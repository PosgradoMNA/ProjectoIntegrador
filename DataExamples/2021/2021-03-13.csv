If you haven’t you’re going to learn all about the seemingly seedy history of this camera; from fake LCD screens to telemarketing scams ahem creativity. I’m going to share with you everything I’ve discovered about the weird deceptive and strange history that is Nishika Ltd.

Before I get into the history of Nishika Ltd and its owners I should tell you a bit about the camera if you’re unfamiliar with this curious plastic beast.

About the Nishika N8000

The Nishika N8000 is a 35mm quad-lens 3D camera that originally sold in 1989 for $200 US dollars. If you wanted to buy one of these you wouldn’t be able to find it at the shop. No one of the only ways to get one was to hear a knock at your door or by calling a number in an ad that you found in your photography magazine. The company that produced this camera did everything it could to make the N8000 seem like the next stage of photographic evolution. Even though it’s a fairly unique concept it was far from a refined product.

The first time I came across an N800 a number of years ago it turned out to be broken and I wasn’t too surprised as it was all plastic. Fast forward a couple of years and I find out these cameras are trending and going for an ungodly amount of money broken or not.

Back in its heyday this was being promoted as a 3D camera that used regular ‘ol 35mm film. It accomplished this by taking four photos at the same time with four separate lenses. You mail in your film and get these cool lenticular 3D prints. If you’ve ever had a special edition VHS DVD or blu-ray movie with that 3D effect on the cover then you know what a lenticular print is.

Long after Nishika Ltd. went under these quad-lens oddities started resurfacing on eBay for upwards of $500. You might be asking how we are supposed to see these 3D images now that we can’t mail away our film for special prints. The answer is by photoshopping them into GIFs. You scan your four images chop them into individual pieces align them and convert them into an animated GIF using the timeline feature in Photoshop.

Taking nifty photos with the Nishika N8000 is a simple matter of making sure that something is in the foreground something in the background and that the light is good. Being animated and tossing stuff into the air adds to that 3-dimensional effect.

I had a working model once and I did my own photos and first impressions on it. You can find a link to that in the description of the video linked below. I ended up selling mine for a pretty penny no regrets.

So why did they go under. This concept seems to have 90s nostalgia written all over it. Let’s find out.

Nikisha N8000 history

As far as I can tell from my research the advertising campaign started in July 1989.





Above left a Popular Photography reads: “It’s new! It’s Unique It’s right for everyone!” It exclaims. At the bottom it lists a toll-free number you can call or an address you can mail $5 to for an information package that is refundable with your first order. Dealer Inquiries Invited.

The other ad I found (above right) actually shows you what the camera looks like kinda. This one was published in American Photographer.

“After fifteen years of research 100 patents worldwide and $50 million dollars 3D is here. No glasses or viewers needed use standard 35mm film you won’t believe it. To order camera or brochure call 1-800 blah blah Distributorships available now.“

If you didn’t catch it these ads are doing two things not just selling you the camera but selling you selling others the camera. That bit of info will be important to remember as we move on with this story.

In November 1989 Peter Kolonia of Popular Photography wrote a review of the Nishika N8000 with the title: A Born Again Nimslo. An excerpt.

“…the reason for this is that while Nishika had some impressive patents for this quadra-lens camera they were purchased from the defunct Nimslo. Technically speaking the cameras were almost the same and produced the same types of photos which resulted in lenticular prints. What Nishika did was beef up the design and add a bunch of purely cosmetic features to it…”

Ouch.

The camera has a metal plate on the bottom to make it heavier added what looked like an LCD display and molded the top to make it seem like there was a pentaprism inside for the viewfinder. As Kolonia put it “twice as big and half the features”.

The Nishika N8000 was all plastic had one shutter speed and three aperture settings. It took 2 AA batteries the only job of which was to tell you if the lighting was too low.

“Of course all this doesn’t mean you don’t get a lot for your $199.95” says Kolonia “The Nishika is BIG including case this 20.5 ouncer stretches a full seven inches across and it’s nearly four inches deep. Worn around the neck it feels like a piece of body armor”

The article goes on to say that it’s prints are actually quite neat but you will find few situations to use it in suggesting it’ll spend more time in the closet than around your neck. Not only that but you had to mail away for your prints and the shipping time seemed to be 2 to 3 weeks despite the claim of a 72-hour turnaround (in the US of course). Though Kolonia admitted “The 3D effects possible with the Nishika are terrific”.

If you read this review in 1989 and still wanted one it wasn’t easy. Waiting for a knock at the door or calling the 1-800 number seemed to be the only ways to get one. These were not sold in stores.

As much as the review praised the prints it tore a strip off the design and who can blame them? Everything the company did to upgrade from the Nimslo was designed to make you think you were getting more camera than you were and an amateur photographer wouldn’t notice most of it until it was too late.

Well Kolonia’s mixed Popular Photography review would not go unnoticed. The hate mail poured in. Here’s one example published a few months later in February 1990 titled “Nishika: Nasty or Nice”:

“What difference does it make whether the camera is a black box or a one eyed space age robot that speaks ten languages to tell you when you’re over exposing?” “For a camera that produces beautiful unique and deep pictures and cost $50 million and 15 years of research to develop a price tag of $200 is a bargain indeed.”

The angry reader also says. “Lesson in logic: The function of a camera is to produce beautiful photographs. Anything else you say about a camera is irrelevant.”

The angry writer also seems to brag about the 3 f-stops that can be used in various lighting situations.

Man it really seems like this guy is invested in Nishika… Oh wait he was. This letter was signed by an “American 3D Independent Distributor”.

Popular Photography made no apologies for their review saying the staff were somewhat divided on the quality of the prints but conceded that some people liked it. However “The Nishika is larger and heavier than it needs to be and is festooned with many mock features.”

To reiterate some of these fake features include: a fake LCD screen that is just a distance scale a grip that implies a motor drive a prism at the top to imply a pentaprism viewfinder a metal plate to give to heft and two out of three contacts on the hot shoe were fake and an implied “JC II” approved sticker which has the initials “JBDF” which are actually the initials on the two main people involved in creating the N8000.

Waiting for the Nimslo 2?

Popular Photography says the Nimslo the camera which many of these patents were purchased from was a superior model with its workable auto exposure system and called the Nishika a “glorified box camera”. Popular photography really took the gloves off on this guy. They continue with “Who spent $50 million and 15 years of research to develop the system? Certainly not Nishika or its pyramid-style distributors…We think the clear light of your logic is somewhat compromised by your being an American independent distributor.”

In the same issue an ex-Nimslo employee also wrote in to express their distaste.

“As an ex-Nimslo employee who maintained his communications network with his former colleagues and had an awareness of Nissei Corporation’s efforts to resurrect the Nimslo 3D system I eagerly awaited announcement of the Nissei camera knowing in advance that it was years late and underwhelming in its capabilities. But I must say that I wasn’t fully prepared for the piece of dreck finally announced by Popular Photography”

Yet another reader called the review a vitriolic attack and touted the “more than 50000 distributors of the 35mm Nishika n8000 3D camera.” The reader slams Kolonia for not mentioning that the developing technology is “American made” or that “you must adhere to the 6-25 foot range for optimum 3D effect” and ends the letter by suggesting that the reviewer must be upset because they were denied a distributorship.

Sounds like another Nishika seller trying to turn the letter section into an advertising campaign.

An internet forum flame war; offline

Popular Photography responded saying they are pretty sure their reviewer was not trying to be a closet Nishika distributor.

The whole thing reads like an internet forum on a rampage. Even the president of Nishika would speak up in the letter section of the May 1990 issue:

“We at Nishika and America 3D Corporation are pleased with Peter Kolonia’s praise of what he calls “the amazing look of the hyperdimensional photographs” taken by our N8000 camera.”

The letter almost reads passive-aggressively taking the few things that were praised ignoring the legitimate criticisms correcting a price issue and the way in which it’s distributed.

“The prices quoted in the article are also inaccurate. For the past three months our price for developing a 36-exposure roll of film (18 3D prints) has been one third less expensive than when Kolonia developed his photos.”

What an amazing nitpick by the Nishika president. Who expected a November 1989 article to predict a price drop that probably occurred after the review. If they received the letter in April a month before this publication that’s still put the price drop in January up to two months after the review was published.

Nishika’s president went on to state that Popular Photography “suggests that our independent distributors are door-to-door salesmen but in fact most of our sales are not made door to door. Our more than 60000 enthusiastic hardworking distributors use a variety of the most modern and effective direct marketing selling techniques used by such companies as Sprint Mary Kay Cosmetics and IBM.”

I paid close attention to the wording here and he said most of their sales are not door to door and they have over 60000 distributors. Well how much do you want to bet these people had to buy the cameras upfront?

Other interesting reads

Another review was published in Petersen’s Photographic. While this review seems a lot more neutral there and definitely large red flags to be had.

Petersen’s Photographic reviewer Patrick Christian spends much of the time just going over the features dimensions and how the whole process works.

“As with the now defunct Nimslo you load the N8000 with color negative film depress the shutter button and Nishika’s four lenses go click in unison. Send your film off to Nishika (in their prepaid mailer) and you’ll get back a set of 3 ½ by 4 ½ colour 3D prints that don’t require a viewer.”

“The brain-power factor is the second aspect of the technology and according to Nishika President Jim Bainbridge it’s the most critical. The N8000’s brain-power is a high-tech computer print-making system said to emulate the eye-brain coordination of human vision. High-tech printers sandwich the four transparent images under a lenticular screen. The Underside is coated with a white pigment and voila you view prints through hundreds of minuscule rows of optical splitters in the plastic lenticular screen sandwiched to the top of the merged image prints. Through the magic of the lenticular surface your left eye sees a slightly different view of a lenticular print than your right; thus you have viewerless 3D”

Christian admits though “it doesn’t match Nimslo’s quality…clearly this isn’t a top of the line point and shoot camera. It’s a very specialized fun bit of business”

Christian also elaborates on where to get one. That the distribution is being handled by another Henderson Nevada company American 3D and not to rush to the local camera store because they won’t be there. Christian ponders how unusual it is for these to be marketed by a multi-level program like Amway and that Bainbridge prefers the term “direct selling” and will put you in contact with the closest distributor.

At the end of this flat-at-best review is an editor’s note that reads like a prescription medicine warning.

“Our calls to Nishika and American 3D or Bainbridge failed to turn up a camera to test (author Christian a long time 3D buff bought his Nishika from a distributor) and we were about to scrap the article when a local Nishika distributor Arlene Shapiro brought one out of the blue. Arlene’s a real go-getter who told us all about the camera left one to try and even wanted to sign us up as distributors (for obvious reasons we had to decline). We weren’t overly impressed by the camera itself but were quite impressed with the outstanding 3D images it produced (and that’s what Nishika is really selling-startling viewer less 3D images)”

The marketing push

Despite the small picture-less ads in photography magazines one of the more impressive acts of Jim Bainbridge was recruiting celebrity Vincent Price for an instructional/promotional video. I guess because he was in a 3D movie once?

Titled “Step into the Third Dimension” this 1989 VHS movie — with a run time of just under 20 minutes — gives you a full breakdown of how to properly create 3D photos with the N8000.

This video is filmed at three sets. Potter’s wax museum in St. Augustine Florida playing off his role in the 1953 classic horror House of Wax which was presented in 3D an outdoor setting with a family in Cypress Gardens Florida and a birthday party. After an introduction a brief history of 3D in photography and a few dry jokes Mr. Price shows you how to load the camera with batteries and film.

The outdoor scene serves to show how to shoot with the camera outside. They have Price in a foldable chair under a multi-coloured umbrella playing director to the family and he explains to us how to optimize the 3D effect. At first I wondered why he was so far away from the family until I saw the credits and realized he had a stand-in and some of the wide or rear shots probably weren’t even him.

What is going to become odd to you immediately is you apparently you need to be 15-22 feet (5-7 meters) from the subject so you have this family man half a mile away taking shots from the bushes like a weirdo. See below.

The promotional material is produced the ads are published and the reviews are in. How was the Nishika N8000 received by the public?

The reception

Not well actually because the photos immediately started fading. This time though it was not entirely Nishika’s fault.

In 1988 Jim Bainbridge (CEO of Nishika) met with 3M (the same people that bought Ferrania) to help formulate an emulsion and what is referred to as a backcoat sauce for the lenticular prints.

By mid 1989 3M had created what they said was an effective and new light sensitive emulsion that could be used in combination with the backcoat sauce they had developed.

Four companies were involved in this partnership:

The camera manufacturer Quantronics Manufacturing Limited owned by Daniel Fingarette.

American 3D Limited which was the distributor

The print designer LenTec Corporation

The printer Nishika Limited.

Bainbridge owned the last three companies.$40 million was invested into the system and over one million of that involved the purchase of the backcoat sauce and new emulsion.

By the end of 1989 over 100000 cameras had been sold but the photos would start to fade within months. Nishika not knowing what the issue was mailed reprints after numerous complaints but by 1990 the damage was done and sales were down significantly.

The four companies affected by the print fading fiasco as well as some independent distributors sued 3M for breach of “express and implied warranties”. The issue as it turned out was the emulsion was not compatible with the backcoat sauce and that caused the images to fade. They also stated that this severely damaged the reputation of the company and its product.

A court jury found that 3M breached express and implied warranties and that 3M’s breach directly caused the harm suffered by each of the Nishika Plaintiffs. The trial court overruled 3M’s objection and based on favourable jury findings court rendered judgment that the Nishika Plaintiffs be awarded just under US$30 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest from 3M. 3M filed for an appeal but only succeeded in reversing the pre and post-judgment interest.

You can recover money but you can’t recover a reputation and people weren’t buying nearly as many cameras. The N8000 and the lesser-known more compact N9000 were collecting dust and around this time Nishika was already working to recover its losses…though not in the most honest way.

Staying alive at all costs

Nishika and its related companies initiated a telemarketing campaign where they convinced their callers they had won a substantial prize ranging from cash to a brand new car. However in order to claim the prize winners needed to pay a one-time fee of $700. The so-called award winner almost always received a camera and/or travel voucher that contained a number of additional costs and restrictions making it nearly impossible to use.

Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine did their own investigation and published their findings in their Jul 1992 issue.

“In March 1992 a Conroe Texas company MC Inc. mailed MRG coded certificates claiming “You’re guaranteed at least one of the five items below for your participation in our national promotion!” One of those certificates arrived at the home of a Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine staffer while we were working on this story. The prizes were a 1992 Chrysler LaBaron or $10000 cash $4000 cash two round trip airfares to Orlando or Las Vegas $1000 cash and a Sony 27” high resolution colour TV. When we called MC Inc. we were told we had to buy a Nishika 3D camera and some jewellery for $498 to qualify for a prize. Our staffer hung up”

They made hundreds of thousands of calls and who knows how many mail outs but eventually the law caught up to them and they were forced to pay back US$11.3 million to those victimized by the campaign. This left Nishika and Jim Bainbridge bankrupt.

On March 19 1996 The Las Vegas Sun wrote:

“While consumers were led to believe they were winning a car or cash award most ended up receiving worthless travel certificates the FTC said.” “None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing by settling the case. Nishika did not have a listed telephone number and could not be reached for comment.” “FTC spokeswoman Patricia Hensley of Seattle cautioned that the government still must collect the $11.3 million settlement. Currently Nishika is involved in another piece of litigation and until that is settled consumers will not be reimbursed”

And there you have it the weird and sketchy history of Nishika and the N8000. I think it’s funny how its found success decades later without making the original owners a penny in the process that has to hurt.

- Advertisement -

CLAAS has introduced two new ranges of rear mower that feature a centre-of-gravity side-mounted system. The ranges the DISCO 10 and DISCO 100 comprise seven brand-new models that cover working widths of 22m to 34m.

A new feature for all side-mounted DISCO disc mowers is a centre-of-gravity hitching system which ensures that the mower bed maintains uniform contact pressure over the entire working width.

Disco 10 series

In the entry-level segment CLAAS offers three new models in the DISCO 10 series: the DISCO 32 28 and 24 side- mounted mowers with working widths of 3m 26m and 22m respectively each with the MAX CUT mower bed.

- Advertisement -

According to CLAAS a unique feature of the MAX CUT mower bed is that it is constructed of two pieces of bolted pressed steel plates providing higher torsional strength with less risk of cracking caused by welding heat stresses.

MAX CUT features a waved shape leading edge. This enables the cutting discs to be mounted close to the front of the bed which in combination with the new specially formed discs provides a greater overlap between the blades creating an enlarged cutting area for optimal cutting quality and flow through the mower.

To achieve a clean cut and avoid soil contamination extra-wide skids are fitted to the underside of the mower bed for guiding dirt and foreign material rearward.

Disco 100 series

The new DISCO 100 series which comprises the DISCO 360 (replacing the 3450) and the DISCO 320 (replacing the 3150) are straight mowers with a working width of 34m and 3m respectively. Both models are fitted with new mechanical centre of gravity and suspension springs that are adjustable without tools to ensure that the mower follows ground contours accurately.

A compact Fast-folding transport harvester

CLAAS has announced improvements to its top-of-the-range model in its line-up of ORBIS row-independent front attachments for the JAGUAR self-propelled forage harvester. Stand-out features include a transport width of only 3m and a new automatically folding transport protection with integrated lighting.

As with the ORBIS 750 the frame of the new ORBIS 900 consists of five parts. This

ensures rapid folding and results in a highly compact design without significantly

compromising visibility to the front or sides. These features enable a transport speed of 40km/h to be maintained safely.

During folding and unfolding the integrated transport protection with warning stickers and lighting automatically pivots into the appropriate position for road travel or field work.

The flat mounting angle with two different positions and the particularly flat design make

it possible to attain stubble heights as low as 85mm.

These characteristics and the use of both small and large three-stage transport discs mean that the ORBIS 900 can be used to harvest not only maize but crop silage too. It is also suitable for low-growing low-yield crops.

Large discs immediately ahead of the feeder unit ensure that even large crop volumes can be handled reliably.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjI4OTE0My9ob3ctdHJvcGh5LWh1bnRpbmctc2F2ZWQtdGhlLW1hcmtob3LSAU9odHRwczovL3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tLnBrL3N0b3J5LzIyODkxNDMvaG93LXRyb3BoeS1odW50aW5nLXNhdmVkLXRoZS1tYXJraG9yP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How trophy-hunting saved the Markhor,"The Markhor one of the largest and most magnificent members of the goat family has been trotting the mountainous terrains of Central Asia Karakoram and the Himalayas for centuries.

The screw-horned goat which gets its name from a combination of two Persian and Pashto words—Mar (meaning snake) and Khor (meaning eater) — was once considered to be the most difficult game in all of British India. It’s nativity to high-altitude regions made the Markhor’s hunt a dice with death for all who dared summiting the perilous peaks of its haunt.

The ruggedly built mountain goat which can grow its horns out to 65-inches and weigh up to a 110 kilogrammes has an average lifespan of 10-12 years in which it produces a litter of one to two kids every six months.

Owing to excessive hunting poaching and loss of habitat The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) had classified Markhor as an endangered species. However following various restorative efforts the provincial government was able to recover its Markhor population from 275 in 1993 to some 3500 goats in 2018.

Two birds one stone

In a bid towards conservation the government opened Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s gates to international trophy-hunting in the 1990s. It was hoped that controlling taxing and regularising Markhor-hunting would not only curb illegal hunting activities but also generate revenue for the locals.

Foreign hunters have since been permitted to hound the mountain goat for a hefty government fee 80 per cent which is directed towards the local community while the remaining 20 per cent goes to the national exchequer.

According to provincial wildlife department the introduction of trophy-hunting has helped the local Markhor population grow from a mere 600 in Chitral to approximately 4000 to 5000 goats in the last three decades. “Locals would previously hunt down the goats in excess much of which was illegal and brought our Markhor population close to extinction.

To save the population we shut down all Markhor-hunting activities and introduced trophy-hunting which is greatly controlled and generates revenue. The first foreigner to be allowed to hunt was a German who paid $1500 in 1998 for a single goat. Today shooting a Markhor can cost upwards of $150000 which was last paid by an American hunter in 2019” shared an official of the wildlife department.

Speaking in the regard DF Chitral Altaf Hussain said that trophy-hunting season lasts from January till March. People from 24 villages split and utilise a portion of the revenue generated from the game to funding basic amenities including community schools road construction health centres teacher salaries welfare work and redressing of various community issues.

“Markhors are primarily hunted in two big areas of lower Chitral. One is Tosha Shasha while the second is Gehriat Golen. Locals here see the games as not only a means of earning livelihood but also an opportunity which has led to great developments in the region including the construction of schools colleges and handicraft centres for women” expressed Hussain.

Zara Bibi a local woman from Toshi told The Express Tribune that in the days prior to trophy-hunting women like her had little avenues for income generation while much of their time was spent fetching water from far-flung areas. “With the advent of trophy-hunting which funded the creation of handicraft centres local women have found the opportunity to earn from home. Whereas the revenues generated have also helped the village conservation committee in installing water pipelines so we no longer have to trek several miles for a pot of water” she told The Express Tribune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnJvZ2F0ZWFkdmVydGlzZXIuY28udWsvYnVzaW5lc3MvcnVyYWwtZW1wbG95ZXItc25hcHBlZC11cC1ieS1pcmlzaC1naWFudC0zMTY0Nzg20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rural employer snapped up by Irish giant,"Green-tech the Arkendale-based manufacturer and distributor of landscaping forestry and grounds maintenance equipment has been acquired by Origin Enterprises.

On Sunday Governor Greg Abbott announced that the federal government planned to move some children from the border to a holding facility in Midland. The migrants arrived in buses overnight.

City of Midland and Midland County officials say they were completely blindsided by the opening of the facility. At a press conference on Monday Midland Mayor Patrick Payton said that the facility is ‘disrespectful’ to the City of Midland.

Payton went on to add that all of the migrants at the facility are boys ranging in age from 13 to 17. He has no idea how long the facility was preparing to bring in migrants.

“It is utter chaos and I don’t think I’m exaggerating on this but they are coming over by the thousands literally by the thousands” said Payton.

Payton says that he wants the children to be moved from the facility in six weeks but added that the timeline of their stay is still unclear.

Both Payton and Midland County Judge Terry Johnson say their questions to federal agencies have all met with the same answer - “We will circle to you.”

In a statement released on Saturday the Department of Homeland Security announced that FEMA would be supporting a government-wide effort over the next 90 days to “safely receive shelter and transfer unaccompanied children who make the dangerous journey to the U.S. southwest border.”

Abbott endorsed the call releasing a video on Twitter claiming that ""antisemitic platforms like Gab have no place in Texas and certainly do not represent Texas values.""

The pandemic changed the structure of everything we experience: how and what we buy when and where we work; to the ways we interact and engage with the community. It has also made us deeply aware of what’s working what’s relevant and what’s possible.

There is a sharp focus on products services and brands and their roles in customers’ and employees’ lives. Our research found that nearly 80 per cent of CEOs see the need to fundamentally change how they engage with and create value for customers.

It is easy to understand that in this context customer experience (CX) – the optimisation of marketing sales and service touchpoints to serve and retain customers – is arguably more important now than ever. Yet Forrester tells us the return on CX investments has become stagnant for 81 per cent of brands. And our research shows that the more a company focuses on CX as a standalone objective the less likely it is to achieve sustained growth.

CX fundamentals are now commonplace even expected and differentiation requires more. If customer expectations are rapidly changing and CX is no longer the pathway to growth what is?

The reality is that in many organisations CX is implemented as glitter – a slick website clever social media purpose-washed marketing – but disconnected from human needs and customers are still left wanting more. The new pathway to growth requires evolution to the ‘business of experience’ (BX) where human needs inform every facet and function of the business bringing the entire organisation to focus on finding and fulfilling their customers’ unmet needs. BX thinking strengthens the organisation’s fabric and makes customer needs a top priority across the entire C-suite. This bold executive mindset shift starts with the CEO and taps into every leader inside front- and back-office functions. Interestingly while CMOs or CXOs have ‘owned’ CX in the past CEOs are now at the experience helm in BX organisations.

BX leaders understand that improving experience improves lives and in turn improves business as measured by traditional metrics like profitability and revenue. The realities and challenges inherent in the global pandemic have forced firms to understand their customers and their employees in a way they never had before and deliver experiences that respond to unmet needs. The result is stalwart marketplace durability not just momentary optimisation.

And it pays off: BX organisations’ profitability growth outpaces industry peers by six times. Ultimately BX provides a pathway to growth and the opportunity to define a new category of industry leadership.

By unlocking sustainable growth in the experience renaissance BX organisations outperform their peers. Their single core commonality? Customer-obsessed reimagination of their business model. These companies deliver on experience with the entirety of their business addressing people’s needs and values through experience innovation at every level. Experience is inextricably tied to profit owned by the CEO and disseminated throughout the entire organisation. Here’s how that comes to life:

Customer needs are your compass. Customer needs will continue to evolve. Therefore invest in discovering unmet needs both big and small by translating data and insights into actions.

Experience innovation is an everyday habit. An experience innovation culture asks you to close the gap between your brand promise and the experiences you deliver by changing not just what you say but how your entire organisation behaves in service of the customer.

Customer experience is everyone’s job. Every person and every part of the business should be interconnected and collaborative functioning as one cohesive customer-obsessed unit with delivering the best possible experience as its North Star.

The tech data and human agendas are aligned. As the experiences you deliver continue to evolve the need to build flexibility into your systems and processes has never been greater. You can only enable customer-centricity at a greater scale if you integrate technologies tools data and processes.

We are in a renaissance when all experiences need to be reimagined. This era demands a new level of customer obsession and rapid innovation. This is the route to meaningful disruption market differentiation and sustainable growth. Without question the core tenets of BX will become the gold standard.

BX leaders provide their customers with not only better products and services but arguably better lives. BX-minded execs are already seeing sustained growth boldly reimagining business and operating models to become indispensable in everyday lives. Along with the challenges of a global pandemic we’ve been given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset and rewire around people

and their needs.

The pandemic has also given organisations – even the biggest household names – a permission slip to reimagine how they do business completely. There’s never been a better time to embrace the business of experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL2Fkb2JlLXBob3Rvc2hvcHMtc3VwZXItcmVzb2x1dGlvbi1tYWRlLW15LWphdy1oaXQtdGhlLWZsb29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Photoshop's 'Super Resolution' Made My Jaw Hit the Floor,"Adobe just dropped its latest software updates via the Creative Cloud and among those updates is a new feature in Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) called “Super Resolution.” You can mark this day down as a major shift in the photo industry.



I have seen a bit of reporting out there on this topic from the likes of PetaPixel and Fstoppers  but other than that the ramifications of this new feature in ACR have not been widely promoted from what I can see. The new Super Resolution feature in ACR essentially upsizes the image by a factor of four using machine learning i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The PetaPixel article on this new feature quoted Eric Chan from Adobe:

Super Resolution builds on a technology Adobe launched two years ago called Enhance Details which uses machine learning to interpolate RAW files with a high degree of fidelity which resulted in images with crisp details and fewer artifacts. The term ‘Super Resolution’ refers to the process of improving the quality of a photo by boosting its apparent resolution” Chan explains. “Enlarging a photo often produces blurry details but Super Resolution has an ace up its sleeve: an advanced machine learning model trained on millions of photos. Backed by this vast training set Super Resolution can intelligently enlarge photos while maintaining clean edges and preserving important details.

What does this mean practically? Well I immediately tested this out and was pretty shocked by the results. Though it might be hard to make out in the screenshot below I took the surfing image shown below which was captured a decade ago with a Nikon D700 — a 12MP camera — and ran the Super Resolution tool on it and the end result is a 48.2MP image that looks to be every bit as sharp (if not sharper) than the original image file. This means that I can now print that old 12MP image at significantly larger sizes than I ever could before.

What this also means is that anyone with a lower resolution camera i.e. the current crop of 24MP cameras can now output huge image files for prints or any other usage that requires a higher resolution image file. In the three or four images I have run through this new feature in Photoshop I have found the results to be astoundingly good.

Let’s run through how this works. First off it works with any image file whether it is a raw images file a TIFF or a JPEG. You will have to open the image file in Adobe Camera Raw via Photoshop or Adobe Bridge as shown below. To access the Super Resolution feature right-click on the image and choose “Enhance” as shown below.

A dialog window will come up so you can see how the image will look and you can also toggle back and forth between the original image and the new Enhanced version. The dialog will give you an estimate on how long it will take to create the new Enhanced image which will show up as a separate image file. Once you are ready simply click the Enhance button in the lower right-hand corner. ACR starts working in the background immediately to build the new image file and it eventually appears right next to the original file you selected wherever that one is stored.

In my testing as shown below it took this old 12MP image from 4256×2832 pixels to 8512×5664 pixels. The screenshots below show this enlargement. The top image is the lower resolution (original) version and the bottom image is the one that went through the Super Resolution process. The higher-res image looks absolutely amazing. And at 48MP I could easily blow this up to a 40×60 inch print just as with any image captured using my 45MP Nikon D850.

Once I upsized the image using the Super Resolution feature I zoomed into the resulting image and was very impressed. The image seemed just as sharp (if not a little sharper) as the original image file but of course it is massively larger (in terms of resolution and file size). Kudos to the folks at Adobe for creating a truly revolutionary addition to Photoshop. I have tried some of the Topaz AI software options like Topaz Gigapixel AI but I have not seen it work this well.

So what does this mean? For starters it means that AI technology will have a huge impact on photography. Going forward the software we use to work up our images (and upres them) might in some instances have a larger effect on the final images than the camera that was used to capture the image.

To a certain degree this new tool in Photoshop significantly equalizes the playing field no matter what camera you are working with. All of a sudden my Nikon Z6 and Fujifilm X-Pro3 (respectively 24MP and 26MP cameras) are capable of producing stunning large prints in a way that was previously just not possible.

What about high-resolution cameras you may ask? Where do they end up with all of this? The new Super Resolution tool will allow up to upres any image as long as the resulting “Enhanced” image file is less than 65000 pixels on the long side and under 500MP in total. What that means is I can upres the 102MP images from my Fujifilm GFX 100 and GFX 100S cameras and produce insane 400MP image files from a single image. That is getting into the absurd but that also opens some doors for crazy huge prints.

The reality is that this feature is a huge boon to lower resolution (12MP to 16MP) and even medium resolution (24MP) camera owners. Higher resolution cameras will still yield better image quality but we now have the option of making large prints from relatively low-resolution image files.

Enhancing a Photo to 376 Megapixels

After talking with some photographer friends about this new feature I played around with images from a variety of different cameras to see how it varies. I ran a few images through from my Nikon Z6 and also a few from my Fujifilm GFX 100. With the GFX 100 image the Super Resolution feature popped out a 376MP image file that was damn near identical to the original image file just four times larger. My jaw hit the floor when I zoomed into 100% and compared it to the original! You can see both the original and the Enhanced images below. There is no way to actually convey the 100% image size here as I have no control over the viewer’s screen resolution but regardless they both look wicked sharp.

From what I can tell the Super Resolution tool seems to do an even better job with higher resolution cameras and in particular with cameras that do not have an anti-aliasing filter in front of the sensor. My Nikon Z6 images when enhanced with this tool still look impressive but not as jaw-dropping as the example above. The Z6 has a very strong anti-aliasing filter basically a filter that slightly blurs the image to reduce digital artifacts. In addition it seems like the amount of sharpening or noise reduction applied to the image is also magnified so playing around with how the image is worked up may have a significant effect on the final image quality. I will have to do some more testing.

If you have gotten this far and are still reading this full-on pixel-peeping madness then you might have realized that this could be the best upgrade to any and every camera ever. This is certainly one of the most incredible features Adobe has ever released in Photoshop.

This is just the start of the AI revolution. It also shows quite clearly that many of the advancements in image quality are going to come from the software side of the equation as we start to see cameras with incredible specs that might be hard to dramatically improve upon in the coming years. I am super excited about this new option in Photoshop as it will allow me to offer much larger prints than I have been able to create previously–and they will look stunning.

While the earliest implementations were a bit of a gimmick powerful tools and developments from companies like Adobe NVIDIA and Luminar have brought AI to the end-user in a meaningful way. Photoshop’s March 2021 update introduces a new AI tool that promises massive resolution improvements for any camera. Does it live up to the hype?

If you’re not caught up on Photoshop’s notes Adobe Camera Raw has received a new feature called Super Resolution. Currently available in Camera Raw 13.2 and coming soon to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic Super Resolution uses a machine learning model to “intelligently enlarge photos while maintaining clean edges and preserving important details.” In practice it’s a one-click way to quadruple your photo’s megapixel count while retaining much more detail than “dumb” upscaling like bicubic and nearest neighbor methods.

Photoshop Super Resolution Versus Topaz Gigapixel AI

This isn’t a new idea however. AI upscaling has been around for a while. It’s even been implemented into existing consumer products most notably in Topaz’s Gigapixel AI software. Gigapixel is built around a similar principle: train a machine learning model with a set of low- and high-resolution image pairs so that the computer eventually learns what a low-resolution area could look like in high resolution. This model can then up-sample the photos and “create” details to fill in the blanks. Depending on how this is implemented it can be pretty computationally intense relying on your computer’s GPU to perform a lot of work.

While there are some differences between how these programs work with PS’s feature integrated into ACR instead of being a standalone program and Gigapixel offering some more options for customizing the processing the end results are perfectly comparable.

For these tests I wanted to take a look at a couple of different types of images that I often shoot and that often benefit from more resolution. To compare I grabbed some raw files from my Mavic Air 2 (to represent aerial shots) and my Nikon Z 7 (representing architecture and product photography as well as higher resolution). While these files are unprocessed each program handled them slightly differently the most important distinction being ACR automatically applying lens corrections. This resulted in a slight difference between FOV and brightness between the files but I’m not really considering that relevant in the comparison as you could pass a processed file through Gigapixel without a meaningful difference. Also in the following images the Photoshop Super Resolution version will be on the left with Gigapixel's on the right.

Increasing Resolution of Drone Photos

In my mind this is the worst-case scenario for upscaling. While the Mavic Air 2’s files are very impressive for a camera that can fly at 40 mph they aren’t gorgeous at a pixel level. They can be a bit noisy even at low ISOs and the Quad Bayer sensor like Fuji’s X-Trans has historically had problems with some demosaicing processes.

One thing that stuck out to me when reading about Super Resolution was how it included ACR’s Enhance Details processing step by default. Enhance Details was an earlier foray into ML-powered tools and offered a way to demosaic raw files with fewer resulting artifacts. It’s a very minor improvement in many cases but I’ve found that it can help in cases of tricky moire or with atypical sensor setups like X-Trans or Quad Bayer. As a result I don’t do it by default but appreciate that it’s available.

This combination of improved image quality and increased resolution make Super Resolution seem like a very promising option for use with drones and I can say it really delivers.

First let’s talk about processing time and workflow. Loading the raw file into Photoshop then right-clicking the image and selecting Enhance brings up the relevant menu. From here a preview is quickly generated and a new DNG can be created. Via this flow you still have access to the same features you’d have if you’re processing the raw file normally and can also quickly see what benefit Super Resolution will offer.

With Gigapixel loading the raw file and setting things up is quite a bit slower. There’s a delay as the preview generates a significant delay each time you scroll or change an option as it redraws and finally a very significant difference in actual processing times. Super Resolution produced a finished file in 3 seconds while Gigapixel AI took 1 minute and 23 seconds.

As for the finished files Photoshop’s version is significantly better. Two major improvements are visible. The first is an area that has been a problem for many other software tools when dealing with Quad Bayer or X-Trans files: “wormy” looking green areas. In Gigapixel’s version there’s a very watercolor-y unnatural look to this area of foliage.

The second major improvement is the relative absence of major artifacts in Photoshop’s version. To personify it Gigapixel is overly aggressive in “making up” details. It creates faint patterns in areas that should be plain texture and generates noticeable artifacts in areas like text and faces. Photoshop meanwhile appears to just deliver a very good upscale. The drone shot after processing becomes a 48-megapixel shot. While it isn’t going to match a DSLR for microcontrast and sharpness it’s surprisingly close and a drastic improvement from the original 12-megapiel shot.

The Best Option for Upscaling Architectural Images

While my Z 7 offers great resolution with its 45-megapixel sensor more is always better. To that end I was curious how these two scaling methods would work with a file offering a mix of organic shapes and straight lines along with some fine details.

From this test file I observed a similar pattern in usability but to an even greater degree. Photoshop rendered a finished file in 6 seconds while Gigapixel took 5 minutes and 1 second to finish its version.

Comparing the two files Photoshop again delivered a surprisingly neutral file. There are no major problem areas and the files still have quite a bit of “bite” at the pixel level. As Photoshop auto-applies lens corrections the FOV is a bit different but I think these corrections would need to be applied anyway to Gigapixel’s file as there’s noticeable distortion present in the buildings. At the pixel level PS’s version only has a slight issue with some fine details like the stars on the flags. Photoshop renders them as stars but with a bit of false color creeping in. In Gigapixel’s version these are unrecognizable smudges as well as artifacts from false color.

Gigapixel also runs into that watercolor problem again along the chain-link fence. Here Photoshop renders the fence as expected while Gigapixel’s version is smeary with individual strands of the fence almost seeming to blur out of focus.

In the architectural details both are competent. Photoshop seems to err on the side of preserving a bit more noise and texture while Gigapixel smooths things to a greater extent but I think you could push either file to the same place with a bit of sharpening and noise reduction.

Conclusion

For about $100 I just can’t see the value in Topaz’s Gigapixel AI product for my workflow now that Adobe’s Super Resolution is available. In my testing across the range of subjects I shoot Super Resolution delivered equal or better results in every case. Architecture landscapes nightscapes product photos aerial shots and more all came out better in Super Resolution. That isn’t even considering the significant workflow benefits: Super Resolution is built-in to Photoshop respects the existing ACR workflow better and is anywhere from 20 to 50 times faster to process. If you haven’t tried out Super Resolution yet definitely give it a try!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhZGdldG1hdGNoLmNvbS9hZG9iZS1waG90b3Nob3Atbm93LW5hdGl2ZWx5LXJ1bnMtb24tbTEtcG93ZXJlZC1tYWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Photoshop now natively runs on M1-powered Macs,"Bumble is ushering a new era of dating. The dating app has just rolled out a new brand design. This includes a new logo and user interface with bolder fonts and refreshed colors and illustrations. Along these are many significant updates to the app’s features giving users better ways to connect with others.

For instance Bumble has added hundreds of new prompts and have refreshed the prompts UI to help members show off their personalities easier. Shared interests have also been moved to the top of the profiles for users to better spot commonalities. This gives users a snippet of profiles for them to know right away what they have in common. Furthermore the app has also increased the number of required profile photos to four to boost the likelihood of matches.

Among the new features on Bumble is Opening Moves. This allows women to set a post-match question for their connections to respond to within 24 hours. This facilitates a more meaningful connection and introduces another way to connect outside of Bumble’s Make The First Move. Of course they may directly message their match even if they haven’t responded to the post-match question.

Meanwhile Bumble has also expanded its Dating Intentions right from the setup. This is so users can answer the question “What are you hoping to find?” with more accurate choices. Among these are Long Term Relationship Life Partner Fun Casual Dates Intimacy without commitment Ethical non-monogamy and Marriage.

This change stemmed from a Bumble survey that saw 68% of women struggle with people not being upfront about their dating intentions. When browsing the expanded dating intentions badges will show right below the person’s profile’s “About me” in a section called “I’m looking for.”

Moreover Bumble has renamed Best Bees to For You. Bumble is employing a new machine learning model to give users their daily set of four curated and relevant profiles based on preferences and past matches.

The changes are part of Bumble’s mantra to empower women to make the first move flip gender roles and take control of their dating app experience and dating life in general.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzEzODE1L2hvdy10by1jaGFuZ2Utc2NyZWVuLW1vZGVzLWluLXBob3Rvc2hvcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Change Screen Modes in Photoshop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzEzODE1L2hvdy10by1jaGFuZ2Utc2NyZWVuLW1vZGVzLWluLXBob3Rvc2hvcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxpbmZvcm1hdGlvbndvcmxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL2Fkb2Jlcy1uZXctYWktZmVhdHVyZS13aWxsLWluY3JlYXNlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe's New AI Feature Will Increase The Photo Size Up To 4 Times,Adobe Photoshop is bringing a new artificial intelligence feature that will quadruple the number of pixels. According to Adobe  the new feature which is named “super-resolution” will be added to Camera Raw as well as Adobe’s Lightroom and Lightroom Classic software which is used for editing photos.Once you put the photo in the editing app its machine learning model will first inspect the picture and then analyze it on the basis of details of millions of other photos fed into the algorithm by bringing out a more focused and clear image said Eric Chan a programmer analyst and IT manager.The feature was put out due to certain reasons; one of the reasons is the pixels get short when printing or zooming into the picture. Like a 12-megapixel picture taken from a mobile phone can become a 48-megapixel picture for large prints and a picture cropped into 2 megapixels can become an 8-megapixel picture.A few years ago Google’s pixel phones bored the same kind of technology called RAISR  Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution which can zoom into a scene digitally.Adobe Photoshop’s most recent version which was released in 2020 has a number of AI-based features for editing called neural filters.Pixelmator the adobe Photoshop rival also has its ML super-resolution feature Programmer Eric Chan told its procedure on how to use the new feature:Press a button and watch the 10-megapixel photo transform into a 40-megapixel photo. It’s somewhat like how Mario eats a mushroom and suddenly balloons into Super Mario but without the annoying sound effects.“Super Resolution is also a pixels project but of a different kind. For example you can upsize an old photo which was taken with a low-resolution camera for a large print. Imagine you have an advanced ‘digital zoom’ feature to enlarge the picture. There’s more to the super-resolution feature than you can think of but we are going ahead of time. To understand Super Resolution feature the right way we must first talk about Enhance Details.”In order to use the new feature Super Resolution in Adobe Photoshop all you have to do is right-click on a photo and select “Enhance” from the menu. The system will then give out an enhanced Digital Negative (DNG). Also the edited file can become like any other image.Read next: Twitter Experiments With Images in Tall Uncropped Display and 4K Support as Its New Features

As any Swiftie (and anyone who doesn't live under a rock) knows Swift has been busy re-recording her first seven albums in an effort to regain control of her old music. The singer released ""Love Story (Taylor's Version)"" in February dipping into her second album Fearless; the full re-recorded album comes out in April. Now with ""Wildest Dreams"" Swift is taking a leap forward to her fifth album 1989 (which earned her Album of the Year at the 2016 Grammys).

Fans were fully freaking out over hearing a clip of the re-recorded song for the first time.

In a perfect world we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind we've noticed some promising trends at B&M European Value Retail (LON:BME) so let's look a bit deeper.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for B&M European Value Retail:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.16 = UK£452m ÷ (UK£3.6b - UK£776m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).

Thus B&M European Value Retail has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms that's a pretty normal return and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 17%.

In the above chart we have measured B&M European Value Retail's prior ROCE against its prior performance but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us

B&M European Value Retail is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 16%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that 123% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at B&M European Value Retail thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.

The Bottom Line On B&M European Value Retail's ROCE

In summary it's great to see that B&M European Value Retail can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.

Taylor Swift took a moment on stage at the Grammys to accept her award for Album of the Year—and for the first time at an award show she gave her boyfriend of over four years Joe Alwyn a very direct shoutout. She also thanked Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively plus their daughters Betty Inez and James too.

It was a brief speech—less than a minute long. But it marked a very public moment in Swift and Alwyn's otherwise very private relationship along with her friendships with Lively and Reynolds. (Swift was given permission to reveal the name of their third child daughter Betty in her folklore song “betty.”)

“Joe who is the first person that I play every single song that I write and I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine” she said to her boyfriend. (Alwyn wrote songs for folklore under the pseudonym William Bowery.) “I want to thank—I want to thank James Inez and Betty and their parents [Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds] who are the second and third people that I play every new song that I write but mostly we just want to thank the fans. You guys met us in this imaginary world that we created and we can’t tell you how honored we are forever by this. Thank you so much and thank you to the Recording Academy. We will never forget that you did this for us. Thank you so much.”

Now over a year later things are starting to look up: borders are reopening people are getting vaccinated and life is starting to return to something somewhat normal.

But while travel is taking off again a year spent traveling virtually helped us realize that the other side of the world is only as far as your Wi-Fi connection. When we were inside during those early months of the pandemic people visited virtual museums and took online trips to the zoo. Realizing how connected we truly all are Airbnb even launched Online Experiences to help us ""travel"" from our couches.

Now whether you're flying the friendly skies hanging out at home or simply trying to plan where to go once it's time why not add one more virtual vacation to your 2021 plans. Here we've gathered everything you need to take a virtual trip to Airbnb's most popular destinations according to internal data shared with T+L and tips on how to visit them soon in real life.

Los Angeles California

""The entertainment capital of the world is the most wish-listed destination by Airbnb guests in 2021 but it might not be for the reason you'd expect"" Airbnb explained. ""Over a quarter of Americans who ranked Los Angeles as their top destination said their top travel priority was relaxation. Hugged between mountains and the ocean the natural landscape of LA's laidback enclaves like Venice Beach and Silver Lake might be enough to bring travelers peace of mind.""

Virtual experiences to try:

-Try a Fluid Art Class experience that will not only leave you feeling relaxed but will also leave you with a beautiful piece of artwork to serve as inspiration for your California adventure.

-Take part in the Discover the LA night sky experience with Host Emilie who helps guests identify and photograph constellations above the city.

Sevierville Tennessee

Even though Koukaki is a small neighbourhood located right next to the famous town of Plaka it is always full of music and live events all of which exude the nostalgic atmosphere of Athens in older times.

The colourful stores and restaurants the old and neo-classical buildings and the picturesque rocky pavements of Koukaki have not gone unnoticed by some of the largest media publications in the world which have named Koukaki the prettiest neighbourhood of Athens and one of the coolest places in Europe.

British tabloid Daily Mail – the most circulated publication in the UK – praised Koukaki and ranked it number one on the list of the best places to visit in Greece.

“Adjacent to The Acropolis Koukaki sits at the bottom of the Lofos Filopappou and like all great neighborhoods in Greece is home to many ancient treasures” the Daily Mail reported.

“In recent years two pedestrian-only streets have cropped up in the neighbourhood making it a fantastic destination for a wander.

""The place has a cafe-like feel with all of the restaurants and bars placing tables and chairs outside.

""Grab a coffee a book and a seat and watch the parade of people go by.”

Travel and hospitality site Airbnb has also included Koukaki in its list with the “Up-and-Coming Neighbourhoods to Visit” and named it the 5th must-visit neighbourhood in the world.

Based on the reviews and votes of 40 million travellers from 150 different countries Koukaki was ranked the 5th best neighbourhood only behind Chūō-ku in Osaka Japan Banglampoo in Bangkok Thailand Brickfields in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and Capucins in Bordeaux France.

“Koukaki one of the most beautiful Athenian neighborhoods and one of the best in the world always welcomes its visitors with a smile hospitality warmth and elements that derive from the history and tradition of Athens” Airbnb wrote.

“On our list of the 16 best neighborhoods in the world our 40 million travellers have selected Koukaki the favourite neighbourhood of Athens to be No. 5 as the place where visitors will both find what they want and at the same time can experience an aura of the past.”

The Airbnb list with the best neighbourhoods to visit also includes three small towns in the United States three neighborhoods in South America as well as the town of Richmond in Melbourne Australia which holds the 15th spot.

The admiration for Koukaki however does not stop here.

Even the American VOGUE – the most popular fashion and lifestyle magazine in the world – highlighted Koukaki in its latest travel feature as the coolest neighbourhood in Athens and one of the best places to visit in the world

“Koukaki which is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the capital was called Little Paris until the 1980s.

""Now it has beautiful alleys that seem untouched by time with bougainvillea bushes elm trees and old-school buildings” VOGUE describes.

“The place is friendly to people and also to animals.

""It has a variety of places to hangout – from gourmet restaurants traditional cuisine taverns bars alternative cafes and galleries.

""There are many artists who feel lucky to live there and who try to make Koukaki more beautiful and sustainable each day.”

In 2017 the French VOGUE had also named Koukaki “the most hip neighbourhood in Europe” in a special feature for Athens stating that “a walk in its picturesque alleys is enough to see the old mansions and neoclassical buildings of older times to smell the basil from the small balconies and to make a stop on the sidewalks to enjoy the feeling of another era.”

Besides its beauty Koukaki is also the birthplace of Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis and Olympic gold medallist Nikolaos Kaklamanakis amongst other notable people.

Filled with life delicious smells and street performers and artists Koukaki always invites Greeks and tourists to explore a retro and at the same time modern view of Athens that will definitely create joyful memories.

It was argued that seatbelts were safe enough but not everyone agreed

These days airbags are a major part of car safety but it wasn’t always that way. Back when car production began there was no protection from an accident like an airbag would provide. Even then when the airbag was created there was pushback from drivers.

Ford Motors didn’t agree to airbags’ benefits due to the newly designed interlock lap belt system but others disagreed.

Airbags would cost $200 for the year 1975

#Airbags for front passenger seats mandatory from April 1; know more https://t.co/OoeGEtpOW1 — Zee News English (@ZeeNewsEnglish) March 4 2021

The New York Times shared an article from the archive that demonstrates just how far we have come with car safety features. Back in 1974 airbags were not a standard feature in most cars.

This article dated August 1 1974 noted that the Vice President of General Motors Ernest S. Starkman spoke to the Senate Commerce Committee about adding airbags as an option to most cars around the start of 1975.

In this meeting staff members from Allstate Insurance Company Ford Motors and Chrysler Motors spoke about the value that airbags provide drivers.

The air bag is designed to inflate in a front‐end crash providing an air pillow that cushions the impact for occupants of the front seat. A Federal safety standard as now written would require passive restraint system such as air bags to be installed in all motor vehicles by the 1976 model year.” New York Times

Starkman also noted that the airbag feature would cost around $200. This would be available on most Cadillacs Buicks and Oldsmobiles in production the next year.

Not everyone was a fan of the idea

Fred G. Segrist was the Vice President of Ford Motor Company and spoke at the same event. Segrist noted that lap and shoulder belts were a more effective solution to preventing fatalities for both drivers and passengers.

He claimed that these prevented people from being thrown from the car. At that time the Department of Transportation estimated that around 25% of people were wearing the safety and lap belts that were recommended.

Segrist said that with the newly implemented interlock lap/shoulder belt system coming out later that year more people would be prone to wearing them. This interlock system prevented the car from starting until all of the occupants were buckled in.

He also compared his new interlock seatbelt system price to that of the airbags. The interlock system would run about $90 compared to around $125 in the Fords.

“The individual who will wear his belts would be deprived of the opportunity for substantially more protection and at the same time would pay more than double the price” Fred G. Segrist | Vice President of Ford Motor Company

Allstate stood by the statistics: airbags would reduce deaths and injuries from auto accidents by anywhere from 25% to 35%. Jack Martens Allstate’s automotive engineering director said that this system works despite the “occupants’ apathy.”

Car safety: Seat belts vs. air bags

In other words you do not need to believe in using an airbag like you would a seatbelt. It could automatically save your life in case of an accident instead of perhaps benefitting you should you wear your interlock seat belt system.

He went on to say that the interlock system was easily defeat-able by those who do not want to wear it. Martens also said he felt that the airbag systems’ production would eventually win even if it did cost a bit more.

Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana claimed that he did not care which side of the argument won as long as it brought down the death rate. “I don’t give a tinker’s damn who wins so that they bring down the death toll.”",,,,,,,,,

Once a leader in the design and production of fitness trackers Fitbit had seen its worldwide market share of the overall smartwatch segment fall to between 5% and 10% and was for sale. By acquiring Fitbit Google would get access to the company’s product data about the health and health habits of Fitbit users and Fitbit’s expertise in designing efficient sensor technology for digital wear.

This case caused considerable agitation among some academic and policy circles and led to a number of contributions pressing the Commission to block the transaction (Caffarra and Valletti 2020 Bria et al. 2020 Caffarra and Crawford 2020 Privacy International 2019). The image conveyed by these contributions is apocalyptic: access to Fitbit data would help Google further dominate the market for online advertising and the synergies between these data and the data that Google already holds would ensure its eventual dominance in digital health. This would have dire consequences for privacy. Finally the acquisition would reduce Google’s incentives to keep its Android ecosystem open to rival wearable products.

I believe that the discussion should now move from the realm of speculation to the sphere of evidence. It is in this spirit that I would like to explain why I find the Commission’s decision fully appropriate. What follows is my own simplified view of the economics of the case stripped of its jargon legal strappings and subtleties.

The role and standards of merger review

Merger review is meant to ensure that mergers and acquisitions do not hurt consumers by increasing prices decreasing quality limiting variety or dampening innovation. These potential harmful effects are evaluated by comparing the post-merger situation to the counterfactual i.e. to the situation that would have prevailed without the merger.

A rejection of the proposed transaction would not have derailed Google’s plans to increase its presence in digital health. While Google might have found it difficult to match Fitbit’s specific software expertise immediately it would have eventually overcome this obstacle. The likely counterfactual is then one of Google’s entry into the wearable health-monitoring sector – and its access to the corresponding data – would just have been delayed.

Explaining the decision

I was concerned about four main aspects of the acquisition: its effect on the digital health and wearable sectors the use of Fitbit data to refine the targeting of online advertising and potential threats to privacy.

1. Wearables

Smartwatches and health trackers are the most prominent example of the type of ‘digital wearables’ that many observers expect to pervade our daily lives soon. Ensuring vigorous competition in the sector must therefore be a prime goal of competition policy. Currently smartwatches work in conjunction with a smartphone. There is therefore a legitimate concern that the acquisition might lead Google to restrict interoperability between rival watches and its Android ecosystem in order to increase Fitbit’s own sales and gather more health data.

Such arguments are assessed based on the parties’ ability and incentives to distort competition in that manner. It is likely that Google could degrade the link between Android and rival watches. To evaluate Google’s incentives we need to weigh the benefits from additional sales of watches and data collection against the cost incurred by reducing the attractiveness of the Android ecosystem.

While the value of extra Fitbit sales can be estimated the other elements of the trade-off cannot. In particular there is no reliable evidence as to the value of Fitbit data. Indeed there are good reasons to believe that the type of data collected by Fitbit is not especially valuable (there is currently no market for it) and it is not unique. Moreover the reputational costs of reducing access to Android could be large for a company that has long relied on openness.1 Such factors are hard to quantify.

Nevertheless the Commission was sufficiently concerned such incentives might materialise that it asked for a commitment to maintain interoperability with the Android platform for the next ten years.

2. Online advertising

Google’s strong position in online advertising stems from the number of users on its platform and its ability to target ads to better-defined audiences. With access to Fitbit data Google might be able to target ads even better gaining a further competitive advantage.

However a transaction should not be blocked simply because it helps the new entity become more efficient. It is only if the acquisition of Fitbit deprived online ads rivals from accessing similar data that anticompetitive concerns might arise. This seems unlikely since health data are not particularly scarce (see Towne 2020).

The second issue is that Fitbit data might not materially enhance Google’s targeting ability. For all the talk about the prowess of online advertising hard evidence is scarce. I could not find any evidence about the marginal targeting value of more precise customer data let alone the marginal value of Fitbit-like data which is the evidence that one would need to support the theory of harm. Indeed the true value of ad targeting is still controversial and customers’ complaints that Google refuses to release sufficient information about the effectiveness of their online ads are hard to square with the idea that Google’s data advantage is overwhelming (Competition and Markets Authority 2020: 300–330 Appendix O and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 2019: 145–50).

3. Digital health

Big data analytics are a crucial part of the ongoing digitalisation of healthcare. The novelty is not the existence of data but the ability to collect it in a systematic manner store it and analyse it. Some observers fear that the combination of Google’s data with Fitbit data could enhance the merged entity’s analytical abilities to the point where it would dominate the field. I am not convinced.

The ability to do health analytics is widespread (see Table 1) and the existence of material synergies between data held by Google and Fitbit is unproven. Even if such synergies were sizeable should we really object to increased efficiency for only one of several potential entrants into the sector?2

Table 1 Top 10 health analytics in the world 2018

4. Privacy

Some aspects of privacy clearly fall outside the scope of competition policy. Who has property rights over different types of data and how these data can be used or sold are essential societal issues but competition authorities have no standing to address them.

This does not mean that privacy cannot be relevant when assessing an acquisition. The manner in which personal data are used is an important aspect of the quality of the service received. Evaluating the effect of a transaction on product quality is standard merger review fare. However a merger’s potentially harmful effects on quality are unlikely to be severe as long as consumers have enough of a choice. If the acquisition were to lead to a deterioration of privacy for Fitbit users they do have a large number of alternatives especially once continued openness of the Android ecosystem is secured.

Some observers are concerned that the combination of Fitbit and Google data might enable health service providers to discriminate more finely between customers/patients. I have three problems with this argument. First I have not seen any evidence of the vaunted synergies between the type of data controlled by Google and Fitbit data. The magnitude of such synergies would have to be established to proceed with such a theory of harm.

Second why is having more information on individual health status and habits harmful? It can allow for better diagnostics better treatment and even fairer health insurance rates. Do people who exercise want to pay more because claims to healthy living are hard to verify?

Third if society feels that some type of personal (health) information ought not to be used to discriminate in the provision of health-related services it should regulate. Giving lower driver-insurance rates to young women than to young men is no longer lawful in the US. One could as easily forbid the use of say existing conditions when pricing insurance.

Finally should the merger really be blocked despite the remedies offered in order to prevent Google from fusing its data with Fitbit’s and use this package in the health sector? If combining data in a manner that leads to more discrimination in the health market is undesirable then why use merger review to prevent such combinations from Google only? Regulation would be far superior in that it would at least preserve a level playing field.

Overall burden of proof and standard of proof

Any sizeable acquisition by one of the large digital platforms is bound to attract the attention of competition specialists. This is as it should be. Competition policy enforcers can only gain from a broad brainstorming at the start of a case. On the other hand post-decision comments should not be a mere repeat of pre-procedure arguments. In order to be useful they should like a decision rely on substantial evidence and defer to the customary burden and standard of proofs. The standard of proof is a ‘balance of probabilities’. This does not allow the Commission to put an especially heavy weight on a low-probability event however damaging it might be.

In my personal view the suggested theories of harm have either been remedied or are not supported by evidence to the requisite legal standard. A negative decision would almost certainly have been overturned by the General Court. Blocking the transaction in such circumstances would not have been a bold policy move. In my mind it would have been an abuse of power.

The strategy — involving more than $30 billion in investment and multiple projects and partnerships — is critical to catch up to Tesla Inc. and counter the existential risks posed by the automotive ambitions of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.“The car industry is changing from a focus on ‘faster stronger’ to becoming more sustainable and smarter” said Senges who worked at Google for more than a decade. “What matters for us here is to foster a mindset” that can bridge the tech and auto worlds.While VW is one of the largest auto producers it’s now pitted against companies that have routinely disrupted industries casting former leaders aside in the process. And they’re coming with deep pockets and big plans to own car data — a $400 billion opportunity according to McKinsey & Co. estimates.VW’s management is keenly aware of the challenges. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess regularly cites Nokia Oyj’s fall as the world’s dominant mobile phone maker because it failed to keep up with the iPhone as a cautionary tale. He’ll provide an update on the company’s tech transition at events this week including the group’s annual press conference in Wolfsburg.The biggest hurdle for Volkswagen may be its firmly entrenched culture built around seven-year automotive cycles. Line and brand managers traditionally have almost total control over what goes in their vehicles while VW’s powerful unions weigh in on nearly every decision.That structure helped manage more than 100 factories around the world but it’s ill-suited for handling vast amounts of data and constantly tuning code. Initial forays haven’t gone well with UBS Group AG determining the company is years behind Tesla from a software perspective.The brimming confidence of top executives isn’t shared by everyone at the German auto giant. Some view a plan to finally start over-the-air updates this month as daunting rather than a promising milestone according to discussions with people involved in the automaker’s operations.The bruises from last year’s scramble to rescue a new line of software-heavy electric cars — with hundreds of specialists working in sprints — haven’t all healed.Senges’s school is an agent of change in Wolfsburg. It’s located in a new building that borrows the utilitarian red brickwork of the nearby plant but with open-floor working areas for collaboration.The facility is equipped with a virtual-reality lab and 3D printers for making prototypes. Coursework starts with 150 students in May rising to 600 by the end of next year.“It requires a quantum leap for automakers to close the gap to Tesla when it comes to software” said Wolfgang Bernhart senior partner at consultancy Roland Berger GmbH. “Just adding headcount won’t be enough.”Already dwarfed by Tesla’s $650 billion market value VW can ill-afford its teething problems. Its new generation of electric cars anchored by the ID.4 sport utility vehicle is going global this year.Traditional rivals are also seeking to adapt to the digital age. Unlike VW which poached an auto executive to run its software unit Toyota Motor Corp. tapped a Silicon Valley star to finalize an operating system that allows features to be installed in a car’s existing hardware over the air.With similar transitions under way at Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG the engineering backbone of Germany’s powerhouse economy is exposed. The efforts have become even more urgent after the implosion of Wirecard AG showed Europe’s lack of global tech champions.VW has set a target of boosting the share of its software that is developed in-house to 60% from 10% currently. To pull this off it established a unit — dubbed Car.Software Org — with about 4000 employees to develop a system that can manage vehicle data flows and connect them to the cloud.“This would be the ‘brain’ of the car and we don’t want to give it to other parties” CEO Diess told Bloomberg in November. “We see that probably as the most important race and decisive point for our industry in the next five to 10 years.”In its latest five-year investment plan the company doubled spending on digitalization efforts to 27 billion euros ($32 billion) even as the overall budget remained flat. While that represents significant resources Google parent Alphabet spends almost that much in a year.Infighting has dogged VW’s effort. Car.Software was initially envisioned as an agile standalone unit but internal rivalries got in the way triggering the departure of high-ranking software specialists including former SAP SE executive Bjoern Goerke. The company then changed tack and put Audi in charge.Meanwhile the need for VW to step up its game has become painfully evident.In the early days of the coronavirus crisis with parallel launches of the Golf hatchback and the ID.3 electric car going wrong Diess summoned senior managers for a fresh round of war-gaming.The Golf’s emergency-call feature had to be fixed. Other glitches delayed the ID.3 for months and the first owners had to drive to their dealerships for a software patch because over-the-air updates weren’t working yet.Diess and his team concluded the efforts were proving too little too late.The result is Project Artemis. Under the more aggressive strategy VW plans to build its own software stack for vehicles starting in 2024. The first Artemis car — code-named Landjet — will be assembled in a smaller factory in Hannover before the technology is scaled up two years later with a more affordable VW-branded electric car out of Wolfsburg.Big Tech isn’t waiting. While VW’s Car.Software unit entered a labor pact with unions regulating salaries and working hours Apple’s car project appears to be moving forward and Alphabet’s Waymo LLC is widely believed to be leading the pack in self-driving technology.The efforts could lead to software companies controlling the relationships with car users said Anja Hendel a former Porsche official who joined Diconium a digital advisory acquired by VW. “It’s a big change for the auto industry” she said during a podcast this month.For tech companies replicating the takeover of the mobile-phone industry won’t be so easy when it comes to cars. While a glitch might be a nuisance during a video chat it could be deadly on the Autobahn. That gives automakers some leeway and Volkswagen is putting the pieces in place.Alongside Car.Software the company has teamed up with Amazon.com Inc. for an industrial cloud for its factories and with Microsoft Corp. for a separate data network for its vehicles.Senges’s 42 Wolfsburg is part of the long-term solution. The VW-sponsored school — with a planned budget of $2.4 million a year — is designed to create a new breed of engineers in the shadow of the factory’s smokestacks.“The difference between the software and car industries isn’t as big as one might think” he said. “The potential we have here is enormous.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8veW91dGhtb3RpdmF0b3I0bGlmZS5jb20vc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS1nb29nbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inspiring Success Story of Google,"Google is one of the world’s most successful technology companies.

Google was co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

About Larry Page–

Larry Page was born to Carl Victor Page Sr. and Gloria on March 26 1973 in Lansing Michigan United States of America.

Both his parents were computer science professors in Michigan State University.

His father Carl Victor Page Sr. was an innovator in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer science.

And his mother Gloria used to teach computer programming.

Larry Page used to find many gadgets and magazines related to computers in his home.

As he was brought up in this environment he eventually gained interest in the computers.

Larry Page was a very curious kid and used to open up the gadgets to know their mechanism of working.

Once in an interview he said that since his childhood he knew that one day he will grow up to become an entrepreneur and will invent something utile.

When Larry Page was of around 12 years of age he decided to become a businessman in the future and this thought sparked him to learn about businesses.

Education-

Larry Page attended the Okemos Montessori School.

And he graduated in Computer engineering from the University of Michigan.

Later Larry Page did his post-graduation from Stanford University and he also got enrolled for the PhD in the same university.

During his PhD he met Sergey Brin at a research project.

Later these two people together changed the face of the technology industry.

About Sergey Brin –

Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin was born on August 21 1973 to Eugenia and Mikhail Brin in Moscow Russia.

His father was a mathematics professor at University of Maryland and his mother was a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose World Wide Web as their research topic for their PhD study.

Birth of Google-

Sergey Brin and Larry Page worked hard for four years to develop an algorithm which links all the websites on the internet.

Basically Google was started with a mission to organise all the information in the world and to make that collected information easily accessible to each and every one by using the power of technology.

They finally succeeded in developing this amazing algorithm in September 1996.

This algorithm was named as PageRank and was used to assign page ranks based on the popularity of the websites.

Their search engine listed the web results in order of their popularity the most popular results showed at the top of the search results because the most popular results will probably be the most useful results.

They initially named their search engine as BackRub but later changed its name to Google by misspelling googol.

As vast as an ocean-

Googol is a mathematical term which can be represented by placing number one followed by a hundred zeroes.

The main concept of their search engine was to provide as much data as possible to the users.

So they wanted to name the search engine as googol as googol indicates a very big number which reflected their mission of developing a search engine googol which displays a vast amount of data.

But they misspelled it as Google.

Initially Google was a part of the website of Stanford University.

Finally google.com domain name was registered on September 15 1997.

And then they raised one million dollars from their families friends and the investors.

Starting in a garage-

On September 4 1998 Google was founded in a garage of their friend Susan Wojcicki in Menlo Park California United States.

Susan Wojcicki is Google’s first marketing manager and currently she serves as the CEO of YouTube.

Becoming billionaires-

During those times Yahoo was a giant and almost each and every one relied on their search engine.

The co-founders of Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page offered Yahoo to sell the algorithms of Google for one million dollars.

Because they thought that it was too early for them to venture into business and instead they wanted to allocate their full time and focus on their education at Stanford University.

But Yahoo rejected their offer.

And for the second time in 2002 Yahoo once again got a chance to acquire Google for a sum of five billion dollars.

But Yahoo wanted Google for three billion dollars.

Yahoo for the second time missed a golden chance of acquiring Google.

After these rejections Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to run Google on their own.

Yahoo has lost the search engine game to Google a very long time ago.

Now on an average Google receives over 40000 searches per second.

First funding-

Google received its first funding of 100000 dollars from Andy Bechtolsheim the co-founder of Sun Microsystems.

And in 1998 Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon.com and David Cheriton a professor of computer science at Harvard University also invested in Google.

Never looking back again-

The eventual global success of Google can be attributed to its unique algorithm.

On 19th August 2004 Google’s held its first Initial public offering.

This offering was a huge success and Google reaped huge investments.

This made Larry Page and Sergey Brin one of the youngest billionaires.

In September 2013 Larry Page was ranked as the thirteenth richest person in America in The Forbes 400 list.

During the same year in the month of October Larry Page was the number 17th in the Forbes most powerful people list.

And by the age of 25 the co-founders of Google became millionaires and they became billionaires at the age of 30.

And now Google is the biggest internet company in the world.

Biggest advertising company –

In addition to being a search engine Google is also an advertising company.

And now the majority of its revenue (more than 70 percent) is generated through advertising alone.

Acquisitions-

In April 2003 Google acquired Applied Semantics a company which specialized in developing software related to online advertising.

The technology utilised in the Google AdSense technology is developed by Applied Semantics.

Google also acquired Android in July 2005 for 50 million dollars.

Now Android powers around 70.16% of the mobile devices across the world.

On 13 November 2006 Google bought YouTube now the world’s most favourite video platform for 1.65 billion dollars.

Google had also acquired AdMob in November 2009 for 750 million dollars.

The services of AdMob are used to display ads in the Google Play applications; this enables the developers of the applications and Google to earn revenue.

Some great offerings-

Google also offers many great products like Google Chrome Gmail Google Translate Google Maps Google AdSense Google Ads Google Docs and Blogger etc.

On 10th August 2015 the co-founders of Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced the creation of a new parent company Alphabet Inc.

This came into effect from 2nd October 2015 and now Alphabet Inc. is the parent company of Google.

Larry Page is the former CEO of Alphabet Inc. and Sergey Brin is the former president of Alphabet Inc.

The current CEO of Alphabet Inc. is Sundar Pichai.

Now Alphabet employs more than 135300 people.

Philanthropy-

Google also runs a non-profit organisation by name Google.org.

This organisation concentrates on developing renewable energies reducing poverty and providing education to masses.

The PageRank algorithm allowed Google to dethrone the popular search engines of that time like Yahoo. Why is Google search engine so successful? Google is the world’s most successful search engine and it has the biggest market share.

The main reasons for the success of the Google search engine are-

• Compared to other search engines Google displays the most relevant and high quality search results.

• Google makes heavy investments into its search engine and develops various algorithms for it.

• Google through its technologies fights hard to weed out low quality search results. How did Google get rich? Google became one of the world’s wealthiest companies by advertising.

Google displays interest based advertisements to its users and earns the majority of its revenue by this process. How did Google get its name? Google got its name when the word googol was misspelled.

Sergey Brin and Larry Page wanted to name their search engine googol to signify that their search engine was capable of displaying vast information.

But they misspelled their product as Google. Who owns Google today? Google is owned by its parent organization Alphabet Inc. How did Larry Page become successful? Larry Page became successful because from a young age he developed an interest in computers and this passion later helped him to make Google successful.

At Stanford University he met Sergey Brin and both of them did their research work together.

This relationship helped both Larry Page and Google. Who is richer Google or Microsoft? Currently Microsoft is richer than Google.

Microsoft Corp. has a market value of $1.6 trillion whereas that of Alphabet is $1.05 trillion. What was the first ever search engine? The world’s first ever search engine was Archie.

Once a leader in the design and production of fitness trackers Fitbit had seen its worldwide market share of the overall smartwatch segment fall to between 5% and 10% and was for sale. By acquiring Fitbit Google would get access to the company’s product data about the health and health habits of Fitbit users and Fitbit’s expertise in designing efficient sensor technology for digital wear.

This case caused considerable agitation among some academic and policy circles and led to a number of contributions pressing the Commission to block the transaction (Caffarra and Valletti 2020 Bria et al. 2020 Caffarra and Crawford 2020 Privacy International 2019). The image conveyed by these contributions is apocalyptic: access to Fitbit data would help Google further dominate the market for online advertising and the synergies between these data and the data that Google already holds would ensure its eventual dominance in digital health. This would have dire consequences for privacy. Finally the acquisition would reduce Google’s incentives to keep its Android ecosystem open to rival wearable products.

I believe that the discussion should now move from the realm of speculation to the sphere of evidence. It is in this spirit that I would like to explain why I find the Commission’s decision fully appropriate. What follows is my own simplified view of the economics of the case stripped of its jargon legal strappings and subtleties.

The role and standards of merger review

Merger review is meant to ensure that mergers and acquisitions do not hurt consumers by increasing prices decreasing quality limiting variety or dampening innovation. These potential harmful effects are evaluated by comparing the post-merger situation to the counterfactual i.e. to the situation that would have prevailed without the merger.

A rejection of the proposed transaction would not have derailed Google’s plans to increase its presence in digital health. While Google might have found it difficult to match Fitbit’s specific software expertise immediately it would have eventually overcome this obstacle. The likely counterfactual is then one of Google’s entry into the wearable health-monitoring sector – and its access to the corresponding data – would just have been delayed.

Explaining the decision

I was concerned about four main aspects of the acquisition: its effect on the digital health and wearable sectors the use of Fitbit data to refine the targeting of online advertising and potential threats to privacy.

1. Wearables

Smartwatches and health trackers are the most prominent example of the type of ‘digital wearables’ that many observers expect to pervade our daily lives soon. Ensuring vigorous competition in the sector must therefore be a prime goal of competition policy. Currently smartwatches work in conjunction with a smartphone. There is therefore a legitimate concern that the acquisition might lead Google to restrict interoperability between rival watches and its Android ecosystem in order to increase Fitbit’s own sales and gather more health data.

Such arguments are assessed based on the parties’ ability and incentives to distort competition in that manner. It is likely that Google could degrade the link between Android and rival watches. To evaluate Google’s incentives we need to weigh the benefits from additional sales of watches and data collection against the cost incurred by reducing the attractiveness of the Android ecosystem.

While the value of extra Fitbit sales can be estimated the other elements of the trade-off cannot. In particular there is no reliable evidence as to the value of Fitbit data. Indeed there are good reasons to believe that the type of data collected by Fitbit is not especially valuable (there is currently no market for it) and it is not unique. Moreover the reputational costs of reducing access to Android could be large for a company that has long relied on openness.1 Such factors are hard to quantify.

Nevertheless the Commission was sufficiently concerned such incentives might materialise that it asked for a commitment to maintain interoperability with the Android platform for the next ten years.

2. Online advertising

Google’s strong position in online advertising stems from the number of users on its platform and its ability to target ads to better-defined audiences. With access to Fitbit data Google might be able to target ads even better gaining a further competitive advantage.

However a transaction should not be blocked simply because it helps the new entity become more efficient. It is only if the acquisition of Fitbit deprived online ads rivals from accessing similar data that anticompetitive concerns might arise. This seems unlikely since health data are not particularly scarce (see Towne 2020).

The second issue is that Fitbit data might not materially enhance Google’s targeting ability. For all the talk about the prowess of online advertising hard evidence is scarce. I could not find any evidence about the marginal targeting value of more precise customer data let alone the marginal value of Fitbit-like data which is the evidence that one would need to support the theory of harm. Indeed the true value of ad targeting is still controversial and customers’ complaints that Google refuses to release sufficient information about the effectiveness of their online ads are hard to square with the idea that Google’s data advantage is overwhelming (Competition and Markets Authority 2020: 300–330 Appendix O and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 2019: 145–50).

3. Digital health

Big data analytics are a crucial part of the ongoing digitalisation of healthcare. The novelty is not the existence of data but the ability to collect it in a systematic manner store it and analyse it. Some observers fear that the combination of Google’s data with Fitbit data could enhance the merged entity’s analytical abilities to the point where it would dominate the field. I am not convinced.

The ability to do health analytics is widespread (see Table 1) and the existence of material synergies between data held by Google and Fitbit is unproven. Even if such synergies were sizeable should we really object to increased efficiency for only one of several potential entrants into the sector?2

Table 1 Top 10 health analytics in the world 2018

4. Privacy

Some aspects of privacy clearly fall outside the scope of competition policy. Who has property rights over different types of data and how these data can be used or sold are essential societal issues but competition authorities have no standing to address them.

This does not mean that privacy cannot be relevant when assessing an acquisition. The manner in which personal data are used is an important aspect of the quality of the service received. Evaluating the effect of a transaction on product quality is standard merger review fare. However a merger’s potentially harmful effects on quality are unlikely to be severe as long as consumers have enough of a choice. If the acquisition were to lead to a deterioration of privacy for Fitbit users they do have a large number of alternatives especially once continued openness of the Android ecosystem is secured.

Some observers are concerned that the combination of Fitbit and Google data might enable health service providers to discriminate more finely between customers/patients. I have three problems with this argument. First I have not seen any evidence of the vaunted synergies between the type of data controlled by Google and Fitbit data. The magnitude of such synergies would have to be established to proceed with such a theory of harm.

Second why is having more information on individual health status and habits harmful? It can allow for better diagnostics better treatment and even fairer health insurance rates. Do people who exercise want to pay more because claims to healthy living are hard to verify?

Third if society feels that some type of personal (health) information ought not to be used to discriminate in the provision of health-related services it should regulate. Giving lower driver-insurance rates to young women than to young men is no longer lawful in the US. One could as easily forbid the use of say existing conditions when pricing insurance.

Finally should the merger really be blocked despite the remedies offered in order to prevent Google from fusing its data with Fitbit’s and use this package in the health sector? If combining data in a manner that leads to more discrimination in the health market is undesirable then why use merger review to prevent such combinations from Google only? Regulation would be far superior in that it would at least preserve a level playing field.

Overall burden of proof and standard of proof

Any sizeable acquisition by one of the large digital platforms is bound to attract the attention of competition specialists. This is as it should be. Competition policy enforcers can only gain from a broad brainstorming at the start of a case. On the other hand post-decision comments should not be a mere repeat of pre-procedure arguments. In order to be useful they should like a decision rely on substantial evidence and defer to the customary burden and standard of proofs. The standard of proof is a ‘balance of probabilities’. This does not allow the Commission to put an especially heavy weight on a low-probability event however damaging it might be.

In my personal view the suggested theories of harm have either been remedied or are not supported by evidence to the requisite legal standard. A negative decision would almost certainly have been overturned by the General Court. Blocking the transaction in such circumstances would not have been a bold policy move. In my mind it would have been an abuse of power.

The efforts have become even more urgent after the implosion of Wirecard AG showed Europe’s lack of global tech champions.VW has set a target of boosting the share of its software that is developed in-house to 60% from 10% currently. To pull this off it established a unit — dubbed Car.Software Org — with about 4000 employees to develop a system that can manage vehicle data flows and connect them to the cloud.“This would be the ‘brain’ of the car and we don’t want to give it to other parties” CEO Diess told Bloomberg in November. “We see that probably as the most important race and decisive point for our industry in the next five to 10 years.”In its latest five-year investment plan the company doubled spending on digitalization efforts to 27 billion euros ($32 billion) even as the overall budget remained flat. While that represents significant resources Google parent Alphabet spends almost that much in a year.Infighting has dogged VW’s effort. Car.Software was initially envisioned as an agile standalone unit but internal rivalries got in the way triggering the departure of high-ranking software specialists including former SAP SE executive Bjoern Goerke. The company then changed tack and put Audi in charge.Meanwhile the need for VW to step up its game has become painfully evident.In the early days of the coronavirus crisis with parallel launches of the Golf hatchback and the ID.3 electric car going wrong Diess summoned senior managers for a fresh round of war-gaming.The Golf’s emergency-call feature had to be fixed. Other glitches delayed the ID.3 for months and the first owners had to drive to their dealerships for a software patch because over-the-air updates weren’t working yet.Diess and his team concluded the efforts were proving too little too late.The result is Project Artemis. Under the more aggressive strategy VW plans to build its own software stack for vehicles starting in 2024. The first Artemis car — code-named Landjet — will be assembled in a smaller factory in Hannover before the technology is scaled up two years later with a more affordable VW-branded electric car out of Wolfsburg.Big Tech isn’t waiting. While VW’s Car.Software unit entered a labor pact with unions regulating salaries and working hours Apple’s car project appears to be moving forward and Alphabet’s Waymo LLC is widely believed to be leading the pack in self-driving technology.The efforts could lead to software companies controlling the relationships with car users said Anja Hendel a former Porsche official who joined Diconium a digital advisory acquired by VW. “It’s a big change for the auto industry” she said during a podcast this month.For tech companies replicating the takeover of the mobile-phone industry won’t be so easy when it comes to cars. While a glitch might be a nuisance during a video chat it could be deadly on the Autobahn. That gives automakers some leeway and Volkswagen is putting the pieces in place.Alongside Car.Software the company has teamed up with Amazon.com Inc. for an industrial cloud for its factories and with Microsoft Corp. for a separate data network for its vehicles.Senges’s 42 Wolfsburg is part of the long-term solution. The VW-sponsored school — with a planned budget of $2.4 million a year — is designed to create a new breed of engineers in the shadow of the factory’s smokestacks.“The difference between the software and car industries isn’t as big as one might think” he said. “The potential we have here is enormous.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8veW91dGhtb3RpdmF0b3I0bGlmZS5jb20vc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS1nb29nbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inspiring Success Story of Google,"Google is one of the world’s most successful technology companies.

Google was co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

About Larry Page–

Larry Page was born to Carl Victor Page Sr. and Gloria on March 26 1973 in Lansing Michigan United States of America.

Both his parents were computer science professors in Michigan State University.

His father Carl Victor Page Sr. was an innovator in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer science.

And his mother Gloria used to teach computer programming.

Larry Page used to find many gadgets and magazines related to computers in his home.

As he was brought up in this environment he eventually gained interest in the computers.

Larry Page was a very curious kid and used to open up the gadgets to know their mechanism of working.

Once in an interview he said that since his childhood he knew that one day he will grow up to become an entrepreneur and will invent something utile.

When Larry Page was of around 12 years of age he decided to become a businessman in the future and this thought sparked him to learn about businesses.

Education-

Larry Page attended the Okemos Montessori School.

And he graduated in Computer engineering from the University of Michigan.

Later Larry Page did his post-graduation from Stanford University and he also got enrolled for the PhD in the same university.

During his PhD he met Sergey Brin at a research project.

Later these two people together changed the face of the technology industry.

About Sergey Brin –

Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin was born on August 21 1973 to Eugenia and Mikhail Brin in Moscow Russia.

His father was a mathematics professor at University of Maryland and his mother was a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose World Wide Web as their research topic for their PhD study.

Birth of Google-

Sergey Brin and Larry Page worked hard for four years to develop an algorithm which links all the websites on the internet.

Basically Google was started with a mission to organise all the information in the world and to make that collected information easily accessible to each and every one by using the power of technology.

They finally succeeded in developing this amazing algorithm in September 1996.

This algorithm was named as PageRank and was used to assign page ranks based on the popularity of the websites.

Their search engine listed the web results in order of their popularity the most popular results showed at the top of the search results because the most popular results will probably be the most useful results.

They initially named their search engine as BackRub but later changed its name to Google by misspelling googol.

As vast as an ocean-

Googol is a mathematical term which can be represented by placing number one followed by a hundred zeroes.

The main concept of their search engine was to provide as much data as possible to the users.

So they wanted to name the search engine as googol as googol indicates a very big number which reflected their mission of developing a search engine googol which displays a vast amount of data.

But they misspelled it as Google.

Initially Google was a part of the website of Stanford University.

Finally google.com domain name was registered on September 15 1997.

And then they raised one million dollars from their families friends and the investors.

Starting in a garage-

On September 4 1998 Google was founded in a garage of their friend Susan Wojcicki in Menlo Park California United States.

Susan Wojcicki is Google’s first marketing manager and currently she serves as the CEO of YouTube.

Becoming billionaires-

During those times Yahoo was a giant and almost each and every one relied on their search engine.

The co-founders of Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page offered Yahoo to sell the algorithms of Google for one million dollars.

Because they thought that it was too early for them to venture into business and instead they wanted to allocate their full time and focus on their education at Stanford University.

But Yahoo rejected their offer.

And for the second time in 2002 Yahoo once again got a chance to acquire Google for a sum of five billion dollars.

But Yahoo wanted Google for three billion dollars.

Yahoo for the second time missed a golden chance of acquiring Google.

After these rejections Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to run Google on their own.

Yahoo has lost the search engine game to Google a very long time ago.

Now on an average Google receives over 40000 searches per second.

First funding-

Google received its first funding of 100000 dollars from Andy Bechtolsheim the co-founder of Sun Microsystems.

And in 1998 Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon.com and David Cheriton a professor of computer science at Harvard University also invested in Google.

Never looking back again-

The eventual global success of Google can be attributed to its unique algorithm.

On 19th August 2004 Google’s held its first Initial public offering.

This offering was a huge success and Google reaped huge investments.

This made Larry Page and Sergey Brin one of the youngest billionaires.

In September 2013 Larry Page was ranked as the thirteenth richest person in America in The Forbes 400 list.

During the same year in the month of October Larry Page was the number 17th in the Forbes most powerful people list.

And by the age of 25 the co-founders of Google became millionaires and they became billionaires at the age of 30.

And now Google is the biggest internet company in the world.

Biggest advertising company –

In addition to being a search engine Google is also an advertising company.

And now the majority of its revenue (more than 70 percent) is generated through advertising alone.

Acquisitions-

In April 2003 Google acquired Applied Semantics a company which specialized in developing software related to online advertising.

The technology utilised in the Google AdSense technology is developed by Applied Semantics.

Google also acquired Android in July 2005 for 50 million dollars.

Now Android powers around 70.16% of the mobile devices across the world.

On 13 November 2006 Google bought YouTube now the world’s most favourite video platform for 1.65 billion dollars.

Google had also acquired AdMob in November 2009 for 750 million dollars.

The services of AdMob are used to display ads in the Google Play applications; this enables the developers of the applications and Google to earn revenue.

Some great offerings-

Google also offers many great products like Google Chrome Gmail Google Translate Google Maps Google AdSense Google Ads Google Docs and Blogger etc.

On 10th August 2015 the co-founders of Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced the creation of a new parent company Alphabet Inc.

This came into effect from 2nd October 2015 and now Alphabet Inc. is the parent company of Google.

Larry Page is the former CEO of Alphabet Inc. and Sergey Brin is the former president of Alphabet Inc.

The current CEO of Alphabet Inc. is Sundar Pichai.

Now Alphabet employs more than 135300 people.

Philanthropy-

Google also runs a non-profit organisation by name Google.org.

This organisation concentrates on developing renewable energies reducing poverty and providing education to masses.

The anti-transgender legislation filed in the last two days include South Carolina HB 4047 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) Texas SB 1311 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) and Michigan SB 218 (an anti-transgender sports ban). The Human Rights Campaign has been tracking anti-transgender legislation across state legislatures for decades including since the surge in anti-LGBTQ state legislation since 2015. The legislative fight to pass discriminatory anti-transgender legislation this year has been fast and furious led by national groups aiming to stymie LGBTQ progress. Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David issued the following statement in response to a record-setting anti-transgender legislative session:



These bills are not addressing any real problem and they’re not being requested by constituents. Rather this effort is being driven by national far-right organizations attempting to score political points by sowing fear and hate. What they don’t understand is opposing equality is highly unpopular — even among Trump voters — and states that pass legislation that attacks our community will face severe economic legal and reputational harm. In many cases these legislative pushes are being prioritized above COVID-19 response and relief. This push comes as equality measures gain not only popular support but legislative momentum on the federal level with the Biden Administration championing equality in early Executive Actions and Congress considering the Equality Act within the first 100 days of the new Administration.

Wide range of business and advocacy groups athletes oppose anti-trans legislation

Earlier this month more than 55 major U.S. corporations stood up and spoke out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. New companies like Facebook Pfizer Altria Peloton and Dell join companies like Amazon American Airlines Apple AT&T AirBnB Google Hilton IBM IKEA Microsoft Nike Paypal Uber and Verizon in objecting to these bills.

Nearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation

The nation’s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ people and transgender children in particular.

A fight driven by national anti-LGBTQ groups not local legislators or public concern

These bills come from the same forces that drove previous anti-equality fights by pushing copycat bills across state houses — hateful anti-LGBTQ organizations like the Heritage Foundation Alliance Defending Freedom (designated by Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group) and Eagle Forum among others.

For example Montana’s HB 112 the first anti-transgender sports bill to be passed through a legislative chamber in any state was written by the Alliance Defending Freedom.

Trans equality is popular: Anti-transgender legislationis a low priority even among Trump voters

In a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group last fall:

At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.

At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care with many states breaking 90% support

When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues the issue came in dead last with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.

States that pass anti-transgender legislation suffer economic legal reputational harm

Analyses conducted in the aftermath of previous divisive anti-transgender bills across the country like the bathroom bills introduced in Texas and North Carolina and an anti-transgender sports ban in Idaho show that there would be or has been devastating fallout.

Idaho is the only state to have passed an anti-trans sports ban to date and that law was swiftly suspended by a federal district court. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) came out against the Idaho bill and others like it and subsequently moved planned tournament games out of Idaho.

The Associated Press projected that the North Carolina bathroom bill could have cost the state $3.76 billion over 10 years.

During a fight over an anti-transgender bathroom bill in 2017 the Texas Association of Business estimated $8.5 billion in economic losses risking 185000 jobs in the process due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and professional sporting event cancellations a ban on taxpayer funded travel to those states cancellation of movie productions and businesses moving projects out of state.

From the highly available infrastructure that powers our servers to techniques we use to cool our data centers to the innovative server designs we provide our customers energy efficiency is a key goal of our global infrastructure. AWS’s scale allows us to achieve much higher resource utilization and energy efficiency than the typical on-premises data center and the AWS Global Infrastructure is built on AWS’s own hardware - purpose-built and optimized for workloads run by AWS customers.

According to a 451 Research report

 AWS’s infrastructure was found to be 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median of surveyed U.S. enterprise data centers with more than two thirds of this advantage due to a more energy efficient server population and higher server utilization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvYXdzL2FtYXpvbi1zM3MtMTV0aC1iaXJ0aGRheS1pdC1pcy1zdGlsbC1kYXktMS1hZnRlci01NDc1LWRheXMtMTAwLXRyaWxsaW9uLW9iamVjdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrate 15 Years of Amazon S3 with 'Pi Week' Livestream Events | Amazon Web Services,"I wrote the blog post that announced Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) fifteen years ago today. In that post I made it clear that the service was accessed via APIs and that it was targeted at developers outlined a few key features and shared pricing information. Developers found that post started to write code to store and retrieve objects using the S3 API and the rest is history!

Today I am happy to announce that S3 now stores over 100 trillion (1014 or 100000000000000) objects and regularly peaks at tens of millions of requests per second. That’s almost 13000 objects for each person in the world or 50 objects for every one of the roughly two trillion galaxies (according to this 2021 estimate) in the Universe.

A Simple Start

Looking back on that launch we made a lot of decisions that have proven to be correct and that made it easy for developers to understand and get started with S3 in minutes:

We started with a simple conceptual model: Uniquely named buckets that could hold any number of objects each identified by a string key. The initial API was equally simple: create a bucket list all buckets put an object get an object and put an access control list. This simplicity helped us to avoid any one-way doors and left a lot of room for us to evolve S3 in response to customer feedback. All of those decisions remain valid and code written on launch day will still work just fine today.

After discussing many different pricing models (discussed at length in Working Backwards) we chose a cost-following model. As Colin and Bill said:

With cost following whatever the developer did with S3 they would use it in a way that would meet their requirements and they would strive to minimize their cost and therefore our cost too. There would be no gaming of the system and we wouldn’t have to estimate how the mythical average customer would use S3 to set our prices.

In accord with the cost-following model we have reduced the price per GB-month of S3 many times and have also introduced storage classes that allow you to pay even less to store data that you reference only infrequently (S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive) or for data that you can re-create if necessary (S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access). We also added S3 Intelligent-Tiering to monitor access patterns and to move objects to an appropriate storage tier automatically.

Giving developers the ability to easily store as much data as they wanted to with a simple pricing model was a really big deal. As New York Times writer John Markoff said in Software Out There shortly after S3 was launched:

Amazon recently introduced an online storage service called S3 which offers data storage for a monthly fee of 15 cents a gigabyte. That frees a programmer building a new application or service on the Internet from having to create a potentially costly data storage system.

Durability was designed in from the beginning. Back in 2010 I explained what we mean when we say that S3 is designed to provide “11 9’s” (99.999999999%) of durability. We knew from the start that hardware software and network failures happen all of the time and built S3 to handle them transparently and gracefully. For example we automatically make use of multiple storage arrays racks cells and Availability Zones (77 and counting).

We had an equally strong commitment to security and have always considered it to be “job zero.” As you can see from the list below we continue to refine and improve the array of security options and features that you can use to protect the data that you store in S3.

Days after we launched S3 tools applications and sites began to pop up. As we had hoped and expected many of these were wholly unanticipated and it was (and still is) always a delight to see what developers come up with.

Today 15 years later S3 continues to empower and inspire developers and lets them focus on innovation!

Through the Years

I’m often asked to choose a favorite service launch or feature. Because I like to be inclusive rather than exclusive this is always difficult for me! With that said here are some of what I believe are the most significant additions to S3:

Fundamentals – Versioning Event Notifications Select Access Points S3 on Outposts and Strong Consistency.

Storage Classes – S3 Glacier S3 Standard-Infrequent Access S3 Intelligent-Tiering and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Storage Management – Cross-Region Replication Same-Region Replication Replication Time Control Replication to Multiple Destination Lifecycle Policies Object Tagging Storage Class Analysis Inventory CloudWatch Metrics and Batch Operations.

Security – Block Public Access Access Analyzer Macie GuardDuty Object Ownership and PrivateLink.

Data Movement – Import/Export Snowmobile Snowball and Snowcone.

Be sure to check out the S3 15 Launches Infographic for a more visually appealing chronological take on the last 15 years.

S3 Today

With more than 100 trillion objects in S3 and an almost unimaginably broad set of use cases we continue to get requests for more features. As always we listen with care and do our best to meet the needs of our customers.

We also continue to profile review and improve every part of the S3 implementation with an eye toward improving performance scale and reliability. This means that S3 (and every AWS service for that matter) gets better “beneath your feet” over time with no API changes and no downtime for upgrades. As a simple example we recently established a way to dramatically reduce latency for (believe it or not) 0.01% of the PUT requests made to S3. While this might seem like a tiny win it was actually a much bigger one. First it avoided a situation where customer requests would time out and retry. Second it provided our developers with some insights that they may be able to use to further reduce latency in this and possibly other situations.

Tune in to ‘Pi Week’ Virtual Events and Learn All About S3

My colleagues have been cooking up a lot of interesting content to help you learn even more about S3 during Pi Week. This is a free live virtual 4-day event that gives you the opportunity to hear AWS leaders and experts talk about the history of AWS and the key decisions that were made as we built and evolved S3. Other sessions will show you how to use S3 to control costs and continuously optimize your spend while you build modern scalable applications.

Werner Vogels has even interviewed some of the senior architects and leaders of S3 including Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec VP Block and Object Storage; Bill Vass VP Storage Automation and Management; and Eric Brandwine VP Security.

Livestreams will take place each day from 9 a.m.-1 p.m. (PDT); 12 p.m.-4 p.m. (EDT). I’ll add the links daily as the videos are published. Here are the day’s themes:

People tend to repeat these to each other as though they’re unquestionably true but they’re either debatable or objectively false - for example Amazon hasn’t raised money directly from investors since the IPO in 1997 though it does pay people a lot of stock (Lina Khan made this mistake in her otherwise excellent paper on the challenges Amazon poses to competition theory).

AWS is particularly interesting though because it is true that AWS is highly profitable and generates a lot of cash that Amazon can use for other things and that naturally leads to the policy argument that we should split it apart from the rest of Amazon so that the retail business would have to run off its own cashflow.

You could certainly do that (though given that Amazon has less than 10% share of US retail it might be hard to win the case) but you also need to understand that AWS is not the only highly profitable part of Amazon - it’s just the only part that the SEC makes Amazon break out. As I wrote here (back in 2014) Amazon is a bundle of lots of different businesses with different margins and the net income line only shows you the aggregate. AWS operating income is broken out but there are other things that aren’t.

Amazon started disclosing AWS numbers five years ago but in the last couple of years another big and highly profitable business has quietly emerged in the footnotes at the back of the 10k.

The Boeing 737 Max is back and here to stay.

Boeing has reported thousands of passenger flights have already been flown with the aircraft and more airlines are resuming service every month.

Its troubled past aside the Max is still a groundbreaking aircraft and offers attractive amenities for airlines and passengers alike. Airlines love the aircraft's cost-saving economics while passengers will enjoy the ultra-modern onboard amenities like Boeing's ""Sky Interior"" complete with mood lights and larger overhead bins.

American Airlines and United Airlines were the first US two carriers to resume flying aircraft after a 20-month grounding imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. In February I took flights on each of the airlines' Max aircraft to see how each airline was handling the delicate return to service especially as passenger confidence in the aircraft plummeted after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.

On American I flew from New York to Miami the same route on which the aircraft made its second debut post-grounding. And on United I flew from Denver to Houston Texas on the airline's very first Max flight since the grounding.

Both airlines had a similar onboard offering but the difference largely came down to how both informed passengers that they'd be flying on the infamous aircraft.

The Boeing 737 Max is back and here to stay.

Boeing has reported thousands of passenger flights have already been flown with the aircraft and more airlines are resuming service every month.

Its troubled past aside the Max is still a groundbreaking aircraft and offers attractive amenities for airlines and passengers alike. Airlines love the aircraft's cost-saving economics while passengers will enjoy the ultra-modern onboard amenities like Boeing's ""Sky Interior"" complete with mood lights and larger overhead bins.

American Airlines and United Airlines were the first US two carriers to resume flying aircraft after a 20-month grounding imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. In February I took flights on each of the airlines' Max aircraft to see how each airline was handling the delicate return to service especially as passenger confidence in the aircraft plummeted after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.

And here's what it looks like on United's. If travelers know to look they will see exactly which aircraft will be used for their flight.

United takes it one step further however with that explicit warning that the customer has selected a flight on the Max.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

American doesn't have a clear warning but the Max name is not hidden at any point.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via American Airlines

The one exception is that United doesn't immediately show aircraft type on connecting itineraries unless customers select ""details."" But even then the warning will still show when reviewing the flight details before purchase.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

Winner: United Airlines. The airline makes it very clear that you're flying on a Max and goes a step further to include a heads up once a customer has selected their flights.

Check-in: The Max name remained on both of my reservations during check-in. Here's what it looked like on United...

Winner: Tied. Both airlines did have the Max name displayed during check-in.

At the airport: Both airlines didn't show the Max name at any time during check-in at the airport kiosks.

The only time I saw or heard the word ""Max"" was at the gate for both flights.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United shows the aircraft type on its digital gate signage...

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

And American's gate agents make an announcement before the flight that includes informing passengers of their flight's aircraft type whether it's the Max or not.

Flying on American Airlines during the pandemic. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Each airport is different for American however as Miami airport clearly showed the aircraft type on its signage.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: United Airlines. Digital signage at the gate clearly shows the aircraft type while American doesn't typically show aircraft type on its signage and agents only say the aircraft type once before boarding.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Onboard the aircraft: The Max doesn't have too many identifying features on the inside in either airline's configuration especially to the untrained eye.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

If a passenger got a glimpse into the cockpit they'd see this highly advanced avionics suite. But the aircraft doesn't scream ""Boeing 737 Max"" and that's typical of most airliners.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Where flyers can see the aircraft type on which they're flying is the safety card. And this is where United and American took a different approach.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United clearly states ""B737-MAX9"" on its safety cards...

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

While American opted to just write ""Boeing 737"" on its latest 737 Max safety cards since they can be used interchangeably with non-Max 737s.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

The Max name was also not included in either airline's safety brief. On United flight attendants simply used the generic Boeing 737 term.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: United Airlines. Both airlines shy away from specifically saying the word ""Max"" while onboard the aircraft but United keeps the aircraft's name on its safety cards so that there's no question.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Onboard amenities: Both airlines had a near-identical offering in economy with nothing overly exciting about either.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Aircraft for both airlines are arranged in a two-class configuration with economy class and first class seats.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United currently flies the slightly larger Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft but the difference in size is negligible on the inside. The main difference is a few more rows of seats and a mid-cabin lavatory.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Both airlines have opted against seat-back in-flight entertainment on the Max as part of an industry shift towards streaming entertainment using a mobile device. Flyers will need to download the United or American app to access the content.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Seats on both jets come with device holders to make viewing the content easier.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

They can hold anything from an iPhone to an iPad.

And both airlines have 110v AC power outlets at each seat to keep devices charged.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

American takes it one step further however with the seat-back USB charging port for easy access.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Aircraft of both airlines are equipped with Boeing's ""Sky Interior"" which gives the cabin an incredibly modern atmosphere.

Overhead bins are larger and allow for more bags to be stowed.

And mood lighting creates a relaxing atmosphere

Both airlines also offer in-flight WiFi. American offers Gogo in-flight WiFi which gives T-Mobile users a free hour of service while United charges for all customers.

Free Apple Music for the duration of the flight is also available on American.

But American offers less legroom than United in economy with 30 inches of seat pitch for standard seats.

United offers 31 inches of pitch for its regular economy seats.

American's seats are also narrower in economy coming in between 16.6 and 17.8 inches wide depending on the seat location.

United's are a consistent 18 inches wide.

I didn't notice the difference as much when flying on both carriers and actually enjoyed American's seat just as much as United's. I wouldn't avoid flying on either airline's Max for the seat comfort alone and I even spent more time on American.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: Tied. Both aircraft are nearly identical in terms of the type of product offered in economy and I found each airline had its own pros and cons that evened them out.

Ultimately I found United to be handling the Max return to serve the best out of the two carriers.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

United clearly did more to try and inform passengers that they were scheduled to fly on the Max while American just handled the aircraft like business as usual. Both airlines have proved that the Max is safe but winning back customer confidence and being proactively transparent will go further than being complacent in the event of skeptical passengers.

Inside the aircraft there were only minor differences between the two and both offered comfortable and modern products that made the journeys enjoyable.

The anti-transgender legislation filed in the last two days include South Carolina HB 4047 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) Texas SB 1311 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) and Michigan SB 218 (an anti-transgender sports ban). The Human Rights Campaign has been tracking anti-transgender legislation across state legislatures for decades including since the surge in anti-LGBTQ state legislation since 2015. The legislative fight to pass discriminatory anti-transgender legislation this year has been fast and furious led by national groups aiming to stymie LGBTQ progress. Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David issued the following statement in response to a record-setting anti-transgender legislative session:



These bills are not addressing any real problem and they’re not being requested by constituents. Rather this effort is being driven by national far-right organizations attempting to score political points by sowing fear and hate. What they don’t understand is opposing equality is highly unpopular — even among Trump voters — and states that pass legislation that attacks our community will face severe economic legal and reputational harm. In many cases these legislative pushes are being prioritized above COVID-19 response and relief. This push comes as equality measures gain not only popular support but legislative momentum on the federal level with the Biden Administration championing equality in early Executive Actions and Congress considering the Equality Act within the first 100 days of the new Administration.

Wide range of business and advocacy groups athletes oppose anti-trans legislation

Earlier this month more than 55 major U.S. corporations stood up and spoke out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. New companies like Facebook Pfizer Altria Peloton and Dell join companies like Amazon American Airlines Apple AT&T AirBnB Google Hilton IBM IKEA Microsoft Nike Paypal Uber and Verizon in objecting to these bills.

Nearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation

The nation’s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ people and transgender children in particular.

A fight driven by national anti-LGBTQ groups not local legislators or public concern

These bills come from the same forces that drove previous anti-equality fights by pushing copycat bills across state houses — hateful anti-LGBTQ organizations like the Heritage Foundation Alliance Defending Freedom (designated by Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group) and Eagle Forum among others.

For example Montana’s HB 112 the first anti-transgender sports bill to be passed through a legislative chamber in any state was written by the Alliance Defending Freedom.

Trans equality is popular: Anti-transgender legislationis a low priority even among Trump voters

In a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group last fall:

At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.

At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care with many states breaking 90% support

When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues the issue came in dead last with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.

States that pass anti-transgender legislation suffer economic legal reputational harm

Analyses conducted in the aftermath of previous divisive anti-transgender bills across the country like the bathroom bills introduced in Texas and North Carolina and an anti-transgender sports ban in Idaho show that there would be or has been devastating fallout.

Idaho is the only state to have passed an anti-trans sports ban to date and that law was swiftly suspended by a federal district court. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) came out against the Idaho bill and others like it and subsequently moved planned tournament games out of Idaho.

The Associated Press projected that the North Carolina bathroom bill could have cost the state $3.76 billion over 10 years.

During a fight over an anti-transgender bathroom bill in 2017 the Texas Association of Business estimated $8.5 billion in economic losses risking 185000 jobs in the process due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and professional sporting event cancellations a ban on taxpayer funded travel to those states cancellation of movie productions and businesses moving projects out of state.

View the current offers here.

Have you ever had your bag lost or damaged during travel? It's probably inevitable for frequent travelers since most airlines have no idea where your bags are between scans. Some airlines like American offer live baggage tracking through an app but others don't.

So it's essential to have baggage insurance if and when your luggage doesn't show up on the carousel. In today's post I'll dive into the details of the baggage insurance plan offered by many American Express cards.

The basics of Amex baggage insurance

It's essential to know all the various rules and restrictions surrounding Amex baggage insurance. Not all losses are covered so it's important to be aware of these limits. If they don't align with your travel needs you may want to look into buying additional coverage elsewhere. Here's everything you need to know about the basics of Amex's baggage insurance plan:

The types of losses it covers

Amex may cover losses resulting from damaged stolen or lost baggage. Carry-on and checked luggage are both eligible for coverage.

Related: The best travel insurance policies and providers

When you're covered

To be eligible for coverage you have to travel on a common carrier which Amex defines as any air land or water vehicle (other than a personal or rental vehicle) that is licensed to carry passengers for hire and available to the public. Your rental car as well as taxis and ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft would be excluded.

To receive coverage you also need to pay for the entire fare with an eligible American Express card or use Membership Rewards points to book tickets through Amex Travel. Trips booked with points or miles from other sources are excluded though.

Who is covered

This policy covers both primary and additional cardmembers. Coverage also includes cardmembers' spouses or domestic partners and any dependent children under 23 years old. However travelers must be permanent residents of one of the 50 states Washington D.C. Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

How much it covers

Most American Express cards will cover replacement costs for checked bags and their contents up to $500 per person although so-called high-risk items are only covered for a maximum of $250. These items include jewelry sporting equipment photographic or electronic equipment computers and audio-visual equipment. And carry-on bags are typically covered for up to $1250.

However you'll enjoy additional coverage on select premium American Express cards including The Platinum Card® from American Express and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express. Check Amex's baggage insurance plan webpage to see the policy documents for airfare purchased with each eligible Amex card.

Eligibility and benefit level varies by card. Terms conditions and limitations apply. Visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for details. Policies are underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company.

Just keep in mind that coverage is secondary; Amex will only cover losses above any reimbursement you may receive from the common carrier.

Other important exclusions

This coverage excludes many items including cash tickets animals motorized vehicles and anything shipped as freight. Plus this coverage excludes losses resulting from acts of war government confiscation and illegal actions. It's best to read the policy for your card so you understand what types of losses Amex may exclude.

How to file a claim

If you've suffered a loss and you meet the conditions outlined in the policy document for your card here's what you need to do to get reimbursed. First inform Amex of your loss by filing a ""notice of claim"" within 30 days of your loss. You can do so by visiting americanexpress.com/onlineclaim calling 1-800-228-6855 in the U.S. or calling 1-303-273-6498 if abroad.

You'll need to complete ""proof of loss"" paperwork within 60 days. This paperwork can include a claim form a charge receipt and a written report of loss for checked bags. Once your claim is approved you can typically expect reimbursement within 30 days.

Here are some tips for making sure you get the coverage you need.

Pick the right Amex card

The American Express baggage insurance benefit is a strong one especially since it covers carry-on bags. But when it comes to booking travel not all Amex cards are created equal. One of the best options is The Platinum Card from American Express ($695 annual fee; see rates and fees) which offers 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com (on up to $500000 in purchases per calendar year). The American Express® Gold Card ($250 annual fee; see rates and fees) is another strong option since it offers 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com.

Always file a claim

Amex's baggage insurance covers some things that you might not expect including lost carry-on bags without specifying that the loss must be the result of theft. So if you happen to leave your glasses or a jacket on a plane you should be covered. It also doesn't matter what form of transportation you use so long as it meets Amex's definition of a common carrier.

Therefore this benefit conceivably applies to losses incurred on subways ferries aerial trams and just about any other paid public transportation form. So you might as well file a claim if something goes missing while you're traveling.

Related: What to do if you leave something on the plane

File a claim with the transportation provider first

Even if this policy covers your loss there are two reasons to file a claim with the airline or service provider. First Amex will require you to submit a copy of the claim against the travel provider as part of its own claims process. Also Amex's coverage is secondary. It will cover you in excess of whatever the transportation provider does. So while the airline's and Amex's coverage might both be individually inadequate you can receive compensation from both.

Bottom line

Cardmembers often forget about credit card travel protections. But it's worth checking what benefits the cards you typically use for airfare purchases provide. After all many of the best cards for airfare purchases offer various protections including delayed baggage insurance trip delay insurance and trip cancellation/interruption insurance. If you find your card doesn't offer many protections consider adding one of the best cards with travel insurance to your wallet.

Free Spirit Gold Benefits

Once Spirit Airlines launched its revamped Free Spirit frequent flyer program I was itching to use my shiny new gold status. Briefly Free Spirit Silver members achieve the level by accruing 2000 SQPs and Spirit travelers earning 5000 SQPs qualify for Gold. What makes this such a unique status is that ancillary charges not only earn points (they do not on United American Delta Alaskan or Southwest for example) but they earn them at an accelerated rate.

Additionally Free Spirit credit card holders (Bank of America revamped that offering too) earn Status Qualifying Points (SQPs) that blend with those earned from Spirit flights. For comparison status at the Gold level would be unavailable by spend on any other airline. I previously held the Citi Aadvantage Executive card which required $40000 in spend to earn 10000 EQMs or the current JetBlue card from Barclays that provides Mosaic status in most years after $50000 in spend – both would afford fewer benefits for the same money.

On my flight my favorite benefit was a free carry-on and free checked bag though it’s nice to have an airline that feels they can manage a snack box for elites in the back of the plane too.

You can find a full review of the new program here.

My Experience

My family and I flew with Spirit a few weeks ago on a roundtrip. The benefits were still new within the last 90 days so not all staff members had come to understand all of them. Checkin was a breeze and for good measure I added a carry-on and checked bag in both directions just in case. This had an unintended benefit. Gold elite members receive Group 2 boarding but adding a carry-on (even if you don’t have one with you) comes with Boarding Group 1 – and that applied to my party of three.

Our checked bag was over the limit of 40lbs but as overweight luggage fees are waived for Gold the agent initially tried to charge us for this until he realized it was an included benefit. He was pleasant about it as were we. He didn’t try to charge us for the bag because we had selected them online in advance.

We used TSA Precheck so we didn’t try out shortcut security however only Pittsburgh has a priority lane outside of standard security and TSA Precheck; Fort Myers does not. Pittsburgh didn’t have a significant line at security regardless.

We boarded in Group 1 and had no issues. As I mentioned in another post by buying our tickets at the airport not only did we save the extra fees of booking online but we also had our seating included at that point in time. The program relaunch hadn’t taken place yet so our free assignments to preferred seating and rows had not been applied but were automatically adjusted at checkin – something American and United don’t do (in my experience.)

After takeoff as inflight services began I was able to select a snack box and a drink though staff wasn’t quite sure how to execute this on their tablets. For my experience it was a pretty seamless encounter and one that my family enjoyed.

Should You Go For Gold?

Comparing my experience to American Airlines and United Airlines both of whom I have flown in the last six weeks and both as a top-level elite I’d call my experience a toss-up vs. Free Spirit Gold. I cleared a first-class upgrade on just one of four flights on United (not offered within Free Spirit) for a 45-minute flight.

I paid $450 for that trip on United compared to a fraction on Spirit but actually got more benefits from Spirit than I did with United. I was able to us points pooling to centralize earnings with friends and family members traveling with me. I would have earned more redeemable points and more SQPs had I spent any money on extras.

Some of these benefits are included in Spirit’s fare club Free Spirit Savers for about $60/annually

I didn’t need to utilize flight flex for my trip (free changes up to 24 hours prior) but it would have been a leg up on American’s antiquated approach. United has a pretty good system for last minute flight changes for elites.

United charges a redemption fee in the form of more points required for near-term bookings while Spirit does not and in fact they waive any redemption fees. Not to beat a dead horse [picks up mallet walks toward carcass] but United can’t give me a box of cheese dip and salami due to COVID (this is now official policy) and Spirit can.

Should you go for Gold? Maybe. Do you fly primarily fly domestically and to Latin America/the Caribbean? If so it’s probably a yes. If you need to go further afield Delta American and United might be your answer.

The one thing to remember is that while the other carriers spent the last five years requiring more and more spending to maintain the same elite levels and more points to redeem for the same trip as before Spirit went the other direction. In the pandemic Spirit is the one that’s rolling out innovation for its customers and United is rolling it back. United is threatening more layoffs without a… [checks notes] third [is that right?] bailout while Spirit is hiring pilots and flight attendants.

Yes. Yes you should go for Gold.

Conclusion

Don’t let my snark cloud your impression of my experience. I found Free Spirit Gold to be an excellent customer experience and on par if not exceeding some aspects of United 1K. You’ve read that correctly. It’s also not for everyone. Some customers will fly long-haul flights abroad utilizing a bevy of partners and extensive needs beyond even what their primary carrier provides. However for those flying closer to home maybe it’s time to reconsider which airline deserves your attention. It’s pretty clear who does and does not want it.

What do you think? Have you flown Spirit with an elite level? How has your experience been?"

We've been hearing it for years but the recent Texas blackouts have made it glaringly apparent: The energy grid needs our urgent attention.

And it's not only the grid in Texas. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the U.S. energy infrastructure a C-minus grade saying that in the near term ""additional transmission and distribution infrastructure smart planning and improved reliability are needed to accommodate the changing energy landscape as delivery becomes distributed and renewables grow.""

Clearly updating our energy infrastructure is a pressing need and many investors are charged up about the companies helping to bring our grid into the 21st century: Companies like Itron (ITRI 0.82%) NV5 Global (NVEE -1.10%) and Quanta Services (PWR -0.97%).

Itron: A global powerhouse

Serving more than 8000 customers (utilities and cities) in over 100 countries Itron is playing a crucial role in bringing electric grids -- at home and abroad -- into the 21st century by offering a variety of products and services including smart meters and analytics software.

The company's grid management helps utilities integrate smart devices and software to achieve greater efficiency and improve resilience. ComEd the largest electric utility in Illinois achieved a 46% reduction in the frequency of customer interruptions and a 32% reduction in customers impacted by storms with the help of Itron.

In Maine electric utility Versant Power recently chose Itron's advanced metering infrastructure including 160000 smart meters to update its grid. Versant President John Flynn said ""With Itron's solution we will be able to continue to ensure that electricity is more acceptable available and affordable to more people than before.""

During its fourth-quarter 2020 earnings presentation Itron reported that it achieved a record $973 million in bookings resulting in a record backlog of $3.3 billion. The insight into the backlog and future potential revenue is valuable for investors mitigating concern that the company won't be able to achieve growth -- especially in the context of constrained budgets due to the pandemic.

On the company's third-quarter 2020 conference call Alex Hockman the chief operating officer talked about NV5's opportunity to update the grid in California saying ""We have secured several large design and survey contracts in Q3 and wildfires this year in California are expected to continue driving utility efforts to modernize the electrical grid for the years to come.""

In January NV5 announced a contract award from an unnamed national utility ""to provide engineering and design services for power distribution transmission and substation infrastructure."" According to NV5 the three-year contract is expected to contribute over $100 million to its top line. While the deal isn't necessarily transformative for the company's finances it is noteworthy considering the company reported $660 million in sales for 2020. The deal furthermore highlights NV5's ability to provide a diverse range of offerings to utilities including engineering surveying and geospatial mapping project management construction administration and testing and inspection services.

Addressing the contribution to the top line of the deal management hasn't commented on how it will affect profitability; however investors can infer that the company's grid modernization business plays an important factor in growing the bottom line. Unlike the building technologies and sciences segment which saw revenue and gross profit decline from 2019 to 2020 the infrastructure segment (which accounts for grid modernizations services) has recognized both growing revenue and gross profit over the past three years helping the company overall along both respective metrics.

Quanta Services: Keeping current with its capabilities

Like NV5 Quanta Services helps utilities update their electrical grids in a variety of ways. It's an efficient builder of electricity transmission towers to replace old towers with related engineering services like line design and foundation design. Quanta also helps utilities with substation design and construction distribution engineering and program management.

Engineering News-Record a trade publication for the construction industry rated Quanta No. 1 on three separate top 600 lists: specialty contractors electrical contractors and utility contractors. And Fortune recently ranked the company No. 3 in the engineering and construction category of its listing of the world's most admired companies.

Like Itron which has seen an increase in its backlog Quanta also has seen growing demand ending 2020 with a record $15.1 billion in backlog.

And last summer Quanta entered into a joint venture LUMA Energy that represents a 15-year operations and maintenance agreement with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to help modernize the island's energy grid. Quanta management noted on the fourth-quarter 2020 conference call that LUMA's contribution over the 15-year agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for the company.

The power-packed recap

Itron NV5 and Quanta are all viable investments. Of the three though NV5 may be better suited to investors in search of a significant growth stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcHJhZGlvLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL2hlcmVzLXdoeS15b3VyLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXByaWNlcy1hcmUtaGlnaC1hbmQtc29hcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Your Electricity Prices Are High And Soaring,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/03/13/heres-why-your-electricity-prices-are-high-and-soaring/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcHJhZGlvLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL2hlcmVzLXdoeS15b3VyLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXByaWNlcy1hcmUtaGlnaC1hbmQtc29hcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tb2JpbGl0eS1yZXBvcnQvdXRpbGl0aWVzLXNvdXRoLW1pZHdlc3QtYnVpbGQtbW9yZS1ldi1jaGFyZ2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utilities to build network of EV charging stations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/utilities-south-midwest-build-more-ev-chargers on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tb2JpbGl0eS1yZXBvcnQvdXRpbGl0aWVzLXNvdXRoLW1pZHdlc3QtYnVpbGQtbW9yZS1ldi1jaGFyZ2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi83LWludmVudGlvbnMtb2Ytbmlrb2xhLXRlc2xhLXRoYXQtd2VyZS1uZXZlci1idWlsdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Eccentric Inventions by Nikola Tesla That Were Never Built,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='interestingengineering.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Have you ever had your bag lost or damaged during travel? It's probably inevitable for frequent travelers since most airlines have no idea where your bags are between scans. Some airlines like American offer live baggage tracking through an app but others don't.

So it's essential to have baggage insurance if and when your luggage doesn't show up on the carousel. In today's post I'll dive into the details of the baggage insurance plan offered by many American Express cards.

The basics of Amex baggage insurance

It's essential to know all the various rules and restrictions surrounding Amex baggage insurance. Not all losses are covered so it's important to be aware of these limits. If they don't align with your travel needs you may want to look into buying additional coverage elsewhere. Here's everything you need to know about the basics of Amex's baggage insurance plan:

The types of losses it covers

Amex may cover losses resulting from damaged stolen or lost baggage. Carry-on and checked luggage are both eligible for coverage.

When you're covered

To be eligible for coverage you have to travel on a common carrier which Amex defines as any air land or water vehicle (other than a personal or rental vehicle) that is licensed to carry passengers for hire and available to the public. Your rental car as well as taxis and ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft would be excluded.

To receive coverage you also need to pay for the entire fare with an eligible American Express card or use Membership Rewards points to book tickets through Amex Travel. Trips booked with points or miles from other sources are excluded though.

Who is covered

This policy covers both primary and additional cardmembers. Coverage also includes cardmembers' spouses or domestic partners and any dependent children under 23 years old. However travelers must be permanent residents of one of the 50 states Washington D.C. Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

How much it covers

Most American Express cards will cover replacement costs for checked bags and their contents up to $500 per person although so-called high-risk items are only covered for a maximum of $250. These items include jewelry sporting equipment photographic or electronic equipment computers and audio-visual equipment. And carry-on bags are typically covered for up to $1250.

However you'll enjoy additional coverage on select premium American Express cards including The Platinum Card® from American Express and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express. Check Amex's baggage insurance plan webpage to see the policy documents for airfare purchased with each eligible Amex card.

Eligibility and benefit level varies by card. Terms conditions and limitations apply. Visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for details. Policies are underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company.

Just keep in mind that coverage is secondary; Amex will only cover losses above any reimbursement you may receive from the common carrier.

Other important exclusions

This coverage excludes many items including cash tickets animals motorized vehicles and anything shipped as freight. Plus this coverage excludes losses resulting from acts of war government confiscation and illegal actions. It's best to read the policy for your card so you understand what types of losses Amex may exclude.

How to file a claim

If you've suffered a loss and you meet the conditions outlined in the policy document for your card here's what you need to do to get reimbursed. First inform Amex of your loss by filing a ""notice of claim"" within 30 days of your loss. You can do so by visiting americanexpress.com/onlineclaim calling 1-800-228-6855 in the U.S. or calling 1-303-273-6498 if abroad.

You'll need to complete ""proof of loss"" paperwork within 60 days. This paperwork can include a claim form a charge receipt and a written report of loss for checked bags. Once your claim is approved you can typically expect reimbursement within 30 days.

Here are some tips for making sure you get the coverage you need.

Pick the right Amex card

The American Express baggage insurance benefit is a strong one especially since it covers carry-on bags. But when it comes to booking travel not all Amex cards are created equal. One of the best options is The Platinum Card from American Express ($695 annual fee; see rates and fees) which offers 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com (on up to $500000 in purchases per calendar year). The American Express® Gold Card ($250 annual fee; see rates and fees) is another strong option since it offers 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com.

Always file a claim

Amex's baggage insurance covers some things that you might not expect including lost carry-on bags without specifying that the loss must be the result of theft. So if you happen to leave your glasses or a jacket on a plane you should be covered. It also doesn't matter what form of transportation you use so long as it meets Amex's definition of a common carrier.

Therefore this benefit conceivably applies to losses incurred on subways ferries aerial trams and just about any other paid public transportation form. So you might as well file a claim if something goes missing while you're traveling.

File a claim with the transportation provider first

Even if this policy covers your loss there are two reasons to file a claim with the airline or service provider. First Amex will require you to submit a copy of the claim against the travel provider as part of its own claims process. Also Amex's coverage is secondary. It will cover you in excess of whatever the transportation provider does. So while the airline's and Amex's coverage might both be individually inadequate you can receive compensation from both.

Bottom line

Cardmembers often forget about credit card travel protections. But it's worth checking what benefits the cards you typically use for airfare purchases provide. After all many of the best cards for airfare purchases offer various protections including delayed baggage insurance trip delay insurance and trip cancellation/interruption insurance. If you find your card doesn't offer many protections consider adding one of the best cards with travel insurance to your wallet.

I learned today that while the Green Card adds to your Amex credit card limit its approval is not affected by that limit.

While many people have more than 4 or 5 Amex credit cards Amex won’t approve you for a new credit card unless you are under the limit. For some the new card limit is 4 credit cards and for others the limit is 5 credit cards (we don’t know why it varies). The only way I’m aware of to know your limit is to apply for a new Amex credit card get denied and then talk to a rep who will tell you how many credit cards you need to close in order to get approved for the new one.

The Amex Green Card counts as a Credit Card towards Amex’s credit card limit. Traditionally Amex has handled their credit cards and charge cards (now often referred to as “pay over time” cards) separately. They had a 4 or 5 card limit for credit cards and a 10 card limit for Pay over Time cards. This changed recently with the Green card which now counts towards your credit card limit even though it is a Pay over Time card.

It turns out that you can get approved for a Green card even if you are over the credit card limit. I was recently denied a new Amex Hilton credit card because I have too many Amex credit cards. This morning though I applied for the Green card and was instantly approved. This tells me that the Green Card is treated like a Pay over Time card (which it is) when applying for the Green card but it is treated like a credit card when you have it and apply for other credit cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZyb21hbG91bmdlLmNvbS9hbWV4LXJlZmVycmFsLW9mZmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why this is a great time to refer your friends and family for an American Express Card?,"American Express has operated one of the longest-running member-get-member programmes in India for its cardmembers over the years.

Since 2012 I have served as the special adviser on crimes against humanity to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Fatou Bensouda. In this role I provide Bensouda and her staff with legal advice and assistance in their investigation and prosecution of crimes against humanity around the world.

In June 2020 Trump issued an executive order authorizing the imposition of sanctions against ICC officials involved in investigations and prosecutions of U.S. personnel (and those of certain allies) for genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity. It also punishes anyone including experts like me who supports these ICC officials regardless of whether that support is related to investigations and prosecutions of U.S. and allied personnel. Last September then-Secretary of State Pompeo designated Bensouda and another senior court official under the order and the U.S. government implemented sanctions against them. As a professor of international criminal law and special adviser to Bensouda I can no longer continue my work without risking prosecution and punishment by my own government.

That’s why with two other law faculty and an ACLU human rights attorney I challenged the Trump administration’s order in a lawsuit filed January 15. The order violates our First Amendment rights and those of other academics lawyers and human rights advocates by punishing our provision of legal and technical advice to the court. We can no longer share our human rights expertise provide evidence of human rights atrocities to the court or represent victims in proceedings before the court.

I had hoped that the Biden administration would quickly rescind the executive order. After all the administration has promised that “America is back” and ready to work closely with its allies to meet shared challenges. The ICC is a critical part of the international legal order — the 123 states parties to the court include many close allies of the United States. Unfortunately although the Biden administration has rejoined the Paris Agreement the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council it has not yet rescinded Trump’s order and my co-plaintiffs and I continue to experience harm. Last night we asked the court in our case to issue a preliminary injunction against the effects of the sanctions regime so our constitutional rights are protected while our lawsuit is pending. We must be allowed to continue our work to support justice for victims of atrocity crimes.

The ICC was created in 1998 to investigate and prosecute genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity when national systems fail to or are incapable of doing so. The court began operating in 2002 filling a critical void in enforcement of international human rights and establishing a path to justice for victims of grave human rights violations when national legal systems have failed them. It is the direct successor of the Nuremberg Tribunal which the U.S. and its allies established after World War II to try members of the Nazi regime for the atrocities of that war including the Holocaust. Its establishment is a tribute to American ideals and commitments to justice and the rule of law.

Before the Trump administration’s order I worked closely with Bensouda and her staff by providing pro bono legal advice and conducting trainings for the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). Because of the order I am no longer free to do this work. I have also been unable to contribute to important conversations about the ICC including on recent judgments for fear of punishment. My students have paid the price as well; I had to cancel one of my annual research seminars in which students would have conducted ICC-related legal research in support of my work for the OTP.

The work of my co-plaintiff K. Alexa Koenig was also abruptly stopped by the executive order. Koenig specializes in the use of emerging technologies to help map and document human rights abuses and mass atrocities in conflict zones. With her law students she regularly worked with OTP staff consulting on how scientific and technological evidence and tools might be employed to aid the office’s work. Koenig’s work resulted in the creation of a Technology Advisory Board at the OTP. All of this work — including that of students and other human rights lawyers who collaborated with her — is now on hold.

My co-plaintiff Naomi Roht-Arriaza who is also a law professor in our suit was also forced to abandon her critical research and advocacy. Professor Roht-Arriaza has worked alongside Latin American civil society groups investigating the role of “grand corruption” — corruption occurring at the highest levels of government — in human rights atrocities. Her pioneering work on grand corruption shows for example patterns of murders tied to illicit mining and natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela. Prior to Trump’s executive order she was meeting with OTP officials and urging them to expand the scope of their investigation into Venezuela to incorporate the issue of grand corruption. In the face of civil and criminal penalties under the U.S. sanctions order Professor Roht-Arriaza had to cease all communication and engagement with the ICC.

The executive order has also interrupted crucial efforts to bring relief to survivors and victims of U.S. human rights violations. Steven Watt a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Human Rights Program and the final named plaintiff represents six survivors and victims of forced disappearance torture and other war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by U.S. military and CIA personnel in Afghanistan. The ACLU sought justice on behalf of these clients in U.S. courts but the U.S. government intervened to have all but one of the cases dismissed. Until the sanctions regime stopped him Watt was providing documented evidence of torture to Bensouda’s office to support its investigation in Afghanistan. He had also applied to represent his clients as official victims in the ICC proceedings but can no longer proceed. For these six men and hundreds more survivors and victims of U.S. war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan the ICC is their last hope for accountability. The sanctions regime extinguishes that hope.

As it stands the regime bars me and my co-plaintiffs under threat of severe civil and criminal penalties from engaging in activity clearly protected by the First Amendment. The sanctions regime has not only chilled our constitutionally protected speech but also that of many other human rights advocates lawyers and others whose work supports the ICC’s pursuit of justice.

One federal court has already ruled in a separate lawsuit filed by the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI) that the Trump sanctions regime punishes those who speak directly in support of the OTP and its work. That ruling temporarily blocked the U.S government from enforcing its ICC sanctions regime against OSJI and four academics and human rights lawyers. Our lawsuit seeks to invalidate the executive order and block its enforcement against any individual seeking to assist the ICC.

President Trump’s unprecedented executive order harms international and U.S. efforts to provide accountability for gross human rights violations. It is actively preventing us from providing our knowledge and expertise to our students colleagues and the American public more broadly. The Biden administration should rescind the executive order immediately and demonstrate to the world that America really is back and ready to stand up for the rule of law and human rights.

And it may be surprising to learn the company is still in Denver where it all began 110 years ago.

Gates Corp. has about 15000 employees around the world and operates in more than 128 locations in 30 countries. The company has customers in roughly 130 countries and about 50 factories including several in the U.S.

But its headquarters is still in Denver. About 430 people work out of the office building in downtown Denver and about 100 at the Customer Solutions Center in Englewood where research engineering and training take place.

“A myth about Gates is that we left and moved to China or wherever. Well we do have factories in China but most of what we make for North American customers comes from North American factories” said Tom Pitstickthe chief marketing officer and senior vice president of strategic planning.

People might think Gates is no longer in Denver because the company’s factory and sprawling campus on South Broadway and its landmark water tank emblazoned with the company’s logo have given way to blocks of new housing and commercial spaces. A remaining building now houses offices for various businesses.

“It was one of the things that people noticed for quite some time. When that moved I think people thought we moved along with it. It’s interesting to talk to people now in the community and say ‘Oh no we’re still here. We’ve been here this whole time'” said Ani Vattano Gates’ director of corporate communications.

While Gates has been a Denver institution for more than a century the company has had a global presence for decades. The family-run business started by Charles C. Gates Sr. in 1911 was on the leading edge of U.S. companies expanding to other countries Pitstick said.

Gates opened its first international manufacturing facility in Brantford Ontario Canada in 1954 and a factory in Mexico in 1958. In 1963 the company opened its first factory in Europe. It was quite an evolution from its start as the Colorado Tire and Leather Co. which made horse halters from leather scraps and a product for the new horseless carriages: the Durable Tread. The item was a steel-studded band of leather that car owners fastened to the tires to extend the mileage according to a company history provided by Gates.

The product took off with help from aggressive marketing by Gates and his brother John. The company expanded its product line to include tire patches and auto fan belts and switched from using leather to rubber. The company’s name was changed to the International Rubber Company in 1917 the same year John Gates invented what became a signature product: the V belt.

“The invention of the V belt is almost like the invention of the light bulb. It’s one of these things that was a critical component of at least the 20th century industrial revolution” Pitstick said.

The V belt or fan belt transfers power through the engine. Gates makes belts for vehicles industrial machinery and appliances. Other products are hoses water pumps power transmission components and automotive accessories.

“We’re the little belt in the vacuum cleaner. If you go to an ATM and get cash the little belt that pushes your cash out are mostly Gates belts” Pitstick said

Most cars trucks buses combine harvesters tractors construction equipment as well as oil gas and mining equipment include Gates products Pitstick added.

“Wind turbines too. We have products that are used to adjust the pitch of wind turbines” Pitstick said.

Gates V belts are in heating ventilation and air conditioning units and its belts are used in warehouses to move boxes around.

“I’ve been here five years and almost every day I come across something new and I say ‘Oh my gosh I didn’t realize our product is on that thing or inside it.’ Things like ATVs and motorcycles and snowmobiles and bicycles” Pitstick said.

Gates now uses synthetic rubber some of which is made from petroleum byproducts. Pitstick said over the past year the company has launched new products that don’t contain chlorine like other synthetic materials do.

Vattano said the company is also continually researching the use of alternative materials that are more environmentally friendly and are partnering with raw material suppliers concerned about environmental sustainability.

“One of the key themes I love about Gates is that it’s kind of a humble just-put-your-head-down and get-things-done-kind-of-company. But there’s a lot of science and technology at Gates and sometimes we don’t get credit for that. Denver in particular has a lot of engineers that work on products” Pitstick said.

The scope of the work and the company’s reputation drew Dave Miller to Gates after he graduated from college with a mechanical engineering degree. He started in 1985 designing belts and other products. He is now vice president of the global product line management.

But Miller’s association with Gates Corp. actually started before he became an employee. He jokes “The place to start is maybe the day I was born at Gates.”

He wasn’t born there but he did grow up around the company. His father Donald Miller started working for Gates in 1962 the year Dave was born. His father eventually rose to the rank of chief operating officer and retired in 1996 the year Gates finalized its merger with Tomkins a London-based engineering firm.

“I spent a lot of time on South Broadway” Miller said. “Gates in the old days had a company store. It had a gas station. It had a medical clinic. There was a lot of day-to-day activity.”

A company history refers to a celebration that opened the cafeteria a company band and a roof garden used for festivities. During the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 Charles Gates organized 10-minute twice-daily calisthenics breaks outside after doctors prescribed exercise and fresh air.

When Miller was growing up and working summers at Gates he figures as many as 8000 people worked for the company in Denver.

“It was a well-known company and someone knew someone who worked at Gates everywhere you went” Miller said. “Today definitely people don’t recognize it as much or maybe they remember the factory on Broadway but they say “Oh I didn’t realize you were still around.’ They don’t really know the complexity of the business or how large we are.”

Miller’s father joined the company after Charles Gates Jr. took over following the death of Charles Gates Sr. in 1961. The company sold its 50-acre site on Broadway to a development company in 2001 and changed its name to Gates Corp. in 2003.

Tomkins Gates’ parent company was acquired by the Canadian company Onex Corp. In 2014 the private equity group Blackstone Group acquired Gates for $5.4 billion. Gates became a public company in 2018 and moved its headquarters to a new building downtown.

“Gates is really a longtime Denver institution. We don’t have any formal connection with the family any more but we know they follow us and watch us” Pitstick said. “We want to make sure we continue to build upon the great brand they built.”

The Gates Family Foundation started in 1946 and separate from the company invests in education natural resources and community development programs. The foundation has awarded grants to respond to the COVID-19 crisis according to its website.

The company has its own philanthropic arm the Gates Industrial Corporation Foundation which has donated to more than 150 nonprofit organizations according to a statement.

Vattano said the company remains committed to being involved in the community. In December for the fourth year Gates delivered brand new bicycles to second-graders at Castro Elementary School in west Denver. Gates partnered with Priority Bicycles a manufacturer and Wish for Wheel. Employees put the bikes together in what they call a “BuildORama.”

Gates also teams with the Downtown Denver Partnership on bike-to-work day.

The company released its second corporate sustainability report in October. Gates CEO Ivo Jurek (said with more than 100 facilities operating in 30 countries “We take very seriously our responsibility as a global corporate citizen and are proud of the progress we’ve made.”

The report addresses the company’s efforts to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and water use. The report says Gates tracks the use of chemicals across all its operations and swaps out “materials of concern” when feasible.",,,

Source: Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons

As someone almost completely associated with electricity it shouldn’t be surprising that many of Tesla’s patents are in the field of electricity generation and transmission. Many people don’t know that Tesla also tried to build a tower that would transmit electricity through the air. He even got American financier J.P. Morgan to finance the building of Wardenclyffe Tower on the North Shore of Long Island which Tesla hoped to adapt to transmit electricity to New York City.

Morgan balked at the cost of the electricity transmission scheme and refused to fund the rest of the project which Tesla had to abandon in 1906 tearing down Wardenclyffe Tower a decade later in 1917.

Supersonic Airships Powered by Ground-Based Wireless Electrical Towers

When wireless charging was introduced it felt revolutionary. Nikola Tesla meanwhile would chide us all for thinking so small. In 1919 Tesla described his idea for a supersonic airship powered entirely by wireless electrical transmission from ground-based towers that could fly 40000 ft (12192 meters) off the ground and at a speed of 1000 mph (1609 km/h) making the trip from New York to London in under four hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2FwdGFpbi1hbWVyaWNhLXNjYXJsZXQtd2l0Y2gtbWN1LW1lbnRvci1zYXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Captain America Saved The MCU From Scarlet Witch,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2FwdGFpbi1hbWVyaWNhLXNjYXJsZXQtd2l0Y2gtbWN1LW1lbnRvci1zYXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL2x1eHVyeS91bmlxdWUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcnVzc2lhcy1tZXJjdXJ5LWNpdHktdG93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Unique Features Of Russia's $1 Billion Mercury City Tower,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL2x1eHVyeS91bmlxdWUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcnVzc2lhcy1tZXJjdXJ5LWNpdHktdG93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Zpc2lvbi5jby51Zy9jYXRlZ29yeS9uZXdzL2thd2VtcGUtaG9zcGl0YWwtZ2V0cy1lcXVpcG1lbnQtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1hbi1OVl85NDIzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kawempe Hospital gets equipment to improve antenatal treatment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://www.newvision.co.ug/category/news/kawempe-hospital-gets-equipment-to-improve-an-NV_94235 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Zpc2lvbi5jby51Zy9jYXRlZ29yeS9uZXdzL2thd2VtcGUtaG9zcGl0YWwtZ2V0cy1lcXVpcG1lbnQtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1hbi1OVl85NDIzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzbmV3c3RoaXN3ZWVrLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vYmhhdnlhLWRvc2ktYW4tdXBjb21pbmctdGFsZW50ZWQtYXJ0aXN0LXN0dWRlbnQtaGVhZC1jcmVhdGl2ZS1jb25zdWx0YW50LW9mLWtyZWF0aXZlLW1pbmRzL9IBhgFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzbmV3c3RoaXN3ZWVrLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vYmhhdnlhLWRvc2ktYW4tdXBjb21pbmctdGFsZW50ZWQtYXJ0aXN0LXN0dWRlbnQtaGVhZC1jcmVhdGl2ZS1jb25zdWx0YW50LW9mLWtyZWF0aXZlLW1pbmRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bhavya Dosi – An Upcoming Talented Artist Student & Head Creative Consultant of Kreative Minds…,"In Kreative Minds we are constantly supporting and guiding young talent to grow and achieve their artistic dream goals.

The Perseverance rover fresh off its flawless landing was on a mission scouring the surface of Mars for evidence of ancient life relaying crystal-clear images of an alien world proving that when it comes to space exploration no one does it better than the United States.

And 139 million miles away back on Earth 38-year-old Chris Prescott was still washing dishes bathing and cooking with bottled water.

It had been two weeks since an Arctic blast swooped into Texas knocked out the power grid and busted Prescott’s pipes just as Perseverance was touching down. For many in his impoverished Houston neighborhood — only a short drive from the Johnson Space Center — the water coming out of their taps was as dark and dingy as the Martian landscape.

“People were already struggling” said Prescott who gets by on the money he makes doing occasional yard work having lost his full-time job to the pandemic. “Now this has put them at the bottom of the barrel.”

Compared with its developed-world peers America has always been a study in contrasts a paradox of exceptional achievement and jaw-dropping deprivation. Rarely have the disparities been rendered as vividly as in recent weeks and months.

Historic breakthroughs in science medicine and technology coexist intimately — and uneasily — alongside monumental failures of infrastructure public health and equitable access to basic human needs.

America can put a rover on Mars but it can’t keep the lights on and water running in the city that birthed the modern space program. It can develop vaccines in record time to combat a world-altering illness but suffers one of the developed world’s highest death rates due to lack of prevention and care. It spins out endless entertainment to keep millions preoccupied during lockdown — and keep tech shares riding high on Wall Street — but leaves kids disconnected from the access they need to do their schoolwork.

“What kind of state are we living in what kind of society are we living in when kids have to educate themselves on the curb of a Taco Bell?” said Brian Smoot a Salinas Calif. chiropractor who invited neighborhood students to use his WiFi after two girls were photographed outside a nearby location of the fast-food chain last year their Chromebooks wobbling on their laps as they tried to connect to high-speed Internet.

And this in a city just a short drive from the extraordinary wealth of Silicon Valley a global symbol of American innovation where Apple Facebook and Google have gleaming campuses — with record stock prices to match.

The disparities reflect a multitude of factors experts say but primarily stem from a few big ones: Compared with other well-to-do nations the United States has tended to prioritize private wealth over public resources individualism over equity and the shiny new thing over the dull but necessary task of maintaining its infrastructure much of which is fast becoming a 20th century relic.

“Let’s face it we don’t have ribbon cuttings when we replace a pipe. Only when there’s a brand new bridge” said Joseph Kane an associate fellow at the Brookings Institution. “That’s the American fascination with bigger and better.”

Those choices can pay dividends as they do when the U.S. leads the world in health-care innovation or electrifies the automobile. They also have consequences.

The nation’s infrastructure — the airports broadband networks transit systems utility lines ports and sewers that keep society humming — is in a perilous state from decades of underinvestment that has transcended both Republican and Democratic administrations. Perhaps even more important than the lack of cash Kane said is the absence of a plan.

“The Eisenhower administration is really the time we really had a goal or a vision for our infrastructure” he said. “Now we’re in a fundamentally different era with a more unpredictable and extreme climate more inequality a lack of accessibility. And we’re still operating as if it’s the 1950s.”

All that neglect is showing: The American Society of Civil Engineers earlier this month gave the country a C-minus for the overall quality of its infrastructure.

That middling mark is actually up slightly from the group’s last report card four years ago when the grade was an ignominious D-plus. But it still reflects the decrepitude of a nation where a water main breaks every two minutes and where nearly half of public roads are in either poor or mediocre condition.

The Biden administration has said that reimagining infrastructure — with increased funding to match — will be a central focus of its legislative agenda this year. In theory it should be a relatively easy sell: The issue is one of the few that enjoys bipartisan backing.

Yet the same was true during the Trump administration when the notion of “infrastructure week” became a running gag and the self-described “builder president” ultimately failed to sign legislation to get workers digging and backhoes rumbling.

President Biden has said he will put racial equity at the heart of his efforts on infrastructure an attempt to remedy a system that has long provided superior public resources to some and inferior ones to others with skin color often making the difference.

The federal level is not the only place where lawmakers will be wrestling with the country’s gaping disparities this year. In 38 states and Puerto Rico legislators will be weighing whether to spend more to bring broadband Internet to poor and rural communities.

Such measures have been repeatedly delayed in the past because of concerns over the cost. But in California at least legislation to help narrow the digital divide has been moving forward. That’s in part because of the outcry over the viral photo of the girls doing their homework outside an East Salinas Taco Bell.

“We know that broadband access is a necessity of everyday life and it’s a moral imperative that we find solutions now” said Luis Alejo a county supervisor who represents the area and who has been advocating for the legislation.

Salinas may be geographically close to Silicon Valley but in other respects it’s a world away.

The city was made famous by John Steinbeck’s Depression-era novel “The Grapes of Wrath” an account of tenant farmers who escaped the Oklahoma Dust Bowl and set out west for California. The “Okies” as they were called found exploitation and discrimination rather than relief.

Today largely Latino field workers harvest lettuce and strawberries earning low pay and enjoying few protections. The city has the highest child poverty rate in the state and the lack of basic Internet access has kept many from attending virtual school during the pandemic.

Tanya Harris’s daughter is among them. Harris a single mother of three was laid off from her retail cashier job during the pandemic. She was unemployed for nine months and with the family bouncing around among shelters rat-infested motels and friends’ couches reliable Internet was rare. As a result her daughter wasn’t able to graduate from high school.

“She was really depressed about [it]” Harris said. “She’s a great student and it was her senior year. I just don’t get it: We have filthy rich people all around.”

Harris recently got a job at another clothing store again earning minimum wage.

And weeks ago she was able to get stable low-income housing in a nearby county.

Her daughter is back online and now has another chance to finish school. But the problem persists.

“I can see from my window students working outside a Starbucks right now for the fast WiFi” said Carissa Purnell director of the Alisal Family Resource Center which helps the area’s vulnerable families. “There are thousands of kids still in this situation.”

And that’s just in the Salinas area. Statewide an estimated 1.5 million students — more than half of them Black Latino or Native American — lack adequate Internet access according to a study co-published by Common Sense which advocates for children and families and the Boston Consulting Group. Nationwide the number is as high as 16 million.

In most other wealthy countries health care is considered a basic human right; a view reflected in the universal healthcare systems in place across Europe Canada and Australia. In the United States it is a commodity a fact that Britons took to Twitter to remark upon recently when they noticed — with considerable alarm — all of the medication advertisements aired during Oprah Winfrey’s interview of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. “If these medicine ads are what it’s like to not have an NHS [National Healthcare Service] I never want to experience that” one viewer tweeted.

As with the digital divide the pandemic has brought disparities in health care into sharp relief.

“We can land a rover on Mars. We can beat a pandemic” Biden recently proclaimed.

Yet the evidence has shown otherwise.

Even as American scientists laboratories and pharmaceutical companies working at breakneck pace have helped blaze a path to effective vaccines the country has consistently lagged behind other developed nations in the more elementary tasks of coronavirus testing and prevention.

Those failings have contributed to a tragic toll: The United States accounts for just four percent of the world’s population but 20 percent of worldwide coronavirus deaths. A disproportionate share are poor or people of color.

“Covid-19 laid bare how systematic inequities exist in this country” said Rabih Torbay president and CEO of Bethesda-based Project Hope an international medical relief organization that provides assistance primarily in war-torn and disaster-ravaged nations but also increasingly works in the United States.

“Where you have the best hospitals and where you don’t where you have the best health care and where you don’t” Torbay said.

Sometimes they exist side by side.

Lark Jones lives in one of the nation’s wealthiest metropolitan regions — Washington D.C. — and about 15 miles from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases labs. That’s where scientists led the development of the spike protein technology that is now at work in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.

The announcement late last year of successful vaccine development — a triumphant moment for American science — came around the same time that Jones and just about everyone she knew was falling seriously ill to covid-19.

Her 72-year-old mother was especially hard hit: After 2½ weeks in intensive care and weeks more of rehabilitation therapy she survived. But the disease left her with permanent kidney failure dependent on dialysis for the rest of her life.

Jones’s own case was milder but it still left her gasping for breath. Even before she fell ill the 40-year-old had already fallen through the cracks of American health care.

A resident of Northeast D.C. Jones lost her job as a home health aide in 2017 and with it her job-provided insurance. She found new work in the form of two part-time jobs for minimum wage. But part-time work — even when it amounts to 17-hour workdays with just one day off a week — doesn’t necessarily provide health insurance. And Jones who requires regular treatment and medication for diabetes and high blood pressure can’t afford to buy her own.

In her two part-time jobs — as a youth counselor and as a program assistant at a D.C. homeless shelter — she is considered an essential worker. She’s one of the people who continued to go to work even as others stayed home and as friends and family began to fall ill. The essential worker designation ultimately made her eligible for a vaccine; this month she received her second dose.

But the irony of it all feels outrageous when she thinks about it. There was never any hazard pay nor any protection should she get sick.

“To care for the community and still not be offered health care I think that’s just crazy” Jones said.

Health-care experts say it’s also simply American. In 2019 about 28.9 million non-elderly people in the United States were like Jones uninsured according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Roughly 45 percent of non-elderly adults are also considered “inadequately insured”—meaning that even those who have insurance still struggle to afford the care they need. The CEO of GoFundMe in 2019 said that a third of the donations raised through the charitable giving site help people struggling to pay their medical bills.

‘People have no water’

Back in Houston the inadequacies of America’s basic support systems were compounding and colliding. A failure to properly weatherize power generation systems after Texas’s last major cold snap in 2011 had led to a power crisis which led to a water crisis. And that in turn was leading to fears of a health crisis made worse by an inability to take basic precautions to ward off illness.

“People have no water” said Marcel McClinton a 19-year-old community activist. “How can they wash their hands?”

The water problems were concentrated in neighborhoods of eastern Houston that already struggled with high rates of illness. Also in the city’s east: the Johnson Space Center — home base for decades of extraterrestrial triumphs though not the most recent one — where workers lacking electricity at home huddled for warmth last month even as their colleagues at mission control in California celebrated.

A native Houstonian McClinton had moved away but he returned to join with fellow organizers to distribute bottled water food and other basic supplies in recent weeks. What he found was enormous need that predates the cold front — and will long outlast it. “We can do this work for a year and our lines will be just as long” he said.

Prescott the 38-year-old was among those standing in them picking up supplies for himself and his family as the power continued to sputter and the faucets spit out contaminated water. He soon found himself on the other side of those handoffs volunteering to help his neighbors in the city’s Fifth Ward. He had it bad but not as bad as many of the people he knew.

In the America of 2021 there was always someone who had it worse.

“I try to look out for other people” Prescott said. “There might be a time when I get in that situation and need someone to help me.”

CruiseCritic.com

Two U.S. small ship lines are quietly resuming cruising this weekend marking the first 2021 sailings back on the water and among the few that have cruised at all in North America since the global pandemic shut down cruising last March.

Both lines American Queen Steamboat Co. and American Cruise Lines have ships that are small enough to bypass the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention orders against sailings. The lines are also American flagged with American crew and are thus able to sail in American waters without a stop in Canada or another foreign port.

Because their size gives them more flexibility both lines had made plans to return to service at various points in 2020 but the unpredictability of the pandemic quashed those efforts.

The only cruises that sailed last year in North America were a few voyages on the St. Lawrence River in Canada by St. Lawrence Cruise Lines; a truncated Maine summer and fall season on two schooners Stephen Taber and Ladona; and an attempt at a Caribbean season out of Barbados by SeaDream Yacht Club which was cut short by COVID-19 cases. Here is the return plan for both lines:

American Cruise Lines

American Cruise Lines departed Saturday on its coastal cruiser Independence on a seven-night sailing from Amelia Island and Jacksonville Florida to Charleston South Carolina.

The ship usually carries 100 passengers but the cruise line has reduced capacity to 75%. The trip includes a complimentary pre-cruise night onboard so travelers on this first trip arrived Friday.

The line requires a negative COVID-19 PCR test for all passengers and crew on the ships taken within four days of boarding. A medical officer will be conducting a preboarding health screening including asking passengers whether they have been vaccinated. (There is no vaccine mandate.)

Masks will be required onboard in public spaces

Shore excursion sizes have been reduced and coaches will be operated at reduced capacity to ensure distancing. Cabins on board have been kept aside for isolation if need be. Each cabin has its own HVAC system and there is no shared air. The second departure for the line will be on its 2021 newbuild American Jazz sailing on the Lower Mississippi River from New Orleans to Memphis. That trip departs Sunday. American Cruise Lines is also one of the few small ship lines that will be able to sail in Alaska this summer given that they don't need to stop in Canada to satisfy the Passenger Vessel Services Act. That season begins in early June.

American Queen Steamboat Co.

American Queen Steamboat Co. started its season Monday with two private charter sailings on its most upscale vessel American Duchess. The ship will sail between New Orleans and Memphis Tennessee on the Mississippi River.

The line of paddlewheel ships will christen its latest vessel American Countess on Sunday followed by a preview cruise. It will sail its first revenue cruise on March 28.

American Queen has implemented a vaccine requirement for all passengers crew and partners taking effect on all sailings beginning July 1. The mandate will include shore excursion drivers as well.

In addition the line is requiring all passengers and crew to take a COVID-19 test the night before they board during their pre-cruise hotel stay. Capacity on the ships has been reduced and social distancing will be maintained. Mask-wearing in public spaces will be required when social distancing is not possible.

Sanitization has been prioritized with antiviral electrostatic fogging in public areas overnight and in cabins before the cruise. Self-service buffets have been replaced with other dining options and a nurse will be on board.

Cruise Critic will attend the American Countess christening and sail on its first cruise. More coverage to follow.",,,,,,,,,

He said PBM mobile trucks or vans carry food on daily basis visiting localities of the poor and laborers to ensure that the free meals reach the deserving on the directives of PM Imran Khan.

He said government initially started this program for Rawalpindi and Islamabad which would help the government learn about the issues and problems and will improve it before its extension to other cities.

He said philanthropists in the country can also participate in program adding they can sign a contract with Bait Ul Mall and this pilot project in the twin cities would help us for winning the trust of donors towards its extension across Pakistan.

He said program was aimed at providing two times hygienically packed food lunch and dinner to the needy individuals through real-time mobile kitchens in urban and rural areas of Islamabad and Rawalpindi adding Langar project’ would set new examples for other nations.

He also explained that at present two Ehsaas food trucks were serving free quality cooked food at various points across the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad including hospitals bus stations and other public places with utmost dignity.

The meals were cooked stored and distributed from the truck kitchen and around 500 uncooked food material were also put inside the mobile kitchen which can be cooked further in emergency need he added.

Everyone knows this but few will admit it: swimming is really really boring. Running or doing your gym routine you can liven up with music or as I do on my Peloton watching the evening news. But with swimming not so much. Splash splash glug glug is about it for a soundtrack.

There are some underwater music players out there but they tend to be old-school MP3 players with a limited memory and supposedly waterproof earbuds that leak.

Zygo from California was developed by two high-school pals who set out to design a system that could stream coaching programmes music podcasts or whatever from your phone or tablet to a swimmer – Bluetooth being almost useless if you’re in water and completely useless when you are actually under water.

Zygo Sol underwater music player £222

They experimented with frequencies and antennas until they got it right. With Zygo you can supposedly transmit content up to half a mile on the water’s surface and 50m if you are underwater as deep as 60cm. Impressive stuff – although full disclosure lockdown restricted my experimentation to being submerged in a deep bath.

Here’s how Zygo works. Your devices stream by Bluetooth to a transmitter unit that looks like a small walkie-talkie – and is. Someone on land or a boat can interrupt your music to talk to you although you can’t talk back (which would be nice especially if you were in trouble – never mind).

The next bit is getting the music or coaching programme or coach to your ears and it does this by bone conduction. The Zygo headset vibrates as if it has hornets inside delivering sound to a spot just in front of your ears whence it travels to your auditory equipment. The quality ain’t hi-fi but it’s OK. And your ears are free to hear whatever else is going on about you.

If you want to turn the sound off there are controls on the headset or better you can use your Apple Watch which you may well be wearing in case you need to take a call while swimming.

Not everyone will think it’s ideal being able to listen to music or radio while taking a dip or scuba diving in the Caribbean. But as someone who wants to be able to listen to Radio 4 anywhere in any country I’m all for worlds colliding. Zygo is clever and life-enhancing.

Photo: Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) — A federal judge in Washington blocked the Defense Department from restrict-ing U.S. investment in the Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi Corp.

In the final days of the Trump administration the Defense Department placed Xiaomi on a list of companies with alleged links to the Chinese military triggering financial restrictions that were scheduled to go into effect next week. But on Friday U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contre-ras put a temporary halt to the ban siding with Xiaomi in a lawsuit that argued that the move was “arbitrary and capricious” and deprived the company of its due process rights.

Contreras said Xiaomi was likely to win a full reversal of the ban as the litigation unfolds and issued an initial injunction to prevent the company from suffering “irreparable harm.” After the ban was announced the smartphone manufacturer faced the prospect of being de-listed from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes.

Xiaomi said it plans to continue to request that the court declare the labeling of its connection to the military as unlawful and to permanently remove the designation according to a compa-ny statement.

Xiaomi is the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world by volume. In the third quar-ter it surpassed Apple Inc. in smartphone sales according to IDC. A lawyer for the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In November former President Donald Trump signed an order barring American investment in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what the U.S. has described as abusive business practices. The U.S. has also pursued bans on popular Chinese-owned apps like WeChat and TikTok invoking threats to national security.

But Contreras brushed those concerns aside in his ruling Friday. “The court is somewhat skep-tical that weighty national security interests are actually implicated here” he wrote.

The Defense Department didn’t immediately return a request for comment on Friday evening.

The case is Xiaomi v. Defense Department 21-cv-280 U.S. District Court District of Colum-bia (Washington).

Here’s how to import them yourself – if you dare.,"Apple products are almost always cheaper when purchased abroad.

But with international travel effectively halted it is not really viable to fly to New York to buy an iPhone.

Importing Apple products yourself comes with some serious caveats.

But if you are willing to shoulder the risks and do it right you can get products not available in SA – at pretty competitive prices.

Review

On a like-for-like basis South Africans pay significantly more than many other countries for Apple products as those who travelled abroad when such things were still possible often attested.

The majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor Core Computer Group which sets prices. That's why it is rare to see any price fluctuations between competing stores on new Apple products and why they compete on value-adds like repairs instead to get you to pick one store over another.

This sole distribution model along with several other factors like shipping taxes and exchange rates means certain Apple products sold in South Africa are at times up to 50% more expensive than elsewhere in the world.

A new 128gb iPhone 12 Pro for example currently has a fixed local price of R22499 - whether you choose to buy it from Digicape iStore or Incredible Connection. Buy the exact same phone in Japan however and you’ll pay the equivalent just R15100 - a difference of 49% according to prices recorded by The Mac Index.

At a price of R22499 South Africa sits around 41st in the world when it comes to the cost of buying a new iPhone - around the same price point as that in Turkey Greece and Romania.

The new MacBook Air M1 256GB released in 2020 also works out significantly more expensive in South Africa than abroad. In Japan Thailand Hong Kong Singapore and South Korea you can expect to pay around R15000 for the laptop. In South Africa the price is currently fixed at just under R19000 about a quarter more.

It’s a similar scenario for accessories too. The AirPods Pro which cost R4999 in South Africa cost around R1000 less elsewhere in the world.

But it’s not just about pricing. The Apple product range available in the small South African market is limited particularly on customisable Macs and niche accessories.

The HomePod and new HomePod mini for example are not yet available in South Africa through official channels - and it’s unclear if they ever will be.

You can import your own – at some risk

Although Core Computers controls the official distribution channels and prices of Apple products in South Africa it is possible to buy directly from foreign countries.

It is important to note that some products like iPhones supplied by certain carriers may be network locked which could present a real problem upon their arrival - but otherwise there are few global restrictions. Even repairs may not be a problem; typically Apple or its Premium Resellers like those in South Africa will honour Apple warranties regardless of where customers buy or choose to repair their items.

That could change though and there is a risk you may have to ship a broken piece of hardware abroad and back again after repairs which won't be cheap.

But there are a few other catches. Although products bought from foreign websites may appear cheaper this is not always the case. Apple in certain destinations publishes their prices online without indicating tax. In the United States for example state tax is typically only added on at the last step. Add this and any potential South African tax and import duties and the price may in fact be less competitive than expected.

Looking for products in destinations where tax is low or non-existent on electronic goods partly solves this problem. Although it’s tempting to look to US and UK Apple online stores many have started looking towards Hong Kong for its low prices limited tax. Either way using a service like The Mac Index can help to identify which destination offers the best prices.

Watch out for credit card restrictions

Some online Apple stores limit the usage of foreign credit cards though many will accept them. According to at least one FAQ on the Apple website “If your purchase is made on the Apple Online Store using a credit/debit card from a country other than the country of the Apple Online Store you are purchasing from then Apple will charge your card in the local currency of the Store.”

If restrictions are in place it may also be possible to complete the purchase using Apple gift cards bought online - although this presents other potential geographical restrictions and additional costs.

Shipping is your problem but there are lots of options

Even with card processing going smoothly Apple’s online stores no longer ship products internationally. To overcome this hurdle shoppers will need to use some kind of freight forwarder - which comes at a cost. But as international shipping from online stores has become more pervasive the costs of these services have dropped to a point that they don't always outweigh potential savings.

Companies like Parcl and Forwardme among many others specialise in shipping products from the United States to the world while Aramex Global Shopper allows you to do the same from multiple destinations.

These shipping costs although high aren’t necessarily exorbitant.

A 1kg package shipped from the United States shipped to South Africa via Forwardme will cost around R500. An equally-sized package shipped from Hong Kong to South Africa via Aramex Global Shopper will cost around R400.

Many of these companies will ship the goods in less than one week - which means they’ll hit South African customs pretty quickly. It’s here that things get significantly murkier.

Customs tax and import duties are going to bite – but it is hard to tell how hard

The biggest unknown in the process is customs processing times - and it’s for this reason that it’s ill advised to use this process for urgent goods. Items may be cleared in days weeks or only in months depending on backlogs at the border.

South Africans must also pay VAT and duties on certain products as stipulated by the SARS Customs and Excise Act. This is charged as a percentage of the product’s value and is dependent on the product in question.

For example according to Aramex if you’re importing a laptop or iPad you can expect to pay no import duties but 15% VAT.

An iPhone or iPod however attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT.

Quite what duties or tax officials choose to tack on to the product is not entirely predictable however and comes at the buyer’s own risk. An official may deem an LCD computer monitor (which attracts no duties) to instead be an LCD TV (which attracts 25%) - and getting recourse on this might be difficult.

Here's what you will actually pay

With the above caveats and added expenses in mind it might only make the most sense to import Apple products in instances where the exact product isn’t available in South Africa. But in some cases products are still cheaper.

The HomePod mini for example currently costs HK$749 or R1500 when bought in Hong Kong. Include Aramex Global Shipping costs of R258 plus R220 tax and you have an estimated final cost of a little under R2000.

The product is not available through official Apple channels in South Africa but Geewiz currently sells it for R3295 and Smart Speakers for R4599.

Importing an iPad from the United States assuming a US tax rate of 10% shows how it can be a less attractive online shopping destination. The iPad Pro 11-inch Wi-Fi 1TB will cost you roughly the same as it would in South Africa. But purchased in Japan where it’s listed for JP¥139800 or R19800 and you could potentially save around R2000.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Comparing Arthur J. Gallagher's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it such as industry size age and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K proxy filing or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro Arthur J. Gallagher's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.76% which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Cette opération de police inédite en Russie intervient un peu plus d'un mois après la condamnation à deux ans et demi de prison d'Alexeï Navalny le principal adversaire du Kremlin et les milliers d'arrestations durant les manifestations de soutien ayant suivi son interpellation.

Samedi plus de 150 participants venus de toute la Russie - dont une immense majorité de députés locaux indépendants - s'étaient retrouvés dans un hôtel pour une conférence sur les futures élections régionales et locales à l'initiative d'un groupe soutenu par l'oligarque en exil Mikhaïl Khodorkovski une des bêtes noires du Kremlin. Mais alors que le forum prévu pour durer deux jours avait commencé depuis une quarantaine de minutes la police a investi le bâtiment et arrêté tous les participants les emmenant dans des fourgons de police garés devant l'hôtel.

""La police a rempli la salle. Tous les députés ont été arrêtés et emmenés dans les commissariats"" a indiqué sur Facebook l'opposant Ilia Iachine accompagnant son post d'une photo de lui dans un fourgon de police. Selon des témoins et des vidéos diffusés par les médias russes les policiers reprochaient au forum d'être organisé par une organisation ""indésirable"" selon les termes d'une loi promulguée en 2015 par Vladimir Poutine.

Dans un communiqué la police de Moscou a de son côté indiqué avoir procédé à l'arrestation de 200 personnes assurant que le forum était organisé ""en violation des règles sanitaires et épidémiologiques"" et que ""parmi les participants figuraient les membres d'organisations aux activités indésirables sur le territoire russe"". L'ex-maire de Ekatérinbourg Ievguéni Roïzman ou l'opposant Vladimir Kara-Murza figurent parmi les personnes arrêtées tout comme plusieurs journalistes qui couvraient le forum.

""Les autorités ont peur""

Le forum - premier de ce genre en Russie - était organisé par les ""Démocrates unis"" un projet de Mikhaïl Khodorkovski qui vise à favoriser l'élection de députés indépendants aux scrutins locaux. ""Leur objectif est de nous intimider"" a dénoncé auprès de l'AFP Andreï Pivovarov responsable d'une autre organisation de Mikhaïl Khodorkovski Open Russia et qui faisait partie des organisateurs du forum. Depuis 2017 Open Russia fait partie des organisations étrangères actives en Russie considérées comme ""indésirables"" selon la loi controversée votée en 2015.

Sur Twitter Mikhaïl Khodorkovski s'est indigné de ces arrestations les jugeant ""anticonstitutionnelles"". L'équipe d'Alexeï Navalny a de son côté estimé que les raisons de l'annulation du forum étaient ""claires"": ""les autorités ont peur de toute concurrence lors des élections et intimident leurs opposants"". ""La cote du (parti au pouvoir) Russie unie est au plus bas et gagner les élections même truquées devient plus difficile"" ajoute l'équipe de l'opposant.

Les élections législatives de septembre 2021 arrivent en effet dans un contexte difficile pour le Kremlin Russie unie ayant connu d'inhabituels revers ces dernières années alors que la stagnation économique nourrit la grogne politique. Alexeï Navalny a été arrêté en janvier à son retour dans le pays après plusieurs mois de convalescence en Allemagne où il se remettait d'un empoisonnement pour lequel il accuse le Kremlin. Il a ensuite été condamné à deux ans et demi de prison tandis que son incarcération provoquait d'importantes manifestations auxquelles les autorités ont répondu par plus de 11.000 arrestations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGVwZWNoZS5mci8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL29zd2FsZG8tdW4tcGVyZS11bmUtYXNzb2NpYXRpb24tZXQtdW4tbGl2cmUtOTQyNDg1Ni5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fenouillet.

Le président de l’association nationale des commerçants et artisans (ANCA) Hadj Tahar Boulenouar s’est exprimé ce samedi sur la tension que connait l’huile de table ces derniers jours.

S’exprimant en marge de l’installation du bureau de wilaya de Sidi Bel-Abbès de l’association Boulenouar a évoqué les rasions de cette perturbation selon les acteurs de la filière.

Hadj Tahar Boulenouar a expliqué que « cette perturbation est due selon les producteurs à l’augmentation des coûts de la matière première en plus de l’obligation pour quelques opérateurs activant dans la distribution ou dans la production d’effectuer leurs transactions avec des factures ».

Assurant que « cette perturbation est provisoire et dans les semaines prochaines la situation se normalisera » le président de l’ANCA dont les propos ont été rapportés par l’agence officielle APS a indiqué que « les stocks d’huile de table sont suffisants pour répondre à la demande durant les prochaines semaines après la pénurie enregistrée dans quelques wilayas ».

Selon lui « malgré les quelques perturbations dans la distribution de l’huile dans certaines wilayas la matière première utilisée dans la production de l’huile de table est disponible ce qui permettra de garantir la couverture de la demande dans les prochaines semaines ».

Il a relevé : « Les perturbations dans la distribution de ce produit a touché quelques wilayas à l’instar de Sidi Bel-Abbes à l’ouest Skikda et Constantine à l’est. Toutefois selon les informations réunies auprès des producteurs et des importateurs de la matière première le stock d’huile est suffisant pour répondre à la demande ».

Abordant la question de la distribution des produits alimentaires durant le mois du ramadan Boulenouar indiqué que des mesures seront prises par le ministère du commerce pour garantir ces produits notamment ceux de large consommation et assurer la stabilité des prix des pommes de terre qui ont connu une augmentation durant ces dernières jours.

Dans ce sens il a rappelé que le ministère de l’agriculture et du développement rural a annoncé qu’il sera procédé au déstockage de pommes de terre des chambres froides en vue de sa commercialisation ce qui permettra de répondre à la demande et à stabiliser les prix en attendant le lancement de l’opération de récolte lors des prochaines semaines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0cy5mci9ydWdieS82LW5hdGlvbnMvcmVhY3Rpb24tcG9zaXRpdmUtZGUtZ2FsdGhpZS00Mzk2NjkuaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0cy5mci9ydWdieS82LW5hdGlvbnMvcmVhY3Rpb24tcG9zaXRpdmUtZGUtZ2FsdGhpZS00Mzk2NjkuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La réaction positive de Galthié,"En conférence de presse Fabien Galthié est revenu sur la défaite du XV de France face à l’Angleterre match durant laquelle l’entraîneur des Bleus a vu un « grand match » de son équipe qui doit repartir de l’avant pour affronter le pays de Galles.

La déception est bien évidemment au rendez-vous. Sur la pelouse de Twickenham le XV de France a une nouvelle fois vu la victoire lui échapper en toute fin de match. Mais Fabien Galthié l’a assuré en conférence de presse d’après-match « l’équipe a fait un grand match ». Toutefois l’entraîneur tricolore a concédé qu’« il y a ce dénouement il faut le digérer ». Le mot d’ordre du staff tricolore à la sortie de la pelouse est la fierté. « Globalement il y a de quoi être fier des joueurs de leur solidarité » ajoute l’ancien demi de mêlée. Mais sur le déroulement du match Fabien Galthié a convenu que les deux mi-temps ont eu des caractéristiques bien différentes avec une gestion de l’effectif qui semble avoir donné raison aux choix d’Eddie Jones.

« Il n’y a pas eu énormément de rugby sur la deuxième mi-temps. Autant la première avait été très rythmée autant la deuxième a été plus saccadée assure l’entraîneur des Bleus. Sur la fin ils ont réussi à chercher la victoire. On dira donc qu’ils ont mieux terminé. » Assurant que ses joueurs « terminent plutôt dans un bon état physiquement » le patron des Bleus ne voit pas de raison de dire que c’est « la gestion de la fin de match qui pose problème ».

Galthié: « Le goût de la défaite est différent »

Comme lors de l’édition 2020 du Tournoi des 6 Nations le XV de France a vu ses espoirs de Grand Chelem s’évanouir au sortir de la quatrième journée. Mais aux yeux de Fabien Galthié « c’est très différent » en raison du contexte des deux rencontres. « En Ecosse l’équipe avait joué à quatorze pendant cinquante minutes et avait terminé loin. Là on est devant jusqu’à trois ou quatre minutes de la fin tempère l’entraîneur des Bleus. Le goût de la défaite est différent. En termes d’expérience et de vécu c’est différent aussi. » Assurant qu’« il faut traverser les matchs » Fabien Galthié voit dans cette défaite une opportunité de « continuer à progresser ».

La question est maintenant de repartir de l’avant en vue du duel face au pays de Galles qui jouera le Grand Chelem samedi prochain sur la pelouse du Stade de France. « On va digérer ensemble ce résultat et basculer dès maintenant sur le pays de Galles. Ce match commence tout de suite assure un Fabien Galthié volontaire. Il dépend de notre capacité à partager et vivre ensemble la frustration pour se projeter sur le rendez-vous qui nous attend samedi prochain. » Face à des Gallois qui auront tout à jouer le XV de France aura à cœur d’effacer ce coup d’arrêt."

Author: Mel Sheehan

Rebecca Rose discusses her time as a student in the VCU History M.A. Program and her new role at the Library of Congress.

Views expressed in this interview belong to the individual and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Library of Congress.

Why did you choose VCU for your M.A.?

I was applying to masters programs and having to choose between them when COVID started. There were a few different programs I was looking at and I was emailing back and forth with Dr. Raymond at VCU and I just felt like “oh my gosh she’s so nice and so helpful.” She even put me in touch with students at VCU. It just made me feel that even though I couldn’t be on campus and meet professors everyone was willing to help me make that decision and give me as much information as I needed. Best choice I ever made.

What M.A. program did you do?

I did my master’s in history. It’s in history broadly but I focused on early Virginia history. I also got to take classes in all sorts of things which was just so much fun—like Russian history with Dr. Munro intellectual history with Dr. Bendersky and the Cold War with Dr. Ewing. My thesis was on a spy at Jamestown in the 17th century.

Why did you choose history?

Going into undergrad I knew I was going to be a history major. I can’t help it it just fascinates me. It’s what I am naturally interested in what I gravitate towards. It wasn’t necessarily a calculated decision like “History’s gonna be better for me than these other majors.” If I’m left to my own devices this is what I’m interested in.

What are your takeaways from the program?

Going back to how amazing the faculty is I’m still in touch with professors from VCU. That feeling of connection and those connections themselves are a takeaway. In addition to learning from them as professors VCU faculty have served as references and recommenders for me—I definitely owe where I am to the program and I’m so grateful. It’s actually Dr. Eastman who connected us to do this interview! When I was working on my thesis my wonderful advisor Dr. Meacham also put me in touch with a colleague in the English department who could help me read period documents. Dr. Eckhardt is the faculty sponsor for the Superscripts VCU’s student paleography (old handwriting) club. I still go to meetings and I encourage any history student at VCU who studies the early modern era to show up to a Superscripts meeting and learn to read what’s called “secretary hand.” Dr. Dickinson also stepped into the project without ever having met me and helped me make it to the finish line.

After graduating you landed a job at the Library of Congress. Why did you choose to work there?

After teaching high school U.S. history for a year I realized I hadn’t really given myself a chance to think about what else was out there. I thought “I just really owe it to myself to take some time see what else is out there and see how I can use my skills in the wider world.” I just started applying to a bunch of jobs and since I live in D.C. I was applying to a lot of federal jobs. I was drawn to working at the Library because I wanted a research job. I thought I wanted to work with the Congressional Research Service. They put together nonpartisan reports on various subjects for Congress. I thought that was perfect for a history major. I applied to every open job listing at the Library and I got an interview for my current job not really knowing what it was.

What is it like working there?

I work in Duplication Services which is on the business side of the library. We help customers who want a copy of a document or image that we have in the Library’s collection. These customers are not able to come into the library and look it up themselves for various reasons. For example I just filled an order for a customer in Japan and for that customer it was not feasible for them to come. Sometimes customers want a reproduction of an image for an exhibit or other project. What’s really cool about my job is that I get kind of a bird’s eye view of everything. I get to go collect incredible material from the Library’s different subject-matter reading rooms and learn about the collections in each of these places. It’s also really exciting to be working on Capitol Hill. The Library is three buildings; they’re all connected by underground tunnels to each other and to Congress.

How do you take what you learned from your M.A. and apply it to your job?

Having research skills is definitely helpful. It wasn’t a job requirement but having the lay of the land historically and being able to understand the context for what a customer has requested helps me. Historical orientation and having a love of primary sources is helpful. That’s all that I do all day—look at cool primary sources— it’s amazing. Supreme Court justices’ papers vintage Lego ads 18th century books about pirates even items from the Library’s Third Reich collection which are books that were confiscated from the Nazis and shipped to the U.S. after WWII.

If a student wanted to be in a similar line of work would you recommend the program you did or a different one?

If you’re going to get your master’s in history you should do it because you love it and you should be willing to be creative about how you’re going to use it in your career. Don’t do it in an instrumental way because you think doing this program is going to be the ticket that gets you into whatever career field. Do it because you really want to learn and you are really passionate about history.

What advice would you give to other M.A. students or undergrad students?

If anyone is looking for this kind of career track federal job applications take forever. I applied for this job in May 2023 and didn’t start working until November 2023. It takes a really long time. As with most job applications the whole process can be incredibly disheartening. You get rejected for reasons you can’t possibly fathom. You just gotta keep cranking the job applications out. Make good connections while you’re at VCU. Take advantage of being a student. Take a look at what internships are available. Reach out to people who work in places you want to work or do things you want to do; just ask to hear about what their path has been."

Parametric modeling is a newly developed modeling technique. It was originally used by architects to set up complex 3D models such as a canopy and a stadium roof with irregular curve forms. In order to quickly easily and precisely control the form of the structure computer programming was used as a tool allowing the designer to quickly and creatively generate the geometry. This technique has been gradually adopted by the structural engineers for the past few years.Major Players in This Report IncludePTC Inc.

Police body camera footage obtained by CNN affiliate KTRK shows a woman being arrested at a Galveston Texas bank after she refused to wear a mask or leave.

The arrest occurred Thursday the day after an order by Gov. Greg Abbott rolled back some of the state’s Covid-19 restrictions including the state’s mask mandate. Private business however are still allowed to require masks at their discretion.

The footage shows a police officer entering the Bank of America branch in Galveston and telling the woman the bank can refuse service to her if she won’t put on a mask. She insists she doesn’t have to and the officer tells her she will be arrested for “intruding on the premises” if she refuses to cooperate or leave the bank. Eventually the officer handcuffs her and removes her from the bank.

Terry White 65 told KTRK that she entered the bank without a mask and was asked by an employee if she had one. White replied “No thank you I don’t need one” and she was offered a mask by the employee.

When White refused the mask she said she was asked to leave.

“I said no I just want to close my account and then I’ll leave” she told KTRK. “(The employee) goes ‘Well if you’re not going to leave then I’m going to call the cops.’ I said ‘Well do what you have to do.’”

Galveston Mayor Craig Brown told CNN the woman was arrested on trespassing charges – “not on not wearing a mask.”

According to KTRK police said White was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest.

CNN has reached out to White but has not heard back. Neither the Galveston Police Department nor Bank of America have responded to requests for comment.

The body camera footage shows a Galveston police officer entering the bank and confronting the woman on Thursday telling her “Ma’am if they ask you to leave you have to leave.”

The woman tells the officer she’s trying to take her money out. The officer responds by telling her to which the officer says she still has to “abide by the rules.”

“Business have the right to refuse service even if you’re not wearing a mask. That’s their choice” the officer says.

“What are you going to do” she asks “arrest me?”

“Yes for intruding on the premises” the officer says. He tells the woman to step outside.

The woman insists she’s in a public place (“This is a private business” the officer says) and accuses the officer of “taking away people’s human rights.”

A brief struggle follows as the woman appears to initially resist while the officer starts to handcuff her. Soon she’s on the floor of the bank saying to other people inside the bank all of whom appear to be wearing masks “Police brutality people.”

“No” they say. “No it’s not.”

The officer takes the woman out of the bank. She says she thinks the officer broke her foot and the officer calls for emergency medical services. He places her in the back of a patrol car before the footage ends.

Reopening is a ‘delicate balance’ mayor says

In an interview Friday White told KTRK she traveled to Galveston in her recreational vehicle and was aware of the governor’s order lifting the mask mandate. KTRK reported that White was glad to have stood her ground and that she is “very opposed” to masks saying at one point “I won’t wear that diaper on my face.”

The order lifting the mask mandate has reignited the debate over face coverings in the state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Austin city leaders this week after they tried to maintain local mask requirements. On Friday a judge denied the state’s request for a temporary restraining order against the local mandate and pushed the injunction hearing back until March 26.

“Many of the businesses and restaurants and shopping areas here on the island are enforcing still or requesting that all their clients and customers wear masks” said Galveston Mayor Brown. “This particular incident was a lady that refused to do that the bank had said that’s their policy.”

“It’s a delicate balance” he added to maintain safety while places open up. “That’s why we still encourage everyone on our island to maintain social distancing and wear their mask.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2VuLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvbGF0ZXN0X25ld3MvMTYxNTcyMjEzNl8xODQxNTUuaHRtbNIBUWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2VuLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvbGF0ZXN0X25ld3MvMTYxNTcyMjEzNl8xODQxNTUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third stimulus check: when will Wells Fargo Chase Bank & Bank of America release it?,"After President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law on Thursday the IRS wasted no time in starting to disburse the first round of $1400 stimulus checks to some of the 160 million Americans entitled to the payment.

However some of the nation’s biggest banks say they will not be processing the payments this weekend instead announcing they will begin to do so on the 17 March.

While the official payment date for the $1400 stimulus checks has been established as 17 March the likes of Wells Fargo and Chase have faced heavy criticism for not releasing those payments already being deposited by the IRS this weekend.

Customers who are eligible to receive direct deposit of their stimulus payment may expect it as soon as March 17 2021. https://t.co/ujd9oUUWmP — Wells Fargo (@WellsFargo) March 12 2021

Stimulus check payments: Chase and Wells Fargo issue statements

""We expect that electronic stimulus payments will be available in eligible Chase accounts as soon as Wednesday March 17 2021"" Chase wrote on its website.

Meanwhile Wells Fargo tweeted: ""Customers who are eligible to receive direct deposit of their stimulus payment may expect it as soon as March 17 2021” emphasizing on its website that it would process the payments in line with effective date provided by the U.S. Treasury of 17 March.

To our understanding Bank of America has not issued a statement regarding when they will process the payments but it appears that many Bank of America customers on Twitter are complaining about their payments being withheld.

Some digital banks like Chime meanwhile have said they authorized their clients to have instant access to their payments. On Friday Chime issued a so-called ""stimmy alert"" on Twitter saying it had already distributed $600 million-worth of payments to its customers.

Millions of Chime members have received over $3B in stimulus payments and more are on the way. That’s up to 5 days earlier than most traditional bank accounts. We know that every day counts and Chime always has your back 💚 — Chime (@Chime) March 14 2021

Why are Chase and Wells Fargo withholding payments?

The banks are in their right to hold back on releasing the payments until the official 17 March payment date outlined by the US Treasury. But why have these big banks not made an effort to start disbursing those payments that have already been transferred by the IRS – as has been the case with digital banks like Chime?

According to the Huffington Post part of the reason is because Chase and Wells Fargo are set to gain from delaying the processing of payments at the expense of their customers who are eagerly awaiting the money.

""Sluggish check processing only works to banks' advantage because of the increased 'float' created by a massive influx of government cash. They can juggle the delays to boost outgoing loans to other customers and to boost their profits"" the HuffPost noted.

How to track the payment status of your stimulus check

The IRS Track My Payment Tool is now available for this latest third round of stimulus payments allowing you to check the status of your $1400 check. Up until early Sunday morning the Tool was only available for tracking the status of the previous $1200 and $600 payments but it has now been updated by the IRS to give information on these latest payments approved under the American Rescue Plan.

""Get My Payment updates once per day usually overnight...Previous payment information is no longer available in Get My Payment"" the IRS says. ""The first batch of payments will be sent by direct deposit which some recipients started receiving as early as March 12. Additional batches of payments will be sent in the coming weeks by direct deposit and through the mail as a check or debit card.""

Body camera footage released by Galveston Police shows officers confronting 65-year-old Terry Wright inside a Bank of America branch on Thursday. The footage shows an officer trying to get Wright to leave the bank at least five times because she refused to follow their mask policy.

“If they ask you to leave you have to leave” said the officer in the footage.

“My money is in this bank and I’m going to take it out” Wright replied.

Wright invoked the state’s lifted mandate amid her frustration over being told to wear a mask inside the bank but the officer reminded her that businesses can refuse service to anyone that does not comply with their masking policies which Gov. Greg Abbott allowed.

Wright pushed back against the officer’s instructions and the confrontation escalated with her raising her voice at other bank customers. The incident then became physical and Wright was taken to the ground during her arrest on charges of resisting arrest and criminal trespass.

Officers say she sustained minor injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Wright who is on a bucket-list trip across the country in a recreational vehicle says she was aware of the statewide mask mandate rollback. She also says when she walked into the bank she was asked to wear a mask and refused.

“I’ve been traveling all over Texas and I’ve never had an issue with not wearing a mask and I knew the governor just poo-pooed it” Wright said.

She says she does not believe in the COVID-19 pandemic and there is nothing she would have done differently.

“My civil right is not to wear a diaper on my face and that’s how I feel about it” Wright said.

Galveston Police issued a statement saying the department is not enforcing mask-wearing. It said the department was responding to a call from the bank for criminal trespass on the property.

“What are you gonna do arrest me?” she replies.

“Yes for intruding on premises” he says.

He cuffs her.

“Police brutality right here people” she declares.

“No…no it’s not” a chorus of other bank customers can be heard saying. She calls them “a bunch of sheep.”

White who accused the arresting officer of breaking her foot was taken to a hospital for treatment.

She faces charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest although refusing to wear a mask on its own is not a crime in Texas under Abbott’s latest directive.

Bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket. The cryptocurrency surpassed $60000 on Saturday to hit a new high just a few weeks after it topped $50000.

Bitcoin (XBT) smashed through the $30000 and $40000 levels over a few days in January. Bitcoin (XBT)s in circulation are worth more than $1 trillion.

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled so far this year up 107% from the December 31 closing price of $28987.60. Investors are excited that Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) said in February it owns $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla (TSLA) also has said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.

That sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash. Software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been actively buying bitcoin.

Top financial firms are helping to validate bitcoin. Payments giants Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are also embracing cryptocurrencies.

BlackRock (BLK) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK) have started to dabble in bitcoin as well.

Investors have been flocking to bitcoin because of the perception that it could be a good hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar if bond yields continue to rise.

Bitcoin bulls argue that the cryptocurrency is like “digital gold” and could even replace the yellow metal as the inflation antidote of choice. To that end bitcoin has surged this year while gold has fallen.

Inflation fears have returned now that President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. There are concerns about whether that much money is really needed.

Some worry that stimulus may cause the economy to overheat and lead to much higher inflation. After all there are now multiple Covid-19 vaccines and more people are returning to work which should boost the economy – and bitcoin prices.

Bitcoin has benefited from investors’ recognition that the cryptocurrency is scarcer than gold or other precious metals.

That’s because there is a cap of just 21 million bitcoins built into the cryptocurrency’s source code available to be mined – the process of using computers or servers to solve complex math problems to generate bitcoin. Roughly 18.6 million bitcoins are in circulation.

Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency getting a boost. Smaller digital currencies such as ethereum litecoin and stellar have soared in 2021.

The optimism about cryptocurrencies has boosted shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot Blockchain (RIOT) Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Hive (HVBTF).

And cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase which has filed to list its shares directly later this year is one of 2021’s most eagerly awaited stock market debuts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzA0LzYwMl8zMDU0NzEuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMwNTQ3MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin passes $60000 for first time,"A Bitcoin ATM sign is pictured in a bodega in the Manhattan borough of New York City New York U.S. February 9 2021. REUTERS-Yonhap



Bitcoin passed the $60000 mark for the first time on Saturday with analysts saying the giant US stimulus package helped boost the world's most popular virtual currency on its record-breaking run.



The cryptocurrency hit $60197 at 1234 GMT and continued to hover around $60000 according to the website CoinMarketCap.



Bitcoin has tripled in value over the last three months ― it was worth $20000 in December ― bolstered by increasing backing from corporate heavyweights.



Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said that in recent days ""Bitcoin went up as investors looked to the imminent arrival of stimulus cheques"".



Individuals in the US earning up to $75000 will receive a cheque for $1400 from this weekend after President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan into law this week.



Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise since March last year when it stood at $5000 spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would allow account holders to use cryptocurrency.



Last month Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the virtual unit while Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and rap mogul Jay-Z said they are creating a fund aimed at making Bitcoin ""the internet's currency"".



Others jumping on the bandwagon include Wall Street player BNY Mellon investment fund giant BlackRock and credit card titan Mastercard.



Bitcoin which was launched back in 2009 hit the headlines in 2017 after soaring from less than $1000 in January to almost $20000 in December of the same year.



The virtual bubble then burst in subsequent days with bitcoin's value fluctuating wildly before sinking below $5000 by October 2018.



However the last year's rise has been more steady with investors and Wall Street finance giants wooed by dizzying growth the opportunity for profit and asset diversification and a safe store of value to guard against inflation.



Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.



The system requires massive computer processing power in order to manage and implement transactions.



That power is provided by ""miners"" who do so in the hope they will receive new bitcoins for validating transaction data. (AFP)

Bitcoin crossed a record high of $60000 on Saturday morning continuing its rally as major companies and financial institutions adopt cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin the world's biggest cryptocurrency was at $60415.34 as of 7:25 a.m. ET according to Coinbase recovering from a dip at the end of February that followed a previous record high that month.

The digital currency is up 963% over the last 12 months according to Coinbase. Its value surpassed $1 trillion last week for the second time this year.

Bitcoin's rally is driven partly by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms and speculative demand. Tesla has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and plans to accept the digital coin as payment for its products a decision that sparked more widespread interest.",,,,,,

""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video . ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

It's no secret that celebrities spend a lot of time preparing for the Met Gala whether it's going through hair and makeup trials or eating a specialized diet . Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Jessica Biel attended the Met Gala for the first time since 2013.

The actor showed up on the steps of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City wearing a pink Tamara Ralph gown with a deep neckline and separated sleeves that was adorned with tiny jewels and petals to comply with “The Garden of Time” theme.

This year she appeared without her husband Justin Timberlake as the singer was performing in San Jose California that night.

To prepare for fashion’s biggest night Biel showed a sneak peek of what she does the night before revealing that she specifically bathes in 20 pounds of Epsom salt.

The day of the Met Gala the 7th Heaven actress took to TikTok to show viewers her prep routine. “I know some people like to party before Met Ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that” her video began.

“This is what I do to get ready for Met Ball.”

She then showed multiple large bags of Epsom salt sitting on the edge of a bathtub counting out how many pounds she had in total. “Four eight 12 16 20 pounds of Epsom salt in a bath” Biel said. “Here we go for real.”

After pouring all of the bags into the bathwater the actress clarified that she makes the water “as hot as you can take it”.

“30 minute soak night before” Biel continued. “[Drink] tonnes of water then and off to bed early. See you tomorrow Met Ball.”

“While the kids are out partying I am in soaking” she reiterated in the caption.

After posting her TikTok went on to receive over one million views with many people questioning what benefits she was receiving from using that much Epsom salt especially considering the recommended amount is usually not even one bag let alone five.

According to the Cleveland Health Clinic an Epsom salt bath with 1.25 cups has the ability to provide stress relief relax muscle pain and reduce any inflammation.

“The way she didn’t explain the benefits of using that much is a crime” one comment read before assuming the salt removes water weight.

“Not me wondering if two cups twice the recommended amount was overkill” another commenter questioned.

“I panicked once because I used five cups instead of the recommended four” a second commenter said about the quantity.

“It’s two cups per gallon. Maybe she has a big ol bathtub!” one commenter suggested for why Biel used such a large amount.

Other commenters pointed out how expensive it is to use that much Epsom salt.

“Girl cost of living doesn’t even afford us table salt these days let alone bags of Epsom Salts” one person commented while another wrote: “In this economy?!”

Biel’s last appearance at the Met Gala was 11 years ago when the theme was “PUNK: Chaos to Couture.”

She had worn a strapless black Giambattista Valli gown with a knitted pair of matching pants and black leather pumps. To embody the punk theme even further she showed up with a nose ring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9taWRjb2FzdC9taWRjb2FzdC1ob3VzaW5nL3RoZS11cHRvd24tY2luZW1hLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1idWlsZGluZy1iYXRoLWpvYW00MHprMHcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New 60-unit apartment building opens at site of former Bath cinema,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/05/07/midcoast/midcoast-housing/the-uptown-cinema-apartment-building-bath-joam40zk0w/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9taWRjb2FzdC9taWRjb2FzdC1ob3VzaW5nL3RoZS11cHRvd24tY2luZW1hLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1idWlsZGluZy1iYXRoLWpvYW00MHprMHcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

You might call Brittany Timko Baxter the ultimate soccer mom.

While her two children Zoe and Johnny aren’t yet old enough to require her chauffeur services to get to practices and games or her culinary skills to slice oranges for halftime snacks she is a two-time hall of famer.

Recently Timko Baxter joined the Coquitlam Sports Hall of Fame just over a year after she was inducted into the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame.

They’re honours Timko Baxter hopes will serve as examples for her own kids as well as the tens of thousands of girls and young women who already play the sport. They’re also accolades she never dreamed of when she was five years old knocking the ball around on the grass behind Parkland elementary school not far from her parents’ home.

That’s when Timko Baxter told her mom she wanted to become a professional soccer player. She said she had no idea how to achieve that goal or what pro opportunities might be out there for women but 30 years later she has attained her wish and more.

Timko Baxter graduated from a successful high school career at Centennial secondary to play 71 matches with the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers where she scored 41 goals. She was also on Canada’s national U19 team earning the Golden Shoe award as the top scorer in the 2004 FIFA U19 world championship in Edmonton.

Timko Baxter played for Canada in two Olympics winning a bronze medal in 2012 in London. She got gold at the 2011 Pan American Games soccer tournament and she played in two FIFA Women’s World Cups in 2007 and 2011. All told she played 132 matches for Canada’s senior women’s team and scored five goals.

Along the way Timko Baxter also played professionally with clubs in Australia Sweden Germany and finally the Seattle Sounders Women team of the W-League for a season until she retired in 2014.

Timko Baxter said the successes of players like Andrea Neil Charmaine Hooper and Amy Walsh showed her there was a path forward in soccer for young women. Now she added that responsibility falls to her.

Timko Baxter said the sport has come a long way.

“But there’s still room to grow” she added.

While international tournaments like the Olympics and World Cup have become showcases for women’s soccer that can sell out 60000-seat stadiums and draw worldwide television audiences Timko Baxter said professional opportunities for women players to actually earn a decent living are still few and far between.

Soccer’s gender gap is narrowing though.

Timko Baxter pointed to the accolades for her former teammate Burnaby’s Christine Sinclair that recognized her achievement as soccer’s greatest scorer while barely mentioning her gender. She said more attention like that will open even greater opportunities for the next generation of girls and young women playing the sport.

“For most people if they’re a fan of soccer they cheer whether it’s men or women” Timko Baxter said adding the higher profile and greater acceptance of elite women’s soccer has trickled down to the community level as well with better coaching more programs and greater opportunity to develop.

That bodes well for her daughter and even her son should they choose to play the sport Timko Baxter said.

“What I want them to learn is the life skills they can take from any sport” she said. “At the end we’ll all stop playing but it’s what you learn from the sport that you carry on with you for the rest of your life.”

On Friday the Internal Revenue Service confirmed that $1400 stimulus checks will officially start to go out on Wednesday March 17. But some taxpayers will start to see those payments before that official date.

“Some Americans may see the direct deposit payments as pending or as provisional payments in their accounts before the official payment date of March 17” the IRS wrote in a statement on Friday.

Similar to past rounds taxpayers will be able to track their third stimulus payment on the “Get My Payment” portal on the IRS.gov website.

“The payments will be delivered automatically to taxpayers even as the IRS continues delivering regular tax refunds. We urge people to visit IRS.gov for the latest details on the stimulus payments other new tax law provisions and tax season updates” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig wrote in statement on Friday.

The $1.9 trillion package signed into law by President Joe Biden this week will send a $1400 stimulus check to single filers earning up to $75000 or a $2800 check to couples filing jointly earning up to $150000. Taxpayers earning above that level could still get a reduced check however no payments will be sent to single filers earnings above $80000 or couples earning jointly above $160000. Income is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI) found in your most recent tax filing

“The third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIP3) will be based on the taxpayer’s latest processed tax return from either 2020 or 2019.

Aldi is one of the best supermarkets around for budget shoppers.

I've already compiled a review of the grocer's best snacks so I wanted to dive into another category of popular products: breakfast foods.

The items I taste-tested fell into four distinct categories — breads frozen foods yogurts and hearty grains — so on top of reviewing the products based on whether I'd buy them again I also chose my favorite from each grouping.

Read on to learn which of these breakfast items I wouldn't buy again and which were my favorites.

Note: As you might see in my haul photo I originally planned to review Aldi's apple-cider doughnuts and blueberry muffins but I bought them too early before this taste test and they ended up going a bit stale. I didn't think it was fair to review them when they weren't at their best.

I kicked off the breads with the 'knock your sprouts off' 7-grain variety

Aldi's sprouted seven-grain bread. Lucien Formichella for Insider

As far as seven-grain sprouted bread goes this was very respectable — especially with a nice slab of butter.

It was relatively smooth and the grains all mix nicely unlike some other brands that seem to just sprinkle everything on top.

I topped a toasted slice with some butter. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This bread had solid structural integrity making it perfect for sunny-side-up eggs. To be fair though I think everything is perfect with sunny-side-up eggs.

It didn't have a robust flavor and it really just tasted like the ""good decision"" your parents wanted you to make for breakfast.

Verdict: I might not buy this again but I probably should.

Aldi's marbled cinnamon bread was like dessert for breakfast

Aldi's cinnamon breakfast bread. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This bread was nearly perfect with a hefty pat of butter.

It reminded me of a raisin swirl bread even though there weren't any raisins in it. It was quite chewy which I enjoyed and not overpoweringly sweet.

Advertisement

It could almost be a dessert if you added some extra cinnamon sugar but I loved how the light flavors blended in with the heavy bread.

I accidentally toasted the slice too long. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This burned quickly because of the sugar but it should be consumed lightly toasted so you can actually experience the flavors.

Verdict: I probably shouldn't buy this one again but absolutely would.

I was pretty impressed by the gluten-free cinnamon-raisin bagels

Aldi's gluten-free cinnamon-raisin bagels. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was one of the better gluten-free bagels I've eaten partly because the bread didn't taste like anything.

The main flavors were toasty raisins and melted butter and there was a nice texture — a little coarse but quite sturdy.

It tasted better with peanut butter than with butter. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This bagel was fairly solid on its own but it was elevated with a little peanut butter.

Verdict: I would absolutely buy these again.

The gluten-free plain bagels were perfectly fine

Aldi's plain gluten-free bagels. Lucien Formichella for Insider

There wasn't as big of a flavor drop-off from raisin to plain as I expected though the raisin was still superior.

Advertisement

Once again I was pleasantly surprised by this bagel's fluffy quality something most gluten-free products lack.

The texture was pretty much identical to the cinnamon-raisin variety. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was respectable but unexciting — a true neutral the water of the breakfast world.

It wouldn't make a sandwich more enjoyable but it would work as the vehicle that carries sumptuous fillings into your mouth.

Verdict: If they're out of the raisin version I'd buy these.

I would definitely use the brioche bagels for sandwiches

Aldi's brioche bagels. Lucien Formichella for Insider

There was a fluffy quality to these bagels that I immensely enjoyed and they soaked up the butter really well.

Even toasted most bread isn't this airy. But the natural buttery flavor of the brioche came through more when it was untoasted.

Like the gluten-free bagel I think this could be better utilized as the sandwich base.

The bagels were pretty buttery on their own. Lucien Formichella for Insider

Verdict: This was quite good but I'm spoiled for choice. I would buy again if I had a deep hankering for brioche.

The sweet smell of the maple French-toast bagel was stronger than its flavor

Aldi's maple French-toast bagels. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I loved the lightness in the center of this bagel. Again I think you could make a case for this being better untoasted.

The sweetness was a little more understated than the delightful toasted-maple smell would have you believe. I felt like it could get a bit lost in the shuffle if it were part of a larger dish.

The flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be. Lucien Formichella for Insider

It's that kind of in-between flavor where you would really need to top it with the right things to bring it out. Oddly enough I could see this mixing well with honey ham and sharp cheddar.

Verdict: It was delightful and I'd buy it again but only if I was really craving it.

It was tough to pick a favorite bread but the gluten-free cinnamon-raisin bagel reigned supreme

The cinnamon-raisin bagels were the top for me. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was the toughest category to choose a winner for.

If I was going exclusively by taste I'd have to pick the marbled cinnamon breakfast bread. Since I'm also considering how I felt a few hours after consuming this bread I'm picking the gluten-free cinnamon-raisin bagels.

They were tasty enough and didn't lead to a sugar crash.

On to the frozen section and the meat-lovers breakfast bowl was just OK

Aldi's meat-lovers frozen breakfast bowl. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was college-cafeteria-level good meaning it's not as bad as some people might say but it's still not great.

Advertisement

It needed pepper and I don't think I would reach for it on a lazy Sunday.

The sausage was surprisingly juicy but it was offset by hard potatoes and factory eggs.

This bowl was a little underwhelming. Lucien Formichella for Insider

One of the issues with the dish was the sodium levels. The eggs and potatoes were under-seasoned and yet overall it felt like drinking from the Dead Sea.

As usual the processed cheese held this entire thing together and I would have liked more.

Advertisement

This certainly wasn't my favorite thing on the list but it was firmly in the ""not bad"" category. I think it's an OK breakfast for anybody running out the door in the morning who doesn't have time to make real bacon and eggs.

Verdict: This is a good breakfast option to have on hand for emergency situations.

The sausage-and-gravy breakfast bowl beat out the meat-lovers variety

Aldi's sausage-and-gravy frozen breakfast bowl. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I'm a gravy snob so I consciously didn't hold this to my usual standards but it was surprisingly solid.

The texture wasn't right at all but it still tasted fine.

Advertisement

I was very skeptical of the frozen gravy. Lucien Formichella for Insider

To me this was slightly better than the meat-lovers bowl but it had the same under-seasoned potatoes and eggs.

The difference here was the gravy which had a surprisingly full flavor even though it felt like a bunch of flour was dumped in it to stretch it out.

Verdict: I'd buy it. This is a solid meal to throw in the microwave while you're getting ready to run out the door.

The original French-toast sticks were pretty good for a quick frozen meal

Aldi's frozen French-toast sticks. Lucien Formichella for Insider

When you make French toast you want to let that bread soak in the batter before you start cooking. These tasted like they were just passed under a batter faucet and quickly slapped on the griddle.

Advertisement

Biting into the middle just tasted like toasty bread.

The syrup made them more enjoyable. Lucien Formichella for Insider

That problem aside these were quite good.

There was just enough of a cinnamon taste to make me want more. My fear was that I wouldn't be able to put syrup on overly sweet sticks but that wasn't the case here.

Verdict: There's no way I'd ever pick this over homemade or diner French toast but it's an excellent time-crunch option.

The cinnamon French-toast sticks tasted too bitter

Related stories

I didn't actually taste a major difference between the two French-toast options.

My brain initially told me to say the cinnamon was better because it had more flavor but then I realized ""more"" wasn't always better.

There was too much cinnamon on these sticks. Lucien Formichella for Insider

There was a slightly bitter aftertaste. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the quality of cinnamon but it was off-putting enough to make me rank the original higher.

Verdict: I probably wouldn't buy this one again.

The homestyle frozen waffles weren't my favorite but there's nothing wrong with them

Aldi's classic frozen waffles. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was about as good as frozen waffles get — crunchy on the top and moist and soft on the inside.

That said it's tough to compare this to other frozen waffles because they all have the same general qualities. I thought it was a manageable size and had an enjoyable consistency.

There wasn't much to say about these good or bad. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I don't think it was the best frozen item or even better than the original French-toast stick but this is a safe call.

Verdict: I'd probably buy these again but only on a whim. They'd never make the official shopping list.

Surprisingly the sausage-and-gravy bowl was my favorite of the frozen bunch

The sausage-and-gravy bowl took me by surprise. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I think the sausage and gravy was my favorite item here because it was the only really enjoyable one that didn't lead to a sugar crash by noon.

But in the end pretty much any of them would make a decent last-minute breakfast.

I started the next category with the coconut-flavored tilt-style yogurt

Aldi's coconut-flavored yogurt with toppings. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I enjoyed this but it left a somewhat empty feeling. I think it came down to my dislike of low-fat yogurt which has an unsatisfying lightness that ultimately doesn't do anything for me.

This is the type of snack I finish and wonder where it went. Personally I'd rather eat less full-fat yogurt than more low-fat yogurt.

Advertisement

I wish there was more of the toppings. Lucien Formichella for Insider

The tangy coconut flavor in the yogurt was delightful. I also liked the toasted almonds and coconut shavings but there just weren't enough of them.

Weirdly the chocolate chips didn't quite mesh for me.

Verdict: Ultimately I wouldn't buy it again.

The key-lime tilt-style yogurt had a bigger flavor punch

Aldi's key lime-flavored yogurt with toppings. Lucien Formichella for Insider

The tangy key-lime flavor was so smooth here — though I prefer my key-lime pie to have a real pucker to it.

Advertisement

The graham cracker mixed super well with the yogurt and right away I could tell this was way better than the coconut version.

The white chocolate was kind of the star here. Lucien Formichella for Insider

Ultimately both tilt-style yogurts suffer from the same issue: being low-fat.

Ironically the white chocolate helped to thicken it a little but that's the closest I've ever come to enjoying white chocolate — largely because most of the flavor was masked by the lime and graham cracker.

Verdict: I am more likely to buy this one than the coconut but still not likely.

The honey-vanilla Greek yogurt would make an indulgent morning meal

Aldi's honey-vanilla Greek yogurt. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was a delicious versatile yogurt.

The flavors were subtle but powerful and I could see it being eaten with granola or in a nice smoothie.

I think you could use this as the base of a good breakfast. Lucien Formichella for Insider

Where the non-fat yogurt was deficient in satisfaction quality this left me full and happy.

Verdict: I would absolutely buy this again.

Advertisement

I actually liked the plain honey Greek yogurt a little better

Aldi's honey-flavored Greek yogurt. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was pretty much the same as the honey-vanilla flavor but I think it was a little more enjoyable.

I liked this even better than the vanilla variety. Lucien Formichella for Insider

The vanilla one had a slightly smoother texture but the honey contributed to a stronger flavor.

Verdict: Both Greek-yogurt options were delightful and you couldn't go wrong buying either.

It was a close call but the honey Greek yogurt took home the prize in its category

The honey Greek yogurt was the best of the bunch. Lucien Formichella for Insider

The indulgent honey Greek yogurt was — by a small margin — the best of this bunch.

It's really tough to find new and exciting things to say about yogurt but I'll definitely be adding it to my Aldi list.

The hearty grain category was off to a good start with the pumpkin seed-and-flax granola cereal

Aldi's pumpkin seed-and-flax granola cereal. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was quite good though the pumpkin wasn't deserving of the banner spot in the name.

There was a nice crisp honey flavor and the toasty oats made me feel like I was eating breakfast in a log cabin.

I could see this falling into the category of cereals that I absent-mindedly eat a handful of when I'm bored.

Advertisement

I was surprised by how much I liked this cereal. Lucien Formichella for Insider

As expected it was even better when I added a little bit of the Greek yogurt which helped soften the crunchy granola a little bit.

Verdict: This was a delightful breakfast and a refreshing mid-afternoon snack that I would definitely buy again.

The coconut-chia granola cereal was better with yogurt

Aldi's coconut-chia granola cereal. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This is another solid granola with the same toasty crunchy oats.

The coconut flavor wasn't much more than a hint but thankfully the honey flavor added a nice balance.

Advertisement

This flavor wasn't as exciting. Lucien Formichella for Insider

Here added yogurt enhanced the overall flavor. But it also negated the coconut a bit.

This was quite a delicious snack and the grains worked exceptionally well with the yogurt.

Verdict: I'd buy this again but not over the pumpkin-seed variety.

The pumpkin-spice instant oatmeal was pretty sweet on its own

Aldi's pumpkin-spice instant oatmeal. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This was a pretty good bowl of oatmeal.

Advertisement

It honestly didn't need the drizzle of syrup I added which made it a little too sweet.

There certainly was a strong pumpkin flavor and I detected some cinnamon as well.

The real enjoyment here was the smooth buttery quality of the prepared oats that tied everything together.

I wish there was more in the pouch. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I'm always disappointed with the amount that comes in a single instant-oatmeal packet but this was an excellent breakfast even if it was a little too sugary for my personal taste.

Advertisement

Verdict: I would buy this again but I'd refrain from adding any extra sweetener.

The cranberry-flax instant oatmeal had a nice balanced flavor

Aldi's cranberry-flax instant oatmeal. Lucien Formichella for Insider

I was a little disappointed there weren't giant cranberries floating around in the packet like on the box but I got past it pretty quickly.

This had a bit more balance than the pumpkin-spice flavor and the cranberries added a burst of sweetness that wasn't overpowering.

I think both instant oatmeals would taste good together. Lucien Formichella for Insider

This flavor didn't need maple syrup either though it paired better here than in the pumpkin-spice oatmeal.

Advertisement

Verdict: I'd buy this again and I can see myself mixing a packet of each flavor together.

There's no doubt in my mind that the pumpkin seed-and-flax granola was the best of the grains

The pumpkin seed-and-flax granola was the clear favorite. Lucien Formichella for Insider

The pumpkin seed-and-flax granola cereal was a clear winner here though part of the reason is that it went so well with the yogurt.

It's rare to describe something that comes from a box as succulent but that's the word that comes to mind.

More importantly it did what any great breakfast should: left me feeling full but not bloated.

Overall you can't really go wrong with most of Aldi's breakfast offerings

The items on this list are all pretty unique so I don't think it's possible to choose one as my ultimate top-pick.

That said I really enjoyed the pumpkin granola and honey yogurt combination. It was the option that I found myself craving most after trying everything else.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL3Rha2UteW91ci1zb3VuZC1vbi10aGUtZ28td2l0aC1vbmUtb2YtdGhlc2UtMTItYmx1ZXRvb3RoLXNwZWFrZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take your sound on the go with one of these $12 Bluetooth speakers,"I'm subjected to a seemingly endless parade of inexpensive Bluetooth speakers. I see occasional deals for as little as $10 and while none of them are audiophile quality they mostly all sound ""good enough"" for playing background music around the house in the backyard or hanging out with a couple of vaccinated friends. Sometimes a speaker will surprise me with how many cool features it has. Like the Zoeetree Wireless Bluetooth Speaker which usually sells for $20 and has True Wireless Stereo a microSD slot and even an FM radio built in. Right now you can get the Zoeetree Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for just $12 when you apply promo code Z46WNSKF at checkout.

Don't expect a lot of fancy styling. This is a generic brick-shaped speaker with a row of push-button controls on top. But it has a microSD slot (which Zoeetree refers to as a TF card slot which is a name that's technically accurate but used so rarely that it looks weird when you see it on a product like this) for playing music without your phone. The FM radio gives you another phone-free music option.

If you like you can buy a pair of these speakers ($24 with the discount) and use the TWS connection mode to turn them into left and right stereo speakers. Zoeetree promises about 12 hours of battery life on a single charge. It has a 4.2-star rating on Amazon with a solid rating from Fakespot; this looks like a solid deal all around.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is the top-of-the-line 60 Series card from the RTX 20 generation. It was a nice improvement over the RTX 2060 bringing in more memory — 8GB vs. the 6GB on the RTX 2060 — as well as a wider memory bus. It's a solid 1080p GPU and also does better at 1440p than the RTX 2060. For Still good enough for 1080p gaming

Higher memory bandwidth Against Slightly higher power consumption

Limited availability NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 $259.99 at Amazon $259.99 at Newegg $389.99 at Best Buy Cheapest RTX 30 pick

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is currently the cheapest RTX 30 graphics card you can buy right now and a decent entry into ray tracing. It performs well at 1080p and can do some 1440p gaming. It outperforms the RTX 2060 SUPER but the performance gap is quite thin. The RTX 3060 also doesn't offer a great price-to-performance ratio like its elder siblings and has a very limited availability right now. For Good 1080p performance

12 GB GDDR6 memory

HDMI 2.1 Against Not the best value for money

Limited stock

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the new RTX kid on the block. It's an entry-level peek into the world of ray tracing and currently the most affordable of the RTX 30 GPUs. While it offers some performance boost over the RTX 2060 SUPER it's definitely not worthy of being an upgrade. The availability and pricing issues combined with the thin performance gap mean that you should just stick to your RTX 2060 SUPER. Let's take a deeper look at why.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: Specs

Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)

Being from a newer generation the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 does have some improvements in comparison to the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 2060 SUPER uses the same TU106 GPU as we saw in the RTX 2060 which was made with the 12nm TSMC process. In contrast the RTX 3060 houses the Ampere GA106 GPU which is made using Samsung's 8nm process. This gives it an edge with transistor count with 13.25 billion transistors against the RTX 2060 SUPER's 10.8 billion transistors. Let's look at the specifications of the two cards.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Category NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Shader (CUDA) Cores 3584 2176 Core Clock 1320MHz 1470MHz Boost Clock 1780MHz 1650MHz Memory 12GB GDDR6192-bit bus width 8 GB GDDR6256-bit bus width Memory Clock 15Gbps 14Gbps Memory Bandwidth 360GB/s 448GB/s RT Cores 28 34 Tensor Cores 112 272 Transistors 13.25 billion 10.8 billion Node Samsung 8nm TSMC 12nm FFN Architecture Ampere Turing TDP 170W 175 W Ports 1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4a 1 x HDMI 2.0b2 x DisplayPort 1.41 x DVI1 x USB C Power Connector 1 x 8 pin 1 x 8 pin

Note: Some specifications of the RTX 3060 and the RTX 2060 SUPER like the ports may vary as per AIB models.

Despite the transistor count difference the RTX 2060 SUPER has a few advantages. First off the RT core count on the RTX 2060 SUPER is higher than that on the RTX 3060. Additionally the total memory bandwidth on the RTX 2060 SUPER is also higher. This means the RTX 3060 is not as more powerful than the RTX 2060 SUPER as it could have been. Let's look at the performance of the two cards.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: Real-world performance

Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)

The real-world performance comparisons of the two cards will vary depending on how the AIB variants are configured. The RTX 2060 SUPER is a beefed-up version of 2060 to begin with but the overclock variants of the card will be able to shrink the performance gap even more especially in comparison to the normal RTX 3060. Let's take a look at the performance comparison between the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 12GB XC and GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER 8GB courtesy of the YouTube channel Benchmark.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Game RTX 3060 (avg. FPS 1440p) RTX 2060 SUPER (avg. FPS 1440p) Cyberpunk 2077 43 39 Shadow of the Tomb Raider 76 69 Watch Dogs: Legion 49 46 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 94 86 Red Dead Redemption 2 66 59 Assassin's Creed: Valhalla 54 50 Horizon Zero Dawn 65 59

As the numbers show the performance gap is very very thin. The RTX 3060 is a decent purchase on its own and it does manage to output some decent figures at 1440p close to the 60 FPS mark. While it doesn't quite hit the 1440p 144 FPS figure it's still a decent performer for the price given you can find a decently-priced AIB card.

However the RTX 2060 SUPER isn't too far behind. While the benchmark shows 1440p Ultra figures the 1080p performance will show margins that are very similar. The RTX 3060 is only a small step up from the RTX 2060 SUPER and it gives a single-digit FPS gain. There's very little intensive to sell your RTX 2060 SUPER and pick up an RTX 3060.

The RTX 2060 SUPER is still a solid 1080p GPU and as far as ray tracing performance goes it will take you nearly as far as the RTX 3060 does. The card isn't due for an upgrade yet and an upgrade to the new base 60 series card is probably the smallest GPU upgrade you can get right now.

So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 from RTX 2060 SUPER?

No. The RTX 3060 is a decent entry-level RTX card no doubt but it's the farthest thing from being a logical upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 3060 is also plagued by the same stock and pricing issues as any new piece of silicon right now which means you'll have a tough time getting your hands on one anyway.

Even if you manage to find one in stock the AIB model prices are expected to cost you way too much to justify such a small upgrade. The logical upgrade would be something like the RTX 3070 which is a great 1440p card that hits higher frame rates at that resolution as we noted in our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review.

The RTX 2060 series cards are also in heavy demand right now like all the best graphics cards. The card is a sweet spot for RTX GPUs so much so that NVIDIA itself is bringing them back to fill out the gaps in its RTX lineup that have been widened due to the GPU shortage. If you're still pressed for an upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER and can grab an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU at a reasonable price you can look at the higher tier cards in the RTX 30 series. If you're not planning a major upgrade however then it makes sense to keep that RTX 2060 SUPER which is a solid graphics card to own right now.

Last-gen 60 series elite NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Check Amazon See at Amazon Solid last-gen performer

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is the last-gen entry-level RTX card and while it's no miracle-worker it holds up well. It does an okay job at 1080p and gives a peek into the ray tracing goodness. As such it's not due for such a small upgrade as the RTX 3060 and worth owning right now barring a big planned system upgrade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC9yZXZpZXdlZGNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L3BhdGlvLWZ1cm5pdHVyZS1nZXQtZm91ci1waWVjZS1zZWF0aW5nLXNldC1qdXN0LXVuZGVyLTE1MC80NjkyOTMwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patio furniture: Get this 4-piece seating set for just under $150,"Arielle Tschinkel

If you’re looking to invest in cryptocurrencies finding a good and credible crypto exchange will be critical to your success. This article will learn about the best and most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges to buy sell and trade cryptocurrencies. We will also highlight the five best and most recognized crypto exchanges in the market.

Additionally you will learn some of the factors to consider when choosing a trading platform including the security policies to safeguard users’ assets payment methods supported services offered and several others.

What is a cryptocurrency exchange and how does it work?

A cryptocurrency exchange is a trading platform that allows anyone to buy sell or trade digital assets. Most crypto exchanges support Bitcoin and Ethereum the leading digital currency assets by market capitalization. The rest of the digital assets are selectively available across the hundreds of trading platforms in the market. Each exchange has proprietary listing policies that affect the assets made available for buying selling or trading on their platforms.

Cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to deposit funds (could be fiat money or digital assets) and exchange them for other digital assets. For instance a user could deposit USD into a crypto exchange and buy Bitcoin. They could then trade the Bitcoin for numerous other digital assets supported by the platform. They could even swap the Bitcoin back to USD and withdraw their funds.

All these are functions of a cryptocurrency exchange. However as you will learn later on in this article the role of most crypto exchanges has expanded. Now you can also invest learn stake store and even lend your assets through a trading platform.

Cryptocurrency exchanges can be classified into two broad categories:

Centralized and Decentralized

A crypto exchange can be categorized as either centralized or decentralized depending on its operator.

If operated by a single entity such as a company or an individual it is regarded as a centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX). If on the other hand there is no single entity responsible for the platform’s operations but rather several distributed entities coming together then this is a decentralized crypto exchange (DEX).

Most of the leading crypto trading platforms in the market are centralized which gives them some distinct advantages over their decentralized counterparts. However depending on your needs and level of technical know-how you may find that you prefer the DEXes over CEXes.

Cryptocurrency exchange vs. Crypto broker

The term crypto broker is often confused with a crypto exchange and it’s easy to see why given their overlapping concepts. However these two terms do not refer to the same thing.

Sure they are similar to the extent that they are both platforms allowing for the buying and selling of cryptocurrency assets. However with a crypto exchange buyers and sellers interact with one another. The platform charges a trading fee for facilitating the asset exchange. Prices are determined by market valuations.

On the other hand a crypto broker also allows buyers and sellers to transact on its platform. The difference is that they don’t interact directly with each other. Instead the broker sells to and buys from the respective parties. The prices are determined by the broker who buys at a discount and sells at a premium compared to the market prices.

Crypto exchanges are ideal for small trades while brokerage platforms are ideal for large transactions. This is because with exchanges the platforms aim to match buyers and sellers while brokerages act as either buyers and sellers of the assets.

Brokerage firms often support fewer digital assets have limited geolocation coverage and payment methods. In contrast crypto exchanges offer broader support for digital assets payment methods and geolocation coverage.

Finally crypto brokerage platforms are more strictly regulated as compared to exchanges. This makes them more secure and trustworthy therefore appealing to the institutional client. Crypto exchanges are often less regulated especially the decentralized variants. Because of this they appeal to a retail clientele.

Cryptocurrency exchange features and services

Trading crypto assets on exchanges may be the most popular application of these platforms but it is not the only one.

Initially these exchanges started as trading platforms. However as crypto assets evolved so did the exchanges. They now serve a wider variety of clients offering increasingly more services to satisfy a continually evolving clientele.

Here’s a rundown of some of the services offered by leading cryptocurrency exchanges:

Trading – this is the exchange of assets between two parties. It could be the exchange transacting with the client (i.e. a broker platform) or clients transacting with one another (i.e. an exchange). All cryptocurrency exchange platforms offer trading by default.

All cryptocurrency exchange platforms offer trading by default. Staking – in the digital economy staking involves maintaining a minimum required balance of a given asset in your wallet to earn the right to validate transactions on a blockchain network. This is possible through the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism used by several blockchain networks including Ethereum the largest blockchain network. Some crypto exchanges introduced ‘staking-as-a-service’ to cater to clients who are willing to ‘lock’ their assets within the trading platforms for a given period. In return they get a share of the staking rewards.

These are called wallets and most exchanges offer these services. We do not recommend keeping your assets within trading platforms especially for long periods. Exchanges such as Coinbase have branched out to offer more specialized storage facilities to institutional clients such as funds and family offices.

In return the lenders get interest on their (lent) savings.

Anyone can easily find these free educational materials and get up to speed on the new asset class. Exchanges providing these services include Coinbase Kraken and Binance.

What to look for when choosing a crypto exchange

There are hundreds of crypto exchanges each unique in its operations interface selling proposition and target audience. First let’s go over some of the most important factors to consider when choosing a trading platform that will match your needs.

Coin support

There were more than 10000 cryptocurrencies in 2024. Most of them are not supported in any major trading platform. Even some notable coins in terms of market value may not be listed in big exchanges. Therefore it’s crucial to take into account the crypto assets supported on the platform you’re considering.

Security (reputation)

The safety and security of your assets are paramount. Over the years billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency have been stolen from platforms leading some to close down. Some of the leading crypto exchanges have taken out insurance covers for their customers’ assets to counteract this. However this is just a recovery solution.

What is more important is that the platforms take active measures to ensure that they do not lose customer assets in the first place. The exchange should also adopt best practices when it comes to handling digital assets.

Liquidity

The liquidity of a digital asset is a measure of how easy it is to convert it to cash or other digital assets. You can quickly assess this factor by checking the daily transaction volume on the platform under consideration.

A high trade volume means that it will be easy to buy sell or trade a given asset of interest. A general high trading volume means that you have a broader selection of assets to trade.

The reverse is also true. A low trade volume makes it hard to buy sell or trade an asset.

Regulation and compliance

The presence of financial industry standards and policies is significant but especially so in the blockchain sector. The blockchain field has been around for over a decade but has grown rapidly in that period leaving regulators struggling to keep up.

In several countries worldwide regulators have implemented initial policies to govern the operations of blockchain-related companies. It is noteworthy and possibly a red flag if a trading platform you’re considering does not comply with any industry regulations already in place.

Payment methods

How can you deposit and withdraw funds from the exchange? Does it support bank transfers? Credit or debit cards? PayPal or your favorite payment method? What trading pairs are also supported on the exchange? Consider whether you can trade EUR USD GBP or a local currency in your country.

You could also consider the costs of deposit and withdrawal while you’re at it. Payment services such as credit cards are more costly compared to bank transfers.

Ease of use

This factor may not be possible to test before opening an account; however you can interact with most trading platforms without creating an account. You can browse around and see how easy it is to find what you need.

You should also consider the account creation process. Is it easy and straightforward? Does the platform require you to verify your identity? Not all exchanges comply with KYC regulations. At this point you may also consider whether the customer support is functional. Search for user reviews online before signing up.

Convenience

The ease of using the exchange is an important consideration. Nowadays most platforms have mobile and desktop applications on top of the conventional web interface. However not all exchanges have this level of convenience. Even the ones that offer these options could have a poor implementation of the apps. So make sure to download the applications and play with them and see whether you will like the experience of using them regularly.

Do you need access to an API (application programming interface)? The API allows you to extract data from your account to display it onto a third-party platform such as a crypto trading bot.

Most exchanges offer API support. If you need to use the API consider its functionality. What data can you access remotely? The security of the API is also another crucial consideration. Do you have permission to withdraw funds through the API? Is this a setting that can be changed? Check all the API functionality settings to see whether you will have the control you need.

The 2072 square-foot building sits on 1202 W Broadway Rd and is the first Black Rock Coffee Bar in Tempe. The new Scottsdale location and the third Black Rock Coffee bar in the Scottsdale community is targeting to open sometime in April. The 2004 square-foot store is located just north of the 101 at 9th street exit on 8870 North 90th Street.

“After the northwest Phoenix Arizona is our second largest market” said Jeff Hernandez Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Black Rock Coffee Bar. “When we look at markets we look at the community its culture the people their families and determine if we fit in with that community. It really comes down to the feel of the place – and we were drawn to Phoenix from the start. We feel we have established an authentic connection to the community.”

Incorporating Black Rock’s signature industrial modern design and as with many of the Black Rock Stores around the country long-time Black Rock employee Brian Koeniger has designed a large mural for the wall that embodies an Arizona- themed design.

The Black Rock culture prides itself on providing opportunities for young people to learn how to lead run a business and develop people skills. Each new location will employ approximately 20 team members.

Figures from the Central Statistics Office reveal that a South Dublin town is the most expensive area to live in Ireland.

Housing in Blackrock was not impacted by the COVID pandemic as prices increased to a median price of €622500.

The largest price increase in the county was in South Dublin as the region saw a rise of 2.8% according to figures from the CSO.

In total property prices in Dublin increased by 1.1% in the year to January.

Following Blackrock Dublin 6's median price of €578000 and Dublin 4's was €575000 making them the second and third most expensive areas in the country.

Meanwhile Ballyfermot in Dublin 10 had the lowest median residential property price at €235000.

Housing prices in Dublin City and Finglas were the only two categories where the CSO noted a decline as rates dropped by 0.1% each year.

Overall the COVID pandemic hasn’t impacted the demand for housing as residential property prices jumped 2.6% nationally year-on-year to January.

A further breakdown by property type showed house prices in the capital rose by 0.6% while apartments jumped by 3%.

The national residential property prices are 15.7% lower compared to the Celtic Tiger times in 2007.

Dublin residential property prices are 21.3% below their February 2007 high.

JD Property which was set up in 2018 to manage the online shopping giant’s warehouse portfolio has entered into formal agreements with an investor consortium led by Warburg Pincus and Hillhouse Capital for around $700 million in funding to boost its property fund management business.

“By leveraging Warburg Pincus and Hillhouse Capital’s industry expertise and resources JD Property will further strengthen its infrastructure property management capabilities and its position as a leading player in high-quality infrastructure properties development and operations” JD.com said in its fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results released late last week.

The announcement came just two weeks after JD announced plans for a potential $5 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong for its JD Logistics unit which holds the assets managed by JD Property.

Fund Manager Born

“We have been deeply impressed by JD Property’s high-quality portfolio unique capabilities and strong management team” said Ellen Ng managing director and head of China real estate at Warburg Pincus. “This investment demonstrates our conviction in the tremendous growth opportunity in new economy real estate and infrastructure as well as our ongoing commitment to investing in these sectors.”

Having previously launched a pair of core logistics funds JD Property debuted its first development fund in the fourth quarter with RMB 3 billion ($461 million) in assets under management. The online marketplace-turned-asset-manager counts Singaporean sovereign fund GIC and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company as key investors in the development vehicle.

With this latest venture JD Property has a total of RMB 19 billion across its three funds.

JD’s first core fund was established in February 2019 with GIC acting as the primary investor in that vehicle. JD served as general partner and retained a 20 percent stake after selling RMB 10.9 billion in logistics facilities to the vehicle.

JD Logistics Properties Core Fund II was set up at the end of March last year when JD.com agreed to sell RMB 93.5 million in logistics properties to the vehicle with GIC also acting as the primary backer of that fund.

Working Together

Warburg Pincus and Hillhouse are backing JD’s acceleration of its fund management business after both of the investment firms spent years working with the e-commerce player from different angles.

JD is a significant shareholder in ESR a Hong Kong-listed logistics real estate platform co-founded by Warburg Pincus. With a portfolio of more than 800 of its own warehouses in China JD invested $306 million in ESR in 2018 and held 7.62 percent of the company’s shares as of 30 June 2020.

Should JD Logistics’ IPO move forward it could value the company’s 20 million square metres (215 million square feet) of warehouses at as much as $40 billion. The public offering could potentially raise $5 billion according to earlier media reports which would eclipse ESR as Hong Kong’s biggest logistics real estate IPO ever.

Hillhouse was an early backer of JD Logistics with the venture capital firm led by billionaire Zhang Lei having joined a consortium of mainland backers that invested $2.5 billion in the warehousing business in 2018.

The Beijing-based firm has increasingly turned its attention to real estate in recent months with the company having hired former Blackstone and Soho China executive Yan Yan as a strategic advisor at the beginning of this year according to an internal memo seen by Mingtiandi. Hillhouse had earlier been rumoured to be exploring a buyout of commercial developer Soho China.

In August former Warburg Pincus managing director Joseph Gagnon reportedly joined Hillhouse to lead the firm’s establishment of a real estate investment division in the region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpaml3b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzRGlzcGxheT9uZXdzSUQ9ODExNjM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mangaluru: Black stone quarrying suspended - Construction sector might face shortage,

Boeing has reported thousands of passenger flights have already been flown with the aircraft and more airlines are resuming service every month.

The Boeing 737 Max is back and here to stay.

Boeing has reported thousands of passenger flights have already been flown with the aircraft and more airlines are resuming service every month.

Its troubled past aside the Max is still a groundbreaking aircraft and offers attractive amenities for airlines and passengers alike. Airlines love the aircraft's cost-saving economics while passengers will enjoy the ultra-modern onboard amenities like Boeing's ""Sky Interior"" complete with mood lights and larger overhead bins.

American Airlines and United Airlines were the first US two carriers to resume flying aircraft after a 20-month grounding imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. In February I took flights on each of the airlines' Max aircraft to see how each airline was handling the delicate return to service especially as passenger confidence in the aircraft plummeted after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.

On American I flew from New York to Miami the same route on which the aircraft made its second debut post-grounding. And on United I flew from Denver to Houston Texas on the airline's very first Max flight since the grounding.

Both airlines had a similar onboard offering but the difference largely came down to how both informed passengers that they'd be flying on the infamous aircraft.

Here's how the two compare.

United only resumed Max flights on February 11 2021 from Denver and Houston Texas but started strong with 22 daily flights on its first day quickly increasing to 32 the next day and climbing.

Booking: Both airlines clearly state the aircraft that are being used for each flight when booking. Here's what it looks like on American's website...

And here's what it looks like on United's. If travelers know to look they will see exactly which aircraft will be used for their flight.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

United takes it one step further however with that explicit warning that the customer has selected a flight on the Max.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

American doesn't have a clear warning but the Max name is not hidden at any point.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via American Airlines

The one exception is that United doesn't immediately show aircraft type on connecting itineraries unless customers select ""details."" But even then the warning will still show when reviewing the flight details before purchase.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

Winner: United Airlines. The airline makes it very clear that you're flying on a Max and goes a step further to include a heads up once a customer has selected their flights.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Check-in: The Max name remained on both of my reservations during check-in. Here's what it looked like on United...

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via United Airlines

And here's what it looked like on American.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider via American Airlines

Winner: Tied. Both airlines did have the Max name displayed during check-in.

At the airport: Both airlines didn't show the Max name at any time during check-in at the airport kiosks.

Flying United Airlines during the pandemic. Thomas Pallini/Insider

The only time I saw or heard the word ""Max"" was at the gate for both flights.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United shows the aircraft type on its digital gate signage...

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

And American's gate agents make an announcement before the flight that includes informing passengers of their flight's aircraft type whether it's the Max or not.

Flying on American Airlines during the pandemic. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Each airport is different for American however as Miami airport clearly showed the aircraft type on its signage.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: United Airlines. Digital signage at the gate clearly shows the aircraft type while American doesn't typically show aircraft type on its signage and agents only say the aircraft type once before boarding.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Onboard the aircraft: The Max doesn't have too many identifying features on the inside in either airline's configuration especially to the untrained eye.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

If a passenger got a glimpse into the cockpit they'd see this highly advanced avionics suite. But the aircraft doesn't scream ""Boeing 737 Max"" and that's typical of most airliners.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Where flyers can see the aircraft type on which they're flying is the safety card. And this is where United and American took a different approach.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United clearly states ""B737-MAX9"" on its safety cards...

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

While American opted to just write ""Boeing 737"" on its latest 737 Max safety cards since they can be used interchangeably with non-Max 737s.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

The Max name was also not included in either airline's safety brief. On United flight attendants simply used the generic Boeing 737 term.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: United Airlines. Both airlines shy away from specifically saying the word ""Max"" while onboard the aircraft but United keeps the aircraft's name on its safety cards so that there's no question.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Onboard amenities: Both airlines had a near-identical offering in economy with nothing overly exciting about either.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Aircraft for both airlines are arranged in a two-class configuration with economy class and first class seats.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

United currently flies the slightly larger Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft but the difference in size is negligible on the inside. The main difference is a few more rows of seats and a mid-cabin lavatory.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Both airlines have opted against seat-back in-flight entertainment on the Max as part of an industry shift towards streaming entertainment using a mobile device. Flyers will need to download the United or American app to access the content.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Seats on both jets come with device holders to make viewing the content easier.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

They can hold anything from an iPhone to an iPad.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

And both airlines have 110v AC power outlets at each seat to keep devices charged.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

American takes it one step further however with the seat-back USB charging port for easy access.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Aircraft of both airlines are equipped with Boeing's ""Sky Interior"" which gives the cabin an incredibly modern atmosphere.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Overhead bins are larger and allow for more bags to be stowed.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

And mood lighting creates a relaxing atmosphere

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Both airlines also offer in-flight WiFi. American offers Gogo in-flight WiFi which gives T-Mobile users a free hour of service while United charges for all customers.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Free Apple Music for the duration of the flight is also available on American.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

But American offers less legroom than United in economy with 30 inches of seat pitch for standard seats.

United offers 31 inches of pitch for its regular economy seats.

Flying on a United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Thomas Pallini/Insider

American's seats are also narrower in economy coming in between 16.6 and 17.8 inches wide depending on the seat location.

United's are a consistent 18 inches wide.

I didn't notice the difference as much when flying on both carriers and actually enjoyed American's seat just as much as United's. I wouldn't avoid flying on either airline's Max for the seat comfort alone and I even spent more time on American.

Flying on an American Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Winner: Tied. Both aircraft are nearly identical in terms of the type of product offered in economy and I found each airline had its own pros and cons that evened them out.

American Airlines and United Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft. Drew Angerer/Getty and Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

Ultimately I found United to be handling the Max return to serve the best out of the two carriers.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. Philip Pilosian/Shutterstock.com

United clearly did more to try and inform passengers that they were scheduled to fly on the Max while American just handled the aircraft like business as usual. Both airlines have proved that the Max is safe but winning back customer confidence and being proactively transparent will go further than being complacent in the event of skeptical passengers.

Inside the aircraft there were only minor differences between the two and both offered comfortable and modern products that made the journeys enjoyable.

As the Boeing 737 MAX works it way back into the sky a steady stream of orders are starting to work their way into the Renton orderbooks. Boeing’s latest customer is 777 Partners who was confirmed to pick up 24 737 MAX 8 models with an additional 60 more options after entering an originally agreement for the deal back in January. The airline company plans to lease the aircraft with only Flair Airlines being confirmed to receive the aircraft type. The Miami-based investment firm hopes with the aircraft’s economics will bring forwards plans that it has with its growing list of low-cost carrier investments in the post COVID environment.

Flair Airlines is confirmed to take hold of 13 of the leased aircraft who will be an inter-company movement as Flair is 25% owned by 777 Partners since 2019. Flair had previously operated over a half dozen Boeing models but the current COVID market saw the Boeing 737-400 retired and the fleet cut to just three Boeing 737-800s. The airline operates hubs in Edmonton and Vancouver and focuses on low cost flying on inter-Canadian routes.

Formed in Miami in 2015 through means of a buyout from its previous ownership the 777 Partners investment group has taken interest in aviation as part of the company’s portfolio. The company has a previously mentioned stake in Flair Airlines of Canada as well as interest in the Air Black Box and World Ticket Solutions companies. The investment firm is also a player in the Value Alliance an ultra-low-cost carrier alliance consisting of Cebu Pacific Cebgo Jeju Air Nok Air and Scoot.

777 Partners had also previously planned to restart World Airways as a low-cost link between Miami and Los Angeles to Asia and Latin America using Boeing 787s however news of a start date or plans past the initial marketing idea have yet to be released. The company also does with in the commercial finance insurance litigation finance and entertainment industries.

The investment firm’s founder Joshua Wander commented on the transaction saying “the 737-8 aircraft are a fantastic addition to our aviation portfolio and will enable our partners to leverage the jets’ superior economic performance to deliver low fares for their passengers while reducing their carbon footprint.”

777 Partners joins the windfall of support for the narrowbody aircraft type as the Boeing 737 MAX begins its return to service. The aircraft manufacturer inked a 25-jet deal with United earlier this week and appears to be close to landing an additional deal with Southwest to expand its MAX fleet. Boeing currently lists that there are 3955 undelivered Boeing 737 MAX orders to date with 39 models being confirmed for delivery in the first few months of 2021.

Release Date March 14 2021 In Hamburg Airbus passes last embers of A380 torch to A321XLR Purchase a PDF of this article

Last week the final Airbus A380 ran its engines for the first time. With the program’s nearing conclusion Airbus is left with an enormous industrial footprint to fill. There is no better illustration of the shift in Airbus’s priorities than watching the sunset of the hub-to-hub A380 only to have the A321XLR a small point-to-point single-aisle take its place in its factories at the Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport in Germany.

Hangar 260 on the banks of the Elbe River until recently was filled with parts for the A380’s three level rear fuselage. Panels of metal glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastic were built up along to form the last third of the superjumbo. Each was then sent along by ship and road convoy to Toulouse for final assembly. Today Hangar 260 has been converted to be an initial production pilot line for major component assembly (MCA) for the A321XLR a jetliner capable of flying as far as 4700 nautical miles.

Michael Menking Head of the A320 program for Airbus sat down with The Air Current last week to detail the status of the A321XLR. The next evolution of the 244-seat A321neo is picking up speed as it advances toward initial assembly. “Without a doubt…the XLR is the high priority if not to say the highest priority we have currently inside Airbus” he said.

Last April when Airbus was scaling back all aspects of its business as global commercial aviation was grinding to a halt with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic chief executive Guillaume Faury said there would be no let up in the A321XLR’s development. “We believe more than ever…in the relevance of that product.”

All five people inside the burning building including two adults and three children made it out safely.

Officials first received word of the blaze around 5:30 a.m. and the home was engulfed by the time they arrived. The scene at the corner of Springfield Street stayed active throughout the early morning as firefighters continued to douse hotspots.

The middle of the house appeared to fully collapse in on itself.

“I saw this big orange and I saw someone call out and I opened the shade and I said ‘Oh Crow it’s a fire.’ I called 911” neighbor Annora Lorrusso said.

Nearby residents watched wearily as strong winds blew burning embers toward other properties threatening to spread the flames even further.

“That’s always a concern when you got a fully involved house like this with winds blowing so we keep an eye on the neighbors house and let them know what’s going on” Quincy Fire Chief Joe Jackson said.

Firefighters said there were no injuries to report for residents or firefighters but the home will need to be demolished as soon as possible.

The cause of the fire is currently unknown.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYnVja3Njby50b2RheS8yMDIxLzAzL25ld3Rvd24tZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyLWJ1eXMtdHdvLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctcmVzdGF1cmFudC1jaGFpbnMtdm93aW5nLXRvLXJlaW52ZW50LXRoZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newtown Entrepreneur Buys Two Struggling Restaurant Chains Vowing to Reinvent Them,"Although 2020 was a challenging year for the many restaurateurs who struggled to keep the lights on amid the pandemic Jignesh “Jay” Pandya of Newtown expanded his business dramatically buying two well-known but struggling privately-held national restaurant chains.

Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Michael Klein wrote that in April Pandya acquired Boston Market the rotisserie chicken specialist adding 41 locations in 2020 for a total of 324. In October he took over the 157-unit Corner Bakery Cafe which offers pastries breads breakfast dishes and sandwiches.

Pandya 44 and a Bensalem High School grad is now overseeing a rebranding and redecoration of the companies’ stores. He said he is also is considering a relocation of the main offices to Bucks County and started hiring more staff anticipating that business will improve in the second quarter of 2021. Pandya said he plans open 90 to 105 more Boston Market and 120 new Corner Bakery locations in the next year—effectively doubling its size.

By controlling the parent companies Pandya is flipping his personal script. Pandya has been a franchisee for more than 20 years operating dozens of Arby’s Checkers and Dunkin’ Donuts outlets while controlling the real estate where the stores exist.

For about 15 years Pandya also was a Pizza Hut franchisee with 27 locations in the Philadelphia area and Connecticut before closing them in October 2019. Pizza Hut took him and his companies to federal court alleging that they had failed to pay franchise fees and violated terms of their operating agreements. Pandya’s attorneys countered that they were underperforming. Pandya declined to comment on the suit which court records suggest is headed toward mediation.

Meanwhile the Pizza Hut name is all but gone from the Philadelphia area.

In 2019 Pandya acquired rights to Brazilian fried chicken company HNT Chicken installed his older son Ronak then 19 as its chief executive and began to convert some of the shuttered Pizza Huts into HNT locations. Jay Pandya said HNT performed well in the months leading up to the pandemic but was not viable during the early months of the government shutdown orders so he closed them. He said he may revive it later.

Pandya also has given up his dream to start a cricket league in the United States but is working to build cricket stadiums.

Of his purchase of Boston Market the Inquirer cites his motivation as purely personal. “I love the food” Pandya said. The full article including a Q&A with Pandya is available here.",,,,,,,,,

We’ve come a long way from the rehashed tale of Frankenstein’s monster being brought to life using 19th-century sewing techniques and a spark of electricity. Nowadays Hollywood just crams sci-fi movies sequels trilogies and even tetralogies down our throats as fast as they can make them. With neon visuals and over-the-top action scenes we can finally put down those boring books and plug directly into the future. Imagination not required.

Enterprising researchers will keep marching on despite the philosophical naysayers who majored in a liberal arts degree and became unemployed screenwriters. They’ll keep discovering new ways to hack the human body for fun and profit tantalizing investors with visions of a utopic future busy shoveling cash out of investors’ wallets and putting it in their own at each funding round. Not to worry. We can still thank them for their hard work by swiping our credit cards for overpriced health insurance and healthcare fees.

The New Wave of Bioelectronic Devices

In the end the future waits for no one. And teams of lab rats have been busy building out the technology of bioelectronic devices. In case you are just skimming through your smartphone on a lunch break bioelectronic devices are implantable or wearable devices that send electrical impulses to specific regions of the body as a way of treating chronic conditions or diseases. Another term for them is electroceuticals. Both are new categories of therapeutics that use electricity to treat disease aimed to replace traditional pill-based pharmaceuticals for certain conditions where drugs have limited use.

Bioelectronic devices themselves aren’t anything new (think cardiac pacemakers which have been around for decades) but the technology is making headway for use in new disease states like Alzheimer’s or Crohn’s disease. The advantage of this new wave of bioelectronic devices is that they are non- or minimally invasive and some can work much like a pill with daily use. McKinsey & Company predicts a $2 billion market for bioelectronic devices if just 5% of patients with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease transition away from pills. Based on their prediction we’re staring down the barrel of a multibillion-dollar opportunity for multiple diseases.

Just for the record medical device startups in general had a record year in 2020 raising more than $19 billion according to CB insights. So investors are putting down their hard-earned cash to pump up these companies.

That also means potentially there’s a lot of competition in the market. As we noted in our article about FDA-approved AI algorithms one way to differentiate is to see which companies have made the leap from amateur scientists to serious business by gaining regulatory clearance or approval from the U.S. Federal Drug Administration. There are several types of FDA approvals designations and clearances for medical devices and all of the companies below have received or in the process of receiving one of these agency approvals.

Bioelectronic Device for Sinus Pain Relief

Founded in 2016 San Francisco startup Tivic Health has raised nearly $11 million in funding to develop a FDA cleared bioelectronic health device called ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief. This small handheld device is drug-free and designed to reduce allergy sinus pain for the 50 million Americans with allergies . More recently the ClearUP device can now claim to reduce moderate to severe congestion from allergies the flu and the common cold. Available at major online retailers nationwide.

Credit: Tivic Health

ClearUP is clinically proven and uses a gentle microcurrent waveform for relieving sinus and nasal pain and congestion. Study subjects with moderate to severe congestion reported on average a 44% reduction in congestion after 4 weeks of regular use. Last spring ClearUP received CE Mark approval (the equivalent of FDA approval in Europe) which opens the market for ClearUP to sell in over 190 countries. In a coming article we’ll do a deep-dive into this interesting company to learn more about what they plan to do with bioelectronic health devices.

Bioelectronic Device for Chronic Autoimmune Diseases

Founded in 2006 Los Angeles-based SetPoint Medical has been around for a while. The company has raised $216.4 million in the past 15 years including medical industry players GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Boston Scientific (BSX). We covered SetPoint Medical a few years ago in case you weren’t keeping track. The company’s technology is based on the accidental discovery of SetPoint Medical’s co-founder Dr. Kevin Tracey back in the 1990s when portable CD players used to be a hip statement of youth culture. He found out that shooting electricity up the vagus nerve which is the information superhighway between the brain and the gut stopped inflammation in the gut and rheumatoid arthritis.

Credit: SetPoint Medical

SetPoint Medical has since been developing an implantable device about the size of a triple-A battery that surgeons shove right into a patient’s neck. The device shoots tiny electrical shocks to the patient’s vagus nerve with a battery life of 10 years before it has to be replaced. Hopefully the warranty hasn’t expired.

Bioelectronic Devices for Stroke

Another startup that’s been around the block Israel-based BrainsGate was founded in 2000 and has raised $84.5 million also from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific. It is creating technology to treat patients suffering from central nervous system diseases with a current focus on acute ischemic stroke the most common type of stroke. While its technology is still pending under the FDA its device has been given Conformitè Europëenne (CE) approval in Europe.

Credit: BrainsGate

The BrainsGate device works by implanting a miniature electrode into the roof of a patient’s mouth that’s supposedly similar to dental treatment. The electrode sends an electric shock into a collection of nerve cells called the sphenopalatine ganglion which is meant to increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain. The shock also releases neurotransmitters that improve the healing of damaged parts of the brain after a stroke. If the company used its technology to treat other conditions that could use a little more blood flow it’d be making serious green on the side.

Bioelectronic Device for Essential Tremor

Founded in 2014 Cala Health is a bioelectronic medicine startup based in the good ol’ San Francisco Bay Area and has raised $71.3 million from a laundry list of investors most notably Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson. Cala Health is developing a non-invasive wearable device called Cala Trio which fits on a patient’s wrist and sends electrical signals to counteract the shaking hands experienced by individuals suffering from essential tremor. Think souped-up bulky Apple Watch except all it does is keep your hand from spilling your coffee and writing illegible signatures.

Credit: Cala Health

To get through the FDA approval process the company conducted a randomized clinical trial on 77 patients to test the effectiveness of its device. Apparently only three of those patients had what it called adverse events which involved lots of itchiness and some pain. That sure beats the laundry list of side effects that most pharmaceutical ads read off these days.

Bioelectronic Device for Chronic Migraines

While salvia has been used by Mexican shamans to trip out on the divine for ages Dutch startup Salvia BioElectronics is all about shocking those neurons to get the old noggin stirred up. Founded in 2017 this company has banked $34.6 million from investors with very European-sounding names. The company is building a bioelectronic device to treat chronic migraines and was just granted breakthrough device designation in November 2020 to expedite patient access to the device. Migraine is the No. 1 cause of disability in people under 50 affecting one out of seven people. People with chronic migraines suffer from 15 or more headache days per month. So there’s a huge market that aspirin just can’t cure.

Salvia’s device works by inserting an electronic foil right under the skin of a person’s head using a minimally invasive surgical procedure. So not too far off from chip implants. One day it might even offer free migraine treatment in exchange for watching a 30-second ad directed straight into your brain.

Bioelectronic Devices for Snoring

The most common reason why couples sleep apart is snoring. In fact marriages have been known to fall apart at a higher rate due to snoring. Founded in 2015 Signifier Medical Technologies has raised $23 million to combat this great marital affliction. The company is using that cash to build basically an advanced mouth retainer that sends electric signals to tongue muscles and gives them a workout.

Credit: Signifier Medical Technologies

The idea is that most snoring and sleep apnea problems are rooted in weak tongue muscles so stronger tongues mean better sleep. While there are other ways to strengthen the tongue muscles that’ll also keep a marriage afloat Signifier Medical Technologies offers a less adventurous approach.

Bioelectronic Device for Alzheimer’s

Founded in 2013 Phoenix-based NeuroEM Therapeutics is a clinical-stage startup developing a bioelectronic device to treat Alzheimer’s. The company has raised less than $1 million in government grants and money from private donors which might explain the single stitching here:

Credit: NeuroEM Therapeutics

Its device which amounts to basically a swim cap orthodontic headgear and a cell phone from the early 90s soldered together sends electromagnetic waves to treat Alzheimer’s. Unlike conspiracy theorists who wear tinfoil hats to keep their brains free of electromagnetic waves this hat harnesses the power of those waves to penetrate through the brain. The electromagnetic waves dislodge abnormal brain proteins called beta-amyloid which build up throughout an Alzheimer’s patient’s lifetime.

Despite the glowing corporate press releases Healthline cautioned that consumers should be aware that there’s little evidence so far that this electromagnetic cap can actually treat Alzheimer’s though the company received FDA breakthrough device status for accelerated development and assessment back in October 2020.

Bioelectronic Device for Opioid Withdrawal Relief

While Texas is now known for its poorly managed power grid advanced technologies have been known to spring up from the Lone Star State from time to time. Spark Biomedical was founded in 2018 and has since brought in a grand total of $50000 from a Texas A&M venture competition. (That’s what they’ve disclosed on Crunchbase though we’re being told they’ve raised more than that in undisclosed funding.) Spark Biomedical has developed a technology to treat opioid addiction called the Sparrow Therapy System which sounds more like a pyramid scheme led by a cult leader than a treatment to curb opioid withdrawal symptoms. The devices created by Spark Biomedical deliver electrical pulses to stimulate nerves near the ear which then activates areas in the brain that release endorphins in the same way as an opioid to curb withdrawal symptoms.

So instead of drowning out the world’s sorrows with a pill purchased from Johnson & Johnson patients can plug in and turn up the juice for personalized withdrawal therapy. Can’t say that’s much different from our modern problematic smartphone use.

Conclusion

Bioelectronic devices might seem like magic turning the clock on an ailing patient’s body using electricity. But rest assured the FDA has us covered making sure high-flying startup companies aren’t blowing smoke up our rear. After all scrutiny from the FDA started the downward spiral for Theranos and its fraudulent claims regarding its blood-testing technology.

While scientists are being funded by Silicon Valley to work out the kinks in the real speculative technologies behind immortality research and cryogenics bioelectronic devices might be the next best thing for us average folks who can cough up a few grand per month for life-saving medicine.

Coping with the life-changing adaptations and questions surrounding MS has made it clear that a support system including family and beyond is vital.

“You can’t do this on your own. It’s important to find help everywhere that you can and ensure that you find a support system for both the physical and mental aspects of the disease” he said noting that for himself and many others with MS depression is also a symptom.

Matt’s family has been his rock. His wife dropped everything to support him as he underwent tests and processed the implications of the diagnosis and she has continued to be there for him always emphasizing that “we’re doing this as a team.”

“It has been an emotional time for the two of us” he said “MS affects my entire family. I always say that I don’t have MS—we have MS.”

His family has been supportive as he tries new types of physical activities and ways to monitor his energy expenditure. Both swimming and yoga have been enjoyable and beneficial and he has worked on conserving energy throughout the day in order to have more available for playtime with his children and other activities.



Colleagues have been compassionate and accommodating as well and Matt has so far been able to continue in the lab though he wonders if MS will someday impact his hands which are vital to his scientific work.

“I’m a scientist and I’ve always wanted to be a scientist. But this is also the first time I’ve been a patient” he said.

Part of a community

When he underwent treatment for the first time the setting was a communal room with other patients receiving infusions for various conditions. It struck him that some of those therapies may have been medicines that he has worked on at Bristol Myers Squibb. It was an “impactful moment” he said making it clear that he was part of a global community of scientists seeking potential cures for various diseases while at the same time part of the patient community receiving those therapies.

As a patient Matt has experienced misconceptions people may have about MS and other illnesses or disabilities that are not always visible to the casual observer. Through his work with People and Business Resource Groups (PBRGs) within Bristol Myers Squibb which began before his diagnosis he has always been a champion of diversity and inclusion. Now with the perspective brought about through his lived experience of MS he has become involved with the PBRG called DAWN (Differently-Abled Workplace Network) in order to advocate for people with disabilities and share what he has learned.

“The idea of hope is not something that comes naturally to me. But I’ve learned the importance of taking each day for what it is and understanding that it’s natural to have a sense of loss and grief. If it’s a bad day it’s okay to lay low but if it’s a good day take advantage of that do the things you enjoy and embrace that day.”

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9hbnRvbmlvLWJyb3duLWxpc3RlZC1hcy1zZWNvbmQtYmVzdC1wbGF5ZXItYXQtaGlzLXBvc2l0aW9uLWV2ZXItYnktZm9ybWVyLXJhdmVucy1yZWNlaXZlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio Brown Listed As Second-Best Player At His Position Ever By Former Ravens Receiver,"In today’s NFL it feels like a handful of wide receivers break out and become great players every year with the position being more loaded now than ever. However for as good as these receivers are none may come close to the level of play Antonio Brown put on the field when he was with the Steelers.

Brown’s career did not end with grace and he is now talked about more for his issues off the field but there was a good stretch of time when he was the best receiver in the NFL. One former wide receiver even believes that makes him the second-best receiver of all time.

Jeremy Butler played in the NFL from 2014 to 2017 bouncing around with a couple of teams but spending the most time with the Ravens to start his career. Therefore Butler got to see firsthand just how good Brown was and apparently that left a big impact. On a recent episode of The Inquisitive Mamba Podcast Butler was asked to rank who he believed to be the top five receivers of all time and Brown ended up landing at number two on his list with Butler also saying that Brown is better than Jerry Rice due to the different eras the two played in.

”And we can go in order on this one so for me Randy Moss AB. I know that’s probably gonna piss a lot of people off but skill-wise? Like when you know the position skill-wise techniques fundamentals bringing everything to the table” Butler said about what made Brown a better receiver than Rice. “If I dropped Antonio or Julio in that era come on man.”

Butler’s list after Brown saw Terrell Owens at third Calvin Johnson at fourth and Julio Jones at fifth with Rice not being listed at all. It’s some of the highest praise that can be thrown a player’s way especially from someone who played receiver at the highest level.

Brown certainly has the numbers to back up such a claim as his production from 2013 to 2018 looks like it’s from a video game set on the easiest difficulty. This conversation may have more of a foundation under it if Brown hadn’t decided to become one of the biggest locker room issues the league had ever seen.

The argument about Brown being better than Rice due to the eras they played in feels unstable though. While it’s true that Rice played with two Hall of Fame quarterbacks he was also lining up against some of the best cornerbacks to ever play in the NFL. Deion Sanders Darrell Green and Rod Woodson are immortalized in the Hall of Fame for their level of play. Brown played against his share of Hall of Fame defensive backs as well but not many who can be talked about with the names Rice battled.

Ultimately this is a question with no real answer because of how great all the players involved are. A person isn’t wrong if they think Brown is the best receiver ever just like how another person isn’t wrong if they believe Moss Rice or Owens is the best ever. They’ve all proved that they were masters of the wide receiver position and playing the what-if game never got anyone anywhere.

In a different world Brown stays with the Steelers and breaks all of Rice’s records but that isn’t the world we live in. Due to his antics off the field Brown may never even see his name put next to his peers in the Hall of Fame and that holds more weight than any player list ever will.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL3duYmEvaW5kaWFuYS1mZXZlci8yMDI0LzA1LzA4LzY2M2FjN2FlY2E0NzQxYjEwMThiNDU5Zi5odG1s0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL2Jhc2tldGJhbGwvd25iYS9pbmRpYW5hLWZldmVyLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvNjYzYWM3YWVjYTQ3NDFiMTAxOGI0NTlmLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio Brown is roasted in social media again for his ridiculous remarks on Caitlin Clark,"Antonio Brown the former NFL star known for his controversial behavior has been stirring up trouble once again this time targeting Caitlin Clark. Again. Brown has been taking jabs at Clark on his social media but after her impressive performance with the Indiana Fever he seemed to have a change of heart. ""Respect"" Brown wrote on X after her preseason debut on May 3.

However the peace didn't last long. Brown took his trolling of Caitlin Clark to a new level by using a picture from the Met Gala to mock her. He posted a picture of Nicole Kidman with a caption suggesting that she brought Caitlin as her guest to the event.

This move didn't sit well with many fans who took to social media to express their disapproval of Brown's behavior. One user wrote ""Damn AB you don't beat around the Caitlin Clark do you?"" It's clear that Brown's actions have not been well-received by the public.

The dynamic between Caitlin Clark and Antonio Brown has been unusual to say the least. The rookie WNBA player has always attracted attention but her interactions with Brown have taken a negative turn. Brown's harassment and derogatory remarks led Clark to block him on social media reportedly causing tension between the two.

Brown's trolling of Clark reaches new heights

Despite the drama surrounding her off the court Clark has been making waves with her on-court performance. In her preseason debut with the Indiana Fever she finished with an impressive stat line of 21 points three rebounds two assists and two steals. This performance solidified her as a force to be reckoned with in the WNBA.

The tension between Clark and Brown has not gone unnoticed by the public. It's clear that their interactions have sparked a lot of interest and discussion among fans. The ongoing drama between the two has only added fuel to the fire creating a buzz around Clark's career in the WNBA.

It's evident that the dynamic between Caitlin Clark and Antonio Brown is far from over. As Clark continues to make a name for herself in the WNBA it's likely that their paths will cross again sparking even more conversation and speculation among fans and sports enthusiasts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvYnJvd24tZGl2ZXN0bWVudC1jYW1wdXMtcHJvdGVzdHMtZ2F6YS1pc3JhZWwtYjI1MzgxMTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Brown agrees to vote on divestment how would it work for colleges?,"The latest headlines from our reporters across the US sent straight to your inbox each weekday Your briefing on the latest headlines from across the US Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

The Gaza campus protests on Brown University will come to an end at least through the end of the school year but not because police stormed student encampments and hauled out demonstrators in zip ties.

Brown has instead successfully negotiated an end to the protests by agreeing to hold a vote on a key issue driving the protests: divestment.

The university's corporate board agreed on Tuesday that it will hold a vote on whether or not it will divest its interest from Israel a major victory for students protesting the ongoing war in Gaza.

In return protesters will tear down their encampment and have agreed not to restart protests during the school year.

“The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this” Christina Paxson the university's president wrote in a statement. “Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other.”

While the broader point of the protests has been to call attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians since the 7 October Hamas terror attack the more direct — and actionable — issue at the heart of the campus demonstrations has been a demand for colleges to stop spending money in ways that benefit Israel.

Divestment

“Disclose divest we will not stop we will not rest” has been an oft repeated chant on the campus of Columbia University where the latest round of student protests began in mid April.

Disclosure is obvious — the protesters want to know how the universities are spending their money specifically with regard to money that benefits Israel.

Divestment is essentially the opposite of an investment. The students want their schools to stop pouring money into Israel which they argue makes them complicit in the ongoing violence in Gaza.

Palestinian advocacy groups have called for divestment since at least 2005. Since then BDS — boycott divest sanction — has been a common demand from advocates for Palestine.

Universities maintain endowments which are funds they use to invest in stocks bonds and companies to help generate revenue.

Different student groups have different demands when it comes to divestment. At Brown students agreed to end their protest so long as the university at least holds a vote on the matter. At Yale and Cornell students have asked that their schools specifically divest any money that aids in weapon manufacturing.

At Columbia students have made a more substantial ask; they want the school to stop using its $13.6bn endowment to invest in any company that does business with Israel. That includes major international powerhouses like Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon according to CNN.

What does divestment look like?

Columbia has actually divested in the interest of civil rights in the past; in the 1980s students protesting apartheid South Africa successfully convinced the school to sell the majority of its stocks in companies connected to South Africa. That divestment included selling stock in Ford and Coca-Cola.

Nicholas Dirks a former chancellor of the University of California spoke with CNN and argued that university investments were more complicated today than in the 1980s making divestment a tricky road to travel.

“The economy is so global now that even if a university decided that they were going to instruct their dominant management groups to divest from Israel it would be almost impossible to disentangle” he told CNN. “It’s not clear to me that it’s really possible to fully divest from companies that touch in some way a country with such close political and trade ties to the US.""

Professor Todd Ely from the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver said that divestments don't typically work to shift a company's behaviour but it can work to draw significant attention to a cause.

""Divestment itself doesn't really influence the companies or the industries being targeted directly"" he told NPR. ""It's more the stigma created and drawing attention to the issue more broadly.""

Columbia University has divested in the past so why not now?

He agreed with the statement that modern university endowments are complex and make divestment a complicated — though not impossible — endeavour. He pointed out that investments made through endowments are intended to go back to supporting students and providing financial aid.

""So it's a complex situation where calls to change the way these funds are invested by students and other interested parties do end up kind of in a circular way going back to support the students themselves"" he said.

Chris Marsicano an assistant professor of education studies at Davidson College told PBS that the divestment movement against apartheid South Africa did not greatly affect its economy but the ""slow drip"" of headlines about colleges dropping their support did put political pressure on the nation.

""So we're pretty sure that — from research that divestment in South Africa didn't make a big economic impact which shouldn't be a surprise as universities weren't heavily invested in South Africa during the apartheid era"" he said. ""But the political pressure the slow drip of headline after headline after headline announcing different colleges and universities divesting certainly put political pressure on the apartheid regime.""

He said it appears that the Columbia protests have been successful in putting political pressure on Israel pointing to the fact that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt the need to denounce the demonstrations.

""When we hear last week that Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically mentions campus protests in the United States that lets us know that college students have captured the attention of key stakeholders for peace"" he said.

What are universities saying about divestment?

On 29 April Columbia University president Nemat Minouche Shafik said the school would not divest from Israel and they are not the only school to balk at the students' demands.

The University of California also said it would not divest claiming doing so ""impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses"" according to a statement.

American University in Washington DC also rejected divestment calls.

“Such actions threaten academic freedom the respectful free expression of ideas and views and the values of inclusion and belonging that are central to our community” Sylvia Burwell the president of American University said in a statement according to the Associated Press.

At Yale University President Peter Salovey said in a message that the school's Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility recommended against divestment including divestment from certain military weapons manufacturers.

The University of Michigan rejected calls for divestment noting that it has no direct investment with Israeli companies and that only a fraction of a per cent of the university’s $18bn endowment was indirectly invested. The college justified its decision by referring to a 20-year-old policy that ""shields the university's investments from political pressures.""

Some colleges have been more amenable to discussing divestment.

Like Brown protests at Northwestern Univeristy ended after the school agreed late on Monday to create an advisory committee on university investments.

Portland State University took a step toward divestment when it announced on 29 April that it would pause its gifts and grants from Boeing in response to protesters demands.

UC Riverside also agreed to “examine” its endowment fund.

“The UC Riverside campus agreed to form a taskforce to examine whether the college’s endowment fund should be removed from the wider UC investment office in order to divest.”

The University of Texas Dallas said it would also welcome “the opportunity for open respectful dialogue” with student protesters on the issue KERA reports.

According to US Department of Education data approximately 100 US colleges have reported either gifts or contracts from Israel that total $375m over the last 20 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9tYW5keS1tb29yZS1zdGVybGluZy1rLWJyb3duLWNocmlzLXN1bGxpdmFuLXRhbGstdGhpcy1pcy11cy1yZXdhdGNoLXBvZGNhc3QtdHJhaWxlci1leGNsdXNpdmUtODY0MzY4ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Brown' Haul in 1st Round of NFL Draft,"Cooper Neill/Getty Images

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk was a popular name floated in trade rumors leading up to the 2024 NFL draft but it sounds like the asking price for him was fairly steep.

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported on Tuesday that ""much of the league was keeping a close eye on the 49ers' handling of the wide receiver position throughout the draft."" However many teams learned that San Francisco was seeking a similar haul to what the Tennesee Titans received when they traded star receiver A.J. Brown to the Philadelphia Eagles.

""Multiple teams told me they had interest in Brandon Aiyuk but they believed the 49ers wanted a first-round pick for him with one comparing the situation to that of A.J. Brown who went from Tennessee to Philadelphia in 2022 in exchange for the 18th pick"" Fowler explained. ""The Eagles then signed him to a four-year $100 million contract. Trading for Aiyuk would have required a new deal and a premium pick.""

Aiyuk is entering the final year of his contract and is set to make $14.1 million in the 2024 season. He has not been shy about his desire to receive a new contract but it doesn't appear that there has been much progress on that front."

Last week I was doing a little clerical work checking a Las Vegas production company’s on-sale dates and ran across something remarkable: A long line of ticketed shows taking almost the whole screen on the KatsTop laptop.

Just like the old days almost. Lined up were more than three dozen ongoing shows (39 by my count) being performed in Las Vegas right now. I would expect any other international city would be encouraged to have safely returned to that volume of live entertainment during a pandemic.

This almost a year to the day after live entertainment across the city was closed in the statewide COVID shutdown of nonessential businesses.

That count falls far short of what Las Vegas has offered in the “old” normal. The stats vary depending on openings and closings and pauses and such but the city presented about 150 ticketed shows per night before COVID hit. Again Las Vegas sets its own standard with its pure volume of live entertainment offerings.

Checking the latest list Sunday Matt Stabile of Stabile Productions said “It’s pretty impressive considering that we had like five shows going when we started reopening. But there is demand. The town is getting much busier. All of our shows have been selling out. It’s a lower capacity of course but it has been crazy all week.”

A canvassing of the city’s ticketed shows ongoing right now gives reason for encouragement. Recent relaxing of maximum capacities for public gatherings to 50-percent of a venue’s fire-code capacity and the removal of the 25-foot ‘Moat’ at the front of stages has quickened the pace of the city’s return to live entertainment.

Following is the hot list of headliners and production shows you can see as the one-year shutdown anniversary approaches Thursday night:

Coming soon?

Any headliner or show not listed in that stretch is yet to be announced or (such as Gordie Brown at Golden Nugget on March 25) opening at a later date. The lineup does not include Cirque du Soleil’s plans to bring back its five Strip shows beginning July 4. Nor does it account for the many resident Strip headliners on the tarmac starting with Barry Manilow’s scheduled return to Westgate Las Vegas in June. Usher’s residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace is next in line in July continuing with Donny Osmond at Harrah’s in late-August.

And add to the ticketed lineup such ongoing “ambient” performances as shows at Mayfair Supper Club at Bellagio Italian American Club and The Vegas Room. Several hotel-casino venues are currently offering free lounge entertainment leading with Le Cabaret at Paris and Indigo at Bally’s; Napoleon’s in Le Boulevard betweent those two casinos; Harrah’s Piano Bar (topped by Pete “Big Elvis” Vallee) and Carnaval Court (my buddies in the Original Chaos classic-rock band); and the just-expanded 1923 Prohibition Bar at Mandalay Bay with Nieve Malandra now in residency.

It’s a lot unless measured pre-COVID business in Las Vegas which sets its own standard. But to answer the question about whether the city can regain its stature as entertainment capital of the world check the scoreboard. It’s already on its way.

EJY recovering

Eric Jordan Young was a late call-out from his scheduled performance at The Space on Saturday. He had good reason. EJY was rushed to the emergency room Friday night with abdominal pain and underwent appendectomy surgery Saturday morning. The malady was caught before any rupture but …

“Ooh it was bad” Young said Sunday just as he was returning home. “I’ve never been in that position to have to walk away from a performance. I was so ill was hoping everyone understood ‘the show must go on’ mentality wasn’t going to work this time. There was no way I would have been able to perform.”

Young is known for his durability. He pulled a 12-show-per-week schedule for four years in “Vegas! The Show.” His next booked gig is April 29 a return with “The Cocktail Cabaret” at Italian American Club. As the headliner says “That should be enough time to make sure I’m back in performing condition.”

Who Was Where

The city’s reopening is leading to some celeb sightings. Las Vegas Raiders Coach Jon Gruden was at Barry’s Downtown Prime steakhouse at Circa Las Vegas. So was Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Dion Dawkins (separate tables). WWE heavyweight champ Bobby Lashley was in the house Friday night easily recognizable as he carried his title belt into the kitchen for a photo opp with Chef Barry Dakake.

British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis was at Top Golf at MGM Grand on Saturday afternoon sipping mimosas with friends. No word on if she broke out the sticks.

Another WWE star Chris Jericho took in “X Burlesque” on Saturday. His photo op was a classic. Our friend known simply as Red Cup Geoff stripped off his shirt and photo-bombed the whole cast along with co-producers Angela Stabile and Tiffany Mondell. That’s him far right but not far right enough. Pretty funny actually. But next time keep your shirt on and leave the comedy to Nancy Ryan.

Two years later he was so disgusted after losing a decision to Sugar Ray Leonard — stolen he claimed by the judges — that he never fought again.

One of the great middleweights in boxing history Hagler died Saturday at the age of 66. His wife Kay announced his death on the Facebook page for Hagler’s fans.

“I am sorry to make a very sad announcement” she wrote. “Today unfortunately my beloved husband Marvelous Marvin passed away unexpectedly at his home here in New Hampshire. Our family requests that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.”

Hagler fought on boxing’s biggest stages against its biggest names as he Leonard Hearns and Roberto Duran dominated the middleweight classes during a golden time for boxing in the 1980s. Quiet with a brooding public persona Hagler fought 67 times over 14 years as a pro out of Brockton Massachusetts finishing 62-3-2 with 52 knockouts.

“If they cut my bald head open they will find one big boxing glove’’ Hagler once said. “That’s all I am. I live it.”

Hagler was unmistakable in the ring fighting out of a southpaw stance with his bald head glistening in the lights. He was relentless and he was vicious stopping opponent after opponent during an eight year run that began with a disputed draw against Vito Antuofermo in 1979 that he later avenged.

He fought with a proverbial chip on his shoulder convinced that boxing fans and promoters alike didn’t give him his proper due. He was so upset that he wasn’t introduced before a 1982 fight by his nickname of Marvelous that he went to court to legally change his name.

“He was certainly one of the greatest middleweights ever but one of the greatest people that I’ve ever been around and promoted” promoter Bob Arum said. “He was a real man loyal and just fantastic person.”

Any doubts Hagler wasn’t indeed Marvelous were erased on a spring night in 1985. He and Hearns met in one of the era’s big middleweight clashes outdoors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and when the opening bell rang they traded punches for three minutes in an opening round many consider the best in boxing history.

Hagler would go on to stop Hearns in the third round crumpling him to the canvas with a barrage of punches even as blood poured out of a large gash on his forehead that nearly caused the referee to stop the fight earlier in the round.

“When they stopped the fight to look at the cut I realized they might be playing games and I wasn’t going to let them take the title away″ Hagler said later. “It was a scary feeling. I thought ‘Why are they stopping this fight?’ I didn’t realize I was bleeding. It wasn’t in my eyes. Then I knew I had to destroy this guy.’’

Arum said Hagler simply willed himself to victory over Hearns whose big right hand was feared in the division but couldn’t keep Hagler at bay.

“That was an unbelievable fight’’ Arum said. “Probably the greatest fight ever.’’

Hearns said Saturday he was thinking about Hagler and their historic fight. Hagler wore a baseball cap with the word “War’” while promoting it while on a 23-city tour with Hearns that Arum said made the fighters despise each other before they even entered the ring.

“I can’t take anything away from him’’ Hearns told The Associated Press. “His awkwardness messed me up but I can’t take anything away from him. He fought his heart out and we put on a great show for all time.’’

Hagler would fight only two more times stopping John Mugabi a year later and then meeting Leonard who was coming off a three-year layoff from a detached retina in his final fight in 1987. Hagler was favored going into the fight and many thought he would destroy Leonard — but Leonard had other plans.

While Hagler pursued him around the ring Leonard fought backing up flicking out his left jab and throwing combinations that didn’t hurt Hagler but won him points on the ringside scorecards. Still when the bell rang at the end of the 12th round many thought Hagler had pulled out the fight — only to lose a controversial split decision.

Hagler who was paid $19 million left the ring in disgust and never fought again. He moved to Italy to act and never really looked back.

“I feel fortunate to get out of the ring with my faculties and my health” he said a year later.

Hagler took the long route to greatness fighting mostly in the Boston area before finally getting his chance at the 160-pound title in 1979 against Antuofermo as a co-main event with Leonard fighting Wilfredo Benitez on the same card. Hagler bloodied Antuofermo and seemed to win the fight but when the scorecards were tallied he was denied the belt with a draw.

Hagler would travel to London the next year to stop Alan Minter to win the title and he held it for the next seven years before his disputed loss to Leonard.

Arum remembered being at a black tie event honoring top fighters a year later that was attended by both Hagler and Leonard among others. He said Leonard came up to him and pointed to Hagler across the room and suggested he go talk to him about a rematch that would have earned both fighters unbelievable purses.

“I went over to Marvin and said Ray is talking about a rematch” Arum said. “He glared at me as only Marvin could and said ‘Tell Ray to get a life.’’’

Hagler was born in Newark New Jersey and moved with his family to Brockton in the late 1960s. He was discovered as an amateur by the Petronelli brothers Goody and Pat who ran a gym in Brockton and would go on to train Hagler for his entire pro career.

He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1983.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd2hpdGVjbGVhdGJlYXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvam9zZS1jYW5zZWNvLXNob290cy1zaG90LWplbm5pZmVyLWxvcGV6L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jose Canseco shoots his shot with Jennifer Lopez,Hey Jennifer Lopez by the way I am single And I can be faithful,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vcGlkZ2luL3Nwb3J0LTU2Mzc4MTU20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvin Hagler: American boxing legend 'Marvelous' Marvin Hagler die at age 66 - See wetin to know about am,"Marvin Hagler: American boxing legend 'Marvelous' Marvin Hagler die at age 66 - See wetin to know about am

So if you're not a Purdue fan IndyStar will be giving you all the information you need to pick your own Cinderella.

Drexel Dragons (Colonial Athletic Association)

How they got here: Drexel had higher expectations than a 4-5 record in the Colonial Athletic Association and sixth seed in the conference tournament. From Jan. 24-Feb. 25 there were eight games postponed and the Dragons played just three times due to pauses by other teams for COVID-19. Drexel beat James Madison on Feb. 26 then handled No. 3-seed College of Charleston (80-75) No. 2 Northeastern (74-67) and eighth-seeded Elon (63-56) to earn an NCAA Tournament berth. Mate Okros scored 14 points and hit four 3-pointers vs. Elon to put the Dragons in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 25 years.

Best player: Camren Wynter leads Drexel in scoring with 17.3 points shooting 48.4% overall and 41.6% on 3s and 5.4 assists. “Cam Wynter could not speak” coach Zach Spiker told the Philadelphia Inquirer after the title game victory. “He had tears flowing down his cheeks. He couldn’t speak.” James Butler averages 13.3 points and 9.2 rebounds. The Dragons shot 36.2% on 3s with Zach Walton (39.2%) and Okros (36.5%) joining Wynter as threats.

Who's your March Madness upset pick? The Cinderella teams of the 2021 NCAA Tournament

Painful NCAA Tournament history: In 2007 George Mason famously reached the Final Four after getting an at-large bid out of the Colonial Athletic Association. The following season Drexel beat Villanova Syracuse and Creighton won 23 games and had an RPI of 43 ... but lost in the conference tournament and was sent to the NIT. In 2010-11 Drexel beat Louisville went 21-10 ... but lost to Virginia Commonwealth at the buzzer in the CAA tournament. VCU got an at-large bid and reached the Final Four. Drexel stayed home. In 2011-12 Drexel won 19 consecutive games and 26 total but another CAA Tournament loss sent it to the NIT.

Famous alumni: Dorcas Bates Reilly invented the green bean casserole while working in the home economics department of the Campbell Soup Company; Toots Shor famous barkeeper in New York City; Chuck Barris creator and host of ""The Gong Show""; Paul Baran a founding father of the Internet.

Indiana connections: Bruiser Flint was the Drexel coach during its NCAA heartbreak and went 245-217 in 15 seasons as the coach. He was hired as an assistant at Indiana after being fired by Drexel following a 6-25 2015-16 season.

Indeed the work seems bigger and sillier than ever. Hopefully it signals a speedy return to normal in the coming months with the pandemic in our rear-views and virbant vistas ahead.

""Sam Spike and Chuck are legends in their own right and certainly don’t need anyone else to make these commercials great"" GSD&M senior vice president managing director Nancy Ryan tells Muse. ""But something special does happen when you drop an outsider into their world. It keeps it fun for them but also sets this expectation with the audience of 'What is Capital One going to do next?'""

""So just when you think it’s going to be another funny March Madness commercial boom! Magic Johnson literally pops up or a longform musical number with Gladys Knight"" she says.

Agency SVP group creative director Ryan Carroll believes one campaign concept could have some legs IRL.

""We think there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barkleylounger"" he says. ""Who’s to say this chair can’t live on and make its way to the stadium once fans can start attending tournament games again?""

The lawsuit said SolarWinds used an easily guessable password “solarwinds123” on an update server which was subsequently breached by hackers “likely Russian in origin.” SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna speaking at a congressional hearing in March blamed the weak password on an intern.

There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.

Experts are still trying to understand just how the hackers broke into SolarWinds servers. But the weak password does reveal wider issues about the company’s security practices — including how the easily guessable password was allowed to be set to begin with.

Even if the intern is held culpable SolarWinds still faces what’s known as vicarious liability — and that can lead to hefty penalties.

What is vicarious liability and why should startups care?

Vicarious liability is “the principle that an employer can be liable for the acts of an employee if the act was something done by the employee acting in the ordinary course of their employment” said Martin Sloan a partner at U.K. law firm Brodies.

Whether a company is liable for cyber incidents based on the actions of employees or contractors will depend on the circumstances of what happened.

“In many cases the company will be directly liable for the acts of its employees” said Sloan. “Was the employee or contractor acting on the company’s instructions or in the course of their duties? If not is the company nevertheless vicariously liable for the acts of the employee?”

Data breaches are more a “when” not an “if” and businesses can still be held liable for damage caused by their employees or contractors.

“A breach that occurred does not require data to be released to people outside a company; a breach can have data released internally often to contractors who do not have need or rights to the data” said Niamh Muldoon who serves as the global data protection officer at identity giant OneLogin.

“These are quite common in GDPR breaches where fines have occurred” she said.

How big can the liability be?

Last year Capital One was fined $80 million and told to tighten its security after a 2019 cloud data breach that exposed the personal data of over 100 million customers. The alleged hacker is a former engineer at Amazon Web Services which Capital One used to store customer data.

Meanwhile the U.K. Supreme Court said supermarket chain Morrisons was “not vicariously liable” for a 2014 data breach caused by an employee who acted for personal gain.

Sloan explained that Capital One was directly liable for the issues that led to the breach. “The fine was for a failure by Capital One to have in place effective information security procedures to protect against third-party attacks” he said. “In the Morrisons case the court said that there was nothing more Morrisons could have done to prevent the breach.”

There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.

Perhaps the most well-known case of a breach caused by a third-party is Target in 2013 when attackers compromised millions of customers’ data using stolen credentials from a third-party HVAC contractor. Target eventually paid an $18.5 million settlement and reportedly spent over $200 million in legal fees stemming from the breach.

Demi Ben-Ari chief technology officer at third-party security management company Panorays said that even though the breach was caused by a third-party “Target was still considered responsible because of a lack of adequate security.”

More recently laboratory giants Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp had millions of customers’ data stolen in 2019 because of a breach at its third-party billing provider AMCA. Facing enormous HIPAA penalties AMCA subsequently filed for bankruptcy.

“While we have yet to see what the financial fallout will be for Quest and LabCorp there’s no question that they will face hefty fines as well” said Ben-Ari.

How can startups avoid vicarious liabilities of cybersecurity incidents?

Humans make mistakes but vicarious liability can be avoided if the company can show that the incident happened despite its best efforts to avoid it. Having strong cybersecurity policies in place can help prevent the most egregious issues.

“It’s essential that businesses regularly review their information security measures and those of their partners to ensure that they remain appropriate and reflect best practice” said Sloan. “As part of this they should use third-party vulnerability and penetration testing. Businesses should also ensure that they consistently apply security patches and address vulnerabilities when they’re identified and provide staff with appropriate training on cyber risk and the business’ internal policies.”

“Taking these steps will help to prevent breaches from occurring in the first place and if they do help the business to demonstrate that it did everything that could reasonably have been done to prevent the breach” he added.

The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre has a helpful guide on 10 steps to take to improve your company’s cybersecurity posture and the U.S. National Industrial Security Program which governs federal contractor facility clearance and insider threat programs also has more.

Keeping the access limited strictly on a need-to-know basis with proper and verified audit trails serves as a deterrent said Tom Van de Wiele principal security consultant at F-Secure.

It also ensures a timely and cost-efficient way of responding to a situation where an insider incident might be suspected he said."

Teachers and staff in pre-K-12 schools and childcare programs will be able to sign up for an appointment at over 9000 pharmacy locations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this year pharmacies were also on the front lines in getting vaccines into the arms of residents of long-term care facilities.

How other eligible Americans get a vaccine at their local pharmacy depends upon vaccine rollout plans in individual states and upon the supply which has been unpredictable.

In November even before a vaccine became available 19 pharmacies partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services for consumer access to a COVID-19 vaccine. That number has grown to 21. On February 11 the federal government announced that one million doses would be going directly to 6500 pharmacies as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.

But vaccination confusion plagued some initial pharmacy efforts in February.

A spokesman for CVS among the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Pharmacy Retail Program acknowledged the potential for vaccine appointment confusion.

""When the first two approved vaccines were in development the challenges that CVS Health faced were related to storing the vaccines as they both have special requirements and both vaccines require two doses and timing between each dose varies"" said Charles Keller a CVS District Leader in Houston Texas by email.

""Additionally there are state-specific eligibility requirements that we must adhere to and this can cause some confusion for customers looking to make an appointment.""

The CDC directs individuals who are interested in getting vaccinated at their local pharmacy to their pharmacy's website or to visit VaccineFinder.org.

A visit to the VaccineFinder.org site muddies the waters except for residents of Alaska Tennessee Indiana Iowa Oklahoma Utah and New York excluding New York City where it says the vaccine is available at pharmacies. ""In other states information may be limited while more providers and pharmacies are added in the coming weeks"" the site says.

Most pharmacy partners are using online scheduling systems and walk-ins are not accepted.

In February even the National Governors Association looked for clarification on how the pharmacy program would work in tandem with state efforts.

""We believe it is important that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in its reporting distinguish between these separate efforts to avoid confusion and provide a clear understanding to the American people"" according to the February 15 letter to President Joe Biden.

HOW TO GET VACCINATED THROUGH PHARMACIES

Healthcare Finance News asked three of the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program – CVS Health Walgreens and Walmart – about their vaccination programs.

CVS is currently vaccinating individuals in 29 states and Puerto Rico based on federal eligibility guidelines with a ""limited supply"" of the Moderna Pfizer and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine according to Keller.

""CVS Health is also prioritizing CVS pharmacies located in vulnerable communities with a particular focus on Black and Hispanic populations which includes proactive patient outreach community-based partnerships vaccines clinics and education-focused marketing"" Keller said.

""As we expand to additional states and locations we will begin to increase access to vaccines by using mobile vaccination vans and offering community-based vaccination clinics by working with nonprofit organizations.""

Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the expectation is that the vaccine will be available in the vast majority of their pharmacies across the country as supply allows.

""Walmart is partnering with the CDC and states to move as quickly as possible to help administer vaccines to eligible populations in participating states with an emphasis on reaching customers in vulnerable communities with limited access to care"" McInnis said.

""Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering vaccines in more than three dozen jurisdictions including Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. through federal and state efforts.""

Walgreens supports vaccinations across 43 states and jurisdictions as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. It has administered approximately five million COVID-19 vaccinations across long-term care facilities in more than 4700 stores and through clinics.

""As we have throughout the pandemic Walgreens will continue to be there for our customers to help them with their health and wellness needs and we're committed to accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations as quickly as supply allows"" said Rina Shah the group vice president of Pharmacy Operations for Walgreens.

""With a flexible model of care that can meet patients where they are – be it in our stores or at off-site vaccination clinics – we're ready to administer COVID-19 vaccines in all of our more than 9000 store locations once they become available for mass availability.""

All three pharmacy chains recognize that demand for the vaccine currently outweighs supply.

Walgreens has received approximately one million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson Moderna and Pfizer per week as of early March.

""Consumers are eager to get vaccinated but we don't yet have enough vaccine supply for everyone who wants one"" Shah said. ""With the recent emergency use authorization of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and as supply increases we anticipate vaccinations to be available to the general population in the late spring/early summer time frame.""

As vaccine availability grows more appointments will become available.

""Once the vaccine is available to the general public we plan to administer vaccines at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide with the ability to administer up to 20 to 25 million shots per month by our approximately 50000 healthcare providers"" Keller said.

Individuals who are interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine through CVS can confirm their eligibility on their state's website and then schedule an appointment online in the CVS app or by calling customer service.

""Walk-ins will not be accepted so it's important for customers to check their local CVS pharmacy location and book an appointment when they are eligible to do so"" Keller said.

Consumers can sign up to get a vaccine through Walmart based on vaccine supply and eligibility which will vary based on state and local guidelines. Eligible customers can make an appointment through the Walmart and Sam's Club online schedulers.

""Appointment availability is based on current allocation so appointments will be limited based on quantities allocated by federal and state governments"" McInnis said.

To make a vaccine appointment at Walgreens eligible patients can schedule online through the pharmacy's online portal. For scheduling via phone individuals can call 1-800-Walgreens or their local Walgreens to access the scheduler which is available in English and Spanish.

In addition to the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program pharmacies can get vaccines from states through the Pharmacy Transfer Program according to the CDC. With this states can choose to transfer some of their federally allocated vaccine doses to federal pharmacy partners to further expand vaccine access.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Getting vaccinated is seen as the most effective way (along with the other safety measures such as mask-wearing) to stem the year-long pandemic and lockdown and prevent COVID-19 cases deaths and surges at area hospitals.

Hospitals continue to suffer financially due to the pandemic and the loss of elective procedures that keep them afloat. The American Hospital Association asked Congress for relief funding for hospitals in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed the House today but did not get it.

COLLECTION OF PATIENT DATA

The pharmacy program recently came under fire for collecting patients' information.

Chains such as CVS Health Walmart and Walgreens-Boots Alliance are collecting data from millions of customers as they sign up for shots enrolling them in patient systems and having recipients register customer profiles according to The Wall Street Journal.

The companies said the information is critical in streamlining vaccinations and improving record-keeping while ensuring only qualified people are receiving shots.

Neither CVS nor Walgreens require members to sign up for loyalty programs which track purchases in order to register for a vaccine.

McInnis said that in addition to appointments the Walmart scheduler ""will provide a digital reminder when it is time to return for a second vaccine if required which is why customers are asked to create a profile helping to ensure they receive the second dose of the vaccine.""

THE LARGER TREND

As of March 10 the U.S. had administered more than 95.7 million vaccine doses according to the CDC. Roughly 19% of the population have had at least one dose and about 10% are fully vaccinated.

A third of adults reported feeling confused about the vaccination process in the U.S. according to a January survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Feelings of confusion were most commonly reported among individuals 18 to 29 years old (40%) and Black adults (46%).

Reports of widespread confusion stretch from Massachusetts to California and are related to disjointed online portals for vaccine appointments and muddled communications around eligibility.

Making matters worse scammers are taking advantage of the confusion in attempts to squeeze money out of vulnerable individuals according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Participating pharmacies will bill private and public insurance for the vaccine administration fee. For uninsured patients this fee will be reimbursed through the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. No one will receive a bill for a COVID-19 vaccine according to the CDC.

In July the U.S. agreed to pay Pfizer $1.95 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine – the equivalent of $39 for a two-shot immunization according to Bloomberg. In August Moderna released a price of $32-$37 per dose ($64-$74 for a two-shot immunization). These prices include only the vaccine itself not administrative costs.

The average administrative cost is $45 per member to receive the appropriate vaccine dose or doses according to Eileen Flick director of Health Technical Services at Segal.

She had questions.

“What is this? Why is he in drag?” Chanin the 53-year-old mother of one from California asked about the experience.

The discovery led Chanin who works at a logo printing business to discover that Solomon was among the founders of the first Jewish group to officially participate in the Carnival of his native Cologne.

Carnival a weeklong event to celebrate Lent the 40-day period that precedes Easter is one of the German city’s most cherished traditions. Hundreds of thousands of revelers wear colorful clothes and consume massive amounts of alcohol on the street.

The culmination is a parade in which registered groups compete and show off the creations they had toiled on throughout the year — floats often with paper mache caricatures satirizing politicians or phenomena. The makers ride or march alongside wearing their costumes and displaying their dance routines.

A reincarnation of Solomon’s group was poised to join the festivities this year with a float for the first time in decades — since the Nazis banned the club from Carnival in 1933. But the COVID crisis intervened and the event has been canceled.

In 1923 Solomon became the first president of the Kleinen Kolner Klub or Little Cologne Club which was the event’s first registered Jewish group. It remained active until the Nazis rose to power. The photo of Solomon in drag was part of the group’s act Chanin discovered. Solomon immigrated to the United States before the Holocaust.

Chanin and other descendants of the early Jewish group — ironically it was known by the same three initials as the Ku Klux Klan — have also learned that local Cologne Jews for the first time in decades recently reconstituted an official Jewish group in Carnival: the Kolsche Kippa Kopp.

The group whose name means “Cologne kippah heads” and is a tribute to Solomon’s original outfit was created in 2017. The plan was to have the new club which has about 20 members participate with its own float for the first time at the parade which usually takes place in mid-February.

That’s been spoiled by the pandemic.

“It’s disappointing especially since this year is the year that the Jewish community and the government are celebrating 1700 years of Jewish presence in Germany” said Aaron Knappstein who co-founded the new Jewish club. “But it’s the way it is. Next year we’ll celebrate the 1701st year of Jewish presence I guess.”

The proximity of Carnival to the Jewish holiday of Purim when it’s also customary to dress in costume gives members of the Jewish club extra reason to party.

“You have to dress up and free your mind and show that it is OK to be different” Robert Katona a 49-year-old Cologne native told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2019. “That’s also what Purim is about: We survived and we show that we’re happy.”

But in a country where the rise in anti-Semitic incidents is making some Jews question their futures even the planning of a Jewish float has brought some uncomfortable issues to the fore.

“When we have the float there will have to be security around it. That’s just the way things are right now” Knappstein said.

Security was on hand too at the Cologne synagogue where the Kolsche Kippa Kopp had its launch event in 2019. Many journalists and non-Jewish Carnival enthusiasts attended and Knappstein drew the guests’ attention to the guards.

Knappstein restarted the Jewish Carnival club out of a deep sense of belonging to Cologne a city in Western Germany with a tradition of tolerance and a laid-back atmosphere. But due to anti-Semitism even he has contemplated leaving for good for the first time in his life.

It happened in 2019 after a neo-Nazi attempted to carry out a massacre at the synagogue in Halle near Berlin on Yom Kippur. The extremist who has since been tried and sentenced to life in prison filmed himself while unsuccessfully attempting to break into the building when it was full of congregants then killed two people nearby.

Knappstein cried in front of the television when it was reported and began wondering whether Germany is “my place where I would like to stay is this my home” he told JTA. “After Halle I can’t say I’m 100% sure. And I’m very happy I have at least one place to go” he said referencing Israel.

The Kolsche Kippa Kopp’s costumes reflect the dilemma described by Knappstein.

Members wear a pointed hat which is checkered in blue and white the colors of Israel’s flag. The middle part has a fold that is normally closed when the hat is worn but can be opened to reveal a Star of David and the Traveler’s Prayer printed against a background of red – the dominant color in Cologne’s banner.

The choice followed some debate Knappstein said.

“We wanted to have the Star of David but not to wear it on the outside” he explained. “Not because we’re scared but … my grandparents had to wear the Star of David on the outside of the cloth. I don’t want that. It didn’t feel right.”

Knappstein a human resources professional who is gay has been living in the city with his husband for the past 13 years. He declined to elaborate on his own family’s survival of the Holocaust.

“I don’t do that. I don’t talk about that. I promised my mother before she died” he said.

Back in California Chanin hopes to visit the Cologne Carnival in the coming years to see the revival of the tradition that her great-grandfather helped start.

“I think it’s just great that they’re bringing it back it has so much meaning” she said.

Despite some research into her family history Max Solomon’s role as the first president of the original Jewish group of the Cologne Carnival is one of just a handful of facts she knows about him.

“I had no idea about any of this before just a few years ago” she said of his Carnival role. “But now it makes us feel very proud of him.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL211bHRpcGxlLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1icmFuZHMtY2FuY2VsLW1vcmUtc2FpbGluZ3MvNDc4NjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multiple Carnival Cruise Brands Cancel More Sailings,"Carnival-owned cruise brands have canceled further sailings in select regions. Princess Cruises Holland America Line and Seabourn have all announced cancellations across multiple regions including Europe the Caribbean and Mexico depending on the cruise line.

This comes as the situation on resuming cruises remains very fluid. Travel restrictions remain in most countries including the United States where cruise lines are still waiting on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).

With that comes a decentralisation of people from major city catchments to smaller ones and to regional and rural areas — and those people will bring higher incomes and jobs with significant business travel and holiday allowances as well as more inbound travel from visiting friends and relatives. Is commercial aviation ready to meet that demand? Your author whose local airport of Lyon is decidedly regional thinks there’s work to do.

The desire for travel from regional and rural areas even in the late 1990s and early 2000s meant that European low-cost carriers were able to start a travel revolution. With the demand boost that will come from the new remote working and living trend both spoke-to-hub and spoke-to-spoke travel will see growth: travellers will need to travel from their regional homes to major urban areas but also to other regional destinations.

For many airlines this will require a fundamental shift in strategy. Many notionally and so-called national carriers like British Airways and Air France have practically abandoned cities outside their hubs leading to the London Airways and Air Paris sobriquets.

These airlines have choices: continue this abandonment policy work more closely with ground transportation companies including road and rail providers to create low-carbon domestic-to-hub travel or invest in point-to-point travel from regional airports. (Boosting domestic flying is in many cases off the cards for environmental reasons.)

At the airport much work is needed too. Airport operators need to attract global carriers and the time has never been more ripe with the arrival of longer range single-aisle aircraft.

But they also need to get their ground handling act together both in terms of their actual work around baggage turnaround and boarding and in terms of being a positive part of the passenger experience puzzle.

Airports and airlines need to consider whether the contractual relationships they have with ground handlers are adequate for the new influx of travellers: do we need a return to airline-employed station managers? Can airline alliances prove helpful in splitting costs while ensuring standards? Would new quality entrants to the business be helpful? Can airports themselves improve the PaxEx here?

At the airport departure areas need to be modern filled with amenities and offering something unique from food and beverage outlets (another Burger King? No thank you… ) to shopping options. If it’s convenient to pick up a local specialty for the snacks table at the office or as a gift for grandpa then retail will succeed.

Workspace will be absolutely vital in the new remote world with business travellers requiring not just space to sit down and type but also to take the video calls that are already the hallmark of this decade of work. Few airports meet these needs today and real innovation is required to create space that is comfortable easily cleaned private and noise-reducing — with frequent air exchange to avoid stuffiness. Inspiration can be drawn from coworking spaces which run into similar issues but this needs careful thought.

That’s true for airline lounges too where special attention needs to be paid in regional airports. All too often it’s either no lounge at all or some unloved windowless internal space offering the most miserable of snacks and most miserly of drinks with the most impractical seating — not office chairs around desks to enable work nor really comfortable armchairs but the worst of both worlds.

Regional lounge success does exist but it requires some thought and perhaps some partnership working. The last time your author remembers being impressed by a regional lounge innovation was the Air NZ Christchurch turboprop hall offering which was a semi-private space that backed onto a two-sided café that provided the service for the lounge.

Again alliances are one option especially at those regional airports served by multiple carriers but so is working with existing food and beverage outlets. Can an existing restaurant or café provide a lounge-like service for early flights? Can a bar in the evening?

It’s this kind of innovation — in the context of reduced capital investment budgets — that will be key to successfully capturing the increasingly regional and rural travel market.

As China has scheduled 11 launch missions in the next two years for the building of its first space station a private space technology start-up based in Huzhou East China's Zhejiang Province has been keeping its pace close to the national program with an ambitious goal of initiating an orbital space biology lab around 2025 firm founder Cheng Wei told the Global Times on Sunday.It aims to conduct studies relating to changes in humans' vital signs in space to explore the development of future manned space missions while also planning to load a self-generating life support system onboard its lab to study the feasibility of long-term human stays on moon or other extraterrestrial bodies.Named after rocket plus the Greek symbol representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter Cheng's firm Rocket Pi has a four-step framework toward its ambitious goals.A single-function biology experiment platform payload Sparkle-1 is expected to be launched via a Long March carrier rocket by September while a multi-functional platform supporting biological experiments may be put into orbit by 2022. The company will establish a space shuttle-like mode for platform launches during the same period.Next by 2025 reusable payload that is able to shuttle between Earth and celestial bodies will become reality which will provide platforms for in-orbit experiments for biopharmaceutical studies.The company aims to launch a program to build the space biology lab after 2025.Against the backdrop of China putting the construction of a space station which is expected to become operational by 2022 Rocket Pi aims to conduct studies relating to changes in human vital signs in space to explore and support the development of future manned space activities.According to material that the company provided to the Global Times its spacecraft will be very much like China's manned Tiangong-2 space lab  which successfully left orbit and re-entered the atmosphere in July 2019 in a controlled manner after more than 1000 days in service with a small amount of debris falling into a designated security area in the South Pacific Ocean. Most of the spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere.A bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) Yuegong-1 or Lunar Palace is likely to be loaded onto the space lab Cheng told the Global Times on Sunday where it will study the feasibility of long-term human stays on moon or other extraterrestrial bodies.""The moon lab project simulates a lunar base where humans animals plants and microorganisms co-exist in a closed cabin. Oxygen water and food are recycled within the lab creating an Earth-like environment"" said chief designer Liu Hong.During an experiment in 2017-2018 eight volunteers took turns living in the 150-square-meter cabin for 370 days during which time researchers evaluated their physical and mental conditions.Currently smaller BLSS equipment is being studied which could be loaded onto space labs as well as moon and Mars probes in the future.According to Cheng Rocket Pi also plans to launch its first liquid-fuel carrier rocket codenamed Darwin-1 by the end of 2022. The company is also developing a wide range of launch vehicles adopting 10-ton and 65-ton liquid oxygen methane engines to support launches for various payloads of different weights.Darwin-1 will be 24.1 meters high with a 2.25-meter diameter and a launch weight of 42.52 tons. The 500 kilo Newton thrust rocket is capable of sending a payload of 270 kilograms into Low Earth Orbit and the 150 kilogram payload into a sun-synchronous orbit.Cheng said that the role of rockets will drastically transform the future of space exploration from launch vehicles to a means of transport to support a range of new space infrastructure programs including space labs and satellite-based internet networks.In addition such more flexible reusable rockets and the space lab could become a platform for space microbial pharmacy research.By probing the changes of microorganisms in space conditions bioengineering can be applied to a range of products such as the development of vaccines Zhuang Fengyuan an academician of the International Academy of Astronautics told the Global Times on Sunday.""With the rise of a commercial aerospace industry China is about to usher in a rapid development phase for large-scale biotechnology experiments and applications of biological payloads"" noted Zhuang.Andrew Jones a Finland-based journalist for spacenews.com who has been closely following China's space program wrote on Sunday that although it remains ""still very early days"" the company's goal of building a ""space biology laboratory"" to provide commercial space technology products and services for the biomedical industry ""would be something if we start seeing an Earth-moon space economy.""Andrews noted that such a development would suggest China is looking at encouraging or allowing commercial space activities beyond LEO.China has been reportedly considering the establishment of an Earth-moon space economic zone by 2050 with insiders expecting the zone to generate $10 trillion a year.Bao Weimin director of the Science and Technology Commission of the state space giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp revealed the ambitious plan during a seminar on the space economy in November 2019.He pledged to complete basic research and make a breakthrough on key technologies before 2030 and establish the transportation system by 2040.

Sonora CA — Over $710000 worth of stolen equipment including a Caltrans Caterpillar excavator taken from Coulterville were recovered at a Merced chop shop.

The picture in the image box is that stolen Cat earth moving equipment. It was reported taken in early February from a Caltrans downed tree and debris cleanup site on Highway 132 after the wicked winter storms hit the Mother Lode as earlier reported here. Armed with a warrant to look for stolen vehicles members of the Stanislaus County Auto Theft Task Force or StanCATT recently raided an automotive recycling business in the 300 block of Highway 59 in Merced.

Right away and in plain sight deputies spotted the stolen excavator which was being used on the property. A further search of the property uncovered numerous theft items reported stolen out of Madera Merced Stanislaus San Joaquin and Tuolumne counties.

In all investigators found ten confirmed stolen vehicles trailers and heavy machinery totaling about $717000. Slapped with a complaint is Carl Joseph Means 36 of Merced for ten counts of auto theft possession of a stolen vehicle and three counts of operating/maintaining a chop shop.

Of note Means has theft and tax evasion charges dating back to 2013. Most recently in January of 2018 Means entered guilty pleas to felony charges of grand theft and state income tax evasion. As the Plant Manager of a victim’s business the Stanislaus District Attorney’s office charges that Means used his position to secretly transfer raw material from his employer’s facility to a different recycler in Atwater bilking $455000 from the business between August 2013 and May 2016. In that case he was also accused of tax fraud for not declaring the money he made during those years.

Below is the list provided by the Stanislaus Sheriff’s office of the recovered stolen property located at the chop shop:

Tucked away in a high-end Central L.A. neighborhood the area’s walkable shopping strip draws praise from locals as “charming” “pleasant” and an “oasis.”



Now a stretch of 14 storefronts located in a building at 124 ½ to 148 N. Larchmont Blvd. is being renovated by Malibu-based Christina Development Corp. which purchased the property in 2018.



The Larchmont Mercantile project as it’s known is designed by Gensler and CBRE Group Inc.’s Zachary Card and Erik Krasney are leasing the storefronts.



The 17000-square-foot building was developed in 1921 by Julius La Bonte. The sale to Christina marked the first ownership change for the property according to CBRE.



Adam Rosenkranz director of asset management for Christina said the company’s plan from day one was to “repair upgrade and refresh the property.”



He added that Christina was chosen as the buyer because the company wanted to “restore the building to its glory” and not bulldoze it.



“This is one of the most prominent spaces in Larchmont and there’s quite a good deal of history in the project” Rosenkranz said.



Among the changes Christina has on tap are new HVAC electrical systems and upgrades meant to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.



But the storefronts themselves which each measure roughly 1000 square feet will retain much of their current look and feel.



CBRE’s Card said the Larchmont Mercantile was the largest piece of real estate in the area under one owner.



“It’s the first chance for someone to merchandize the street” he said adding that the buildings all having one owner would lead to more cohesion.



In addition to the 14 ground-level storefronts there could be one tenant in the second floor space. Although there is some flexibility that could allow a tenant to sign for more than one storefront Card said it was likely there would be 14 tenants.



No date has been announced for a grand opening but Card said tenants would likely start to occupy the space in the third and fourth quarter of this year.



He’s in the process now of seeking tenants. Leases expired at the end of last year for previous tenants at the property and Rosenkranz said it’s possible some of them could return.



Pedestrian friendly



Larchmont is known for being pedestrian friendly with lots of crosswalks wide sidewalks and parking in the area.



“Larchmont Village is truly one of the very few charming walkable small village corridors in all of Los Angeles. It’s hard to find something like that and replicate it” Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.’s Greg Briest said.



Mark Ventre a senior vice president at Stepp Commercial who used to live near the famed street called Larchmont “an oasis nestled in the heart of Los Angeles. It’s like a mini-Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. It’s a very pleasant place to be.”



Carine Mamann with Cushman & Wakefield Inc. called Larchmont “a little village.”



Card said Larchmont is “the busiest street in L.A. The great thing about Larchmont is it already has the built-in foot traffic that tenants look for.”



The area also has residential density nearby office density and high average household income. Many visitors come from Hancock Park and other affluent communities nearby.



Those factors helped insulate Larchmont from the worst of the coronavirus downturn. Ventre said multifamily rents in the Larchmont area declined about 4% during Covid compared to a drop of more than 8% in greater L.A.



Briest said the area hasn’t seen much retail turnover. Some locations that were vacant prior to the pandemic have remained available he added but much of that vacancy was in the Christina Development project which was planned long before Covid.



Duncan Paterson a principal with Gensler who’s involved in the Larchmont project said it was important to preserve and acknowledge the area’s history and charm in the design of the Larchmont Mercantile.



“Our goal with the project is not only to create modern unique and extraordinary space for retailers but to … repurpose and renovate and bring it to its further glory” he said.



Paterson added that Gensler was getting rid of “false pieces of history” which were added to the building later and was restoring actual historic elements.



Preserving history



The centerpiece of the project he said is the historic part of the building that is being preserved. There are wings on both sides as well.



One major change Paterson said is creating a new way to do signage with a surface application that lights up so tenants are easier to spot.



Gensler is updating the exterior but Paterson said individual tenants would curate the look on the inside of the stores.



Paterson called Christina founder Larry Taylor a “placemaking expert” who was open to ideas and worked to create a property that fit with the rest of the street.



But experts think the street will retain its charm.



“Larchmont is always going to be Larchmont. It is always going to be a good street to shop on … It’s a solid street. It will always be good” Mamann said.



Unlike some other shopping areas in L.A. Larchmont has not been overrun by chain stores.



The street is filled with local favorites and boutique stores some of which have been there for decades and give the street a quaint feel.



“Their mandate is that all of the shops remain local boutique artisan owners. You aren’t going to see a lot of chains. It will never turn into that” Ventre said.



That’s something people involved with the Larchmont Mercantile are focused on.



Rosenkranz said the project’s storefronts “catered to smaller more boutique community-oriented retailers. We want to have smaller focused retailers that are going to really provide a service and a business.”

Villa Del Sol a 203-unit multifamily community in Rolando has been sold for $49.3 million.

A local family that owned the property for over 45 years sold the complex to 29th Street Capital a Chicago-based multifamily investment firm.

Located at 5474 Reservoir Drive Villa Del Sol sits one mile from San Diego State University. Community amenities include a clubhouse fitness center laundry facility swimming pools tennis court and yoga studio.

Kevin Mulhern and Allen Chitayat of CBRE represented the sellers while Scott Peterson Bill Chiles and Brian Cruz of the firm’s debt and structured finance team in San Diego arranged a $40.3 million acquisition loan on behalf of the buyer.

“This was a highly competitive offering which attracted approximately 20 offers from highly qualified buyers” Chitayat said. “In the selection of 29th Street Capital as the purchaser the sellers were impressed with their business plan for the property their strong reputation in the marketplace and their closing track record.”

Peterson said 29th Street Capital has a business plan that will enhance the Villa Del Sol property.

“The 29th Street team sees strong value in the San Diego apartment market and the ability of Villa Del Sol to attract highly qualified renters” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvZGF0YS1jZW50ZXJzLXBvaXNlZC1mb3ItcmVjb3JkLXllYXItb2YtbGVhc2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data Centers Could Have Record Year,"Data centers appear poised for record growth this year.

A recent CBRE report found that demand is strong and preleasing suggests 2021 a sustained surge CNBC reported.

Data centers — essentially large warehouses filled with computing and data storage systems — are measured in power instead of square footage.

“We know that there’s already 500 megawatts of new build coming online now almost 70 percent of which is pre-leased” said CBRE’s Spencer Levy. “And so we do believe that 2021 might be the record year and then we’ll accelerate thereafter.”

The pandemic’s economic volatility prompted companies to freeze their information technology budgets causing demand for data centers to dip 11 percent. Despite that 2020 was still the second-best year on record for leasing according to CBRE. Data center real estate investment trusts were also the best performing REIT sector in the last year.

Digital Realty Trust a $41 billion real estate company and one the country’s largest data-center developers is developing a 600000-square-foot compound. That announcement made in the fall came as it received a major commitment from Bloomberg LP the parent of Bloomberg News.

Levy said that demand for so-called “edge computing” purposes like self-driving cars and remote working outside major cities served by local data centers will accelerate demand moving forward.

Bryson DeChambeau and Lee Westwood hit some of the most wild tee shots you'll ever see a pro hit on the 4th hole at TPC Sawgrass on Sunday. NBC

If you were rooting for some chaos during the final round of the Players Championship you didn’t have to wait long.

After a ho-hum start to the round for Lee Westwood and Bryson DeChambeau in the final pairing the duo stepped to the tee at the par-4 4th hole settling into a groove for their Sunday battle but the swings they produced were anything but championship quality.

DeChambeau took the tee first with a fairway wood in hand but when he made contact with the ball the explosive contact he has been come to be known for was absent. Instead of rocketing off the clubface the ball shot toward the water in front of the tee box with top spin.

“That was nearly a shank” remarked analyst David Feherty.

Close but a cold top might be a better explanation.

Westwood then took the tee with a golden opportunity to create some separation between himself and DeChambeau. He selected a fairway wood as well reared back and made solid contact. Unfortunately the ball flight was nothing near what he had in mind as the ball banana-sliced well right of the fairway and into the water.

“What is that?” said analyst Paul Azinger. “What have we seen?”

With a top and a slice both DeChambeau and Westwood find the water on No. 4. pic.twitter.com/ZAikGR1k5O — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) March 14 2021

DeChmbeau ended up carding a double on the hole while Westwood was able to save bogey.

Next week the South Bend Regional Chamber is bestowing their 2021 Woman of Influence award to Karrah Herring.

It turns out Herring is also reaping a financial reward. REAL News Michiana discovered Herring is the highest paid member of the Governor’s Office. Her annual salary is listed as $164999.90. That’s more than $30000 than Governor Holcomb who is paid $133683. And approximately $17000 more than the next highest paid employee of the Governor’s Office according to public records.

RNM uncovered several disturbing tweets written by Herring around the time she started working for the University of Notre Dame. You can read that entire story here. Below are examples of those tweets.

In January 2011 she referred to “white folk” as corporate criminals.

In September 2011 she wrote “some of these white parents & children have never seen color” referring to private schools.

Also in September of 2011 Herring retweeted someone saying “they are racist heartless White ppl.”

In February 2011 she wrote “I have gotten hit on by so many white boys… I’m NOT fulfilling ur fantasy honey! Pink Penis=No go.”

In August 2010 Herring wrote what appears to be a negative post about the gay community. “A man who constantly complains about women not being wht he needs & not on his level… is gay!”

RNM Reached out to South Bend Regional Chamber President Jeff Rae to get comment about the tweets and the award. Below is his emailed statement:

Prior to the awards process we solicit nominations from the different award categories we receive them and then have a group of volunteers review the nominations and make a recommendation. We had quite a few excellent nominations for the Woman of Influence Award including several for Karrah Herring. After review our committee unanimously chose Mrs. Herring.

We do these awards each year for as far back as our records go. I am proud of our effort to highlight talented individuals and companies in our region. We rely heavily on the input of our volunteers and the experiences they and our team have had with the nominated individuals. We’ve worked with Mrs. Herring for many years in various ways during her time at the University of Notre Dame. We’ve found her to be a dedicated volunteer she’s worked closely with a wide variety of people and in our experience only exhibited warmth and kindness to them all. I personally have never witnessed any of the characteristics you have suggested nor had any of volunteers raise any concerns about Mrs. Herring during any of our discussions or interactions. Instead we only heard positive stories about the inspiration she has been to others and about the positive ways she has influenced others. We’re honoring Mrs. Herring for that good work.

Herring’s position is being paid for by a $250000 grant from the CenterPoint Energy Foundation. According to CenterPoint’s own grant rules the organization does not provide funding to “organizations that discriminate on the basis of race culture gender sexual orientation age or religion.” The organization also claims not to provide funding to “political labor military international or fraternal organizations.”

CenterPoint Energy refused to answer any questions from RNM referring all inquiries to the Governor’s Office.

That private funding may have allowed the Governor to bypass some legislative oversight as well. Since the legislature is responsible for approving budgets it appears this grant may not have needed legislative approval. RNM requested detailed information about the budgeting process for the position from the Governor’s Office and received an old press release that simply said the position was being paid for by the CenterPoint grant. RNM is still seeking more information regarding any legislative oversight. The story will be updated when that information is uncovered.

Republican Governor Eric Holcomb nominated Herring to the newly created position after protests and ensuing riots in Indianapolis following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Minnesota where video captured an officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than 8 minutes. As the Chief Equity Inclusion and Diversity Officer Herring is poised to have one of the most powerful positions in Indiana state government.

According to a news release from the governor’s office in November “The officer will focus on improving state government operations as well as drive systemic change to remove hurdles in the government workplace and services the state provides. Herring will help agencies develop strategic plans to remove any barriers. As a member of the governor’s cabinet Herring will report directly to the governor.”

Before taking the government position Herring held several influential positions at Notre Dame where she started working in 2011. Her last position was as the Director of Public Affairs. She’s also served on “Notre Dame’s Human Resource’s Senior Leadership Team as director of the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX coordinator. In this role Herring provided oversight and support of the university’s efforts to comply with federal and state civil rights laws related to policies prohibiting discrimination harassment and retaliation. Herring created Notre Dame’s affirmative action plans had oversight of employee disability compliance for the campus and oversaw workplace investigations falling under Title VII and Title IX.” According to the Governor’s news release. She received her undergraduate degree from Purdue University. She later earned her law degree from Valparaiso University.

When Holcomb announced the creation of the diversity czar in August 2020 he said the following in a statement:

“This person will be a member of the Governor’s Cabinet – reporting directly to me… this new Cabinet member will help every state agency raise their game.”

REAL News Michiana reached out to Governor Holcomb’s office for comment on Herring’s posts. RNM sent copies of the posts in email and left a voicemail. The Governor’s office never responded.

Herring did not responded to requests for comment either.

Herring’s twitter account is now deactivated.

One of those hard-working Schwabbies is Lily B. who finds the firm helps her strike the right balance between career professional and pandemic parent. Meet Lily.

Question: Lily thanks for your time. Tell us a little bit about your career at Schwab?



Lily: Happy to be here! I have been at Schwab for almost six years. It’s interesting how I found out about the firm. I was a non-traditional student at the University of El Paso Texas I worked full-time and was a full-time student while raising two young children with my husband. I earned a multi-disciplinary studies degree there focusing on education and business. Shortly after graduating I saw Schwab listed at the University’s career fair and wanted to learn more about the firm. The firm’s philosophy of seeing through clients’ eyes and my interest in wanting to make an impact in people’s lives is what made me interested in Schwab.

Question: What do you do at Schwab today?

Lily: I lead teams in El Paso and Orlando with Operational Services Account Solutions. We support account open and maintenance work for Retail Services Advisor Services and Charles Schwab Bank.

Question: You mentioned Schwab’s mission resonates with you. What has kept you at the firm for all these years?

Lily: I like the people at Schwab – we have a true sense of community and willingness to support each other. Professionally I like that we focus on people’s financial futures. And that includes the financial well-being of our clients our colleagues and of ourselves.

I also think that Schwab supports a healthy work life balance. And as a mom of two kids (ages 14 and 11) that’s very important to me. I work hard but I also have the flexibility I need to care for my family. That is especially important during the pandemic when my two children are at home learning online.

Question: In your time at the firm what has stood out to you the most?

Lily: We have a lot of diversity at Schwab. All my leaders have been women and that really speaks volumes to me. The firm is full of strong women leaders and I think they really set an example to all of us… that it is possible to have a successful career and grow a family.

Question: Tell me about your time away from work what do you do for fun?

Lily: Before the pandemic my family and I really loved to travel. But these days I am enjoying introducing my kids to the movies of the 80s and 90s hiking and growing my backyard garden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vdW5jb3ZlcmluZ3BhLmNvbS9tb3VudC1hc3Npc2ktZ2FyZGVuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visiting the the Beautiful Mount Assisi Gardens in Cambria County,"18.4K shares









Located on the outskirts of Saint Francis University in Loretto PA is one of the most beautiful public gardens in the Alleghenies: Mount Assisi Gardens.

Officially known as the Shrines and Sunken Gardens at Mount Assisi this beautiful spot is located on the grounds of the Saint Francis Friary at Mount Assisi on the edge of town and adjacent to the university. However while the grounds are currently a friary they were once owned by one of the most prominent men from America’s industrial age: Charles M. Schwab.

Schwab who was the president of U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel was raised in Loretto PA. While he had a large mansion in New York City he wanted a summer home in Cambria County where he could get away and relax.

The home designed by architect Richard Henry Dana Jr the grandson of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was completed in 1919. It was a modest 44 rooms in size half the size of Schwab’s mansion in New York City. It was known as the Limestone Castle and is an impressive sight to see to this day.

After falling on hard times during the Great Depression Schwab would die heavily in debt and his castle in Loretto was sold. Today it has become the home of a friary and the gardens below the mansion are open to the public throughout the year.

The Mount Assisi Gardens are a bit over 3.5 acres in size and offer the chance to see beautiful flowers fountains religious statues and much more.

The entrance to the gardens and the parking area can be found along St. Francis Drive to the north of the university and the town of Loretto and near to the grave of Prince Gallitzin. The official address for the gardens is 131 St Francis Dr Loretto PA 15940.

Entering the gardens from the parking area feels a bit like entering a secret hideaway thanks to the small metal gate and stone arch through which you enter.

Once inside there are a series of paths that allow you to explore this beautiful space in whatever direction you’d like to head.

The gardens are oval in shape and the two curved ends feature beautiful walkways that pass below a stone structure that’s covered with incredible vines. It really feels like you’ve stepped back several centuries while walking through this space.

In the center of the garden there is a series of small ponds and fountains that leads towards an impressive view of Schwab’s Limestone Castle on the hillside above.

Cascading down the hillside is a beautiful fountain that would create an incredible waterfall if it was on. Unfortunately this fountain appears to be typically (or possibly permanently) turned off. While it’s still a breathtaking scene it would be even more awe-inspiring if the fountain were flowing.

That being said there are several smaller fountains sprinkled around the garden that visitors can enjoy during the warmer months of the year.

While the three spots mentioned above are the undisputable highlights of Mount Assisi Gardens the rest of the space is quite enjoyable for a stroll. Throughout the space you’ll find well-manicured grounds and beautiful plants that are sure to be relaxing. There are also many interesting statues that you can find tucked into corners throughout the gardens.

Ultimately the Mount Assisi Gardens is a beautiful spot to visit if you find yourself near Loretto perhaps traveling along Route 22 or visiting some of the nearby train viewing spots.

While this isn’t somewhere I’d personally travel far out of my way to see it’s a beautiful spot to check out if you are already in Cambria County especially if you love beautiful gardens and horticulture.

But there was a lot of early behind-the-scenes action by the labor department to avoid even one day’s delay — unlike in December when most people on pandemic unemployment began their eight-week wait for additional aid to be added to their accounts. (Some got partial payments after five weeks but others well I am so sorry for all of those who have still not been paid since December — more on that below.)

Whether it was efforts by those on unemployment who reached out to the labor department state legislators Congress and even Gov. Jared Polis or this column someone was listening. (I credit the voices of the unemployed.)

Don’t miss the free weekly newsletter on Colorado jobs and unemployment. Sign up: ColoradoSun.com/getww

Joe Barela CDLE’s executive director said that his team reached out to the U.S. Department of Labor earlier to get permission to continue paying benefits during a possible gap between the two relief plans — and then program the system when guidance arrived. Congress kept the wording simple. And President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act on Thursday a few days before the last one expired. So now no gap is expected.

“It is our top priority right now that we ensure Coloradans experience a seamless transition as they continue to need to be on financial assistance through the unemployment programs” Barela said.

To reiterate from earlier stories here’s what people on unemployment can expect:

Six more months of Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)

$300 per week supplemental pay until Sept. 6

A tax break. The first $10200 in jobless aid received last year is now tax-free for those earning less than $150000.

So how is this supposed to work?

By the time you read this the change should be done. The unemployment computer system was scheduled to go offline at 7 p.m. Friday and be back up at 3 a.m. Those who use up their last week of federal benefits by Saturday can go ahead and request a payment Sunday. That will exhaust their account.

However courtesy of the American Rescue Act an additional 29 weeks will be added to eligible accounts. Phil Spesshardt acting director of the state’s Unemployment Insurance Division said some testing still needs to be done to make sure the new programming takes.

But even if the additional weeks show up in accounts no one can claim them until next weekend since the new relief plan doesn’t go into effect until March 15 — and you can’t get paid for days in the future.

The “no gap” story may be different for folks who still haven’t been paid at all or still have issues in Phase 1 or 2. And if you were on PUA in early February 2020 there may be a gap in payments. More below as I address updates and other unemployment news.

UPDATE March 13: It worked! A reader shared a screenshot showing the 29 weeks showed up in her account this morning:

→ What’s with the 29 weeks? The new relief plan has a hard-stop on Sept. 6 which is 26 weeks from now. But the actual law (read it here) extends pandemic unemployment for 29 weeks so those on PUA or PEUC can get up to 79 weeks. That means unless a new relief plan is passed some folks on unemployment will still have benefits left when the program ends on Labor Day. CDLE officials say the difference is due to changes made by the Senate to end the program on Sept. 6 rather than three weeks later which the House’s version proposed.

Jobs: Charter’s minimum wage now $18/hour

With the new aid package passed it seems like a relief to start talking again about jobs. So Charter Communication’s decision to increase its starting wage caught my eye.

Charter isn’t the main cable provider in the Front Range — it does provide service on the Western Slope. But it also has a large technology operation in Greenwood Village plus a call center in Colorado Springs.

If you work at Charter wages start at $18 an hour plus benefits as of this week. The plan is to get to $20 an hour by 2022 nationwide according to the company.

Offering competitive wages was critical to attract tech workers in Colorado especially before the pandemic when unemployment rates were near record lows. But that strategy didn’t change too much in the past year said Bret Picciolo a Charter spokesman.

“While COVID has created some short-term obstacles that have forced us to innovate the ways we recruit the goal behind our increased starting wages is long term” he said. “Over the last year we have been successful in attracting many talented candidates. However our approach is not only about attracting candidates but also retaining quality employees who can build a career with Charter.”

Most of the 140+ job openings in Charter’s Greenwood Village facilities are not entry-level jobs per se. Most roles are technical and start above $50000 and get into six figures. Even tech internships start at $18.50.

The company is constantly looking for people to fill customer-service jobs in Colorado Springs. And those have entry-level friendly qualifications: a high school diploma or GED and preferably six months of experience in customer service and working with computers. Customer service supervisor jobs start at $41200. And here’s a tip from Picciolo: New hires typically work in the office to get additional training but the majority have been working remotely.

Charter began increasing its minimum wage to $15 in 2015. That was around the same time Amazon also bumped up its starting pay to $15 but after Target announced its goal to get to $15 by 2020. Denver’s minimum wage is now $14.77 an hour and goes to $15.87 on Jan. 1 2022.

If you haven’t been keeping track of what is happening in the U.S. the national minimum wage is still $7.25 where it’s been since 2009. While President Joe Biden hoped to tuck a $15 minimum wage into the new COVID relief bill he backed away. But with the new administration I’m sure the discussion will return.

A handful of unemployed people emailed this past week well every week that their benefits are still on hold and they haven’t been paid for weeks or months.

Some were caught in the software glitches of rolling out Phase 1 and 2. The top MyUI+ issues are now posted on the state’s daily dashboard which may be more valuable than calling the customer support line at 303-536-5615.

(And if you get bad info from a call center agent fill out this form to rat on them. If users call out agents by name CDLE will provide extra training to the person or discipline them if necessary Smith said.)

The “double-dip” glitch affecting people whose benefit year has ended causing them to reapply for a new year was scheduled to be fixed on Friday. I began hearing from some folks that they got paid by Thursday so the glitch was fixed. Then I heard from others that it was not. On Friday the dashboard shared an update: Double dips were not yet fixed.

“We have discovered a portion of the population affected by this issue did not get fixed as expected and we are actively working to rectify the issue” the dashboard says.

So … more waiting. But at least the dashboard may provide some comfort that CDLE is aware of an issue.

At least the amount of time spent waiting on hold for a call center agent has been in steady decline according to CDLE data. On March 8 callers were on hold for one hour and 14 minutes. By Thursday it was 15 minutes. And on Friday it was hold on “only 15 seconds!” Smith said.

The on-hold times to get through to a one of Colorado’s unemployment call center agents dropped to 15 minutes on March 11 according to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Back to the CDLE Dashboard

But notice that the MyUI+ issues page is only about MyUI+. If your account is held up in a fraud hold you won’t see any resolution in the works on the issues page.

For those other issues check out the FAQ page and the How Do I page advised Jessica Hudgins Smith press secretary for the Division of Unemployment Insurance. That’s where you’ll find information on:

1099-Gs: All 1099 forms have been mailed. Use this link to request another copy. For those who recently verified their ID through IDme the 1099-G is in the process of being printed and mailed Smith said. The 1099s availability online is only for PUA claims.

All 1099 forms have been mailed. Use this link to request another copy. For those who recently verified their ID through IDme the 1099-G is in the process of being printed and mailed Smith said. The 1099s availability online is only for PUA claims. Denials : A PUA claim is denied if someone says their unemployment isn’t a direct result of the pandemic. Claims are also denied if one answered a question incorrectly; physically or mentally unable to work; not completing work-search activities.

A PUA claim is denied if someone says their unemployment isn’t a direct result of the pandemic. Claims are also denied if one answered a question incorrectly; physically or mentally unable to work; not completing work-search activities. Program integrity holds: These are the fraud holds where the user needs to request a link to IDme verification. But if you’ve done it why is your account still on hold? That takes me to …

4000 claims still on hold

Then there are people who haven’t been paid since December. Many are still caught up in these program identity issues or fraud holds. So far this year CDLE emailed 442752 users the ID verification link to IDme. Of those 57945 have been released. That’s about 13% cleared. (Apparently not all recipients even completed the IDme process.)

“There are 4000 that require further investigation” Spesshardt said. “Just because an individual successfully passes IDme does not guarantee 100% that we are going to release the hold right away.”

He offered one example: If IDme concludes you are deceased.

“We’re not going to pay you. It requires additional confirmation on our behalf and by the way if it’s showing that you are deceased and you actually are not the fraudster you have bigger problems than just trying to have everything clear through us” he said suggesting someone in that situation better check with the Social Security Administration as well.

Of those 4000 holds about 2800 had information that didn’t match up to what the labor department has on the user’s account. That’ll take CDLE staff additional analysis to verify users.

Spesshardt said CDLE hopes to hire a new vendor to help with the backlog. “But again that number changes every day” he added.

Odds and ends

→ No more Phase 3. Hello Phase 2B.1? There is no more Phase 3 or 4 which was supposed to include mixed earners and those with complicated histories. CDLE is instead calling these “optimizations” because they affect “small populations of claimants” and not the majority of the unemployed Smith said.

→ Mixed earners: The extra $100 per week promised in the December round of benefits still has no ETA Smith said. It’s also not part of the new federal relief plan. Updated on March 15 mixed earners are part of the new American Rescue Plan until Sept. 6. An estimated 2000 people who had $5000 in regular income will qualify for the $100 Spesshardt said in an correction on March 15.

→ Missing SEB payments: You know who you are all you State Extended Benefits people. Those who did not apply for PUA after Nov. 28 but could have “will be captured in future deployments as we continue to reprogram our systems to recognize these particular backdates. We hope to deploy these fixes soon. (American Rescue Plan) will not disrupt this effort” Smith said.

Another Saturday another blizzard. If you get terribly bored The Colorado Sun has a whole archive of unemployment stories — not to mention just plain ol’ Colorado news stories that may be of interest. Hang in there folks and have a safe weekend. ~tamara

This week a team led by the Judiciary Principal Communications Officer Mr Solomon Muyita kicked off the sensitization drive at Mpigi High Court and the Chief Magistrates Court.

The team further proceeded to Buwama Magistrates Court where they engaged the public and sensitized them on the different initiatives in place aimed at improving access to justice.

These included Plea Bargaining in criminal matters Alternative Dispute Resolution and Small Claims Procedure for civil disputes and the new Judiciary Client Service Charter.

Mr Muyita enlightened the public on the Judiciary Client Charter saying it was a social contract by the Judiciary to uphold professionalism transparency accountability equality and independence while dealing with court users.

In response to questions on bail Mr Muyita elaborated on the process of how this can be done. He equally highlighted on the complaints management mechanisms in the Judiciary.

The Mpigi High Court Judge Anthony Oyuko Ojok commended efforts of the team in helping to demystify court operations to the public.

The other court officials who participated in the sensitization drive included the Ag Deputy Registrar and Mpigi Chief Magistrate Ruth Nabaasa; and Magistrates Grade One: Adams Byarugaba (Mpigi) and Susan Awidi (Buwama).

It was also noted that the courts face a lot of challenges in the administration of justice. For Mpigi High Court and Chief Magistrate Court there is inadequate equipment such as computers insufficient space for offices and court halls and lacks an alternative power source and a station vehicle for the Chief Magistrate who also doubles as the Acting Deputy Registrar. In addition only one Secretary serves all the Judicial officers both at the High Court Circuit (2) and the CM court (5).

Buwama Magistrates Court faces similar challenges like Mpigi in addition to understaffing and delays in producing inmates from Kitalya Prison which according to HW Awidi can take about three to 10 weeks as a result of the ever since COVID-19 pandemic.

The Krejci Dump operated as a salvage yard and waste disposal facility in Boston Township from the 1940s to 1980 receiving solid and hazardous wastes from nearby cities towns and companies. At the time dumps were largely unregulated and toxic materials were buried in unlined pits and seeped into the environment.

CVNP acquired the property in 1985. The park partnered with the U.S. and Ohio environmental protection agencies and closed the site to the public in 1986 initiating a comprehensive investigation after realizing the scale of pollution. The level of contamination qualified the site for cleanup under the Superfund law.

According to the park service several corporations were found to have disposed industrial waste at the site including Ford Motor Co. General Motors Chrysler 3M and Chevron. Under the Superfund law parties that disposed hazardous materials at the site were liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up contamination the park service said.

More: Final restoration to begin soon at former toxic dump in Cuyahoga Valley park

In a multi-year cleanup process the park service worked with Ford Motor Co. the lead corporation involved in the cleanup to recontour and revegetate the site with native grasses and wildflowers reestablish natural wetlands and restore wildlife habitat. That work was largely completed in 2014.

Since then the park service — which issued a certification of completion to Ford after it completed the removal of all contaminated material from the site — said it's monitored the restoration to ensure its success and long-term effectiveness.

The park service said the effort set a legal precedent that cleaned up the Krejci Dump site as well as other National Park Service sites across the country. Ultimately the responsible parties paid more than $50 million to remove the toxins and restore the property. The park service certified the work as completed in December 2020.

“The completion of the remediation and restoration work necessary to eliminate public health risks and the impairment of park resources marks a great achievement for Cuyahoga Valley National Park and everyone who has been involved in this long process” Acting Park Superintendent Lisa Petit said in a statement. ""Together we have completely removed one of the most toxic Superfund sites in the national park system and made it safe for the public to enjoy.""

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Pastor John-Paul Miller 44 was released from his duties at Solid Rock at Market Common Church in Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

His wife Mica Miller 30 was found dead at Lumbee River State Park in North Carolina on April 27 from a self inflicted gunshot wound.

An email seen by News13 said: 'I Charles Randall by the authority vested in me as overseer hereby release Pastor John-Paul Miller from all ministerial functions for a time of healing counsel and guidance pursuant to our governing instrument.'

Weeks before her passing she shared a video speaking about abuse within marriage as claims emerge she was being harassed and was 'afraid for her life'.

Weeks before her passing she shared a video speaking about abuse within marriage as claims emerge she was being harassed and was 'afraid for her life'

Miller who has a criminal record including multiple counts of aggravated assault and battery to which he pleaded guilty told his congregation that her death was 'self-induced'

Miller who has a criminal record including multiple counts of aggravated assault and battery to which he pleaded guilty told his congregation that her death was 'self-induced.'

'You all know she wasn't well mentally and that she needed her medicine and it was hard to get to her' he said.

Prior to making the announcement he asked his flock to stand and instructed them to 'leave church quietly and don't talk about the announcement here in the building.'

'I'm taking a little bit of a break it might be a few days or weeks. I got a call last night my wife has passed away yeah it was self-induced [...] I'm just kind of going on adrenaline' Miller's husband said.

An obituary penned by him also described his wife as 'a great stepmother and an amazing wife and helpmate' and portrayed her as his biggest cheerleader.

Miller had called authorities before taking her own life telling them: 'I'm about to kill myself and I just want my family to know where to find me'.

Officers were sent to the state park where he body was found with authorities confirming on Monday she died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police said that throughout the call she remained calm asking the dispatcher if her phone could be tracked.

In the days after her death her friends and family held a rally calling for 'justice for Mica' outside the Solid Rock Church where Pastor Miller 44 works.

An email shared

Court filings indicate she had served her husband with divorce papers just weeks before her death

Weeks before she died Mica posted an emotional video in which she spoke of abuse within marriage and offered support to 'ANYONE struggling with leaving a dangerous situation because they think God will be 'mad' at them.'

She said: 'Today my heart's a little heavy. I've had lots of women that have reached out to me about situations of abuse and I just want to tell you what a lot of people have told me lately because I think I forgot.

'But you are the bride of Christ before anybody else's male or female it doesn't matter what gender you are abuse is abuse.'

On Monday before her cause of death was announced ABC reported that Mica had filed police reports against a man - whose name was redacted in the reports - in March accusing him of harassing her.

She had told officers that she was 'afraid for her life' had found a tracking device on her car and had her tires repeatedly deflated.

In the days since Mica's death on April 27 her family had pushed back at her husband's explanation of it as suicide.

Speaking to DailyMail.com last week Mica's sister Sierra Brown said: 'The one thing I would say is that he has said it was an official suicide that is not the case. There's still an open investigation.'

Mica's death came just 48 hours after her husband from whom she had been separated for one month was served with divorce papers.

Mica previously shared a video speaking about abuse within marriage to pastor John-Paul Miller 44 (pictured) as claims emerge she was allegedly being harassed

Court records hint at the tumult within the marriage with Mica first filing for divorce back in October 2023 before withdrawing the filing February 12.

Later that same month Miller filed against his wife for Separate Support and Maintenance in a motion withdrawn March 11.

But on April 15 just 12 days before she was found dead Mica filed once more and according to friends also sought a no contact order against her husband.

Her friends Kenn and Allicia Young have also now insisted on NewsNation that Mica did not take her own life.

Allicia Young who is a member of the Solid Rock Church alongside her husband Kenn said: 'I absolutely do not believe that she took her own life.'

'I absolutely do not believe that she took her own life because she was energetic and her faith in God was unwavering' Allicia said on Banfield.

'She was always quick to encourage somebody else including myself. We went to lunches together we worked out together.'

In an interview with ABC15 Miller reiterated that his wife had taken her own life.

'She had struggled with suicide before' he said. 'Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor and we got through it and everything was fine.

'She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video. She battled suicide but God took care of her and got her through it.'

He added she was 'probably the greatest wife anyone could ask for' and described nights spent talking to each other for hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9yYXBoby10b3duc2hpcC10ZWVuLWtpbGxlZC1pbi10aHVyc2RheS1oaXQtYW5kLXJ1bi1hY3RpdmUtaW4tY2h1cmNoLWNvbW11bml0eS9hcnRpY2xlXzg5MDdmNjRjLTBjYWMtMTFlZi1iODhjLThiNTMwMDUzNWVkYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rapho Township teen killed in Thursday hit and run active in church community,"The Rapho Township teenager killed in a hit and run last week will be remembered as someone who was active in his church and community.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

Menurutnya bela negara tidak lagi hanya sebatas kekuatan fisik militer saja sebab ancaman terhadap kedaulatan negara hadir dari beragam aspek seperti ekonomi sosial budaya politik ideologi dan ancaman lainnya yang bersifat soft power.

""Spektrum konsepsi bela negara juga harus dimaknai dari sudut pandang yang lebih luas dan komprehensif. Menjaga dan melestarikan kebudayaan bangsa agar tidak diklaim oleh negara lain adalah bela negara. Menjaga kedaulatan pangan nasional adalah bela negara. Mengkampanyekan gerakan 'cinta produk dalam negeri' adalah bela negara. Menggalang aksi sosial kemanusiaan di masa pandemi COVID-19 adalah bela negara"" ujar Bamsoet dalam keterangannya Sabtu (13/3/2021).

Hal tersebut ia ungkapkan dalam Rapat Pimpinan Pusat (Rapimpus) ke-3 Forum Komunikasi Putra-Putri Purnawirawan TNI-Polri (FKPPI) di Jakarta kemarin (12/3).

Ketua DPR RI ke-20 ini menjelaskan konstitusi Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945 (UUD NRI 1945) mengamanatkan pada Pasal 27 Ayat (3) bahwa Setiap warga negara berhak dan wajib ikut serta dalam upaya pembelaan negara. Dipertegas lagi pada Pasal 30 Ayat (1) yang menyatakan bahwa 'Tiap-tiap warga negara berhak dan wajib ikut serta dalam usaha pertahanan dan keamanan negara.

""Menggambarkan bahwa upaya bela negara selain sebagai hak dan kewajiban dasar juga harus dimaknai sebagai kehormatan bagi setiap warga negara yang dilaksanakan dengan penuh tanggung jawab semangat pengabdian dan sikap rela berkorban demi kepentingan bangsa dan negara. Bela negara adalah tanggung jawab setiap warga negara yang hanya akan berdaya guna secara optimal jika setiap elemen saling bergotong royong"" tutur Bamsoet.

Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila ini menambahkan konsep ideal konstitusi yang bangsa Indonesia bangun dan perjuangkan adalah konstitusi yang merujuk pada dua aspek. Pertama konstitusi yang 'hidup' untuk menjawab segala tantangan zaman dan dilaksanakan secara nyata dalam kehidupan bernegara. Kedua konstitusi yang 'bekerja' sebagai pedoman dalam setiap pengambilan kebijakan di kehidupan bermasyarakat berbangsa dan bernegara.

Surat-surat cinta sepasang kekasih di masa Perang Dunia Kedua ditemukan di bawah lantai papan sebuah hotel di tepi laut.

Catatan tulisan tangan dan berbagai obyek lainnya peninggalan masa perang itu ditemukan selama renovasi di Hotel Esplanade di Scarborough Inggris.

Pasangan kekasih itu yang namanya tak diketahui menyatakan cinta mereka satu sama lain.

Sang pria dalam surat itu menulis: ""Oh sayang aku sangat kesepian tanpamu"".

Para sejarawan meminta bantuan untuk mencari tahu informasi lebih lanjut tentang pasangan kekasih tersebut.

Surat-surat mereka ditemukan di bawah ruang cuci berukuran kecil di lantai pertama hotel tersebut.

Beberapa puisi tulisan tangan dan benda lain — termasuk potongan tiket bungkus rokok dan bungkus coklat — juga ditemukan.

Perkumpulan arkeologi dan sejarah Scarborough telah meneliti materi tersebut dan mengatakan bahwa benda-benda itu berasal dari antara tahun 1941 hingga 1944.

Pada tahun-tahun itu hotel tersebut diminta oleh otoritas militer untuk menyediakan akomodasi bagi antara lain tentara yang sedang berlatih.

Marie Woods dari perkumpulan itu mengatakan memiliki bukti bahwa beberapa anggota skuadron dan kompi pernah tinggal di Esplanade antara lain dari unit terowongan sinyal relawan serta korps senapan dari Angkatan Darat Inggris.

Woods mengatakan satu-satunya petunjuk dari nama pasangan itu adalah M — inisial perempuan yang menandatangani selembar surat tetapi lainnya ""digigit tikus"".

Alamat pengirim pada catatan lainnya menunjukkan alamat perempuan itu yaitu di 50 Dellburn Street di Motherwell Lanarkshire.

Jeffrey Talpins one of the highest earning hedge fund managers in 2017 according to Forbes founded Element Capital Management in 2005 within Proxima Alfa Investments and then spun it off in 2009 which has grown into one of the biggest hedge funds that uses a global macro investing strategy. The fund is based in New York and London. Before Proxima Alfa Jeffrey Talpins honed his investment acumen at Citigroup’s Fixed Income Options franchise where he was a Head Trader.

Its investment philosophy has proven to be very smart as the fund delivered returns of more than 21% per year through the end of 2018. When many other hedge funds were struggling through 2016 with average returns of 2.3% Element Capital brought back 19.4%. In 2015 which was even worse for the average macro-oriented fund (which lost 1.2%) Element Capital Management gained 23%. 2017 was also a good year for the fund as it returned 5.46% to give it average returns of 15.61% between 2015 and 2017 placing it 23rd on Barron’s 2018 list of the top 100 Hedge Funds.

While Jeffrey Talpins' stock-picking strategy is working the broader hedge fund industry is struggling. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Let’s start our list of Jeffrey Talpins' top 10 stock picks.

10. Health Assurance Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: HAACU)

Value: $22040000 Percent of Jeffrey Talpins' 13F Portfolio: 2.3% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

A total of 20 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish HAACU at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Element Capital Management owns 2 million shares of the company worth $22 million.

According to its press release ""Health Assurance Acquisition Corp. is a newly organized blank check company sponsored by General Catalyst and established by Hemant Taneja Quentin Clark Stephen Klasko MD MBA Anita V. Pramoda Jennifer Schneider MD and Glen Tullman for the purpose of effecting a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities"". The SPAC raised $500 million from investors during the fourth quarter.

Hedge funds are taking advantage of the retail investors' SPAC craze by buying into these offerings at $10 and generating higher returns than that are offered by low-risk fixed income securities. Four of Jeffrey Talpins' top 10 stock picks are blank check companies. The next stock in Talpins' 13F portfolio is also another SPAC.

9. Gores Holdings V Inc. (NASDAQ: GRSV)

Value: $23400000 Percent of Jeffrey Talpins' 13F Portfolio: 2.44% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 28

Element Capital Management is one of the 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey having stakes in GRSV at the end of the fourth quarter. The fund owns over 2.25 million shares of the company.

In February GRSV entered into an agreement with Ardagh Group S.A a global supplier of infinitely-recyclable metal beverage and glass packaging for the world's leading brands to combine with Ardagh's metal packaging business that will be held by Ardagh Metal Packaging. According to the company's press release ""Ardagh will retain an approximately 80% stake in AMP and receive up to $3.4 billion in cash in the transactions. Oliver Graham CEO of Ardagh Metal Beverage will be CEO of AMP. Paul Coulson Chairman and CEO of Ardagh will serve as Chairman and Shaun Murphy COO of Ardagh will serve as Vice Chairman of the Company following the closing of the transaction"".

Investors didn't like this announcement much as GRSV's stock price declined by about 10% over the last month.

Value: $24345000 Percent of Jeffrey Talpins' 13F Portfolio: 2.54% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 53

The company is getting the attention of the smart money as 53 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in the company at the end of the fourth quarter up from 46 funds a quarter earlier.

Among these funds Coatue Management held the most valuable stake in Dynatrace Inc. (NYSE:DT) which was worth $279.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was SRS Investment Management which amassed $271 million worth of shares. HMI Capital Citadel Investment Group and Matrix Capital Management were also very fond of the stock becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position HMI Capital allocated the biggest weight to Dynatrace Inc. (NYSE:DT) around 10.34% of its 13F portfolio. Shannon River Fund Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock earmarking 7.82 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to DT.

DT shares returned nearly 50% over the last four months.

7. TPG Pace Tech Opportunities Corp. (NYSE: PACE)

Value: $24420000 Percent of Jeffrey Talpins' 13F Portfolio: 2.54% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 32

A total of 32 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish PACE at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Element Capital Management owns 2.2 million shares of the company worth $24.4 million.

PACE is the third blank check stock in billionaire Talpins' top 10 stock picks. To be honest we could have also invested in SPACs and recommended them to our subscribers if there weren't a ton of stocks that were trading at deeply discounted prices because of the coronavirus induced pandemic. Talpins paid $10 a share for his PACE holdings and the stock currently trade at $10.39. That's not too shabby in a market where the short-term bonds yield next to nothing.

Value: $26125000 Percent of Jeffrey Talpins' 13F Portfolio: 2.72% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 38

Jeffrey Talpins' Element Capital Management is one of the 38 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey having stakes in CONX at the end of the fourth quarter. The fund owns over 2.5 million shares of the company. CONX is the fourth and the last SPAC among Talpins' top 10 13F holdings. The next stock in Talpins' portfolio is a tech giant that we expect to outperform the market by a large margin over the next couple of years.

Translators for Elders started as a project for a winter term course they took called Crowdsourcing Social Localization and Translation. Bartlett says Professor Adam Wooten gave them complete freedom on the types of projects we wanted to do. The Asian American Senior Association of Pennsylvania (AASAPA) immediately came to Zhang’s mind. AASAPA is a nonprofit organization advocating for senior citizens where Zhang has served as its Chairperson of the Board and knows first-hand the need for language help in the community.

“The elders often need help translating documents for them” Zhang says “including medical immigration legal tax utility or financial information. There have been numerous times when older adults had to miss their doctor visits or opportunities to get involved in activities due to not understanding the correspondence mailed to them. This can lead to physical and mental illness.” TFE’s mission is to help the elderly as well as low-income families and anyone in need to overcome the language barrier. “We strive to provide high-quality translations at no cost to anyone in need starting with Chinese and Spanish translations.” In February 2021 TFE was approved by the Institute leadership as an Immersive Professional Learning initiative (IPL). Zhang says that through her professional and non-profit experiences she started realizing the importance of getting the right training in language translation and interpretation. “Although I have successfully interpreted for conferences trade talks and negotiations I feel that language learning is a life-long journey that should never cease. Not all language programs are created equally. The translation and translation and interpretation and translation and localization management programs at MIIS clearly stand out among others. The programs will perfect my language skills and equip me with techniques required professionally. Middlebury’s excellent faculty team—from academic expertise to career advisory—topped with its vast network of resources for graduates are deciding factors that brought me to the Middlebury Institute.”

There have been numerous times when older adults had to miss their doctor visits or opportunities to get involved in activities due to not understanding the correspondence mailed to them. This can lead to physical and mental illness. — Meng Zhang (Barbara) MATI '22

Bartlett studied Anthropology French and Spanish as an undergraduate. “I always knew I wanted to continue my education along the same path but I had no idea how to or what localization even was at the time. I’ve always loved learning other languages and using them as a tool to connect with people that I never would have known otherwise. I entered the working world for a few years and got experience working with people from all over the world in a library setting assisting immigrants in navigating the US naturalization process and facilitating programs for kids of all ages in English and Spanish. Through that work the massive need for more cultural humility openly multilingual settings and generally equalizing the opportunities and resources available for all people here in the States became painfully apparent. I decided to pursue a career in which I could leverage my background within a managerial or administrative role to encourage a shift in the current norm of workplace dynamics. The TLM degree at the Institute is the ideal track to explore different roles and build the necessary skills to take on any job in the industry. “ Translators for Elders will be an ongoing project at Crowdin.com. As a crowdsourcing translation project it will engage MIIS students as well as linguists and localization professionals worldwide to participate in and become part of the TFE translation community. As Bartlett explains volunteers choose what they would like to do and roles include: pre-translation preparer translator post-editor reviewer project manager logo designer. TFE is a fully registered nonprofit organization at the State and Federal level. Bartlett and Zhang say everyone is welcome to join TFE now and be part of the growth of this exciting startup. At this moment they are running off of donations and the IPL funding from the Institute.

Zhang and Bartlett are hosting a Translate-a-thon on March 20 2021 to raise awareness for the initiative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L3N0aW11bHVzLWNoZWNrLTIwMjEtd3JvbmctYmFuay1hY2NvdW50cy1jb3ZpZC1yZWxpZWYtcGF5bWVudHMvNDY5MTQ2NzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stimulus check 2021: IRS deposits some payments in wrong bank accounts,"Some Americans say their government checks were deposited in the wrong bank accounts this weekend forcing many of them to wait longer for the badly needed aid after struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Those taxpayers were surprised to see that the last four digits of their bank account numbers were incorrect when they checked their payment status on the IRS website an issue that happened during the first two rounds of direct payments when technical glitches from third-party tax preparers caused delays for many filers.

Some taxpayers are frustrated that they might have to wait for a paper check in the mail while others still haven’t received a dime of the second payment that was supposed to arrive months ago.

When USA TODAY contacted the IRS the agency directed all questions to the FAQ page for its “Get My Payment” tool.

If a filer’s bank information is invalid or the account has been closed the bank will return the payment to the IRS and the agency will mail a check to the address on file the IRS says on its website.

When will I get my third check? IRS begins sending first round of $1400 COVID-19 relief payments

Where is my payment? IRS updates 'Get My Payment' tool with information on new COVID-19 payments

Lori Young 52 didn’t recognize the bank account destination for her third check.

The retired nurse who lives in Camden South Carolina receives Social Security disability benefits. She received her first $1200 Economic Impact Payment last spring but she never got a second $600 check in December after the wrong bank account information appeared on the IRS “Get My Payment” tool the government’s tracking portal.

Young has received Social Security benefits via direct deposit for five years and she hasn't changed her bank account.

Her $1400 payment showed the wrong bank account information on the agency’s tool as her medical bills are piling up. She has fibromyalgia a chronic pain condition rheumatoid arthritis and is being tested for multiple sclerosis.

“I’m very frustrated. I have so many bills to pay” Young said. “I have a steady income with my Social Security but I have a lot of medical issues. I was relying on these stimulus checks to help me pay off my bills.”

What we know

The issue with wrong bank accounts popped up among filers in the first two rounds who had set up a tax advance in previous years when filing returns tax professionals said. The IRS and tax partners took steps to redirect stimulus payments to the correct account for those affected the agency said.

It’s unclear why the wrong account information showed up again for Young. For filers who didn't receive a payment in the first two rounds or received less money than they were eligible for they may be eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 returns the IRS said.

Young filed a return for 2020 to claim the rebate for her second payment and is still waiting for her refund she said.

The third round of stimulus checks started hitting bank accounts for eligible Americans this weekend after the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law Thursday.

The IRS bases the third round of checks off tax returns from 2020 or 2019 whichever is more recent.

In the coming weeks more batches of payments will be sent via direct deposit and through the mail as a check or debit card according to the agency. Some people may see the direct deposit payments as “pending” or as provisional payments in their accounts before the official payment date of March 17 the IRS said.

Social Security and other federal beneficiaries will generally receive this third payment the same way as their regular benefits the IRS said. A payment date for this group is to be announced soon.

In the prior rounds if the IRS didn't have routing and account information for a direct deposit taxpayers would be sent either a check or an EIP debit card. Paper checks and debit cards require more processing and mailing time.

'Payment status not available'

Some people may receive the message “payment status not available” when checking the IRS site.

""If you get this message either we have not yet processed your payment or you are not eligible for a payment"" the IRS said.

If that happens filers should check to make sure they meet the requirements for the money. Filers must have a Social Security number that is valid for employment and are a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien.

The payments amount to $1400 for a single person or $2800 for a married couple filing jointly plus an additional $1400 for each dependent child. Individuals earning up to $75000 get the full payments as do married couples with incomes up to $150000. Payments decline for incomes above those thresholds phasing out above $80000 for individuals and $160000 for married couples.

Some can't update banking information

Some people have run into issues updating their bank account information with the IRS.

Ryan Deckard who lives in Pittsburgh received the first payment but he never got a second one after the “Get my Payment” tool showed an account that was no longer active for him.

When tax season kicked off this year he filed his 2020 return with TurboTax on the first day – Feb. 12 – to make sure his bank account information was updated with the IRS. He claimed the Recovery Rebate Credit to get his second payment.

When he went online to check the status of his third relief check his old account information still showed up on the agency’s website.

“I’ve been in the throes of a meltdown. I’m tired of going to bed hungry” said Deckard 33 an unemployed author.

“Why can’t I change my banking information? The government shouldn’t be blindly sending money to closed bank accounts” Deckard said. “It seems like the people who need the money most can’t get it.”",,,,,,,,,

Mickelson plays on amid news of U.S. probe into possible insider trading – Reuters

Authorities Find Insider Trading Case Tied to Phil Mickelson Is Slow to Take Shape – New York Times

Those were the headlines from around the business world a couple weeks ago linking Phil Mickelson to insider trading. Mickelson emphatically denied that he did any wrongdoing but the reports had certainly painted the picture that golf’s beloved left-hander had been involved in nefarious activity.

Now it appears that all those reports linking Mickelson to insider trading were off the pace.

The New York Times was one of the outlets that initially reported Mickelson’s wonderfully timed purchase of Clorox stock. Now a new report in the Times says that their initial story and the stories from outlets like Reuters and WSJ were “overstated.”

Phil Mickelson the famed golfer did not trade in the shares of Clorox just as the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn was mounting an unsolicited takeover bid for the company in 2011 say four people briefed on the matter. Recent reports in The New York Times and other news organizations said that Clorox was among the stocks that federal authorities were examining as part of a two-year investigation into well-timed trades made by Mr. Mickelson and the sports gambler William T. Walters. Initially authorities pursued a theory that Mr. Icahn shared private details of his Clorox bid with Mr. Walters who then traded on the information and passed on the tip to Mr. Mickelson. Although Mr. Icahn and Mr. Walters remain under investigation over Clorox the F.B.I. and the Securities and Exchange Commission have found no evidence that Mr. Mickelson traded Clorox shares. The overstated scope of the investigation came from information provided to The Times by other people briefed on the matter who have since acknowledged making a mistake.

That’s a loooooooooong ways from the previous Crypto Engine review that spoke about the investigation into Mickelson’s trading and said “some of which were options contracts to buy Clorox stock.” Now it’s clear that the FBI and SEC are still interested in Mickelson’s cooperation in some kind of open investigation. However this is a stunning admission of jumping the gun from an outlet as respected as the New York Times. Furthermore how did multiple industry standards “overstate” Mickelson’s role in this probe and the trade of Clorox stock? It’s incomprehensible and you can make your own judgment as to what it says about our current reporting climate.

Reports are missed and corrections are made. These things happen in the reporting world although everyone strives for accuracy. But usually in the sports world we are used to those reports circling around things like free agent signings or things of that nature connected to the games. Not federal investigations!

Who were the Times’ sources on this that made such a glaring and crucial mistake? Dan Marino?

He was 79.

“A great friend and mentor to many at Notre Dame throughout Chicagoland across the country and around the world Jack epitomized what it means to be a loyal son of Our Lady’s University” Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins C.S.C. said. “His sage advice fighting spirit and infectious personality made him a valued member of our Board. We join in praying for the repose of Jack’s soul and offer our condolences to his wife Carole and his children — who were always the center of his life.”

John F. “Jack” Sandner

Raised on Chicago’s South Side Sandner came by his “fighting spirit” quite literally. Under the coaching of the great middleweight boxing champion Tony Zale Sandner became a Golden Gloves champion as a teenager and won 58 of his 60 amateur bouts.

He gave up the “sweet science” to attend college earning a bachelor’s degree from South Illinois University and then a law degree from Notre Dame where he received the law school’s Dean’s Award and won the three-year appellate advocacy competition. While attending law school he met Carole who was a nurse at a South Bend hospital.

Sandner began a career in law but became interested in the futures industry and purchased a seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1971. He soon launched his own firm and by 1980 had become so well regarded at the Merc that he was elected to his first of many terms as its chairman.

As the exchange’s longest-tenured chairman during the 1980s and ’90s Sandner led it from agricultural commodities into new products including the S&P 500 while also overseeing the evolution from open outcry to electronic trading. He stepped down as chairman in 1997 but remained on the board and as an adviser until 2018.

“Today is an extremely difficult day for our company and our industry” CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said in a statement following Sandner’s passing calling him a “true visionary who made many contributions to our industry.”

Sandner was inducted into the Futures Industry Association’s Hall of Fame and in addition to his service to Notre Dame he was a member of the boards of Chicago’s Rush University Medical Center Shedd Aquarium and Museum of Science and Industry as well as many other organizations.

Before his election to Notre Dame’s Board in 1993 Sandner served on the advisory council of the law school. His family funded the acquisition of the Chicago Bar Association’s library to create the law school’s John F. Sandner Family Law Library Collection. A gift from the family also made possible the construction of a new facility for the University’s Alliance for Catholic Education named in honor of Carole Sandner.

An advocate for special needs programs he was a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award a Points of Light Award and in 2006 an honorary degree from Notre Dame.

Sandner is survived by his wife eight children and seven grandchildren. Two sons and a daughter graduated from Notre Dame and two daughters are Saint Mary’s College alumnae.

Services will be private and he will be buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery on Notre Dame’s campus.

What do you feel is the special thing about Punjabi music that attracts the audience?

What changes did lockdown bring in the Punjabi music and audience?

Do singers change themselves according to the audience or they are the ones who contribute to a particular taste?

Name the singer who comes to your mind when you hear:

Power-packed performer

Soothing voice

Legend of Punjabi music

Future of Punjabi music

Game changer

The man behind Panj-aab Records and Brown Studio Harwinder Singh Sidhu recently sat for a cup of conversation in the exclusive segment of #TheBigInterview with ETimes. In the very segment Harwinder spoke about what according to him makes Punjabi music so loved among the audience what changes have been witnessed over time and a lot more.To be honest I think there are a number of factors that draw people to Punjabi music the foremost is the rawness.The raw energy of Punjabi music is something that grabs attention instantly. Secondly it’s the feel. People feel connected to it are able to relate to it. Last but not least Punjabi music is rich in slang making it all the more popular among ‘aam janta’.I can go on and on about the changes that this one last year in lockdown has brought in both Punjabi music and its lovers. But here I would like to address the elephant in the room and say that one of the major changes is that after lockdown audience has started listening to songs that are rich in lyrics after so many years. Further I find it very good and healthy for our culture.I think it is both ways. It is good to blend according to the audience but if a singer works really hard for his music then he should give his people the songs that he wants them to enjoy.Diljit DosanjhNone other than Dr. Satinder SartaajAmar Singh ChamkilaArjan DhillonI am not going to take the name of any singer here because I feel compositions are the real game-changers in the current scenario.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvb25nY3Mtc2hhcmUtaW4taW5kaWFzLW9pbC1nYXMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1qdW1wcy10by03MC1mcm9tLTUzLTEwLXllYXJzLWJhY2svYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODE0OTIzMDkuY21z0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9vbmdjcy1zaGFyZS1pbi1pbmRpYXMtb2lsLWdhcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWp1bXBzLXRvLTcwLWZyb20tNTMtMTAteWVhcnMtYmFjay9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODE0OTIzMDkuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ONGC's share in India's oil gas production jumps to 70% from 53% 10 years back,"

State-owned ONGC which is often perceived as a drag on the crude oil and natural gas produced in the country has actually seen its contribution to the national production jump to over 70 per cent from under 53 per cent a decade back petroleum ministry data showed.While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) maintained production levels output by other operators has dropped leading to an overall fall in India's output and a sharp rise in import dependency.Its standalone production at 47.51 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2010-11 was 52.8 per cent of a total of 89.91 million tonnes of oil and gas produced in the country that year the data showed.Despite having majority of fields where natural decline has set after being in operations for more than four decades ONGC maintained production throughout the last decade thereafter and had an output of 44.57 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2019-20 which was 70.3 per cent of India's total production of 63.353 million tonnes.ONGC's output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India's total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase.Even when its production dropped when compared to previous year ONGC's share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back showed.ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency.This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1014 million tonnes the data presented at the review showed.Of this ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves.ONGC's share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13 62.2 per cent in 2013-14 62.3 per cent in 2014-15 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17.In subsequent years it was 67 per cent 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review.During this 10-year period India's dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent.ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.In December last year it opened India's eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is responsible for putting into production one basin in Assam.",,,,,,,,,

A Coquitlam forklift operator fired from a Coca Cola Canada facility after wearing a bandana emblazoned with a Confederate flag and the words “The South Will Rise Again” has won a labour dispute in a case that tests the limits of workplace anti-harassment and discrimination policies.

The decision decided Feb. 4 but released this week stems from two incidents last year at Coca Cola Canada warehouses in Richmond and Coquitlam.

In the first incident on April 27 2020 someone hung a noose from a supervisor's platform near an area where a person of colour usually worked at the company’s Nelson Road facility says the decision.

When a fellow worker approached the forklift operator D.D. to take it down — the colleague said he didn’t want to deal with it because his girlfriend had died by suicide by hanging — he did so.

The incident prompted managers to speak with the workers later telling them “they thought the noose was a symbol of race hate and violence” wrote arbitrator Randall J. Noonan in his decision.

But following an investigation in which 23 employees were interviewed management was unable to identify who hung the noose and no evidence linked D.D. to the incident outside of taking it down.

According to notes taken in a June 30 interview with D.D. he said the noose had no racist or discriminatory meaning and that it wasn’t meant as a threat against black employees because the person of colour hadn’t been working that day. The whole incident said D.D. was overblown according to the decision.

A week after the interview D.D. was working at a Coquitlam Coca Cola facility when a company-wide mandatory mask policy went into place to stem the spread of COVID-19. Masks were handed out to all employees but according to D.D. he found them uncomfortable.

That’s when D.D. went out to his car to retrieve a bandana he said he got at a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Emblazoned with the Confederate flag on one section of the bandana it also showed a Confederate soldier encircled in the words “The South Will Rise Again.”

Inside D.D. folded the bandana into a makeshift mask.

When another worker told D.D.’s supervisor about the bandana he Googled the Confederate flag determined it was a racist symbol and told him to remove it the decision said.

D.D. did so immediately. According to notes from a meeting with a supervisor D.D. was told “people may be scared to speak up” and that the symbols on the bandana were “not appropriate in the workplace.”

INVESTIGATION ON THE HEELS OF GEORGE FLOYD’S MURDER

The investigation into both incidents came at a time when many businesses around the world faced heightened scrutiny over their role in either upholding or dismantling systemic racism.

In between the Richmond and Coquitlam incidents the murder of George Floyd a black man at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer had sparked a global Black Lives Matter movement rocking cities across North America and beyond with protests calling for meaningful change.

Witnesses for Coca Cola Canada said the company had long strived to be a leading voice for equality and live by the words of the song in a famous 1971 commercial: “I’d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony…”

At the time Coca Cola’s CEO encouraged reluctant politicians and business leaders to attend the ceremony celebrating Martin Luther King’s award of the Nobel Peace Prize stated company witnesses.

The company’s chief people officer testified that in May leadership decided that they “had to do something. There was a lot going on in the world and not just in the U.S. There were racist slurs anti-Asian discrimination Nazi symbols in Jewish Synagogues and anti-Black racism in Canada.”

Coca Cola Canada said the Human Resources executive wanted “to be very clear about what side of history we are on” and that “racism intolerance bigotry and hate will not be tolerated.”

WORKER FIRED

On July 10 D.D. received a letter of termination stating that based on the two incidents he showed a “flagrant disregard for issues of racism in the workplace” inconsistent with the company’s policies around harassment and violence said the decision.

When the company investigated the noose incident one worker questioned why management thought it was racist because white people got hung in the past and “cowboys did it all the time.” And at least two managers said they were “shocked” D.D. thought the noose incident may have been “a joke by somebody with a dark sense of humour” said the decision.

According to the decision the Vancouver manager who recommended D.D.’s termination “saw the wearing of the Confederate flag mask as blatant racism done in spite of what he should have known based on the discussions and interviews around the noose incident” and that “his dismissal was very much influenced by his attitude in relation to the noose incident.”

“Despite your understanding of the racist connotations of the confederate flag with an emblem that says The South Will Rise Again and your knowledge of issues of racism at the Richmond warehouse you chose to wear the confederate flag in the workplace” reads his termination letter.

At arbitration witnesses for Coca Cola Canada also noted that D.D. had been involved in other “racist events” over the years including racist drawings jokes and music played when a black employee crossed a pick line.

But in his decision Noonan noted evidence did not make clear when these events took place and that many of them likely occurred before he was employed at Coca Cola.

Further the arbitrator wrote there was no evidence D.D. had played any role in the hanging of the noose and that in the case of the bandana he immediately removed it when confronted by his supervisor.

TERMINATION TOO HARSH

The decision said that Coca Cola considered the incidents as blatant examples of racism and therefore warranted a dismissal but the arbitrator disagreed writing that the legal precedent for “zero tolerance” in workplace transgressions has not been established and that “every case must be assessed against specific facts.”

When D.D. was asked in direct testimony what the Confederate flag means to him he said it reminds him of music like Kid Rock Alabama and Lynyrd Skynyrd. “It’s about southern culture — food and things you can’t get anywhere else” he said.

Noonan found D.D. was only answering workplace investigators’ questions honestly that there is “no allegation or evidence” that he hung the noose and that nothing D.D. said fairly indicates he supports or condones racism or racist acts in the workplace.

Coca Cola leaned on legal precedent in a case where a worker had hurled violent and racist epithets at a Black co-worker and in another where three corrections officers posted racist comments on Facebook about First Nations inmates.

But the arbitrator wrote that D.D.’s conduct was “not of that character” and agreed with the worker’s union that it was “on the low end of the scale.” He found Coca Cola Canada’s firing of the forklift operator was “an excessive response.”

Far from termination the union suggested a letter of reprimand was appropriate for the bandana incident. “In earlier times the Union may well have been right” answered Noonan in his decision. “However we are in an era of heightened awareness of systemic and individual discrimination.”

“Although I find that (D.D.) did not intend to cause harm he nevertheless wore a mask that through its symbolism was offensive to the values of Coca Cola and Canadian society” Noonan wrote.

Noonan ordered Coca Cola Canada to reinstate D.D. and make up for his subsequent financial losses. For the bandana incident the arbitrator ruled D.D. deserved a one-day suspension but in the end upped it to five days.

“Whether or not it would have been viewed in the same light in earlier times his offence must be considered as serious today” wrote Noonan. “This case presents a true ‘teachable moment.’”

If D.D. had pushed back when asked to remove the mask or claimed he was wearing the bandana as an expression of free speech this could have been a “very different case” wrote Noonan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvZ2VvcmdpYS1hY3RpdmlzdHMtcHJlc3N1cmUtYmlnLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9ucy10by1vcHBvc2Utdm90aW5nLXJlc3RyaWN0aW9ucy0uaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2dlb3JnaWEtYWN0aXZpc3RzLXByZXNzdXJlLWJpZy1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnMtdG8tb3Bwb3NlLXZvdGluZy1yZXN0cmljdGlvbnMtLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia voting rights activists pressure big corporations to oppose GOP-backed ballot restrictions,"Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams waits to speak at a Democratic canvass kickoff as she campaigns for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at Bruce Trent Park on October 24 2020 in Las Vegas Nevada.

Civil rights and activist groups are turning up the pressure on large Georgia companies like Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines to oppose sweeping voting restrictions proposed by Republican state legislators.

""We've got the power of organized people. They've got the power of organized money. And between us and them we could put pressure on these legislators or worst case scenario the governor to kill these bills"" Cliff Albright co-founder of Black Voters Matter told CNBC.

Groups including Black Voters Matter the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP on Friday launched the next phase of their campaign in local press and on social media asking supporters to directly contact CEOs presidents and headquarters of major Georgia-based corporations. They're urging them to speak out publicly against the proposed voting restrictions and to stop donating money to the Republican legislators sponsoring the bills.

The voter restriction bills come after historic turnout from Georgia voters — particularly from Black voters and voters of color — during the November general and January runoff elections where Republicans lost the presidential and U.S. Senate races for the first time in decades.

""It's very very disappointing after the outpouring of civic engagement all across the state that the legislature would then seek to make it more difficult for Georgia citizens to participate in choosing their elected officials"" Andrea Young executive director of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said in an interview.

Republican lawmakers in March passed a bill in the state Senate that would eliminate no-excuse absentee voting and in the House that would limit weekend early voting increase ID requirements for absentee voting and restrict ballot drop boxes: SB 241 and HB 531. These proposed restrictions would disproportionately harm Black voters an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found.

Advocacy groups are turning to Georgia's powerful business community because they say trying to sway GOP lawmakers alone has little effect.

""These companies employ hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters who are going to directly be impacted by these laws"" Nse Ufot CEO of the New Georgia Project told CNBC. ""Voter suppression is not good for business.""

The coalition is focusing on six of the biggest companies in Georgia — Aflac  Coca-Cola  Delta Airlines  Home Depot  Southern Company and UPS — with full-page ads demonstrations and text banks. A March 3 investigation by Popular Information found the six corporations gave a combined $190800 to co-sponsors of HB 531 and SB 241 since 2018.

The activists' work seems to be seeing some results. Business boosters have come out against certain provisions in the proposed voter restrictions since advocates started their pressure campaign.

The Georgia Chamber of Commerce previously reiterated the importance of voting rights without voicing opposition against any specific legislation. In a new statement to CNBC the Georgia Chamber said it has ""expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access"" and ""continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state.""

Dave Williams SVP of public policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce said in a statement Monday: ""Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.""

The Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce told CNBC in a statement: ""As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the 'Urgency' to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is 'RIGHT'; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are 'OPPOSED'. And GGBCC represents them.""

Most of the corporations have not taken a stance in the voting rights debate instead offering broad stances on voting and elections. All six companies belong to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and all but Aflac belong to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.

Aflac  Coca-Cola Delta  Home Depot and UPS reiterated their support for fair and secure elections and equal voter participation in statements to CNBC. Southern Company did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Georgia corporations have come out strongly against legislation in the past like a ""religious liberty"" bill in 2016 that would have allowed discrimination against same-sex couples. They've also mostly stood silent in other debates like a ""heartbeat"" anti-abortion bill in 2019 that was ruled unconstitutional in 2020.

Conservative Georgia lawmakers in the past have punished Georgia corporations for certain political moves. Republican legislators killed a major airline tax break after Delta pulled discounts for a National Rifle Association members.

CNBC has reached out to the Georgia Senate and House Republican Caucuses for comment on the corporate accountability campaigns.

Voting rights activists are not impressed with the statements companies have offered so far on the voting rights debate.

""We need a full throated repudiation of these bills"" New Georgia Project's Ufot said. ""What is your affirmation of how important democracy is when you are witnessing democracy being attacked and you're silent about it?""

Jerry Gonzalez chief executive of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials compared the bills to the notorious voting restrictions that kept people of color from casting ballots in the South before the civil rights movement ushered in the Voting Rights Act in the 1960s.

""We have been talking to business partners and chambers of commerce to get them to step up"" Gonzalez told CNBC. ""Many of them have taken a strong stand on racial justice issues. Well this is a Jim Crow voting rights attack that is happening right now.""

Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said business leaders should take an unequivocal stance against the proposed voting restrictions in Georgia and other states on a Tuesday call with voting rights organizations Fair Fight Action which she founded and More Than A Vote founded by NBA superstar LeBron James The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

""There should be no silence from the business community when anyone in power is trying to strip away the right to vote from the people"" Abrams said on the call. ""There should be a hue and cry.""

Bernice King the daughter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said Wednesday she wrote a letter urging CEOs of Georgia-based corporations to oppose the bills and to use their influence with Georgia state legislators to block restrictive legislation.

""It's not going to be business as usual"" Black Voters Matter's Albright said. ""If you can't get involved in the business of fighting for democracy then we're going to have to get involved in your business.""

Read the statements from companies and business groups below:

Aflac

The right to vote in national state and local elections is the cornerstone of democracy. We need to join together to ensure accessible and secure voting while preserving election integrity and transparency. As this important issue is debated in Georgia and statehouses across the nation we expect that fairness and integrity will be the ongoing basis for discussion.

Coca-Cola

Voting is a foundational right in America and we will continue to work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country. We support efforts by the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced in the Georgia Legislature this session. The ultimate goal should be fair secure elections where access to voting is broad-based and inclusive.

Delta

Delta is more than 75000 strong - and our shared values call on us to make our voices heard and be engaged members of our communities of which voting is a vital part of that responsibility. Ensuring an election system that promotes broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and creates an environment that ensures everyone's vote is counted.

Home Depot

We believe that all elections should be accessible fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We'll continue to work to ensure our associates both in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote.

UPS

UPS believes in the importance of the democratic process and supports facilitating the ability of all eligible voters to exercise their civic duty. We are committed to voter awareness and engagement. In the last election UPS ran an education campaign for our employees called ""Drive the Vote"" to encourage employees to vote. The Drive the Vote campaign was nonpartisan and endorsed no specific candidate or party. Like other businesses in the community we are working with the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber to ensure equitable access to the polls and the integrity of the election process across the state.

Dave Williams SVP Public Policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber:

Broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and contribute to a business environment that fosters growth and vitality. We continue to work closely with members of the Georgia General Assembly to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced this session. We are carefully evaluating the impact the bills would have on equitable access to the polls and elections integrity in our state.

As we assess specific elections legislation we will continue to rely on our core values related to elections:

We believe Georgia's elections process should be fair secure accurate and equally accessible to all eligible Georgia voters.

We believe our state and local governments should do everything possible to maximize voter participation and minimize unnecessary obstacles in our elections while working to ensure election integrity.

We are committed to voter education and broad engagement in the electoral process. Our past actions have demonstrated this commitment; our future actions will do the same.

We continue to advocate for balanced legislation that makes voting more accessible and more secure. Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.

Georgia Chamber of Commerce

The Georgia Chamber continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state. We have expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access. As these two omnibus bills move through the legislative process we will continue to work on ensuring both accessibility and security within our voting system.

Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce

GGBCC affirms ""All Eligible voters should be able to vote in Georgia."" As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the ""Urgency"" to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is ""RIGHT""; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are ""OPPOSED"". And GGBCC represents them.

""Our organization plays a very vital role in contributing to the economic growth in Georgia"" states GGBCC's CEO Melinda Sylvester. ""Accordingly we believe it is our civic duty to stand with all voters in our great state. In so doing we are exhibiting our collective strength to assure that the efforts of our Bridge Builder Initiative can continue to be building blocks for continued and future success for all Georgians."" The organization is further encouraging all GGBCC business owners and aspiring business owners to get engaged and stay in contact with their respective legislators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYWxsb25nZW9yZ2lhLmNvbS9jaGF0dG9vZ2EtbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9uZXctb3duZXJzLWZvci1tYXJzLXRoZWF0ZXItZGlzdHJpY3QtaW4tbGFmYXlldHRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Owners for Mars Theater District in LaFayette,"Long-time LaFayette resident Robert Wardlaw has announced the acquisition of the Mars Theater District in LaFayette Georgia.

Wardlaw is joined by fellow investor and cousin Robert “Buzz” Law of Alpharetta GA.

The new owners have long family ties to LaFayette.

Robert Wardlaw was born and raised in LaFayette.

Buzz Law’s mother Louellen (Wardlaw) Law was also a native of LaFayette.

The Wardlaw family owned and operated the Coca-Cola Bottling Works of LaFayette for 80 years.

The two have big plans for the project. “We believe in LaFayette and we believe the Mars Theater District is well-positioned to become a local and even regional destination for dining entertainment arts and commerce” said Wardlaw.

Buzz Law agreed “I have so many fond memories of my childhood visits with family in LaFayette. When Robert approached me with this opportunity I could immediately sense his confidence and belief in the project. It was an easy decision to team up and make it happen.”

The District is home to the Station House a popular New American cuisine restaurant; Back Alley Productions a local community theater group; and a local CPA Firm.

The NASCAR Hall of Famer switched teams striking up a sponsorship with Coke’s rival Pepsi in 1996. The big move all began innocently enough at a cookout.

Jeff Gordon quickly became the face of NASCAR

Jeff Gordon can be considered a NASCAR pioneer. He has been labeled as the guy who got the younger generation into the sport. Gordon was a young driver who had immediate success and was given high praise by NASCAR legend Richard Petty. Petty is the most accomplished racer in history with 200 victories.

“Most of the guys went through the process of doing the NASCAR Sportsman and they were always 25 26 years old before they got a first-class ride” Petty said in an interview with Graham Bensinger. “(Gordon) came in and got a first-class ride at 20 years old 21 years old. So he starts a new trend of younger people coming into the sport. In doing that the face of NASCAR he changed it from one face to another. He’s been a really big asset to be able to be as personable to be on late-night TV or early-morning TV and still be a heck of a racecar driver.”

From his rookie year in 1993 until his retirement in 2015 Gordon was the face of NASCAR. Jimmie Johnson a seven-time Cup Series champ said Gordon opened the doors to many successful drivers. “IndyCar was always on my radar growing up on the West Coast but then here’s this guy with a really bad mustache making his way in stock car racing” Johnson said according to USA Today. The doors that he opened for drivers that did not grow up in the South that grew up racing in the dirt he really changed that whole outlook for owners. A lot of opportunities came through those doors that he opened.”

Gordon is one of NASCAR’s all-time greats

Not only was Jeff Gordon a pioneer but he was also one heck of a driver. Gordon is a four-time Cup Series champion winning in 1995 1997 1998 and 2001. When he won his first championship in 1995 Gordon became the youngest ever to do so. He was 24.

Gordon is also a three-time winner of the Daytona 500. He accomplished the feat in 1997 1999 and 2005. He also won three career Grand Slams and is third on the all-time list of Cup Series wins with 93. Gordon set a record for winning at least one pole in 23 straight years. Gordon was also a very durable – and lucky – driver running 797 consecutive races.

In 1998 Gordon was named one of NASCAR’s 50 Greatest Drivers. Gordon was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2018. The following year Gordon earned his place in the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

Pepsi sponsorship started over cookout talk

When Jeff Gordon began his NASCAR career Hendrick Motorsports had a sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola. According to USA Today Jeff Faust a Pepsi employee and friend of Gordon’s first wife Brooke always joked about getting Gordon to switch teams and head to Pepsi. “We’d just be hanging out at a cookout and I’d say ‘C’mon man you’ve got to come to the A Team'” Faust said. “He would always say to me ‘You’ll be the first person I call if I ever make that decision.'”

In October of 1996 Gordon was prepping for a race and gave Faust a call. “I said ‘Hey if you want to connect me with Pepsi let’s pursue it'” Gordon told USA Today back in 2015. Faust called a Pepsi brand manager. “I don’t know if you’re going to know this guy but I’ve got a friend who is a NASCAR driver and he really wants to talk to Pepsi” Faust said. “His name is Jeff Gordon.”

Although NASCAR wasn’t nearly as popular then as it is now Pepsi heard of Gordon and took action. “They believed in NASCAR and its fan base and they were excited about it” Gordon said. “And they really wanted to really get behind it and support it from a marketing standpoint and that was something we were lacking. They said ‘Hey let’s do some big things here.'”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheW1haWwuY28uencvY29jYS1jb2xhcy01YnkyMC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLWVtcG93ZXJzLXdvbWVu0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5bWFpbC5jby56dy9jb2NhLWNvbGFzLTVieTIwLWluaXRpYXRpdmUtZW1wb3dlcnMtd29tZW4vYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca Cola’s 5by20 initiative empowers women,"The “5by20” initiative has enabled economic empowerment by providing access to business skills financial services and support networks

Business Reporter

The Coca-Cola Company says its “5by20” economic initiative has enabled the empowering of more than six million women entrepreneurs around the world.

In a latest media update the multi-national beverages firm said the initiative has enabled economic empowerment by providing access to business skills financial services and support networks.

“This International Women’s Month The Coca-Cola Company and its partners are proud to celebrate exceeding our ‘5by20’ goal by enabling the economic empowerment of more than six million women around the world and 34 percent (just over two million) of those women enabled by the ‘5by20’ programme live and do business in Africa” it said.

Coca-Cola said the “5by20” initiative was aimed at assisting women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain — agricultural producers suppliers distributors retailers recyclers and artisans — overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business.

This would be through providing access to business skills financial services assets and support networks of peers and mentors women entrepreneurs are enabled to overcome social and economic barriers and succeed as entrepreneurs while helping create sustainable communities.

The beverages firm said it executed “5by20” across 33 countries in Africa with locally relevant initiatives rolled out.

“The ‘5by20 goal was ambitious and we knew that we could not achieve it alone. Over the last 10 years we have worked with countless partners including our bottling partners civil society organisations government stakeholders other private sector actors and generous financial grants from The Coca-Cola Foundation to recipients within its Women’s Entrepreneur Empowerment priority giving tier” it said.

The Coca-Cola Foundation has funded some of “5by20” initiatives while the Coca-Cola system has worked with several partners to implement over 300 programmes in 100 countries to provide women entrepreneurs with business skills training mentoring networks financial services and other assets to help enhance their businesses and lives as well as providing more for their families said the organisation.

“Women’s empowerment and progress against all the Sustainable Development Goals requires the collective effort of governments civil society Non-Governmental organisations and private sector.

“Over the last 10 years we have worked with countless partners who helped us bring our aspiration to life” said Coca-Cola.

Partnerships with organisations such as the United Nations Women Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Women Enterprise Fund (WEF) Department for International Development (DFID) USAID International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps TechnoServe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Hand in Hand Southern Africa and several other regional and local partners were critical to the success of the ‘5by20’ programme.

“These partnerships are a demonstration that through collective action we achieve more together than we can on our own.”

In 2012 the Coca-Cola Company signed a global agreement with UN Women to enable the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs in three pilot countries which included South Africa.

At the end of the four-year programme in South Africa in December 2016 over 25 000 women micro-entrepreneurs had received business skills leadership training mentoring and peer networking skills and access to finance."

Under the 5-year initiative a cadre of 100 women called Digital Smile Sakhis have been trained and onboarded to reach out to 50000 tribal rural and urban less privileged women in remote villages and urban settlements through meetings and campaigns. The Sakhis will help the women in learning mobile banking operating bank accounts and using insurance and social support schemes through online modes to build inclusiveness and financial resilience. The sessions will also include innovative methods of teaching and interactive learning to make it a fun learning process.

The program will help in enabling the women to make informed financial decisions and in improving their financial management and entrepreneurial skills. Additionally the initiative will also create awareness among tribal and low-income women on banking and non-banking frauds.

But what about other companies out there making waves seemingly undetected?

Enter – Merlin Entertainments LTD.

Who is Merlin you ask? Well let’s talk about it.

Merlin Entertainments was founded/created in 1999 and over the last 20+ years has grown to become a “global leader” in family entertainment. Along with Disney and Universal they are one of the largest attraction operating/themed entertainment companies in the world.

Merlin brands are split into 2 categories. The First is Theme Parks – which include two groupings of entertainment offerings: LEGOLAND Parks which are the most popular here in the states and Resort Theme Parks- varying in themes attractions and accommodations. There are water parks not included in these lists as well.

Here is a list of the current LEGOLAND Theme Parks across the world:

Billund

California

Deutschland

Dubai

Japan

Malaysia

Florida -Soon To welcome Peppa Pig With the addition of an ALL NEW THEME PARK

Along with these parks across 7 countries and 3 continents (so far)  they also have a multitude of resorts and hotels connected to their theme parks with a focus on children ages 3-12 and their families to enjoy.

Resort Theme Parks are national brands aimed at families teenagers and young adults that come equipped with themed accommodations at ALL locations. The impressive list includes outstanding theme parks in the UK Italy and Northern Germany:

The Second Category is labeled Midway Attractions… a massively versatile collection of interesting brands in city centers shopping malls and resorts. They operate over 100 Midway attractions in 22 countries around the world. The most notable are SEA LIFE THE LONDON EYE and MADAME TUSSAUDS. The whole list you can see HERE. These attractions often include food drink merchandise locations and photography services.

If none of this impresses you maybe look at how well the company has done for itself this past year.

Even with a Pandemic threatening their very infrastructure they managed to pre-plan and continually execute multiple grand openings of not only brand new shows and attractions here in Florida but across the U.S. and beyond. Additionally the impact that other companies have suffered…such as lay-offs…were minimal in comparison. In fact upon my own investigating a somewhat mass lay-off in 2019 is the only visible documented occurrence.

(Editor’s note: To correct a previous statement they did have a layoff at LEGOLAND Florida in summer 2020 no numbers from which were released)

Perhaps this is due to their preferences in utilizing seasonal employment and contracts in a vast amount of roles across their brands. Or perhaps their IP relations have a hand in that success as well – brands such as Lucasfilm Marvel BBC Studios Sony Pictures DreamWorks and the list goes on.

They also seem to have a fair amount of full time employees that seem quite taken care of. Including their own CEO Nick Varney who has been with the company since it’s creation.

How about achievements in the U.S.?

LEGOLAND Florida upon reopening introduced several new shows both seasonally and in it’s daily operations. This along with more coming over the next year…including the announcement of a new Theme Park in 2022 featuring the characters of “Peppa Pig.” They already closed off the area and entering the next phase of it’s creation.

LEGOLAND New York will finally have it’s opening day this year and I very excited to see how well this park does as it is the largest LEGOLAND park built by Merlin thusfar.

What’s next for Merlin?

The company boasts “67 Million Visitors a year.” I am sure Covid closures had an impact on that number in 2020 but I have no doubt this company has found a way not only to survive but thrive in adversity and that is worth the attention. Their company website explains their “ Strategic Vision ” and I left their quote below because I am inspired by their tenacity:

” To create a high growth high return family entertainment company based on strong brands and a global portfolio that is naturally balanced against the impact of external factors.”

Their strategic vision it seems has stayed the course. Even through a global pandemic that has caused mass amounts of hardship for multiple companies they have remained active vigilant and steadfast on the course of success. Though I am sure Merlin has had their fair share of struggle…you would never know it. Just look at all they are producing in the wake of shutdowns and uncertainty of the next few years.

So I myself will be keeping an eye out on this company. Not only for LEGOLAND and all that is coming for them but the company itself because I believe this is only the tip of the Iceberg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXpuLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9uZXdzL2JveGluZy9jaG9jb2xhdGl0by12cy1lc3RyYWRhLWhvdy1tdWNoLWRvZXMtcHB2LWNvc3QtZm9yLXJvbWFuLWdvbnphbGV6cy1maWdodC12cy1qdWFuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1lc3RyYWRhLWluLXRoZS11c2EvYXhyeDN5ZmZ5Nm5kMXA4dWY1ZnRlaHlzedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chocolatito vs. Estrada: How much does PPV cost for Roman Gonzalez’s fight vs. Juan Francisco Estrada in the USA?,"Fans can order the bout through traditional cable TV on pay-per-view.

Downey Jr was in the running for worst actor for playing the title role in Dolittle a film remake about a doctor who can talk to animals.

Dolittle released by Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures tied for the most Razzie nominations with six overall including the worst picture. It will compete with Netflix’s Polish erotic drama 365 Days which also received six Razzie nods.

Others contending for the worst film included Music directed by musician Sia about a young girl with autism and a film remake of TV show Fantasy Island.

Mike Lindell chief executive of widely advertised company MyPillow and a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump was nominated for Absolute Proof a film featuring baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election. It also is competing for the worst picture.

Giuliani made the Razzies list for his brief appearance in Sacha Baron Cohen’s mockumentary Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. The former mayor was filmed in a hotel room with an actress pretending to be a reporter. Giuliani has said nothing inappropriate happened.

The tongue-in-cheek Razzies created in 1980 serves as an antidote to Hollywood’s glitzy Academy Awards ceremony. Winners of the Razzies will be announced on April 24 the night before this year’s Oscars.

Razzie nominees and winners are voted for online by members from more than two dozen countries who sign up online and pay a $40 membership fee.

This year the Razzies announced a special pandemic-related award for 2020 as “The Worst Calendar Year EVER!”

The report includes remarks from HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi who is also the president and CEO of Qatar Petroleum (QP) in addition to key information on Qatar’s energy sector targeted for US companies. The publication was sponsored by ConocoPhillips as Platinum Sponsor ExxonMobil as Gold Sponsor and Excelerate Energy as Silver Sponsor.

The US and Qatar have shared a rich history of partnership in the development and production of Qatar’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) fields. Through this close collaboration Qatar has become the number one LNG exporter worldwide in addition to being a major petrochemical producer.

American companies have played a leading role in Qatar’s rise with international oil company giants like ExxonMobil ConocoPhillips Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) and Excelerate Energy holding large stakes in Qatar’s energy sector.

Additionally American construction and technology companies like McDermott International Zachry Group and Honeywell have also had significant engagements in Qatar in the development of critical infrastructure projects.

Qatar and the US are expected to continue their close collaboration with the massive North Field Expansion (NFE) project which will expand Qatar’s LNG production. One of the most important aspects of the NFE is QP’s commitment to reducing its carbon emissions from its operations and recently released a strategy aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Underscoring Qatar’s interest to diversify its LNG holdings and the country’s close link with the US QP is also investing in the US’ oil and gas sector with a recent $10bn investment in a joint venture with ExxonMobil for the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas.

“Together the US and Qatar have become global LNG export leaders. Qatar Petroleum’s ambitions coupled with the country’s Tawteen initiative will create significant investment opportunities for American investors not just in exploration and production but throughout the entire supply chain” said USQBC managing director Mohamed Barakat.

Through Qatar’s commitment to diversify its economy create in-country value and attract additional American investors QP has introduced a supply chain localisation programme for the energy sector called. This localisation programme will provide hundreds of new investment opportunities and will promote the collaboration of suppliers and energy sector companies.

“Qatar and the US continue to reinforce their important business partnership in the energy sector. Not only will Qatar’s North Field Expansion project create many additional opportunities for US investors in the energy field but it will also serve as a multiplier across the spectrum of industry in Qatar’s rapidly diversifying economy” said USQBC Doha Office managing director Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad al-Thani.

The Qatar-US relationship has grown steadily and is now worth more than $200bn. The US has been a key partner in Qatar’s rapid economic growth and diversification with over 850 US businesses operating in the country.

The USQBC is the premier entity to facilitate trade and investment between the two countries and provides advisory and consulting services reports and publications and hosts events to build business relationships between the two countries. USQBC is dedicated to helping its American and Qatari members expand their business and encourage foreign investment and trade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

BBC News Mundo

13 marzo 2021

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Durante 120 años se creyó que Edison había sido el primero en grabar la voz humana.

Durante 120 años hubo una verdad difícilmente controvertible: que Thomas Alva Edison había sido la primera persona en grabar la voz humana.

El inventor de entre otras cosas la bombilla y la cámara cinematográfica famosamente lo había logrado en 1888 con otra de sus creaciones el fonógrafo de cilindro de cera y hubo muchos testigos de la hazaña incluidos los asistentes a un concierto que grabó en el Festival Handel en Crystal Palace Londres.

Sin embargo más de un siglo después dos miembros de First Sounds Initiative -un colectivo que ""se esfuerza por hacer que las primeras grabaciones de sonido de la humanidad estén disponibles para todas las personas de todos los tiempos""- empezaron a sospechar que había una realidad alternativa.

Sus sorprendentes descubrimientos llevaron a que en 2008 la historia fuera reescrita... dos veces.

El hallazgo

Cuando el estadounidense Patrick Feaster un historiador de audio empezó a leer sobre un pionero del sonido anterior a Edison un francés llamado Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville no se entusiasmó mucho; su invento no parecía ser más que un precursor técnico del fonógrafo que sólo se usó para experimentos científicos.

Pero su opinión fue cambiando a medida que investigaba más particularmente tras ver unas malas fotocopias de la patente de un aparato llamado fonoautógrafo que el francés había registrado el 25 de marzo de 1857.

Pie de foto Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville había logrado lo mismo que Edison pero en pos de otro sueño.

Poco después en una visita a París su colega David Giovannoni consultó en persona los documentos de Scott de Martinville en la Oficina de Patentes de Francia y encontró dos fononautogramas... nada menos que grabaciones de sonido fechadas en 1860 28 años antes de las de Edison.

Eran hojas de papel cubierto en hollín que habían sido marcadas por la vibración de una cerda de jabalí provocado por sonidos; gracias a que habían sido sumergidas en un fijador esos rastros de algo que sucedió una decena de décadas atrás estaban perfectamente preservados.

Fuente de la imagen Académie des sciences-Institut de France Pie de foto Las marcas que dejó la cerda de jabalí en el papel con hollín aún guardan los sonidos.

El desafío consistía en traducir esas marcas en ondas sonoras. Giovannoni le envió los papeles a Feaster a Estados Unidos quien con su computadora se abocó a la tarea apenas los recibió.

""Terminé quedándome despierto toda la noche"" le contó Feaster al programa ""La orquesta de los sonidos perdidos"" de la BBC.

Tuvo que ajustar manualmente las ondas de sonido usando como referencia las vibraciones inscritas por un diapasón que Scott había grabado en los mismos documentos precisamente para tal fin.

""Cuando salió el Sol finalmente pude escuchar la grabación. Era (la canción folclórica francesa) Au Clair de la Lune. Sentado allí me di cuenta de que era la primera persona en escuchar a alguien cantar antes del estallido de la Guerra Civil estadounidense: se me puso la piel de gallina"".

No sólo eso: Feaster fue además el primero en escuchar esa grabación. Punto.

Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville nunca la había reproducido; de hecho ni siquiera lo intentó.

Otro sueño

Scott era editor y tipógrafo de manuscritos en una editorial científica de París. Como buen hombre de letras su sueño había sido otro.

¿Qué tal si un escritor -se preguntó- pudiera ""dictar un sueño fugaz en medio de la noche y al despertar descubrir no sólo que ha sido escrito sino regocijarse en su libertad de la pluma ese instrumento con el cual lucha y que enfría la expresión?""

Básicamente lo que quería crear era un aparato que cumpliera una función similar a los programas de reconocimiento automático del habla modernos una herramienta capaz de procesar la señal de voz emitida por el ser humano y convertirla en símbolos que pudieran ser leídos con facilidad.

""La imprudente idea de fotografiar la palabra"" se le había ocurrido un día de mediados del siglo XIX tras leer un texto sobre fisiología humana: si la fotografía podía capturar imágenes fugaces con lentes que imitaban el ojo ¿no podría una réplica del oído capturar las palabras habladas?

Fuente de la imagen Institut national de la propriété industrielle Pie de foto La idea era hacer una réplica del oído para escribir sonidos.

Su inspiración dio a luz el fonoautógrafo un autoescritor de sonido y volvió a soñar con que la caligrafía escrita en hollín que consideraba como una taquigrafía natural algún día se leería con la misma facilidad que los símbolos que habíamos inventado como las letras.

Por lo pronto había realizado su visión de hacer del sonido desde siempre invisible y pasajero algo visible y permanente.

Pie de foto Una de las versiones del fonoautógrafo creado por Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville.

Después de que su fonoautógrafo captara la atención de SEIN (Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale) una asociación de expertos que evalúa las nuevas tecnologías y sus posibles contribuciones a la industria francesa Scott tuvo apoyo para mejorar su invento.

Más tarde se asoció con Rudolph Koenig un constructor de instrumentos científicos de precisión para comercializarlo ofreciéndolo en el catálogo como un aparato capaz de llenar un vacío en la acústica que -decía- ""está un siglo atrás de otras ciencias experimentales careciendo de instrumentos de observación medición y análisis como la astronomía antes de la invención del telescopio"".

El fonoautógrafo era ""un medio de diseccionar los fenómenos sonoros un microscopio que no solo muestra los sonidos sino que conserva su huella"".

Fuente de la imagen Institut national de la propriété industrielle Pie de foto Intentos de Scott de interpretar las huellas de los sonidos grabadas con el fonoautógrafo.

Mostrar sonidos más que reproducirlos fue siempre su intención y con ello en mente Scott hizo varias decenas de grabaciones de fragmentos de canciones poesía y teatro en varios idiomas que yacieron en silencio a salvo pero casi olvidadas en varias venerables instituciones francesas.

Hasta que en 2008 con la tecnología actual una de esas grabaciones cobró vida como ""un fantasma atravesando una cortina velada de tiempo"" como le dijo Giovannoni a la BBC.

Presentación en sociedad

La grabación de Au Clair De La Lune en la voz de una niña que Giovannoni y Feaster pensaron podría ser la hija de Scott -""¿No sería dulce?""- fue revelada al público y pronto se hizo viral.

No a todos les pareció tan dulce.

A Charlotte Green periodista de BBC Radio 4 le provocó un ataque de risa incontrolable al escucharla en el noticiero que estaba presentando en vivo un clip que también se volvió viral.

Green dijo más tarde que sonaba como ""una abeja atrapada en una botella"".

A algunos los conmovió a otros les pareció espeluznante.

En cualquier caso la historia se reescribió: quizás Edison había sido el primero en reproducir la voz humana pero ahora sabíamos que Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville había sido la primera persona en grabarla.

Sólo que...

Encore une fois

Seis meses después del lanzamiento de lo que ahora se reconocía como la primera grabación de voz del mundo Giovannoni y Feaster estaban trabajando en otro audio cuando se dieron cuenta de que habían cometido un tremendo error: habían reproducido Au Clair De La Lune al doble de velocidad.

Cuando lo corrigieron la voz no era la de una niña sino la del propio Scott de Martinville.

¡La historia tuvo que ser reescrita una vez más!

Scott murió de un aneurisma en virtual anonimato un año después de conocer el fonógrafo de Edison.

Fue enterrado en una tumba sin nombre pues su familia no pudo pagar una lápida. En su testamento Scott pidió a sus hijos que se aseguraran de que él y su invento no fueran olvidados.

En 2015 la UNESCO inscribió en su Registro de la Memoria del Mundo ""Las primeras grabaciones de la humanidad de su propia voz: los fonautogramas de Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville (c.1853-1860)"".

Hay quienes creen que el destino está escrito pero tal vez la vida nos ponga en el camino de otras personas para ayudarlos desde nuestra sencillez. Recuerdo que el viernes 5 de marzo acudí al Registro Civil del parque California en Guayaquil para pedir el acta de nacimiento de mi hija con el fin de renovar mi cédula.

Al llegar hice una fila fuera del edificio y luego otra para que me den un turno al momento de pagar para el documento me di cuenta que me faltaba un dólar para completar los seis requeridos.

El cajero no me lo quiso adelantar aunque le propuse dejar mis documentos en garantía. Me dirigí desesperado a la puerta de salida:

-“Señor guardia ¿hay un cajero cerca?”

-“Sí pero está a diez minutos y ya mismo vamos a cerrar las puertas”.

Qué cara habré puesto que al momento de terminar la frase: “¡Y pensar que solo me falta un dólar!” el guardia me extendió la mano con la milagrosa moneda.

Su gesto me sorprendió y me conmovió tanto que no supe cómo reaccionar. Solo le dije gracias pagué y me dieron el documento.

Al salir conversé con él. A pesar de tener una mascarilla se adivinaba un rostro amable su voz era pausada y su conversación amena.

Intercambiamos pocas palabras. Solo alcancé a pedirle su nombre y su dirección para hacerle llegar un obsequio. Nos despedimos con una foto y ya en mi carro cogí mi celular y puse este mensaje en twitter adjuntando la foto:

“Estoy en el registro civil del parque California. Al momento de pagar por la certificación de un documento me falta 1 dólar. El guardia de seguridad me ve desesperado y me lo da. Se llama Edison Rosado Mera. ¡El Registro Civil tiene un empleado de primera!”.

A los pocos minutos el mensaje se viralizó y Edison recibió felicitaciones masivas de ecuatorianos dentro y fuera del país. Su cuenta que contaba con 10 seguidores se puso de moda en instantes.

Regresé el lunes al Registro Civil y conversamos un poco más. Me contó que había nacido en Bahía en una cuna humilde que había sido lustrabotas y vendedor de lotería. Desde hace 16 años vive en Monte Sinaí. Hablaba mucho de Dios de su esposa Jéssica y de sus hijos Bryan y Ariel. Para él los estudios eran muy importantes y me detalló que estaba culminando sus estudios en idiomas extranjeros y que quería luego seguir la carrera de jurisprudencia. “A mi esposa también le dije que tenía que terminar sus estudios ya pronto mi amor se graduará de bachiller” acotó.

Ese mismo día puse otro tuit detallando mi conversación con Edison y añadiendo: “¿Qué tal si le regalamos una laptop a Edison para que estudie mejor?”. Al final del tuit puse el número de su cuenta bancaria. Más de 5.000 likes poco tiempo después recibió una laptop de parte de la señora Cristina Enríquez Mafla y unas donaciones masivas.

Pero el círculo virtuoso no termina allí. Sin hacerlo notorio el actual Ministro de Inclusión Social le había escrito a Edison para felicitarle.

-“Yo fui director del Registro civil por casi 2 años por eso me llegó tanto su historia; conocí gente buena y gente no tan buena por ello el caso de Edison me conmovió. Nos da esperanza y me recordó el valor que tenemos los ecuatorianos y de lo que realmente estamos hechos. Aunque en los últimos meses hayamos visto cosas atroces aún hay una luz”.

El día siguiente Vicente Taiano González le daba un nuevo trabajo. “Va a desarrollar capacidades completamente distintas a las que venía ejerciendo como guardia de seguridad. Será funcionario del MIES en el área que él prefiera desenvolverse puede ser tema educativo o administrativo porque estudia idiomas” me contó.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbmFjaW9uLmNvbS5hci9lY29ub21pYS9sYS1pbmNyZWlibGUtaGlzdG9yaWEtZGUtbGEtZW1wcmVzYS1kZS1mb3RvZ3JhZmlhLXF1ZS1xdWVkby1mdWVyYS1kZS1mb2NvLW5pZDE1MDMyMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La increíble historia de la empresa de fotografía que quedó fuera de foco,"El enorme éxito de Kodak y su masividad dejaron de serlo cuando no pudieron adaptarse a la nueva era tecnológica aún con recursos para hacerlo

George Eastman jamás imaginó el éxito que tendría la empresa que acababa de crear: su mayor obsesión era hacer la fotografía accesible a las masas y fue así que fundó Kodak una compañía que se transformaría en sinónimo de foto y se erigiría como líder del mercado mundial pero que estando en la cresta de la ola se derrumbaría por no subirse a tiempo a la nueva tecnología digital que paradójicamente se había desarrollado en su laboratorio.

Para conocer los orígenes de Kodak hay que remontarse a 1888 y situarse en Rochester en el noroeste del estado de Nueva York en los Estados Unidos. En ese año y en ese lugar Eastman fundó esta nueva empresa sobre las cenizas de la Eastman Dry Plate Kodak Company una compañía dedicada a la fabricación de placas fotográficas.

El nombre Kodak que no tiene significado alguno y se cree originada en el balbuceo de algún niño fue elegido porque resulta de fácil pronunciación en todos los idiomas y porque además la letra “K” era la preferida de su fundador.

Mientras el foco de los fabricantes estaba en las cámaras Eastman vio que había algo que todos necesitaban y pocos hacían: las películas. Le esperaba un prometedor futuro como banquero sin embargo decidió renunciar a su trabajo para dedicarse con todo a su pasión: hacer que la fotografía fuera accesible a las masas.

Tal como se señala en un artículo del diario español ABC en 1900 Eastman a quien hoy se considera el Steve Jobs de su tiempo obsequió a sus clientes con la primera cámara portátil apta para simples aficionados un aparato que revolucionaría la forma de ver el mundo.

Kodak pronto empezó a fabricar además de sus rollos aparatos de fotografía. Con su modo de producción y la sencillez de sus cámaras puso el mundo de la fotografía amateur al alcance de las masas en los Estados Unidos. Tuvo enseguida un gran éxito comercial y no tardó mucho en acuñar su famosa frase publicitaria: “Usted apriete el botón nosotros hacemos el resto”.

En 1891 desarrolló la primera cámara Kodak con rollo intercambiable permitiendo el cambio incluso a la luz del día. A partir de ese momento lanzó una innovación tras otra y poco a poco comenzó a tener sedes en todo el mundo.

En el siglo XX se convirtió en líder absoluta al lanzar en cada década una tecnología diferente. Uno de sus mayores hitos fue la serie Instamatic entre 1963 y 1970 de la que se vendieron más de 50 millones. La innovación de la cámara era que la película venía protegida en un cassette y se transportaba automáticamente al insertarlo en la cámara. Esta máquina con su sistema tuvo una increíble aceptación en el fotógrafo amateur por eso se vendió como pan caliente.

El negocio de Kodak se basó principalmente en la venta de rollos y suministros para imprimir las fotografías. Vendían sus cámaras a precios muy bajos obteniendo márgenes mínimos pero luego ganaban dinero cuando la gente tomaba e imprimía las fotos. Esta estrategia la volvió imbatible algo que la hizo llegar esplendorosa a inicios de la década de los noventa.

Aquella pequeña empresa de Rochester era ahora un monstruo con más de 140.000 empleados se había convertido en sinónimo de fotografía y facturaba millones de dólares por año. Estaba en su mejor momento. Pero... siempre hay un pincelazo que lo arruina todo.

El monstruo se durmió en los laureles. Aunque fue un ingeniero propio el que desarrolló la tecnología que daría vida a la era de la cámara digital Kodak decidió no enfocar su estrategia hacia ese producto por temor a que le canibalizara su tradicional negocio. Cuando las cámaras digitales explotaron en el mundo entero y sus directivos se dieron cuenta del grave error que habían cometido al darle la espalda ya era demasiado tarde.

Kodak intentó subirse al tren de los productos digitales pero nunca pudo adaptarse al nuevo fenómeno lo aventajaron competidores mucho más ágiles y el derrumbe de las ventas de sus productos propios fue tan grande que en 2012 se declaró en bancarrota. Si bien hoy la marca sigue viva con otros negocios la historia de éxito de la empresa que se había convertido en sinónimo de fotografía llegó a su fin.

Como se señala en el sitio El Confidencial el caso de Kodak suele estudiarse continuamente como el de una empresa que dominó el mercado durante cien años y que sin embargo no supo adaptarse a los cambios del siglo XXI. “El verdadero error fue realmente la mala dirección. La idea de centrarse únicamente en un producto y poner todos los recursos en la producción de cámaras que iban realmente a un fondo perdido y roto. Esto se debe simplemente a un miedo natural a perder a los compradores de toda la vida entrando en mercados desconocidos” se concluye.

© TWE | Treasury's wine portfolio will be a little thinner after unloading a range of bargain brands to The Wine Group.

Wine conglomerate Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has offloaded four lower-end US wine brands to The Wine Group (TWG) for $100 million as the company continues to focus on its higher-end brands and bottom line.

The quartet of brands sold on March 10 includes Beringer Main & Vine Beringer Founders' Estate Coastal Estate and Meridian. The harsh tariffs imposed by the Chinese market on the Napa-based TWE's brands – particularly the company's signature Penfolds label – have pushed the wine company to rethink its brand lineup and marketing approach to the US market.

The recent brand shuffle did not come as a surprise to most US wine industry analysts. ""In the case of TWE the industry has been waiting for the sale of the under-$12 segment in the US to happen for some time"" notes Mario Zepponi a wine merger and acquisition advisor at the Santa Rosa-based Zepponi & Company.

The TWE-TWG deal notes Stephen Rannekleiv Rabobank's global sector strategist for beverages in New York was a good opportunity for TWE to cash in on these specific brands as they play in a less than premium segment. He adds that the price was also right. ""I would guess that both companies are satisfied with the deal they got. There wasn't a long line of people who could take on these brands.""

While it is ""hard to assess value but I am sure Treasury sees it positively from a reported earnings standpoint and The Wine Group sees it positively from a cash flow standpoint"" adds the Napa-based Jon Moramarco the managing partner of bw166 a drinks industry analyst.

TWE's Americas president Ben Dollard calls the move ""a mutually beneficial sale"" adding: ""We look forward to allowing our team to focus on driving our priority brands for the business including Beringer Beaulieu Vineyards 19 Crimes and Penfolds.”

A closer look at the deal

TWE executives say the deal will allow them to better focus on their higher-end brands. ""As part of our TWE Americas strategy we continue to focus on our luxury and masstige brands whilst refining our commercial wine business"" Dollard says. The adjective ""masstige"" – long used by TWE – occupies a sweet spot between mass and class and commands a premium over conventional products while being priced well below super premium goods according to the Harvard Business Review.

Dollard adds that at the same time TWE will ""continue to build momentum on our masstige and luxury tiers with the release of 19 Crimes Snoop Cali Red … and in the luxury tier with the release of the Penfolds California Collection.""

The California-based TWG – which has more than 60 brands including Franzia Cupcake Chloe and Trapiche – is the second largest wine group in the US according to WineBusiness.com. The group was an ideal buyer for these four brands as the company has long specialized in and been skillful at marketing lower-end wine brands.

TWG declined to comment for this story and TWE provided a press release confirming the sale and the fact that TWG would acquire existing inventories of the four brands. TWE's chief executive officer Tim Ford said in the release that the deal ""will be of mutual long-term benefit to our respective organizations. For TWE this transaction is a significant milestone towards our plans to deliver [TWE's vision of] the future state [of the] premium US wine business and we can now focus solely on continuing the growth of our premium brand portfolio to drive future performance in the Americas.""

A sale that makes sense

TWE has long wanted to focus on its premium brands and the beating the company recently took in the Chinese market has clearly pushed its hand to change its sales configuration on the US market. Zepponi says TWE was hit with a ""double whammy with the slowdown of sales in the US and the political fallout with China and Australia"".

Since the company's standoff with China accelerated interest in changing up its US portfolio Zepponi notes that TWE ""wanted to make some quick decisions relative to the US portfol"". The sale to TWG makes sense because the company ""is not afraid of those lower-priced brands and it actually has a sweet-spot for them"" he concludes. ""It is a win-win for both parties.""

""Treasury has not made a secret of wanting to focus on wines that they refer to as 'masstige'"" notes Moramarco. ""Generally these brands are declining so they are a drag on revenue and earnings growth for a public company."" The benefits to TWE in the case of this sale ""are similar to benefits to Constellation with Gallo deal"" he adds.

TWE has long struggled to balance its business in the US for some time add both Rannekleiv and Zepponi. At times according to Zepponi they seemed to get it rebalanced but once again the brand mix tilted like a pinball machine. So getting rid of brands that aren't a fit for them will help them ""free them up in the future to add brands that will help them be successful"" Rannekleiv says.

Moramarco agrees. ""Treasury will find it easier to spend more time on brands they want to concentrate on. However they might make some staffing adjustments with the loss of gross profit.""

The Gallo deal

There are similarities to Constellation Brand's $810 million sale of its lower-end brands to Gallo that was announced in April and completed in January of this year. ""There is a trend of publicly held companies selling off their lower-end portfolio. These brands are not as attractive and won't show shareholders growth"" shares Rannekleiv. In comparison ""a private company can see these acquisitions as very profitable"".

On the other hand a larger stable of brands stands to benefit TWG in the long term according to a handful of analysts. This acquisition will also help TWG to maintain relevance with retailers adds Rannekleiv. What is more TWG manages ""lower-priced brands very well"". He adds that the purchase is also ""an interesting opportunity for the TWG to consolidate their role at the value end of the market"".

Given the recent spate of IPOs and SPACs – an acronym for a special purpose acquisition company that is publicly traded and has no assets other than cash – including Vintage Wine Estates which slated to close in May; and Duckhorn a company that just stated its intentions to go public some wonder if this sale is a precursor to a larger TWE merger.

Butler a sophomore at Virginia Tech posted a time of 2:02.15 just off the school-record 2:01.96 she ran two weeks ago in winning the event at the Atlantic Coast Conference Championships.

Baylor's Aaliyah Miller led nearly the entire race Saturday and won in a meet-record 2:00.69. Clemson's Laurie Barton who placed second just behind Butler at the ACC Championships was second in this meet as well finishing in 2:00.69. Shafiqua Maloney of Arkansas took third in 2:01.22. All three are seniors.

The performance from Butler gave the Elmira-Corning area its second first-team All-American finish in two days at the meet. Elmira High graduate Abbey Wheeler a graduate student at Providence College took fifth in the 5000 meters Friday night.

Butler advanced to the 800 finals by placing second in her heat during Friday's prelims in 2:04.61.

She was the outdoor state champion in the 800 as a senior at Corning-Painted Post in 2019 setting a Section 4 record with her time of 2:06.88 in Middletown. She was an indoor state champion in the 600 that year.

Another championship meet Monday

Jessica Lawson who won multiple state titles at Corning is one of the top runners for the Stanford women's team that is expected to contend for a team title at Monday's NCAA Cross Country Championships in Stillwater Oklahoma.

Stanford is ranked fourth nationally and coming off a win in the Pac-12 Championships. Lawson a senior placed ninth.

Union-Endicott alumna Emily Mackay a senior will represent Binghamton University after becoming the first Bearcats woman to win the America East title earlier this month.

The men's field will include another former Corning runner Quinn Nicholson. The junior competes for Georgetown which was selected as a full team after finishing as Big East runner-up.

The women's race starts at 12:50 p.m. Eastern time with the men beginning at 1:40. Live coverage will be available on ESPNU or the ESPN app.

Summit local Gerard top American in 4th Corning 11th

ASPEN — Red Gerard led the American contingent in Friday’s men’s snowboard slopestyle final at the World Championships in Aspen but it wasn’t enough to sneak onto a star-studded podium led by Norway’s Marcus Kleveland.

Kleveland a four-time X Games champion —including Aspen big air gold only six weeks ago — nearly dropped out of the final after hurting his leg in training.

“I was about to go take an X-ray but I wanted to do it. So I went back up and did the contest. And I’m happy about it now” Kleveland said. “For sure was a little bit nervous because my leg felt kind of weak. But as soon as I dropped in I didn’t feel any pain and was so focused on what I was going to do. I’m so happy of the day.”

Friday’s final was a massive 16-man field down from the more than 50 who competed in qualifying on Wednesday. With only two runs in finals to impress the judges Kleveland wasted no time and scored 86.86 on his first run which would have been enough to win the contest. He didn’t stop there; however scoring 90.66 on his second run primarily by turning his cab (riding opposite foot forward and rotating to the board’s front side) 1440-degree rotation on the final jump into a cab 1620 (4 1/2 rotations).

This was Kleveland’s first slopestyle competition at Worlds. He did compete at Worlds in 2017 winning big air bronze.

Canadian veteran Sebastien Toutant won silver Friday scoring 82.53 on his first run. The 28-year-old is a two-time X Games champion going back to his slopestyle win in 2011 but this was the first time he’s ever competed at the World Championships.

“The course was perfect. The weather was perfect. The boys were killing it. Hyped I got second place today” Toutant said. “Any podium it’s the best feeling ever getting back on it. I’m stoked I’m still in shape and I love snowboarding.”

Winning bronze was Finland’s Rene Rinnekangas who like Kleveland is 21 and one of the sport’s most popular and talented young riders. Like so many his age he idolized snowboarders like Toutant growing up. Toutant’s career highlight is arguably his big air gold from the 2018 Winter Olympics.

“Snowboarding never felt this good” Rinnekangas said. “I’ve been watching Seb since I was a little kid and same with Marcus even though we are the same age. But just watching X Games him and Seb riding in X Games it’s an amazing feeling to share the podium with those guys.”

Gerard the reigning Olympic slopestyle champion from Silverthorne was fourth with a first run score of 82.28. Japan’s Kaito Hamada was fifth (80.23) Canada’s Max Parrot was sixth (78.60) and California’s Dusty Henricksen was seventh (77.90). Henricksen emerged onto the scene at X Games Aspen in January by winning two golds as a rookie including becoming the first American since Shaun White in 2009 to win X Games snowboard slopestyle.

Local pro snowboarder Chris Corning finished 11th (72.41) and Hawaii’s Lyon Farrell was 12th (70.63). Corning entered as the reigning world champion winning in 2019 after he led qualifying and the finals were canceled due to weather.

California’s Judd Henkes was the only American to not make finals this year. Also among the big names to not have made finals was Canada’s Mark McMorris who has more X Games medals than any other winter athlete despite having missed this year’s X Games competition after getting a positive COVID-19 test. McMorris won silver at Worlds in 2019 while Henkes had been the reigning bronze medalist.

The company was moving forward with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine. Calitri a chemical engineer by training was in charge of Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Kalamazoo Michigan where the constituent parts of the vaccine would eventually be assembled before being shipped across the country. “At first I was really excited” he told me. “And then after I sat down on the couch and started thinking about it I was horrified because I knew that it was going to take the full force of everything we could throw at it.”

Typically vaccine manufacturing doesn’t begin until a candidate has proved to be both safe and effective in animal and human testing. In the past that process could take ten years; Pfizer’s vaccine which was developed in collaboration with BioNTech a German biotechnology company took a record ten months. The vaccine received emergency-use authorization from the F.D.A. on December 11th; two days later the company began shipping tens of thousands of doses all of which had been made while clinical trials were still under way.

In Kalamazoo on a campus larger than Central Park Calitri’s team worked around the clock. Pfizer hired roughly seven hundred workers reassigned experienced engineers to the vaccine effort and increased the number of vials that it could produce by installing additional “fill and finish” machines. Even so by the end of 2020 the company had delivered only half of its initial production goal of a hundred million doses. A Pfizer spokesperson told me that among other things “securing enough raw materials took longer than we expected.”

Five days after his Inauguration Joe Biden set a goal that a hundred and fifty million vaccinations would be administered in the first hundred days of his Presidency. At the time about eight hundred thousand Americans were receiving a vaccine each day most of them health-care and other front-line workers. The Trump Administration had left distribution planning up to the states; as vaccine appointments were made available to older Americans in many states in mid-January some vaccination sites were flooded with requests but others sat relatively empty. “It was like running out on the field during the Super Bowl and telling the players to just do whatever they want” Bruce Y. Lee a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy told me. “So it’s actually not a big surprise given the apparent lack of planning that we’ve run into a lot of problems with the vaccine distribution.”

Even as more vaccines became available—by early February roughly a million and a half shots were being administered a day—the quest for a vaccination appointment was being compared to winning the “Hunger Games” or beating the house at a Las Vegas casino. So far just over ten per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated. The reason for the slow pace as Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado said at a recent congressional hearing is that “we still face a lack of vaccine supply to meet current demand.”

On February 11th Biden announced that the government had signed a deal with Pfizer and Moderna—the latter’s vaccine had been authorized for emergency use by the F.D.A. on December 18th—for an additional hundred million doses each. Both vaccines are based on a messenger-RNA platform or mRNA for short that has previously never been produced commercially. At the end of February Johnson & Johnson received an emergency-use authorization for its one-shot vaccine which is based on a DNA platform similar to the company’s Ebola vaccine. A few days later Biden announced that Merck whose own COVID-vaccine efforts had failed was going to help Johnson & Johnson to boost production.

The White House has sounded particularly optimistic this week. On Wednesday the President announced a plan to secure an additional hundred million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. On Thursday during his first prime-time Presidential address he directed states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by the beginning of May. The catch: none of the increased supply that has been established since Biden’s Inauguration will be available until late spring at the earliest and most of it will not arrive until the end of the year. All adults may be eligible to receive a vaccine in a couple of months. But whether doses actually will be available will depend on a lot of things going right.

When the President of the United States places an order for millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine they do not simply appear like Amazon packages two days later. For much of the past year it has taken Pfizer a hundred and ten days to produce each vial of vaccine. The time line starts at the company’s plant in Chesterfield Missouri outside St. Louis which houses a cell bank of frozen E. coli bacteria. Scientists extract DNA from the E. coli cells to grow the template called a plasmid on which the vaccine’s mRNA will be built. Once the plasmid is made purified and tested the double-helix structure of the DNA has to be linearized—literally made linear. The process takes about ten days after which it goes through additional testing. “We’re going twenty-four hours a day with three manufacturing shifts” Christine Smith the Chesterfield-site leader told me. “And then there’s another shift making all the buffers and media to grow the cells in and getting ready for the next day. It’s a very regimented process. It’s not like we can just open up a door to the room next door and start making it.”

From Missouri the plasmid is flown to Pfizer’s campus in Andover Massachusetts where it is incubated in a bath of enzymes and nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA—for several hours. The process called in-vitro transcription synthesizes the genetic material the RNA which carries the instructions to make a modified form of the spike protein that causes COVID-19. (These reëngineered spikes are what trick the immune system into creating antibodies to defend against the coronavirus.) A few days later the RNA is placed in specially designed bags frozen and flown overnight to Kalamazoo where Calitri’s team puts the final drug product into vials and inspects and labels them before freezing them at ultra-low temperatures. When it’s time to ship them out the vials are packed with dry ice—Pfizer has its own dry-ice-manufacturing facility on site—in thermal containers created specifically for this vaccine each with its own G.P.S. unit and temperature alarm. (When the initial vaccine drive is over one of Pfizer’s shipping containers will be sent to the Smithsonian Tanya Alcorn the company’s head of biopharma supply chain told me.)

Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine candidates require rare ingredients that are in short supply such as the lipids used to encase the mRNA and the enzymes used to transcribe it. Calitri meanwhile had been grappling with a series of engineering puzzles. “There’s a step in which the mRNA is coated with these lipids and it’s done in a specialized mixer” he told me. “The mixers we were using to develop the process are very small”—about the size of a silver dollar. His team didn’t have time to design a larger mixer so they tied together a hundred of the silver dollars. When the filters on some of the filling equipment needed to be replaced switching to a different filter was not an option because any adjustment to the process would have to be approved by the F.D.A. Instead the team had to learn how to “regenerate” the ones they had. It took six months and numerous prototypes to figure out how to store and ship a frozen product that needed to be kept at subzero temperatures. There were some misses too. They thought the vaccine would need to be frozen as soon as it came off the filling line so they installed blast freezers; the data have since shown such precautions to be unnecessary. “We needed to have options” Calitri explained.

Even before the clinical trials were completed it was obvious that Pfizer’s domestic operation would not have enough capacity to meet the U.S. demand. In July Pfizer ordered two prefabricated modular manufacturing suites but they took eight months to build and finally arrived in Kalamazoo in mid-February. “This is not like a production line for making cars or trucks” Tim Manning the supply coördinator for the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 response team told me. “This is extraordinarily complex biochemistry. And it happens at the molecular level. . . . It’s really complicated and made on extremely rare and difficult-to-make machinery.”

Most years the health-care supply chain is fairly stable. Hospitals anticipate how many N95 masks nitrile gloves and various medications and vaccines they will need based on what they’ve needed in the past. The pandemic year exposed the fragility of that system. In early 2020 with a COVID-19 vaccine still on the distant horizon Rick Bright the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority warned the Trump Administration that once there was a vaccine there would likely be a shortage of syringes needles and glass vials. At the time manufacturers were producing around fifteen to twenty billion glass vials for all of the world’s medications in a typical year. Bright was fired in April; in a searing whistle-blower complaint filed in May he predicted that it could take up to two years to produce enough vials just for the U.S. vaccination effort. “They can’t just crank out more vials” Kelvin Lee the director of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) told me. “That glass gets manufactured through very specialized processes. And ultimately glass comes from sand. Their raw-material suppliers have to think about where they are going to get the right kind of sand to make sure the vial is of appropriate quality.”

The government has been able to use the Defense Protection Act to secure a sufficient number of vials so far. Some recent advancements in glass technology will likely help too. The same month as Bright’s whistle-blower complaint was filed Pfizer signed a multiyear contract with Corning which is based in New York and manufactures a super-strong pharmaceutical-grade glass called Valor. In June of last year the Trump Administration awarded Corning more than two hundred million dollars to scale up production. But that deal will address only a fraction of the need. Chandra Brown who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing in the Obama Administration recently wrote in an online editorial “By this time next year I predict Americans will covet borosilicate glass”—the material used in traditional vials—“the same way they do N95 masks.”

The vials also need rubber stoppers. Last fall tropical storms in rubber-producing regions of Thailand Vietnam and India led to shortages that could have jeopardized the vaccination effort. The government used the Defense Protection Act to round up sufficient supplies but it was clear that a tremendous strain had been placed on the world’s rubber supply. “The D.P.A. is allowing the U.S. to hoard some of these materials for production of U.S. vaccines but is causing other shortages globally” Robert Handfield the executive director of the Supply Chain Resource Cooperative and a professor of supply-chain management at North Carolina State University told me. He also said that there is “very little visibility into the manufacturing bottlenecks that are occurring.” On March 5th the Times reported that officials in the United States and Europe say that they may not have enough syringes to administer the vaccine.

The supply of lipids used in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines continues to be precarious too. Vox recently reported that even among the few companies whose facilities can be repurposed to make lipids “not nearly enough of them are ready to make the kind of lipid nanoparticles we’d need to distribute billions of mRNA vaccine doses quickly.” As Stéphane Bancel Moderna’s C.E.O. told investors in January if “there’s one raw material missing we cannot start making products and that capacity will be lost forever because we cannot make it up.”

Recently the Biden Administration has used the Defense Protection Act to acquire enough low-dead-space syringes to be sent out with every Pfizer-vaccine shipment. (Such syringes enable a sixth dose to be extracted from Pfizer’s vials automatically increasing the company’s vaccine doses by twenty per cent.) With government support a company called ApiJect is building a “Gigafactory” in North Carolina to manufacture single-dose injectables to reduce waste and simplify the distribution of vaccines. (It is expected to come online in 2022.) The White House is also investing in the construction of factories that would be able to make more than a billion surgical gloves a month. The goal is to move enough production Stateside so that the domestic health-care supply chain is not dependent on other countries which in a crisis will likely choose to prioritize their own citizens.

Perhaps most crucially the government brokered a deal between Johnson & Johnson and Merck paying Merck up to $268.8 million to upgrade two of its manufacturing facilities. But it will take months for Merck to retrofit its facilities; the vaccines it will be making for Johnson & Johnson are not expected to be ready until the second half of the year. Meanwhile the company that Johnson & Johnson currently contracts with to produce its vaccines domestically has yet to receive F.D.A. approval. (The four million or so Johnson & Johnson vaccines that are now being distributed were made abroad.)

The most hopeful news is that Pfizer has cut the time it takes to make a batch of its vaccine to sixty days. As of mid-March the company expects to deliver more than thirteen million doses a week up from around five million last month. At a congressional hearing in February John Young Pfizer’s chief business officer explained that the company has begun making its own lipids and has increased capacity at its facilities in Kansas and Wisconsin (in addition to the new production suites in Michigan). It has also doubled batch sizes increased yields per batch and developed faster laboratory tests.

“We’re getting better at it” Calitri said of the manufacturing process. “I think people don’t know how challenging it is to make billions of doses of a product that you did not have a process for nine months ago. And then to scale that up even further. There’s so much involved from an engineering perspective from a quality perspective from a compliance perspective and from a safety perspective. We’re not making widgets. We’re making a product that people inject into their bodies—into healthy humans—and it has to be perfect. We need to make sure of that for every single dose. That takes engineering it takes science it takes time.”

Display and Design

All three smartphones boast the same 6.78-inch (2448 x 1080) Samsung AMOLED display with 144Hz refresh rate and 300Hz touch sampling rate. The three also come HDR10+ certified and geared with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.

Both ROG Phone 5 Pro and 5 Ultimate are equipped with ROG Vision a new rear matrix display that shows customizable animations for system alerts and status. The ROG Phone 5 Pro features a color ROG Vision display while the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a monochrome version. The standard ROG Phone 5 doesn’t have this feature but has a dot-matrix style RGB instead.

Additionally the ROG Phone 5 Pro and ROG Phone 5 Ultimate feature hidden rear touch sensors on the back cover which provide L2/R2 trigger functions similar to a game console controller. Both also work together with the ultrasonic sensors the AeroActive Cooler 5 buttons and the motion controls.

In terms of color options the ROG Phone 5 comes in either Phantom Black or Storm White. However you can only have the Storm White if you’ll go for the ROG Phone 5 Pro and the Phantom Black for the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.

Chipset

The three are powered by the latest flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor and Adreno 660 graphics which has enough power to run the ROG Phone 5’s features and the latest graphics-intensive games smoothly.

RAM and Storage

What also makes the smartphones different from each other are their RAM and storage configurations. The ASUS ROG Phone 5 is available in three RAM options: 8GB 12GB and 16GB and it has two storage options of either 128GB and 256GB. On the other hand the ROG Phone 5 Pro comes with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage while the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate boasts a higher 18GB RAM paired with 512GB storage.

Cameras

There’s no difference between the three smartphones in terms of cameras. The ROG Phone 5 series sport triple rear cameras consisting of 64MP Sony IMX686 (main) 13MP (ultra-wide) and 5MP (macro) sensors. Plus all of them have the same 24MP front camera. For a gaming smartphone this is a versatile set of cameras but we’ll know more about its performance once we have reviewed it.

Connectivity and Features

The ASUS ROG Phone 5 series also sport the same connectivity features such as Dual-SIM WiFi 6E Bluetooth 5.2 SatNav systems (GPS Glonass Galileo BeiDou QZSS NavlC) NFC USB-C in-display fingerprint scanners face recognition and a 3.5mm audio jack.

For software the three runs under the new ROG UI based on Android 11.

Additionally the three are also equipped with dual front-facing speakers by Dirac technologies and a 7-magnet stereo speaker with a Cirrus Logic amplifier for good audio quality whether you’re playing games watching videos or listening to music.

Battery

Looking at their capacities all pack the same 6000mAh battery with 65W HyperCharge support. It’s a massive battery capacity which is just right considering the numerous features that will suck up power.

Price

There’s no word yet about the series’ pricing and availability in the Philippines so stay tuned!

Based on the specs the standard ROG Phone 5 should be more than enough for any mobile gamer. But those with bigger budgets need the large RAM and storage capacities and a cooler design could go for the ROG Phone 5 Pro or ROG Phone Ultimate.

Breyer Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod Judge Amit P. Mehta Judge Joshua Deahl Judge Thomas B. Griffith (ret.) Marshal Pamela Talkin (ret.) and Attorneys Makan Delrahim and Andrew Weissmann.

This is the 35th year the “Mock Trial” has been presented and like last year it is virtual. In keeping with the Shakespeare Theatre Company and the STC’s Bard Association it is a delightful confluence of Shakespeare lawyerly wit and timely barbs focused on the news of the day. This year did not disappoint.

The arguments were made with brio and wit. The judges asked searching questions and kept the lawyers on their toes and it was seamlessly done. For once everyone was glad that nobody followed Shakespeare’s dictum to “…kill all the lawyers.” Because they slayed!

“A Winter’s Tale” the trial before the Supreme Court of Siciliy is an appeal against a lower court ruling. Having kept King Leontes and Queen Hermione apart for 16 years the lady-in-waiting Paulina claims that she was obeying the dictates of Apollo’s oracle and saved the life of the queen. Granted Leontes did believe she was unfaithful (the old whispering in the ear ploy) and condemned his queen and their baby girl to death but somehow Paulina kept this state of affairs going for 16 years gaining an outsized influence. Paulina has been ordered to pay 10000 florins to Leontes and Hermione who are also claiming to be aghast at missing 16 years of conjugal bliss (except Leontes seems to complain that Hermione has aged). It’s Shakespeare in all manner of mistaken identities treachery fumbling plots and vast egos — and then the lawyers get involved.

This year the court is helmed by the Chief Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States. Sitting on the bench with him are Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; Judge Amit P. Mehta United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Judge Joshua Deahl District of Columbia Court of Appeals; and Judge Thomas B. Griffith United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (ret.). It turns out that judges can speak in couplets iambic pentameter and limericks.

The advocates are Makan Delrahim University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School Former Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice for Leontes and Hermione; and Andrew Weissmann Jenner & Block LLP NYU School of Law Former General Counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation making the case for Paulina.

Reprising her role as the Marshal is Pamela Talkin Supreme Court of the United States (ret.). Much of the precis of the story is given by Hannah Yelland actress and veteran of STC’s “The Winter’s Tale” production and Abbe David Lowell Winston & Strawn LLP and member of the Bard Association.

The catchword for the day is wit. There were more topical references worked in and tossed off oh so casually than one could keep track of. Certainly the choice of play was apt — a deluded king given to pronouncements of alternative facts and catered to by a coterie of sycophants? This play is ripe for this treatment and the cast did it justice (excuse the pun). With the news of the past couple of years everyone was skewered. It was far more enjoyably than in real life.

There was one moment that if we could have been there in person would have brought about a standing ovation — when the inimitable RBG was respectfully and drolly referenced. The comments section at the side of the screen just exploded. It was a poignant yet wryly funny moment and much appreciated.

Sadly there was quite the disconnect between the spectators (for example the viewers had the opportunity to vote on whom we thought won) and the judges on the charges brought. The judges’ verdict was that Paulina loses (to be honest I cheered) and the audience thought she had won.

The arguments were made with brio and wit. The judges asked searching questions and kept the lawyers on their toes and it was seamlessly done. For once everybody was glad that nobody followed Shakespeare’s dictum to “…kill all the lawyers.” Because they slayed!

There was one final surprise. As the judges and lawyers were signing off a kitten showed up and the befuddled lawyer assured us all that “I’m not really a cat!” So we ended with a judge singing limericks some robust couplets — and a cat. It was all pretty perfect.

Samin references this in a follow-up tweet about the ""ethics of cheap chicken"" which she calls ""so awful."" These remarks came in reply to a TASTE piece by Cathy Erway that does a deep-dive into the grocery store stalwart and bridges the gap between ""cheap"" rotisserie chicken and the homey deeply satisfying roasted whole chicken that would be fit to serve at a holiday meal.

Erway notes that Costco which was founded in 1983 and has 785 locations throughout the US offers a $4.99 rotisserie chicken. She also notes that many rotisserie chickens are injected with spices or seasonings which is obviously not a usual occurrence in home-cooked roasted chickens. Some rotisserie chickens also have additional additives such as food dye or preservatives.

Andrew Gunther the executive director of A Greener World stated that cheap rotisserie chicken like Costco's is ""still chicken but it's not been outdoors and it's going to have been grown as quickly as it can be by a contract farmer who has absolutely no rights."" Moreover many processing plants are not operating under safe conditions especially during COVID. Gunther also said that ""there is no such thing as cheap food – there is a consequence. Something has been compromised to give you that product."" Of course you could buy a whole chicken and some buttermilk and make Samin's recipe instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL3BvcHVsYXItY29zdGNvLXByb2R1Y3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Costco Products That Fans Are Obsessed With — Eat This Not That,"When Costco shoppers love a product they really love it.

Cinnamon Pull-A-Part

Costco made the right decision in bringing back its Cinnamon Pull-A-Part after claiming it was gone for good. The ooey-gooey treat is packed with deliciousness — and sugar — and should definitely be saved for a special treat.

Novo Ravioli

These seasonal ravioli are flying off the shelves and will probably disappear soon which means you need to snap them up as soon as you can! The fun pasta is filled with white cheddar parmesan cheese shredded mozzarella velvet ricotta and Irish aged cheddar. The good news is that Novo has ravioli to suit whatever the holiday is so once March passes there's bound to be another ravioli shape around the corner.

Chocolate Chunk Cookies

You won't find a better deal than Costco's Chocolate Chunk Cookies. Snag a 24-pack of these treats for under $8 and feed your whole house in one go. Costco's bakery section is top-notch so you know these cookies will be on point. They'll also most definitely be full of sugar but again everything in moderation.

Just Bare Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks

These chicken nuggets went viral early this year and are continuing to be a popular buy at the warehouse. The Just Bare Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks are a perfect dupe for Chick-fil-A's iconic nuggets but can be made at home and cost far less. After one savvy shopper shared her experience on TikTok shoppers immediately snatched up bags of these nuggets for themselves — and you should too.

Rotisserie Chicken

It's true! Costco's rotisserie chicken is one of the store's most popular items. These birds are simple and delicious — and cost less than $5. In fact Costco sold over 101 million rotisserie chickens last year. That's a whole lot of poultry.

Tipiak Pull-Apart Cheese Bread

Cinnamon-Pull-Apart isn't the only pull-apart option Costco shoppers love. Costco recently brought back the Tipiak Pull-Apart Cheese Bread to much fanfare. The cheesy loaves of bread are stuffed with brie Emmental and mozzarella cheeses. Definitely heavy on the calories but also heavy on the deliciousness.

Decadent Fudge Brownie

Basically anything you pick up from the bakery section at Costco is going to be delicious and is going to have a lot of fans. This massive fudge brownie is no different. It lives up to its name and is completely decadent but that means it's not going to be anywhere in the healthy spectrum. It's a fan-favorite but definitely one that should be eaten very very sparingly.

Brown Sugar Boba Ice Milk Bar

Perhaps it's because these are so hard to find or perhaps it's simply because they're delicious but these Brown Sugar Boba Ice Milk Bars are incredibly popular with Costco fans. The popsicles are sweet and refreshing and not like most of what you'll find in the freezer aisle.

Interestingly enough customers bought$65.1 billion more frozen food last year than in 2019. Here's what they spent the most on.

Pizza

Costco's pizza — both in the food court and in the refrigerated section — is ridiculously popular and ridiculously delicious. Not only is it a budget-friendly food option but it's just really tasty. Plus you have options: The food court has slices or full pizzas and the refrigerated section has whole pizzas for later.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Coffee

Costco shoppers love turning to the warehouse aisles to pick up bags of coffee. Costco sells Starbucks products but also Kirkland products as well — which are basically the same but with a lower price tag. If you aren't already buying your coffee at Costco you should definitely start.

Costco has finally announced the opening date for its new store in west Edmonton.

The company’s Costco Business Centre at Stony Plain Road and 186 Street in the city’s northwest will open on April 6.

The 127000 square-foot warehouse has been in the works since November 2019.

Another Costco Wholesale store already operates in the Granville neighbourhood in west Edmonton just seven kilometres away from the new business centre.

The new store will bring the number of Costco stores operating in the Edmonton area to eight: four wholesale stores three wholesales in St. Albert Sherwood Park and Leduc and the business centre in the city.

The business centres offer different products than Costco’s wholesale locations. They tailor more towards businesses and offer larger quantities of products and business-specific items like food packaging.

Costco members can shop at the business centre with no extra charge to their membership.

Costco,"LOS ANGELES -- Police body camera video released Monday shows the moments after an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer shot and killed a man inside of a Corona Costco in 2019.

In the newly released body camera footage off-duty Los Angeles Officer Salvador Sanchez who initially cooperated with police can be heard saying he wanted an attorney present before he answered any further questions.

The video shows officers with the Corona Police Department arrive on the scene as frantic customers ran out of the store. Once inside the video shows officers finding off-duty Officer Salvador Sanchez laying on the ground.

Officer: Are you hurt? Did you get shot?

Sanchez: I thought I got shot. I still feel pain in the side of my head.

Sanchez told police that he returned fire after believing he had been shot killing 32-year-old Kenneth French who was developmentally disabled and wounding his parents.

Sanchez: I see a blast and I feel my head get knocked off and I fall to the ground and dropped my son. When I dropped my son I looked over and the guy like hunkers down.

Officer: What guy?

Sanchez: The guy in the blue shirt. I believe he was still armed and so I shot.

But police never found a weapon and Sanchez was not shot.

Security video released after the shooting showed some kind of physical altercation between the two men but it was not clear how the altercation started or how it escalated into a fatal shooting.

Prosecutors and a grand jury declined to file charges against Sanchez but LAPD ruled the shooting was outside department policy.

And while Sanchez initially answered the officer’s questions in the newly released video he later changed his mind and said he would not be talking further without a lawyer present.

“As far as any further questioning I will lawyer up” he said in the video.

LAPD said Sanchez has not been employed with the department since June of last year. As for the French family they have filed a lawsuit against Sanchez and the city."

The interview went on to attract over 17.8 million viewers in the US alone.

The widely viewed interview has put the Royal family is in the eye of the storm following some steep accusations made by out-of-favour royals Prince Harry and Megan Markle.

One of the standout accusations according to Forbes was the cutting off of the annual $7.8 million disbursed to the Royal princes for their private family operations. Prince Harry’s son Archie was also excluded from assuming the prince title and being a working Royal.

Experts at Forbes believe the bad publicity following the Oprah Winfrey interview is putting the UK Royal Family Business at risk. The UK Royal family is a standalone organization separated from the official UK Government.

Have you ever wondered how they make money?

Royal Family Business

The UK royal family business structure is known as “The Firm” or Monarchy LLC.

It is a $28bn business entity with over 1000 years of history. It is carefully managed by the senior members of the UK Monarchy.

In this brief article we are going to highlight 3 major ways the British Royal Family makes money annually.

Sovereign Grant

The Sovereign Grant is the official funding provided by the UK government to its Monarchy.

The Sovereign Grant covers the Queen’s costs of travel security staff and the upkeep of royal palaces. The Sovereign Grant is generated from the Crown Estate. The crown estate is a collection of prestigious UK farms and estates that generates millions of pounds every year. The UK government collects a huge chunk of it and gives the Queen 20% of it.

According to CNN Money the Queen received £42.8 million ($58 million) free of tax from the Sovereign Grant in the 2016–2017 fiscal year.

The payment was projected to grow to £76.1 million ($103 million) in the latest fiscal year to help finance an extensive renovation of Buckingham Palace. Senior members of the Royal family are paid directly from the sovereign grant too.

A UK brand valuation firm stated that the UK Royal family added an estimated $70 million to the media industry in 2017.

According to the BBC the tourist board of Great Britain stated that the tourist attractions to the UK Royal family palaces pull in £550 million every year.

The Royal family also makes a lot of money through the goodwill of well-wishers and fans.

Its sequel The Stars in the Bright Sky was longlisted for the 2010 Booker prize. His new novel Kitchenly 434 is set in 70s Sussex and narrated by a rock star’s deluded butler. Warner who grew up in Oban spoke to me on Zoom from Edinburgh where he had recently been self-isolating on arrival from his home in Spain en route to the University of Aberdeen where he teaches creative writing.



What led you to write an English country house comedy?

I’d been working on a longer novel involving the building of Scotland’s coastal defences in the second world war; it’s giving me a lot of trouble and it was nice to just not deal with Scotland for a bit. I do that thing of having three books on the go at once so that all my eggs aren’t in one basket: I do it out of insecurity – it’s a weakness I don’t think it’s good – but I feel if things aren’t going well in one book I can move to another. I wanted to write about rock music but it’s hard to write about – few have done it well and so I was looking for a weird tangent to come at it from. In a freakish way this is my most autobiographical novel: all Crofton does is hang out on his own in the house listen to old records and read books.



And yet the story becomes excruciatingly tense…

Yeah I’ve always thought there’s room for boredom and monotony in a book if it heightens the tension. Crofton’s elusiveness as a narrator does get sinister when two teenage schoolgirls turn up at the mansion and disrupt his exceptionally dull life. You can see potential disaster – we all have that narrative in our heads now – but while I needed that jeopardy in the book I also wanted to defuse all that sexuality stuff. This is a book about a guy who does the right thing.



The critic Frank Kermode said he couldn’t understand your 1997 novel These Demented Lands. Are you less keen on stylistic experiment now?

My novels settle down a bit after The Worms Can Carry Me to Heaven; in terms of technique Their Lips Talk of Mischief could have been written in 1896 which bothers me. Probably there’s an element of me just getting older and crap but it’s easy to underestimate The Deadman’s Pedal which is composed of long filmic sequences in a vérité style that I don’t think I’d have been confident about if I hadn’t experimented previously. James Kelman was still an influence there. Way down in the new book there is an anti-novelistic Samuel Beckett thing going on but it’s fairly welcoming. The trouble is so many influences are swarming round me all the time: I adore Kelman but I adore PG Wodehouse as well. How the hell do you harmonise Wodehouse and Kelman? That’s what I’m fighting out.



What’s going on with the film of The Sopranos?

It’s ready. It’s called Our Ladies. I think it’s fantastic but with Covid the industry is in limbo. Michael Caton-Jones took 20 years to make it and it might take 20 years to release! He had lots of opportunities to get it made if he moved the action to Los Angeles but he always said no we’ll make it in Scotland and it’ll be faithful to the book.



What about Irvine Welsh’s film of The Man Who Walks?

The financial crash scuppered that one. It was all lined up – this was September 2008 – and then suddenly a queue developed outside the Northern Rock building society in Edinburgh and the investors ran for the hills. Billy Connolly had agreed to play the title role. Irvine met him with a first draft script at the Prestonfield hotel in Edinburgh and they walked round a suite in circles trying to prove their different ideas of how The Man Who Walks should walk. I wish I’d been there.



In 2010 the body of the MI6 agent Gareth Williams was found in a bag in his bath. On a table in his flat was a copy of your first novel Morvern Callar in which a corpse is dismembered in a bath and put into a bag. What did you think when you saw that?

It was very sad. The poor man died under very mysterious circumstances. It does kind of bring it home that your books are out in the world; I remember a headline in the [Evening] Standard – “grisly thriller clue to spy death” something like that – and it’s fantastic in terms of mystery to think you’re implicated in such a headline but the connection was tenuous. Even if the guy read it what happened seems more sinister than the grisly disposal of a suicide in Morvern Callar.



Which writers do you recommend to your students?

Some of them might be writing science fiction so I put them on to Michael Moorcock and Roger Zelazny. Some of them might be writing fantasy – there’s a whole post-Harry Potter generation coming through – so I direct them to Mervyn Peake who they’re always delighted to discover. I still recommend Duncan McLean’s collection of stories Bucket of Tongues which was such an inspiration to me; Irvine too. Each story has its own style and rhythm; there’s such a variety of experience in it. But it’s out of print – you can’t set it otherwise the class struggles to find 30 copies and you end up paying £17 a go.



What have you been reading lately?

Besides the proofs of my own bloody book which is horrible I’ve been reading David Sheppard’s biography of Brian Eno On Some Faraway Beach. It’s my third time; I’m bizarrely addicted to rereading this book in the evenings. Eno’s life seems to have a certain tranquillity and order much as some of his music does and I find it very comforting.

While there are several different options now available to the commercial trucking world not many people realize that RAM was actually working on building a truck for those who haul heavy loads across the country.

Enter the 2011 Ram 5500 “Long-Hauler” Concept. Based on the Class 5 Ram 5500 Crew Cab Chassis-Cab which was designed to suit the needs of anyone that tows multiple or heavy trailers drives long distances or small business owners looking for a “workhorse” at the job site RAM designers ditched the Crew Cab configuration for the much larger Mega Cab passenger compartment.

The next step was to add an 8-foot box to the chassis. To fill out the gap between the Cab and box with the extended length chassis RAM then fitted a mid-ship fuel tank to extend the range between refueling stops. Combined with a second frame-mounted tank and a third optional bed-mounted auxiliary tank the total fuel capacity equaled 170 gallons.

Under the hood of the Long-Hauler Concept was the legendary 6.7-liter H.O. Cummins Turbo Diesel inline six-cylinder rated at 800 lb.-ft. of torque. The Cummins was mated to a 6-speed Aisin AS68RC automatic transmission with a four-wheel-drive (4×4) transfer case coupled to a 4.88 Dana 110 axle with dual rear wheels.

The Long-Hauler Concept rode on a 197.4-inch wheelbase and 37500 Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR). It was the perfect combination for those wanting to step up from the traditional Class 3 (1-ton) and Class 4 trucks. The overall length of the Ram Long-Hauler Concept was a massive 24 feet with a height of 79.1 inches and a curb weight of about 9300 lbs.

Riding on a full Kelderman Air Suspension front and rear and 19.5-inch Alcoa aluminum wheels on-road driving dynamics was civilized and even the toughest road surfaces were easily absorbed providing the driver and passengers with a smooth comfortable ride. In fact the Ram Long-Hauler Concept’s ride qualities were more in line with those of a 3/4-ton truck. The suspension package was also self-leveling with a kneel feature.

On the exterior the Long-Hauler was painted with a Brillant Black exterior paint accented by White Gold Metallic color two-tone on the body side moldings and wide wheel flares at the front and rear. The scheme mimicked that of the production Laramie Longhorn paint scheme.

Upfront a bull bar extended the entire width of the vehicle. For full use of the bed a spare tire was located under the floor of the pickup box. To help make the trailer line-up easier was a camera showing the full-new of the pickup box. This would make production with the Center High-Mount Stop Lamp with Cargo View Camera now part of the Towing Technology Group.

A custom hitch-access tailgate allowed for easy hook-ups without the need to open or remove the entire tailgate.

Inside interior noise levels were heavily dampened with an upgraded NVH package that ensured a quiet cabin environment. The Long-Hauler Concept included 2+2 leather seating with a specific high-comfort driver seat. Rear passenger comfort was assured with power-adjustable footrests and a rear center console that includes a refrigerator cup holders and tray tables. With the interior Wi-Fi enabled passengers could easily work on laptop computers connected to the Internet during long drives.

Additional cabin features also included a laptop storage area and a safe for valuables. Interior items designed to keep the driver monitoring of vehicle performance included a tire pressure monitoring system rear axle temperature gauge and exhaust gas temperature and boost gauges. Convenience features included an inductive charger and DVD player with an overhead screen for rear-seat passengers could enjoy their favorite programs and entertainment. The rear seats and console also folded flat for additional storage or as a berth for resting.

RAM used the Long-Hauler Concept for customer feedback to see if such a vehicle was wanted by its customer base. RAM identified a potential market for a Class 5 pickup including race car teams car haulers RV owners ranchers and rodeo competitors boaters and commercial expediting operations. The Long-Hauler Concept went on a tour of 8 truck shows across the midwest during the summer and fall of 2011.

While RAM didn’t end up producing the Long-Hauler Concept it now offers a luxury Chassis-Cab on its Ram 3500 4500 and 5500 Chassis-Cab lineups. We are sure there is plenty of people looking for such a truck to come to market in today’s world.

What do you think? Should RAM build a production version of the Long-Hauler Concept?

It was an audacious introduction. But I could not begrudge the assumption she had made even if I was disoriented by the way she had expressed it. I too assume that much of the contemporary fiction I read is autobiographical. Douglas Stuart’s “Shuggie Bain” which won the Booker Prize drew openly on the author’s childhood. Ayad Akhtar wrote “Homeland Elegies” in the form of a memoir and Brandon Taylor a former doctoral student in biochemistry called his campus novel “Real Life.” Two of the buzziest books of early 2021 Lauren Oyler’s “Fake Accounts” and Patricia Lockwood’s “No One Is Talking About This” blur the lines between art and life while deploying the language and brain fugue of internet immersion. None of these books would be caught off-guard by a prying party guest.

“Write what you know” has been the novelist’s imperative at least since Charles Dickens retooled fragments of an abandoned memoir for “David Copperfield” and reached a logical extreme with the autofiction boom of the last decade. The belief that every novel is a self-accounting is timeworn too: Some early readers of “Lolita” suspected that only someone with the mentality of a child predator could have conjured the depraved Humbert Humbert. Publishers meanwhile often appear to want readers to see books as thinly veiled autobiography and their publicity campaigns typically emphasize authors’ personal connections to their work. This can backfire as with the P.R. blitz for Jeanine Cummins’s border-crisis blockbuster “American Dirt” which exaggerated the author’s Latina heritage and suggested that her husband is an undocumented Central American immigrant (he’s from Ireland).

Some of the boldest and most exciting novels of recent years have taken the autobiographical assumption and everything knit up in it — the nature of truth the boundaries between what is real and what is imagined — as a shadow theme. The first third of Susan Choi’s “Trust Exercise” steeps itself in the horny adolescent drama of a performing-arts high school modeled in part on the one Choi herself attended in Houston in the 1980s. Then however Choi raises another curtain and yet another her book shape-shifting into a dazzling metafiction on authorship and self-performance. From the opening pages of “The Need” Helen Phillips a mother of two captures the sticky overwhelm of early parenthood — the engorged breasts the toddler mayhem — with diaristic feels-real precision. But from the jump Phillips’s book is also operating in the realms of science fiction and body horror becoming a wondrously demented commentary on the slipperiness and duality of the maternal state.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTM2MjA2OS9UaGUtQmFjaGVsb3JzLUp1bGlhbmEtS2luZy1OaWNrLUN1bW1pbnMtc2Vhc29uLXNlY3JldGx5LXdlbGNvbWVzLWJhYnktYm95Lmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTkzNjIwNjkvYW1wL1RoZS1CYWNoZWxvcnMtSnVsaWFuYS1LaW5nLU5pY2stQ3VtbWlucy1zZWFzb24tc2VjcmV0bHktd2VsY29tZXMtYmFieS1ib3kuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bachelor's Juliana King from Nick Cummins' season secretly welcomes a baby boy,"She didn't find love with Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins on The Bachelor in 2018.

Juliana appeared on The Bachelor three years ago but didn't get very far with Nick - who infamously ended up choosing no one at the end of his memorable series.

However the sun-kissed blonde teacher is also known for appearing on Bondi Rescue as an experienced lifeguard.

She recently told Woman's Day that motherhood has been a 'beautiful and divine contrast' to her life as a professional lifeguard for 15 years.

Stores located in Kansas City Sedalia St. Louis and Ballwin are among those participating.

Anyone interested in getting a vaccine must book an appointment on the CVS website and fill out an eligibility form .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVmaW5hbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jdnMtd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWFuZC13YWxtYXJ0LXNoYXJlLWhvdy1uYXZpZ2F0ZS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbnMtbG9jYWwtcGhhcm1hY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Walgreens and Walmart share how to navigate vaccinations at the local pharmacy,"The Federal Retail Pharmacy Program is prioritizing vaccinating all school staff and childcare workers during the month of March according to a March 2 directive from the Department of Health and Human Services.

Teachers and staff in pre-K-12 schools and childcare programs will be able to sign up for an appointment at over 9000 pharmacy locations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this year pharmacies were also on the front lines in getting vaccines into the arms of residents of long-term care facilities.

How other eligible Americans get a vaccine at their local pharmacy depends upon vaccine rollout plans in individual states and upon the supply which has been unpredictable.

In November even before a vaccine became available 19 pharmacies partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services for consumer access to a COVID-19 vaccine. That number has grown to 21. On February 11 the federal government announced that one million doses would be going directly to 6500 pharmacies as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.

But vaccination confusion plagued some initial pharmacy efforts in February.

A spokesman for CVS among the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Pharmacy Retail Program acknowledged the potential for vaccine appointment confusion.

""When the first two approved vaccines were in development the challenges that CVS Health faced were related to storing the vaccines as they both have special requirements and both vaccines require two doses and timing between each dose varies"" said Charles Keller a CVS District Leader in Houston Texas by email.

""Additionally there are state-specific eligibility requirements that we must adhere to and this can cause some confusion for customers looking to make an appointment.""

The CDC directs individuals who are interested in getting vaccinated at their local pharmacy to their pharmacy's website or to visit VaccineFinder.org.

A visit to the VaccineFinder.org site muddies the waters except for residents of Alaska Tennessee Indiana Iowa Oklahoma Utah and New York excluding New York City where it says the vaccine is available at pharmacies. ""In other states information may be limited while more providers and pharmacies are added in the coming weeks"" the site says.

Most pharmacy partners are using online scheduling systems and walk-ins are not accepted.

In February even the National Governors Association looked for clarification on how the pharmacy program would work in tandem with state efforts.

""We believe it is important that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in its reporting distinguish between these separate efforts to avoid confusion and provide a clear understanding to the American people"" according to the February 15 letter to President Joe Biden.

HOW TO GET VACCINATED THROUGH PHARMACIES

Healthcare Finance News asked three of the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program – CVS Health Walgreens and Walmart – about their vaccination programs.

CVS is currently vaccinating individuals in 29 states and Puerto Rico based on federal eligibility guidelines with a ""limited supply"" of the Moderna Pfizer and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine according to Keller.

""CVS Health is also prioritizing CVS pharmacies located in vulnerable communities with a particular focus on Black and Hispanic populations which includes proactive patient outreach community-based partnerships vaccines clinics and education-focused marketing"" Keller said.

""As we expand to additional states and locations we will begin to increase access to vaccines by using mobile vaccination vans and offering community-based vaccination clinics by working with nonprofit organizations.""

Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the expectation is that the vaccine will be available in the vast majority of their pharmacies across the country as supply allows.

""Walmart is partnering with the CDC and states to move as quickly as possible to help administer vaccines to eligible populations in participating states with an emphasis on reaching customers in vulnerable communities with limited access to care"" McInnis said.

""Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering vaccines in more than three dozen jurisdictions including Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. through federal and state efforts.""

Walgreens supports vaccinations across 43 states and jurisdictions as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. It has administered approximately five million COVID-19 vaccinations across long-term care facilities in more than 4700 stores and through clinics.

""As we have throughout the pandemic Walgreens will continue to be there for our customers to help them with their health and wellness needs and we're committed to accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations as quickly as supply allows"" said Rina Shah the group vice president of Pharmacy Operations for Walgreens.

""With a flexible model of care that can meet patients where they are – be it in our stores or at off-site vaccination clinics – we're ready to administer COVID-19 vaccines in all of our more than 9000 store locations once they become available for mass availability.""

All three pharmacy chains recognize that demand for the vaccine currently outweighs supply.

Walgreens has received approximately one million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson Moderna and Pfizer per week as of early March.

""Consumers are eager to get vaccinated but we don't yet have enough vaccine supply for everyone who wants one"" Shah said. ""With the recent emergency use authorization of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and as supply increases we anticipate vaccinations to be available to the general population in the late spring/early summer time frame.""

As vaccine availability grows more appointments will become available.

""Once the vaccine is available to the general public we plan to administer vaccines at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide with the ability to administer up to 20 to 25 million shots per month by our approximately 50000 healthcare providers"" Keller said.

Individuals who are interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine through CVS can confirm their eligibility on their state's website and then schedule an appointment online in the CVS app or by calling customer service.

""Walk-ins will not be accepted so it's important for customers to check their local CVS pharmacy location and book an appointment when they are eligible to do so"" Keller said.

Consumers can sign up to get a vaccine through Walmart based on vaccine supply and eligibility which will vary based on state and local guidelines. Eligible customers can make an appointment through the Walmart and Sam's Club online schedulers.

""Appointment availability is based on current allocation so appointments will be limited based on quantities allocated by federal and state governments"" McInnis said.

To make a vaccine appointment at Walgreens eligible patients can schedule online through the pharmacy's online portal. For scheduling via phone individuals can call 1-800-Walgreens or their local Walgreens to access the scheduler which is available in English and Spanish.

In addition to the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program pharmacies can get vaccines from states through the Pharmacy Transfer Program according to the CDC. With this states can choose to transfer some of their federally allocated vaccine doses to federal pharmacy partners to further expand vaccine access.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Getting vaccinated is seen as the most effective way (along with the other safety measures such as mask-wearing) to stem the year-long pandemic and lockdown and prevent COVID-19 cases deaths and surges at area hospitals.

Hospitals continue to suffer financially due to the pandemic and the loss of elective procedures that keep them afloat. The American Hospital Association asked Congress for relief funding for hospitals in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed the House today but did not get it.

COLLECTION OF PATIENT DATA

The pharmacy program recently came under fire for collecting patients' information.

Chains such as CVS Health Walmart and Walgreens-Boots Alliance are collecting data from millions of customers as they sign up for shots enrolling them in patient systems and having recipients register customer profiles according to The Wall Street Journal.

The companies said the information is critical in streamlining vaccinations and improving record-keeping while ensuring only qualified people are receiving shots.

Neither CVS nor Walgreens require members to sign up for loyalty programs which track purchases in order to register for a vaccine.

McInnis said that in addition to appointments the Walmart scheduler ""will provide a digital reminder when it is time to return for a second vaccine if required which is why customers are asked to create a profile helping to ensure they receive the second dose of the vaccine.""

THE LARGER TREND

As of March 10 the U.S. had administered more than 95.7 million vaccine doses according to the CDC. Roughly 19% of the population have had at least one dose and about 10% are fully vaccinated.

A third of adults reported feeling confused about the vaccination process in the U.S. according to a January survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Feelings of confusion were most commonly reported among individuals 18 to 29 years old (40%) and Black adults (46%).

Reports of widespread confusion stretch from Massachusetts to California and are related to disjointed online portals for vaccine appointments and muddled communications around eligibility.

Making matters worse scammers are taking advantage of the confusion in attempts to squeeze money out of vulnerable individuals according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Participating pharmacies will bill private and public insurance for the vaccine administration fee. For uninsured patients this fee will be reimbursed through the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. No one will receive a bill for a COVID-19 vaccine according to the CDC.

In July the U.S. agreed to pay Pfizer $1.95 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine – the equivalent of $39 for a two-shot immunization according to Bloomberg. In August Moderna released a price of $32-$37 per dose ($64-$74 for a two-shot immunization). These prices include only the vaccine itself not administrative costs.

The average administrative cost is $45 per member to receive the appropriate vaccine dose or doses according to Eileen Flick director of Health Technical Services at Segal.

In a perfect world we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind we've noticed some promising trends at B&M European Value Retail (LON:BME) so let's look a bit deeper.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for B&M European Value Retail:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.16 = UK£452m ÷ (UK£3.6b - UK£776m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).

Thus B&M European Value Retail has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms that's a pretty normal return and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 17%.

More than 22 percent of Minnesotans with at least 1 vaccine dose

Nearly 13 percent of state residents have completed vaccinations

Number of active cases climbs back above 8500

Here are Minnesota’s current COVID-19 statistics:

6746 deaths (5 new)

497392 positive cases; 97 percent off isolation

22.3 percent of Minnesotans with at least 1 dose

74.9 percent 65 and older with at least 1 dose

The pace of COVID-19 vaccinations in Minnesota increased on Sunday with the latest update from state health officials showing an average of more than 43000 doses administered each day over the past week — the highest on record.

Nearly three-quarters of Minnesotans 65 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; more than 22 percent of all state residents have received at least one dose.

But at the same time the number of known active cases of the disease in Minnesota continued to rise to 8593 as of Sunday's update. That's up from fewer than 7000 early last week and the highest that number has been in more than a month although still well below the peak of more than 51000 seen in November.

“Active cases” refers to the cumulative total of people who've tested positive in recent days who still need to be self-isolating.

State officials have emphasized that even as more Minnesotans are vaccinated everyone needs to keep wearing masks and following physical distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus especially with COVID-19 variants confirmed in the state.

“It's just really important that we keep the cases down even as we are getting more people vaccinated. This is really a race against time. It's getting people vaccinated before these variants can take hold” Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm told reporters on Friday.

Baseball prom and weddings What to know about Minnesota's latest COVID dialback

While officials monitor the recent uptick in active cases overall trends have improved to the point where Gov. Tim Walz announced a rollback of many of the state’s remaining pandemic restrictions.

“Normalcy is on the horizon” Walz said in remarks Friday.

Inoculation progress

Vaccinations are big part of the optimism. Health Department data shows more than 700000 people — 12.7 percent of the state’s population — have completed their vaccinations while more than 1.2 million — about 22.3 percent — had received at least one dose.

Because doses are shipped once a week the state often sees its vaccination counts jump from Thursday through Sunday.

Shots for all possible by late April Minnesota expands vaccine eligibility

Pandemic metrics show active cases up

The increase in active cases is notable given the concerns about the rise of the U.K. COVID-19 strain in Minnesota.

Hospitalization rates were up slightly on Sunday but remain at levels last seen before the late-fall surge in cases: 240 people were hospitalized with the disease as of Thursday with 66 needing intensive care.

Five newly reported deaths brought Minnesota’s collective pandemic death toll to 6746 as of Sunday’s update. Among those who’ve died about 63 percent had been living in long-term care or assisted living facilities; most had underlying health problems.

The state has recorded 497392 total confirmed or probable cases so far in the pandemic including 997 posted Saturday. About 97 percent of Minnesotans known to be infected with COVID-19 in the pandemic have recovered to the point where they no longer need to be isolated.

Cases spread across age groups regions

People in their 20s still make up the age bracket with the state’s largest number of confirmed cases — more than 93000 since the pandemic began including more than 49000 among those ages 20 to 24.

New Minnesota COVID-19 cases by age adjusted for population

The number of high school-age youth confirmed with the disease has also grown with more than 39000 total cases among those ages 15 to 19 since the pandemic began.

With kids increasingly returning to school buildings and sports Minnesota public health officials are urging Minnesota families with children to get tested every two weeks for COVID-19 now until the end of the school year.

Although young people are less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease and end up hospitalized experts worry youth will spread it unknowingly to older relatives and members of other vulnerable populations.

People can have the coronavirus and spread COVID-19 when they don’t have symptoms.

Regionally all parts of Minnesota are in significantly better shape than they were in late November and early December. Some areas are seeing upticks in cases.

Worried you might have been exposed to COVID-19? Here’s what to do

Caseloads still heaviest among people of color

In Minnesota and across the country COVID-19 has hit communities of color disproportionately hard in both cases and deaths. That’s been especially true for Minnesotans of Hispanic descent for much of the pandemic.

Even as new case counts continue to track well below their late November early December peaks the data shows Latino people continue to be hit hard.

Distrust of the government together with deeply rooted health and economic disparities have hampered efforts to boost testing among communities of color officials say especially among unauthorized immigrants who fear their personal information may be used to deport them.

Walz has acknowledged that distrust by communities of color has been a problem during the pandemic. Officials have offered up some data on vaccinations broken down by race and ethnicity. The state is expected to update the data weekly.

Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm has said the state was committed to doing more to expand vaccine access to people of color including getting more doses to community pharmacies partnering with local groups and deploying mobile vaccination clinics.

Latest developments

More pharmacies in Minnesota administering COVID vaccine

Gov. Tim Walz announced Saturday that CVS Health and Goodrich Pharmacy have been added to the expanding network of pharmacies vaccinating Minnesotans across the state.

Minnesota now has five pharmacies with dozens of locations participating in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program which is a collaboration between the federal government states and territories and 21 national pharmacy partners and independent pharmacy networks. Other pharmacies and health care providers are providing vaccinations through the state.

Three CVS in-store pharmacies at Target stores in Duluth Rochester and Eden Prairie will receive 3510 vaccine doses this week according to the governor's office. Goodrich Pharmacy in the north Twin Cities metro will receive 1170 vaccine doses this week.

“As vaccine supply from the federal government continues to increase we’re building the path so getting your COVID-19 vaccine can be as easy as making an appointment online and walking into your local CVS at Target or pharmacy” Walz said in a news release. “We will continue to mobilize every option we have to get more life-saving shots into more arms as quickly as possible and end this pandemic together.”

Appointments at CVS and Goodrich Pharmacy will become available in the coming days and the locations and contact information for scheduling appointments will be accessible on the Vaccine Locator and Vaccine Connector websites when the information becomes available.

The Maroon 5 singer and former coach on The Voice and his wife model Behati Prinsloo purchased a historic estate in Montecito Calif. for $22.7 million in a deal that became finalized on March 9 according to public records. The couple bought a 100-year-old estate that spans just over 5 acres in Montecito where celebrities including Oprah Winfrey Ellen DeGeneres Rob Lowe and more have flocked to the comparatively small community in search of greater privacy.

Designed by famed architect George Washington Smith and originally built in 1923 the historic El Miraval estate consists of four different structures on a lavishly landscaped piece of land. The structures total 9 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms on 5.16 acres of prime California real estate Dirt.com reports.

Lockwood de Forest designed the extensive gardens for the picturesque estate and the official listing touts El Miraval as ""an opportunity to own one of the rare collaborative projects by the coveted team considered to be some of Montecito's most revered estates.""

The property includes a Spanish Revival-style primary residence a 2-bedroom guest house a single-bedroom garden cottage and a detached 5-car garage with a built-in 3-room apartment above it.

The estate's high-end amenities include a home theater wine cellar tennis pavilion pool terrace and a putting green. The interior of the main house features grand rooms with high ceilings exposed beams and arched windows with doors from many of the rooms leading to a terrace patio loggia or garden.

Levine and his wife are no strangers to luxury living. They previously owned a massive Beverly Hills mansion that they sold to Ellen Degeneres in 2019 which the talk show host listed for sale for $53.5 million in early March of 2021.

Ugg alongside their parent company Deckers Brands made clear of their commitment to the environment with the launch of their sustainability platform Feel Good back in October 2020. They have even gone so far as to align their goals with those set out in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. Now consumers get to see their environmental goals in action with the new Plant Power capsule collection.

Ugg’s Plant Power collection features sustainable men’s and women’s versions of some of the brand’s most popular and iconic shoe styles. The limited-edition line was manufactured with biodegradable materials that reduce carbon emissions.

Two of the standout styles from the collection are the Fluff Sugar Platform and the Fluff Sugar Sandals both part of Ugg’s extremely popular Fluff sandal series. To recreate both of these shoes the traditional petroleum soles were swapped out for soles made of SugarSole a foam derived from renewable sugarcane. Ugg claims that sugarcane is fast growing and requires minimal watering making it a sustainable crop in and of itself. The crop also absorbs 1.6 pounds of CO2 for every pound of ethylene that is replaced (ethylene is a widely used petroleum-based material in shoe soles). Further the colourful “fluff” on top of the shoes is made out of Tencel Lyocell which is sourced exclusively from responsibly-harvested trees in Forest Stewardship Council-certified forests.

The third style featured in the new plant-based Ugg collection is the Neumel Natural an eco-friendly version of their best-selling Neumel chukka. This version features a Tencel Lyocell lining and an upper made out of 55% cotton and 45% hemp. The decision to choose hemp was due to the fact that for every pound of hemp fibre produced the hemp plant absorbs 3.58 pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere. Further the Neumel Naturals have a sole derived from Lactae Hevea latex harvested from the Hevea rubber tree ensuring no forests were cut down in the production process. In addition Ugg’s new and improved Neumel Natural style was handcrafted and made in a small batch.

Ugg has made clear that the release of Plant Power is just the beginning. They have given themselves the target of increasing their use of recycled repurposed plant-based and bio-based materials by 35% between now and 2027.

The limited-edition Plant Power capsule collection is available on ugg.com as well as in Ugg stores around the world and via their many retail partners. Prices range from $110 to $140 USD.

WASHINGTON — The practice of planting a cash crop directly into an immediately terminated or growing cover crop has gained a lot of popularity in recent years as producers look for ways to work through tough spring planting conditions and maximize the benefits of cover crops says Brent Jones Iowa Research Farm Manager for GO SEED.

While this has resulted in a lot of new information being made available regarding things like which cover crop species work best with which cash crop and termination strategies there’s a huge misconception that planting green requires significant equipment investments.

“Work that GO SEED has done with producers and conversations had with industry experts has shown that many people are hesitant to even consider planting green due to the belief that it is going to require them to make huge upfront equipment investments for a practice they don’t even know will work for them” says Jones. “This is certainly not the case with many producers taking a bootstrapping approach by tailoring planting practices and cover crop specie selection to work with existing equipment or by taking the welder out and making modifications for a custom planter to work for them.”

To give producers ideas of how they can utilize existing equipment as is or make customizations two experienced cover croppers give insight below.

Customization

Loran Steinlage FLOLOfarms West Union Iowa

Farm background:

Making the most of the short 140 growing days per year in northeast Iowa has required Loran Steinlage of FLOLOfarms to cheat the system to encourage earlier spring growth and to maintain a living crop in the ground 365 days of the year for the 750-acre farm.

“Traditionally we were corn on corn and then corn on soybeans but we started to evolve to companion relay cropping in 2014” says Steinlage. “This allows us to focus on cycling plants to keep a living plant in the soil at all times to help aid in moisture management and weed suppression. Not only does this help pay the bills quicker but it has allowed us to start planting green in a tough climate.”

For FLOLOfarms planting green with a relay crop looks like doing a precision establishment of cover crops in the autumn following harvest and then interseeding the cash crop in the spring. However instead of terminating the cover crop at or shortly after planting the cash crop like most traditional methods Steinlage delays termination to maximise its benefits.

“For example in the autumn we’ll plant a field planned for soybeans to cereal rye. By the time we are ready for spring planting that cover crop will only be 2-3 inches tall so delaying termination will not only allow us to take advantage of the biological benefits of the cover crop but also its harvest potential” he says. “Really we are planting green and harvesting green.”

After several seasons of learning to push the limits of his system Steinlage is ready this year to start a relay of corn and beans and vegetables with cereal rye and buckwheat – giving him five crops in two years.

“At the moment the field is in cereal rye. This spring we’ll plant it with corn and let the cereal rye stand until June 15. At that point we’ll roll-crimp the cereal rye with an inter-roller to suppress it and then plant in a mix of vegetables including peas string beans and squash with the goal to harvest them before the corn. Since we suppressed instead of terminated the cereal rye will still be in the field. We will then interseed that field with beans next April – ideally we will harvest those two crops at the same time” he says. “If conditions allow our next cover crop after that will be buckwheat which will act as an insectary for the following soybean crop.”

Equipment:

Drill – Dawn DuoSeed Cover Crop Inter-Seeder row units on a custom frame

Skilled in engineering Steinlage built 10 drills before settling on a Dawn DuoSeed Cover Crop Inter-Seeder row units on a custom frame fitted with a MonTag seed/fertilizer box in 2016.

“Once I had a drill dialed in and figured out I’d already be looking ahead to the next one” he says. “This home build setup is simple effective and versatile” he says. “We can seed with it. We can put fertilizer down with it. Essentially that is the tool that made it all flow” he says.

According to Steinlage Dawn DuoSeed Cover Crop Inter-Seeder row units have been ideal due to being very low disturbance.

“You have to be careful with a lot of openers because the disturbance they cause will end up seeding weeds in with your interseed which is the biggest thing most people struggle with” he says. “We’ve found minimal soil disturbance to result in the best soil to seed contact. You really have to treat it like a cash crop.”

In-row roller – Dawn InRowl Roller

Through his customization work Steinlage has gone on to work with Dawn Equipment to help develop and test new projects. A recent one was the development of the InRowl Roller – designed specifically to suppress rather than termination.

“Suppression is really important to us to support an organic system by maintaining the residue mat. By doing this I only recently terminated clover than has been in the line since 2016” he says.

Piece of advice:

Before anyone invests any money into equipment for planting green Steinlage stresses the importance of getting the principles right first. And when the time is right to make upgrades start simple and stay within budget.

For those already planting green he advises to keep evolving and to not get locked in the same mindset.

“While something may be the best option right now that will not always be the case as you continue to understand how you can push things further. The best explanation I heard for this recently is that we are building the plane as we’re flying it.”

For both parties he recommends producers find a mentor that is planting green on scale – even if it is just someone to follow on Twitter – who will show you the good bad and ugly.

“Use others to get ideas and then tailor them for what will work for you and your overall business” he says.

Andrew Reuschel Reuschel Farms Golden Illinois

Farm background:

Starting in the 70s Reuschel Farms near Golden Ill. started its first experiment with cover crops and no-till on its 1200 acre corn and soybean operation. After a break the Reuschel family gave cover crops another try in the early 90s. Admittedly says fifth generation Andrew Reuschel the evolution of where they started to where they are today has not always been a pretty one.

“In the early days I wouldn’t even classify what we were doing as cover cropping because we weren’t getting any of the benefits. At one point we were using 3lbs of turnips with 3lbs of radishes per acre – that was insanity. We were going backward on what we wanted to achieve” recalls Reuschel. “But it was a learning process we had to work through to get to where we are today.”

The turning point was in 2010 when the decision was made to transition from brassicas to grass-based mixtures allowing the farm to start capturing soil health benefits.

Through continuous refining of practices and strategic decisions to achieve specific goals present day finds Reuschel planting the entire farm green with management decisions dictated by Mother Nature instead of calendar dates. So far this has allowed him to delay termination every year.

“For soybeans being planted into cereal rye I plant when I plant and terminate when I terminate – the two things are separate in my mind” he says.

While managed separately he relies on soil moisture and the 10-day forecast for both.

“It is all about managing the variables. If things are getting hot and dry I will have a look at the 10-day forecast to see how long I can wait until I have to terminate to maximize biomass growth but without hurting my soil or younger plants” he says. “If the beans are in the V1 to V2 stage and the cereal rye hasn’t headed yet but is just whipping out moisture I will go knock it down and beat it up just to buy myself a few more days before having to chemically terminate.”

Data collected on farm show that soybean yield has a conservative 2bu per acre advantage when cereal rye is knocked down when beans reach the V2 stage allowing for a lot of management flexibility. For corn on the other hand which is planted into a cover crop cocktail data shows that the cover crop needs to be knocked down and terminated at the time of planting.

“We can plant roll and chem in any order but the cover crop must be terminated before corn starts to emerge to give it immediate access to sunlight” he says.

To avoid wrapping issues when planting green cash crops must be planted in the same direction a swath was rolled. For Reuschel it is much simpler to plant green into a standing cover crop and then knock it down.

“Along with being able to knock the crop down without the need for GPS and maintaining perfect swath widths ahead of the planter this also allows reels to ride on top of the soil to avoid inconsistent seed depths with inconsistent areas of biomass – another lesson learned the hard way” says Reuschel.

When Reuschel Farms ventured into planting green they wasted no time or money on frills and put their 1986 Kenzie 2600 and 1993 John Deere planters with double discs and two press wheels to work.

“We have the two planters since beans are planted in 15 inch spacings and corn in 30 inch spacings” he says. “Aside from color these are essentially the exact same models. These planters are 100% standard and good to go without any modifications. As long as the cover crop is green these planters will just slide through it like butter. It doesn’t get any more bone stock than this.”

Roller – 20 foot I & J Cover-Crop Roller

To terminate Reuschel rents a 20 foot I & J Cover-Crop Roller from his neighbor.

“Since it is 20 foot it is the perfect setup to use when crimping ahead of corn. And the best part an I & J roller crimper is that hairy vetch sees it – which is notorious for wrapping – it lays down” he says. “This really is the Cadillac of termination tools.”

Crumbling basket – Designed as a stubble tillage tool Reuschel started renting his neighbor’s crumbling basket to terminate cereal rye and has recently purchased one of his own.

“It doesn’t do as good of a job as the I & J roller crimper but it is much more cost-effective to rent and is effective at knocking cereal rye over” he says.

Equipment not worth the hassle:

Residue managers – After trying multiple residue managers that have all caused huge issues with wrapping Reuschel has found it is best to keep things simple and to leave them off.

Roller crimper planter attachment – Starting out planting green Reuschel had his sights on eventually attaching a roller crimper to the planter to do everything in one pass. However the more he learns about the importance of keeping planting and termination separate particularly for soybeans the more he is losing interest in one.

Piece of advice:

Five years into evolving his planting green system Reuschel’s biggest piece of advice is to build flexibility and options into the entire system.

“You need to be able to make a decision at the absolute last moment you can to maximize what you’re trying to achieve because you can’t see into the future and know what conditions are going to be like two months from now” he says.

But most importantly he says to learn from mistakes.

“You will screw up. However you will learn more from screwing it up than you ever could have by getting it right” he concludes. “Keep evolving and learning new things. You’ll be amazed at how much you will be able to achieve.”

Making the most of a cover crop

While the practice of planting green is an innovative management strategy to maximize the benefits of cover crops producers can take it a step further by tailoring variety and specie selections to support the system and subsequent cash crop.

“Selecting a variety with a later maturing date will allow for greater management flexibility so the cover crop can be terminated when best for the system rather than working around early heading dates” says Jones.

Varieties also allow for producers to take advantage of specific traits such as cold tolerance or nitrogen production that can help a farm overcome unique geographical challenges and target nutrient benefits at the subsequent crop.

If producers plan to harvest a cover crop Jones advises them to work with their seed suppliers to ensure compliance is maintained for any government programs they may be part of and plant variety protections are not infringed.

“Certain USDA programs like EQIP have specific harvest and utilization guidelines that must be followed to avoid being disqualified” concludes Jones. “Using innovative management practices and genetic traits are a great way to make the most of your cover crop but make sure they are used in a way that don’t jeopardize other critical areas of your system.”

Flying business class between the East Coast and West Coast is normally among the most extravagant flying experiences in the US. The transcontinental flights attract no shortage of well-to-do flyers from businesspeople to celebrities and airlines go all out to make the experience as luxurious as possible for those that pay extra to sit in the premium cabins.

Flying home from Los Angeles to New York in February Delta was offering upgrades into its transcontinental first class cabin known as ""Delta One"" for a whopping $799. It was too rich for my blood but I got lucky and scored a complimentary upgrade into the cabin as a Delta elite status holder.

Delta had assigned one of its largest jets the Boeing 767-400 to the route due to the pandemic. And that meant flying in a top-tier business class cabin normally reserved for intercontinental long-haul flying to Hawaii Europe and South America all for the price of a coach ticket in my case.

Delta has been using their B767-400 to fly between Las Vegas and Atlanta (also between Atlanta and Salt Lake City or Orlando).

4 B767 per day between Las Vegas and Atlanta

I rarely fly on Delta as I am a mostly United flyer in the US due to their network and loyalty status. However this time I made the jump simply because Delta is currently the only carrier operating the B767-400; a rare stretched model of Boeing 767 at that. United is the only other carrier that has the B767-400 but these planes are currently grounded (although the United B767-400 may make a come back given that most of their B777's with Pratt and Whitney engines are currently grounded)

My Delta B767-400 flight was operated by ship 1810 registration N834MH a 21 year old B767. It is interesting to note that the B767-400 was brought in to replace the L1011 in Delta's fleet.

The cabin has been completely refurbished. I think Delta have done a great job in keeping up their cabins appearance despite flying older planes.

As per Delta's website the 767-400 has 4 classes and has a total of 238 seats as follows:

Delta One Cabin B767-400

Delta One Cabin B767-400

Delta One Cabin B767-400

Delta One Seat 1A on B767-400

Delta One Seat 1D on B767-400

Delta Premium Select on B767-400

Cockpit of B767-400

I spoke with the pilots before we departed. They showed me the differences in the cockpit compared to B757/B767. Although the B767-400 has the same type rating as the B767 the category is different. Pilots do not interchange their flights on other B757/B767 models. Watch the video review for the differences.

We took off from runway 26R of Las Vegas making a left 180 turn heading towards East shortly after. Flight time was 3 hours and 20 minutes.

My Delta One suite 8A was an inner window seat. However when seated it is very close to the TV monitor. The privacy however is excellent even if it doesn't come with a door like those available with Delta One on the A350.

On their narrow body's Delta is currently blocking all middle seats and the seat next to you in domestic First Class. I think this strategy has resulted in a fare premium and more loyalty.



The flight attendant passed out water and snack bags to all passengers. This is the Economy Class snack bag Delta Snack Bag for Economy and Comfort

Delta Snack Bag for Economy and Comfort For Business Class you get an additional snack box. It came with 3 choices (Tapas Hommus or Salami). Delta One Domestic Snack Box

Delta One Domestic Snack Box Perhaps the biggest drawback was the limited selection of beverages. There was only water beer or wine. No hot beverages sodas or juices were available. I feel like Delta need to bring back more selection as soon as the other US Major carriers do such as United offer a full beverage selection. United also brought back hot sandwiches on flights over two and half hours. I enjoyed free Wi-Fi onboard as a T-Mobile Customer.

The rest of the flight was spent listening to music relaxing and looking out the window view as we flew Eastward. I also tried out the flat bed which is as predicted a little narrow. The length is excellent for my height (6' 0"" or 185cm).

The footwell box restricts your leg movement. The landing was slightly early and performed with a very quiet and clear night at Atlanta Airport. During my transit in Atlanta I visited the Delta SkyClub. A limited selection of pre-packaged snacks and other nibbles were on offer. The bar was open however the whole scene was rather subdued.



My next Delta flight was on a B757-200 from Atlanta to Orlando. An incident happened on the jetbridge during the boarding. An elderly lady was feeling unwell on the jetbridge and the cabin crew at the door were first to assist her while they waited for the paramedics to arrive. The crew did a great job to recover the situation (which could have gone wrong very quickly without a fast reaction). It is not an everyday situation but I happened to catch the crew's reaction to the incident. Well done to the crew on handling such a situation calmly and professionally. Watch the video on how crew reacted to the incident. My flight to Orlando was eventless but it was good to see Delta keeping their older planes up-to-date. There were two things that I observed of Delta; when compared to other US airline carriers it seems that the Delta staff are more stable proud and passionate in their jobs also that Delta do fly older planes some more than 20 years old but they do look after them. On my B757 flight to Orlando the plane was nearly 30 years old but had received a new Boeing signature cabin interior along with renovated bathrooms and bulkheads.

(Bill Roth / ADN)

No matter how you look at it this summer will be different for travelers.

Even though the big cruise ships aren’t sailing up the Inside Passage lots of people want to come to Alaska. After all Alaska has two things going for it: more people are getting vaccinated than anywhere else in the U.S. and there are more wide open spaces.

The bump in vaccinations here in Alaska is a game-changer for travelers. Even though other COVID-19 mitigation practices prevail (mask-wearing hand-washing and social distancing) once you’ve been vaccinated you’re a little more confident about traveling. I know I am.

If you want to explore Alaska this year the attractions and activities that we’re used to may be available on a smaller scale — if they’re available at all. For example the Alaska Railroad is scaling back its passenger service to accommodate the lower projected passenger count absent the cruise travelers.

Instead of leaving the station in Anchorage every morning for Denali National Park and Fairbanks northbound trains will depart on Sundays Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays. The return trips will be on Sundays Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays.

The railroad’s season starts a little later this year: May 29. And it ends a little earlier Sept. 6. The train to and from Seward will run every day as will the “Glacier Discovery” train from Portage to Spencer Glacier.

More independent travelers are making plans to visit Alaska this year — and more airlines are adding flights to make up for the lack of cruise ships.

There’s always a seasonal bump for the summertime travel season. But this year is different.

[Pandemic-hit airlines are digging into the ‘fare war’ playbook with deals for Alaska travelers]

Delta Air Lines is adding new flights to new destinations and hub cities from both Anchorage and Fairbanks.

From Anchorage Delta is adding new nonstop flights to Detroit New York’s Kennedy Airport and Los Angeles. These new flights will operate only on Fridays and Saturdays starting May 28.

Also Delta is boosting flights from Anchorage to its hub cities: up to seven flights per day between Anchorage and Seattle three flights per day between Anchorage and Minneapolis and two flights per day between Anchorage and Salt Lake City. Plus Delta is resuming its Anchorage-Atlanta nonstop on May 5.

From Fairbanks Delta will operate three daily nonstops to Seattle two nonstops to Minneapolis and a new nonstop flight to Salt Lake City. Delta’s flights to Seattle already operate year-round but the airline has committed to year-round service for the new flights to/from Minneapolis and Salt Lake.

Delta is not the only airline adding nonstop flights from Alaska. It’s just the latest to make the announcements.

United Airlines announced its summer schedule a couple of months ago. The airline operates nonstop flights to Denver year-round. But starting on June 3 United will operate daily flights from Anchorage to San Francisco Houston Newark and Chicago. Plus United is adding a daily Anchorage-Fairbanks flight starting on June 3. The fare? Just $49 one-way.

American Airlines has high hopes for Alaska this summer. From Fairbanks American is operating a daily flight to Dallas and one to Chicago. From Anchorage there are nonstops to Chicago Dallas and Phoenix. American’s fares are worth writing home about. Right now American still has a great fare from Anchorage to New York for $99 one-way connecting in either Chicago or Dallas.

Don’t forget: American Airlines is Alaska’s new partner in the oneworld alliance. That means eventually your Alaska Airlines elite MVP status could get you extra perks on American and other oneworld partners like Qatar Air and Japan Airlines.

You can add all of these airline departures together. Even throw in Sun Country Air’s new weekly service between Fairbanks and Minneapolis (on Saturdays) plus its daily flights from Anchorage to Minneapolis. The total still would not add up to Alaska Airlines’ new summer schedule.

Alaska Airlines is bringing on some new nonstop destinations — and extending service for others.

At the peak of the summer season Alaska Airlines will offer 19 flights each day between Anchorage and Seattle. The schedule shows three flights each day between Anchorage and Portland and two flights daily between Anchorage and Los Angeles/LAX.

Starting on June 17 Alaska will resume nonstop service between Anchorage and Denver. The daily flights are scheduled through Aug. 16.

On May 20 Alaska will resume nonstop flights between Anchorage and Las Vegas. Alaska’s Flight 707 will depart Anchorage at 11:55 p.m. arriving at 6:10 a.m. the following day. The flight is scheduled to operate four days a week: Thursday-Sunday.

Now that Alaska has a hub in San Francisco Anchorage will get its own nonstop flight starting on June 17.

Starting on May 20 Alaska Airlines will launch two daily flights from Anchorage to Chicago. On Sept. 8 the schedule goes back to one nonstop flight each day.

Alaska’s schedule also shows three flights per week all spring between Anchorage and Honolulu (through May 18). After that Alaska will fly nonstop Anchorage-Honolulu every day. Between Anchorage and Maui Alaska will fly nonstop four days a week: Wednesdays Fridays Sundays and Mondays. The last Anchorage-Kona nonstop is on Mar. 16. Right now those flights are scheduled to resume on Sept. 9 with three flights per week.

[What Canada’s cruise ban and Alaska’s now-optional traveler screenings could mean for summer travel]

In addition to its fights to the Lower 48 and Hawaii Alaska Airlines flies to 19 destinations in Alaska from Anchorage.

Although international airlines like Condor and Eurowings are scheduled for Anchorage-Frankfurt flights the borders are still closed so the planes aren’t flying. That’s also the case with the weekly flights from Anchorage to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Russia. Air Canada canceled its nonstop from Vancouver B.C. last year.

There still are huge swaths of the world that still are inaccessible to Americans because of the COVID-19 virus. That includes Australia New Zealand Vietnam Indonesia and much of Europe. There are other countries where it’s possible to fly to but the virus is raging. Brazil falls into this category.

Often you'll need to connect when flying to Hawaii. But here are the airlines that operate nonstop flights from at least one mainland U.S. city to at least one Hawaiian airport:

TPG's Summer Hull has previously argued why you should fly Hawaiian Airlines to Hawaii. But I'll discuss the routes flown by each of these airlines in the following sections.

But you can connect onward to other Hawaiian islands using inter-island air transportation. Southwest even operates some inter-Hawaii flights. And you can rent a car to explore more remote parts of the four Hawaiian islands serviced by nonstop flights from the mainland. You may even be able to snag a reasonably priced rental car using AutoSlash or by redeeming your points and miles for a car rental.

Flying to Hawaii with points and miles

Flights to Hawaii can be expensive. Luckily you can get to Hawaii using points and miles. For example TPG's Summer Hull took her family on a three-week Hawaiian vacation using points and miles. And TPG contributor Ian Snyder leveraged a single card bonus for free flights to Hawaii for a whole family.

In short there are a lot of ways you can fly to Hawaii with points and miles. For example you could redeem points and miles to fly on Hawaiian Airlines. You could also redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards points to fly Southwest. But when flying with Alaska Delta United and American you may be better off booking with partners such as Turkish Miles & Smiles British Airways Avios Korean Air SkyPass or Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer.

You could even redeem miles to fly in a lie-flat seat to Hawaii. For example we've seen American Airlines Web Special awards that would allow you to fly to Hawaii in lie-flat first class for just 45000 miles. And you can book lie-flat first-class seats on new Hawaiian Airlines routes from 40000 miles.

Bottom line

Depending on what you plan to do on your Hawaiian vacation the best time to visit Hawaii will vary. As this guide shows there are many nonstop flights between the mainland U.S. and Hawaii. But if you don't live in a city with an airport that offers nonstop flights to Hawaii you may need to book a connecting flight. Some of the loyalty programs mentioned above only allow nonstop itineraries but it may be worth booking a separate positioning flight in order to redeem through select programs."

A recent CBRE report found that demand is strong and preleasing suggests 2021 a sustained surge CNBC reported.

Data centers — essentially large warehouses filled with computing and data storage systems — are measured in power instead of square footage.

“We know that there’s already 500 megawatts of new build coming online now almost 70 percent of which is pre-leased” said CBRE’s Spencer Levy. “And so we do believe that 2021 might be the record year and then we’ll accelerate thereafter.”

The pandemic’s economic volatility prompted companies to freeze their information technology budgets causing demand for data centers to dip 11 percent. Despite that 2020 was still the second-best year on record for leasing according to CBRE. Data center real estate investment trusts were also the best performing REIT sector in the last year.

Digital Realty Trust a $41 billion real estate company and one the country’s largest data-center developers is developing a 600000-square-foot compound. That announcement made in the fall came as it received a major commitment from Bloomberg LP the parent of Bloomberg News.

Levy said that demand for so-called “edge computing” purposes like self-driving cars and remote working outside major cities served by local data centers will accelerate demand moving forward.

Ulrich said Friday.

The Common Council is scheduled to vote Wednesday on paying Ulrich to cover the costs of the removal of buried contamination in a parking lot at Walnut and Locust streets.

The amount to be paid has not yet been determined Deputy Corporation Counsel Patricia M. McGrath said. She has been negotiating a cap on the city's costs with Ulrich's attorney Thomas H. Brandt.

""Their potential liability is well over $1 million"" said Ulrich who added that if the Council refuses to pay a lawsuit is likely.

That would cover the costs of the cleanup and reimbursement for any loss or reduction in the value of the Dollar General purchase contract with Niagara Management Group an Ulrich entity. Ulrich wouldn't say how much the retailer was to pay for the lot but the purchase contract is still in force he said.

McGrath said an underground storage tank is believed to be on the site and petroleum or petroleum byproducts are present.

The site was known as the city's Parking Lot No. 2 before Ulrich leased it in 2004. His company bought the property outright the next year.

However Ulrich contends the environmental indemnification clause in the lease remains in effect. In 2004 the city pledged to cover all costs connected with any environmental condition on the site that predated the lease.

""There are indemnity obligations contained in the original lease"" McGrath said. ""The indemnification clause survived the termination of the lease by the purchase of the property.""

John J. Ottaviano who was the city's attorney at the time said he didn't write the lease; attorney Daniel J. Spitzer did. Spitzer said he was not authorized by the city to discuss the matter.

""It was certainly a favorable agreement for Mr. Ulrich"" McGrath said.

The environmental clause was the same as one in the 2004 lease for the Ulrich City Centre site on the other side of Locust Street from the Dollar General site.

In 2012 the city reclaimed ownership of the City Centre parking lot after sediments containing chemicals from a long-ago dry cleaning shop were found under the pavement.

Ulrich said there hasn't been any digging on the Dollar General site but he said a gas station was located there generations ago and another one stood on the other side of Walnut Street.

""It's really very simple. I have a contract that guaranteed me a clean environmental site"" Ulrich said. ""The site turned out to be contaminated. My expectations are that they will live up to their contract and do what's in the best interests of the city which is to have some kind of compromise.""

Chief Drake defends his officer after fatal shootout,"NASHVILLE Tenn. (WTVF) — Saturday morning Metro Police Chief John Drake took questions from reporters following a fatal shootout involving one of his officers.

Nika Holbert died from her injuries Friday after Holbert and Officer Josh Baker exchanged gun fire in a Dollar General parking lot on Brick Church Pike.

""I’ve reviewed the body cam footage he appeared to do everything he could to try to de-escalate the situation including the use of taser including trying not to use his firearm"" said Chief Drake.

The morning of the shooting Officer Baker pulled over a black Chevy Camaro after running the plates through their system and seeing that the owner of the car Demond Buchanan had six outstanding drug warrants. Baker quickly realized the owner wasn't behind the wheel.

Instead it was Nika Holbert. Body camera footage released by MNPD showed Officer Baker found drugs in the car radioed for backup and attempted to take Holbert into custody. That's when everything escalated.

""Here do me a favor and turn around"" said Baker.

""No don’t put me in handcuffs I haven’t done anything wrong"" replied Holbert as she ran away from the officer.

The video shows Baker warned Holbert that she was about to be tazed. When she retreats back into the car he deploys the taser. Then you can see Holbert reach for something with her right hand. Baker believes it's a gun. ""Ma’am put the gun down put the gun down"" Baker screamed.

Holbert and the officer then exchange gunfire. Metro Police say Baker was shot once Holbert was shot twice. She then attempted to get away only to drive the Camaro into a ditch. Holbert later died from her injuries.

""There’s nothing else he could have done better other than maybe leave the scene and let her go away and obviously he couldn’t do that"" surmised Chief John Drake.

Drake says Baker couldn't let her go because he found her to be in possession of drugs and because she was driving without a Tennessee's drivers license.

Nika's Mother Responds

Nika Holbert's mother thinks it should never have gotten to this point. She called NewsChannel 5 wanting to share what she believes is her daughter's perspective on this story. She has asked us not to use her name in the interest of her own safety.

""There’s a thousand scenarios that could have happened to where both of them could have walked away. My daughter should be alive today"" said Holbert's mother.

Nika's mother tells NewsChannel 5 she does not know the owner of the car her daughter was driving. ""If I did I would have him arrested already - yesterday. I don’t know that guy"" she added.

She also said she wasn't surprised that Nika pulled out a handgun saying she was quite obviously scared. “He was trying to kill her with that taser and she was trying to protect herself"" she said.

Holbert's mother is now in the process of hiring an attorney and is considering her legal options.

Latest on Officer Baker's Condition

Chief John Drake visited a wounded Officer Josh Baker Saturday morning in his hospital room at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""He was in a little bit of pain still understandably. His stomach had been -- he had a procedure done so he was a little groggy still"" said Drake.

The 14 year veteran of the force could be released in the coming days.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations is still looking into the case but it will ultimately be up to District Attorney General Glenn Funk if any further legal action will be taken.

Drake spoke with members of the media near Vanderbilt University Medical Center Saturday where Officer Josh Baker is being treated for injuries sustained in a shooting Friday morning.

Investigators said Nika Holbert 31 shot Baker in the stomach during a traffic stop Friday morning and he returned fire. She later died from her injuries. Baker has remained in stable condition after surgery.

A 33-year-old woman is in critical condition after being shot twice by an MNPD officer Friday evening.

The woman was shot in the 2800 block of Greer Road around 5 p.m. Friday after charging at officers with a pick ax and baseball bat according to an MNPD news release.

""I tell my men and women to use caution make the best judgment de-escalate when they can"" he said. ""I'm telling them to be careful and just pay attention to signs if they can and if possible de-escalate.""

Drake said the Friday night shooting was ""unfortunate.""

""We're hoping to have a co-response model ... for crisis intervention where we can have mental health experts and police officers respond simultaneously"" he said. ""So until we get there this was our best response.""

Drake plans to make body camera footage from Friday night shooting public

Three officers were dispatched to a home on Greer Road and met the woman outside and tried to talk to her police said in a news release. MNPD Officer Ben Williams a four-year veteran fired his Taser at the woman which appeared to have no effect.

The woman then charged at the officers with the weapons the release said. Officer Brandon Lopez shot her in defense of himself and the other responding officers the release said.

Lopez joined MNPD in August 2019.

The woman was taken to Vanderbilt Medical Center and is in critical but stable condition Drake said Saturday.

Drake said he will make the body camera footage from Friday night's shooting public. Vowing transparency he plans to make it a policy to release body camera footage whenever it's available.

""I want to show that we are an accountable police department"" he said. ""We want to get the accurate information out there as quickly as possible.""

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating both shootings.

Williams Lopez and Thomas Denenea who also joined MNPD in August 2019 have been placed on administrative duties as the investigation is underway.

Officer Baker who is assigned to the East Precinct is in ""good spirits"" Drake told reporters Saturday morning after meeting Baker and his family.

Drake said he has reviewed the body camera footage and found that Baker followed de-escalation training and handled the situation the right way. The police chief said he does not think Baker's attempt to detain Holbert escalated the situation.

The footage shows Baker instructing Holbert to hand over her handbag and informing her of the active body camera. After discovering what appeared to be drugs Baker attempted to detain Holbert and called for backup. He fired his stun gun at her before the two exchanged gunfire.

""I think he did everything to de-escalate"" Drake said. ""Even when she was pulling away from the scene he was still on his knees. She could have directed the vehicle toward him if she wanted.""

“I returned from a trip to Israel on March 11” said Deming who at the time was a pastor of Chestnut Ridge Church. “We self-quarantined as I had shown some symptoms. I asked to be tested on the 13th but was told I probably had a sinus infection.”

Deming said he went to another hospital – Mon Health – and got tested on March 15 a Sunday. Four days later he was told the results were positive. He had COVID-19.

Fast forward a year later. Deming 48 and his wife and their two sons have recovered from the virus after quarantining for two months. Last fall Deming and his family relocated to Westminister Md. where he is campus pastor at Crossroads Church in Hampstead Md.

“I think COVID has changed all of us” Deming said in email. “It has challenged us to see life differently and for me to move back to focus on the kind of person I am becoming rather than just what I want to do in my life.

“Everyone is at a different place in how they feel about the world and COVID right now” he said.

Indeed.

COVID-19 in West Virginia

West Virginia has an aggressive vaccine program with the end goal of “vaccinating our way out of the pandemic” to quote Gov. Jim Justice and other state and local health officials.

The vaccination numbers have been impressive too. More than 250000 have registered with the state to be vaccinated and the number of active COVID-19 cases continues to fall. Justice has eased restrictions for bars and restaurants.

Also there have been more than 2 million COVID-19 tests conducted in the state which has a population of 1.7 million. There have been approximately 2300 deaths with an average age of 77.

West Virginia University recently confirmed three cases of the COVID-19 U.K. variant which originated in the United Kingdom. The variant is said to be more contagious than the original strain and is expected to be the dominant strain in the U.S. by spring.

Health officials have said both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer protection against the U.K. variant.

“While this is not unexpected it reinforces why it is so important to protect yourself and others by continuing to wear a mask when you are in public spaces and around others you do not live with wash your hands frequently and carefully self-monitor for symptoms” Dr. Jeff Coben vice president for health affairs and dean of the WVU School of Public Health said in a statement released by the university.

Experiencing COVID-19 firsthand

On the morning of Dec. 2 Nikki Godfrey 39 a Clarksburg social worker was getting ready for a 9 a.m. meeting.

“I was feeling nauseous dizzy foggy brain and had a terrible headache” she said. “This went on for three days and the nausea was the worst. They were all mild symptoms but all at once.”

On the fourth day Godfrey said she felt better but had no energy and lost her sense of taste. Two days later she said she lost her sense of smell and by the eighth day it was like she had a sinus cold.

“But I felt OK otherwise. My wife had similar symptoms; however they didn’t last as long except for the fatigue” she said.

Andrew Spellman 26 a sports writer for The Dominion Post got tested in September at a pop-up clinic in Morgantown near the Mileground.

“They were offering $50 per test in the hopes to create a vaccine. I can’t remember which company was hosting it” Spellman said in an email. “I had intense flu-like symptoms day one and two then mild symptoms after. I lost my taste and smell.”

Spellman said it took him 14 days to be cleared by the Monongalia County Health Department.

“But I had long-term symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue.”

Johnathan Hughes 47 of Morgantown said he lost his ability to taste and smell three days after being diagnosed.

“It took me seven days to recover and my smell is still not 100%” said Hughes who works as a sales service representative for Cintas.

Donna Tennant is the admissions and marketing director at Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown which was the first health care facility to have an outbreak of the virus last year. Five Sundale residents some with underlying health conditions died from COVID-19.

Tennant 61 said she never really had any symptoms but was tested frequently as were all Sundale residents and employees.

“I was tired and then after finding out what the symptoms were I did have an odd sense of smell” she said.

Nicky Boyers a councilman for the Town of Granville who also works as a security guard was told he had the virus on Dec. 13. More than a month later – Jan. 21 – he was still recovering.

“Just finishing second round of antibiotics for a lung infection” said Boyers 54 who had the classic COVID-19 indicators – headaches body aches fever loss of smell and taste.

On New Year’s Day Linda Huggins the Preston County Clerk was running a high fever and was fatigued. She went to the drive-thru testing site at Mon Health Preston Memorial Hospital.

Sure enough she had the novel coronavirus.

“After four to five days my symptoms subsided” said Huggins 61. “My energy level gradually returned.”

Frank Fidler 65 said he got exposed by his son at Christmas. At the time Fidler who is retired said he began feeling sick Jan. 3.

“My wife youngest son youngest daughter and husband were tested on the 5th” Fidler said in an email. Fidler who has seven children – six of whom are married – and 16 grandchildren said 10 members of his family tested positive for the virus.

“Of the five of us living here at our home only two tested positive myself and my youngest son 25” said Fidler who lives in Morgantown.

“It took me about 10 days to begin being able to taste and smell again” said Fidler adding he is back to about 70% when interviewed in late January.

“The extreme fatigue lasted for 14 days and is even now what I consider still moderate. I have very little stamina and lost a lot of muscle tone.”

How did COVID-19 change you?

Without a doubt COVID-19 has impacted the lives of everyone affected. In some cases people are now taking the virus seriously. They wear masks socially distance and avoid crowds with the possible exception of the grocery store.

“You know COVID has limited me socially” Tennant said. “It has scared my husband to the point he does not want to go anywhere and does not want me to travel either. I enjoy getting away each year to the beach or just a resort to relax and he panics every time I mention it. We no longer go shopping and our family reunions have been cancelled two years in a row.”

Huggins said having recovered from COVID-19 has made her more aware of her surroundings and everything she touches.

“My heart aches for so many who are not able to sit next to their loved ones who are not well or elderly” she said. “These are very sad times.”

Godfrey said she is concerned about possibly getting the virus for a second time.

“We continue to wear our masks and social distance when out in public” Godrey said. “It is harder to remember masks now that we know we’ve had the virus.”

Boyers agreed.

“Wear your mask for your protection as well as others. This isn’t fun.”

What advice would you give?

Tennant said even with the availability of a vaccine it’s important for people to be smart.

“I don’t feel people take it serious because there are so many who have had the virus who are asymptomatic” she said. “However until you lose someone that is close to you from the virus you don’t understand the seriousness. I wish all those who don’t believe could spend a day at one of the locations where the funeral homes are putting bodies in cold storage because they cannot bury them or lose a loved one.

“I just lost my stepmother and we could only visit one or two at a time and that made it hard because several of us wanted to be with her. Then the funeral was very limited because of social distancing and even at that my stepsister and her husband both came down with the virus.”

“The only thing we could think of was (the cause) was from one of the gatherings.”

Added Deming: “Everyone is at a different place in how they feel about the world and COVID right now. We can be loving towards people who think differently than us and in this world we need this more than ever right now.”

The weekend of March 6 she bid farewell to Domino well-loved by countless Staten Islanders as he crossed over Rainbow Bridge.

Raised by David Benjamin and Regina Benjamin Domino and Matera matched through the Canine Companions for Independence (CCI) whose program trainers and staff stayed with Matera in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy to ensure a smooth transition.

“I knew short after I brought Domino home that he was a gift I needed to share” said Matera. “We attended many CCI events and fundraisers. He held the donation bucket like no other especially at the NYC Auto Show. He always had a way of drawing people in wanting to know more.”

With Domino by her side Matera started a reading program on Staten Island often giving demonstrations about service dogs to the young students.

“There wasn’t a neighborhood we walked in where you wouldn’t hear a kid yelling Domino” said Matera. “He would light up any room we entered especially when I went to physical therapy.”

LUV ON A LEASH PROGRAM AT PRIDE CENTER OF STATEN ISLAND

Domino was a volunteer for the Luv on a Leash Therapy Dogs a project of the Pride Center of Staten Island which places trained registered therapy dog teams in meaningful programs throughout the Staten Island community.

All the therapy dogs including Domino provide comfort and caring in a wide variety of settings including hospitals extended care and residential facilities schools and agencies where therapy dogs can be of benefit.

Luv on a Leash Therapy Dogs is funded through the generosity of The Bruce Geary Foundation and is a proponent of the power of the human/animal bond to significantly enhance people’s lives. The human-animal connection shows the benefits are not just emotional but can also boost infant immunity to infections help with mental health disorders by affecting brain chemistry and lower blood pressure.

Specifically Domino gave comfort and assistance for five years to patients at Staten Island University Hospital bringing smiles to rehab and cancer patients. “The kids would say his leash had super powers” said Matera. “Once the word got out there wasn’t a department we didn’t visit. Most people didn’t know my name but they sure knew Domino’s.”

Domino was also an avid volunteer at the Staten Island Family Justice Center and Richmond County DA’s Office. “Domino gave victims the courage to tell their story and comforted them during the process and he was a favorite at the courthouse” said Matera.

“Our great work as Team Domino caught the attention of many news outlets. We were honored to except many awards especially the community service award” she added.

RACHAEL RAY AND DR. OZ APPEARENCES

In between the back-to-back community service events Domino enjoyed CCI doggy play dates. “Always being the oldest Domino gave the other pups a run for their money” said Matera.

Domino quickly attracted the attention of talk shows too. “We went to many talk shows” added Matera. “Rachael Ray was his favorite. She called herself Auntie Rachel every time she came off stage to give Domino a special treat.”

He got to wear his ‘how you doin” bandana for Wendy Williams and made sure Dr. Oz took notice. “We attended outdoor concerts and countless Atlantic City trips where sometimes a rub on his head would win him some extra treats.”

“Domino and I had an amazing journey” said Matera. “Who would’ve thought it would’ve started during a natural disaster ended during a pandemic. He filled his purpose and we filled ours above and beyond. Domino always looked so good with the shiniest coat no one ever knew his real age.

“I’m so glad he was able to spend his 10th birthday at his favorite place Domino Park. I pray that God helps me get through this along with my CCI family. I take comfort Domino was greeted by many when he crossed especially his brother Dodger who passed a few days ago. He touched so many lives he will always be my “Dominoeffect.”

Ammon News - A post on Reddit shows the note left behind by a Sainsbury's shopper who was stunned by the price of a can of paprika Pringles - and people hailed it the ""proper British response"".



A shopper who took a stand to protest the price of a can of Pringles in Sainsbury's has been hailed for doing the most British thing ever.



Rather than flagging down a member of staff or writing a strongly-worded letter to the supermarket they instead decided to handle it with a good old-fashioned passive aggressive note.



The cans of paprika crisps which are shaped perfectly to create a convincing duck mouth came with a price tag of £3 leaving one shopper fuming in the knowledge you can often pick them up for half the price.



Using a blank tag just under the display of Pringles they wrote: ""3 quid - you're having a bleedin' laugh ain't yer!"" and simply carrying on with their day.



It was spotted by a fellow customer and a picture was shared to Reddit with the caption: ""The proper British response to Pringles being raised to £3 in Sainsbury's.""



People left comments with their own theories as one said: ""Pringles must be one of those things that no one ever buys on full price just like those fancy Naked or Innocent juice drinks outside of meal deals.""



A second wrote: ""Most expensive I’ve ever seen them was in a Spar and it was £3.60 I nearly died there and then.""



A third replied: ""It's just a rotation of offers in supermarkets they [are] probably £1.50 in Morrisons or Asda now.""



And someone else may have rumbled the crisp manufacturer's entire business model saying: ""I have a theory that Pringles only get charged £2.50/£3 every so often just so their actual price of £1.50 can be called a deal. PROVE ME WRONG CRISPY MOUSTACHE BOY.""



To which others responded: ""A.k.a the Domino’s Pizza strategy"" and ""I don't think I've ever bought a 'full price' Dominos they're never not on offer in some fashion.""



A spokesperson for Kellogg’s the owner of Pringles said: ""The recommended retail price of a 200g can of Pringles has gone up to £2.99. This reflects the fact it now costs us more to make the food than it did before.



""You’ll still be able to find some great offers on Pringles throughout the year and the price does vary store-by-store as it’s the grocer’s absolute discretion and decision what price to charge you.""

The evidence that most active portfolio managers typically underperform passive benchmarks appropriate to their investment style is extensive—both historically and geographically. Exhibit 2 for example summarizes data from our firm’s SPIVA® Scorecards which have documented the performance of U.S. managers since 2001 (with shorter histories for other markets). Of the 19 full calendar years for which we have U.S. SPIVA results the majority of large-cap active managers outperformed the S&P 500® in only three.

This paper asks a simple question: what (if anything) distinguishes the three years when most active managers outperformed from the 16 years when the majority failed?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9zcGFjZXgtc3Rhcmxpbmstc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1sYXVuY2gvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3BhY2V4LXN0YXJsaW5rLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtbGF1bmNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rocket carrying Starlink satellites. Their goal is to blanket the planet in high-speed broadband,"CNN —

The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched Sunday morning sending 60 Starlink satellites into orbit.

Falcon 9 took off from the 39 launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at around 6 a.m. SpaceX said on Twitter.

The first stage booster supporting the mission completed eight flights prior to this launch.

“Falcon 9’s first stage has landed on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship completing the ninth flight of that booster” SpaceX tweeted.

The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket which stands 70 meters or 229 feet tall according to information provided during the broadcast of the launch. It is described by SpaceX as the “first orbital class rocket capable of reflight.”

The 60 Starlink satellites were deployed about an hour after the rocket was launched.

Starlink is a satellite-based internet constellation intended to blanket the planet in high-speed broadband and often touted as a way to potentially bring connectivity to the billions of people who still lack reliable internet access.

The idea requires swarms of satellites operating in low-Earth orbit – roughly 340 miles high in SpaceX’s case – to provide continuous coverage.

About 1000 Starlink satellites have been deployed and SpaceX plans to grow Starlink to include more than 40000 satellites. That’s five times the total number of satellites humans have launched since the dawn of spaceflight.

SpaceX now owns about one-third of all the active satellites in space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1pbnNpZ2h0cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9zcGl2YS11LXMteWVhci1lbmQtMjAyMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SPIVA® U.S. Year-End 2020,"SUMMARY

The year 2020 was tumultuous for financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic threw the world into chaos early in the year with the S&P 500® falling 33.8% between Feb. 19 2020 and March 23 2020. Governments and central banks pulled out their playbooks from the global financial crisis of a decade earlier and acted swiftly to increase spending and ease monetary policy. Financial markets rapidly recovered with the S&P 500 regaining its all-time high by August and ending the year up 18.4% after shrugging off U.S. election histrionics.

The torrent of liquidity depressed interest rates and pushed up asset prices nearly everywhere investors looked. Of the 31 distinct benchmarks tracked by this report 30 finished with a positive return for 2020; the S&P United States REIT (-7.5%) was the only exception.

The positive market performance broadly translated into good absolute returns for active fund managers. While the turmoil and disruption caused by the pandemic should have offered numerous opportunities for outperformance 57% of domestic equity funds lagged the S&P Composite 1500® during the one-year period ending Dec. 31 2020.

Large-cap funds picked up where they left off the previous decade—for the 11th consecutive one-year period the majority (60%) underperformed the S&P 500. Mid-cap (51%) and small-cap (46%) funds did somewhat better relative to the S&P MidCap 400® and S&P SmallCap 600® respectively.

The ongoing growth versus value battle firmly tilted toward growth in 2020. The pandemic boosted the fortunes of those positioned to take advantage of changing lifestyles with the S&P 500 Growth returning 33.5% while the S&P 500 Value managed a meager 1.4%. A healthy 62% of large-cap growth funds 83% of mid-cap growth funds and 86% of small-cap growth funds topped the S&P 500 Growth S&P MidCap 400 Growth and S&P SmallCap 600 Growth respectively. However this did little to improve their longer-term relative performance as on a 20-year horizon a paltry 4% 10% and 6% of large- mid- and small-cap growth funds beat their benchmarks respectively.

Active value funds posted more mixed results. While 67% of large-cap value funds beat the S&P 500 Value just 47% of mid-cap value funds and 56% of small-cap value funds were able to do so. Nevertheless 20-year results showed a similar decline to growth funds as just 23% 15% and 24% of large- mid- and small-cap value funds outperformed their benchmarks respectively.

For U.S. funds looking outside of the country relative results in 2020 were a toss-up. Roughly 50% of global international international small-cap and emerging markets funds beat the S&P Global 1200 S&P International 700 S&P Developed Ex-U.S. SmallCap and S&P/IFCI Composite respectively. This clustering artifact remained but the poor results widened when viewed over three years (about 60% underperforming) five years (about 70%) or 20 years (about 90%).

Gorging on central bank largesse the long-tenor bonds of the Bloomberg Barclays US Government Long returned a spectacular 17.6% for the year. The government long funds charged with targeting this index failed in spectacular fashion as fewer than 6% were able to clear this hurdle. In 3 of the 14 fixed income categories tracked (government long funds investment-grade long funds and loan participation funds) more than 90% of funds failed to clear their benchmarks in 2020. Better results were generally found in the intermediate and shorter-dated tenors for 2020.

Echoing the results from equities longer observation horizons offered little sanctuary. More than 60% of funds underperformed their benchmarks across all fixed income categories over the 15-year horizon; in 10 of the 14 categories tracked more than 80% of funds came up short.

The SPIVA Scorecard's accounting for survivorship bias continues to be a valuable cautionary tale. As has generally been the case in recent years roughly 5%-10% of funds across asset classes and categories were merged or liquidated in 2020. Over 20 years nearly 70% of domestic equity funds and two-thirds of internationally focused equity funds across segments were confined to the history books.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9pbnZlc3RpbmcvYml0Y29pbi1wcmljZXMtNjAwMDAvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2JpdGNvaW4tcHJpY2VzLTYwMDAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin tops the $60000 mark,"New York CNN Business —

Bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket. The cryptocurrency surpassed $60000 on Saturday to hit a new high just a few weeks after it topped $50000.

Bitcoin (XBT) smashed through the $30000 and $40000 levels over a few days in January. Bitcoin (XBT)s in circulation are worth more than $1 trillion.

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled so far this year up 107% from the December 31 closing price of $28987.60. Investors are excited that Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) said in February it owns $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla (TSLA) also has said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.

That sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash. Software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been actively buying bitcoin.

Top financial firms are helping to validate bitcoin. Payments giants Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are also embracing cryptocurrencies.

BlackRock (BLK) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK) have started to dabble in bitcoin as well.

Investors have been flocking to bitcoin because of the perception that it could be a good hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar if bond yields continue to rise.

Bitcoin bulls argue that the cryptocurrency is like “digital gold” and could even replace the yellow metal as the inflation antidote of choice. To that end bitcoin has surged this year while gold has fallen.

Inflation fears have returned now that President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. There are concerns about whether that much money is really needed.

Some worry that stimulus may cause the economy to overheat and lead to much higher inflation. After all there are now multiple Covid-19 vaccines and more people are returning to work which should boost the economy – and bitcoin prices.

Bitcoin has benefited from investors’ recognition that the cryptocurrency is scarcer than gold or other precious metals.

That’s because there is a cap of just 21 million bitcoins built into the cryptocurrency’s source code available to be mined – the process of using computers or servers to solve complex math problems to generate bitcoin. Roughly 18.6 million bitcoins are in circulation.

Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency getting a boost. Smaller digital currencies such as ethereum litecoin and stellar have soared in 2021.

The optimism about cryptocurrencies has boosted shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot Blockchain (RIOT) Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Hive (HVBTF).

And cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase which has filed to list its shares directly later this year is one of 2021’s most eagerly awaited stock market debuts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTE1L3NoYXJlLW1hcmtldC13YWxsLXN0LWRvdy1qb25lcy1hc3gtYXVkLXdyYXAvMTMyNDgzNzTSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMyNDgzNzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASX ends higher as China data boosts sentiment Tilt Renewables get $3 billion takeover bid,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-15/share-market-wall-st-dow-jones-asx-aud-wrap/13248374 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTE1L3NoYXJlLW1hcmtldC13YWxsLXN0LWRvdy1qb25lcy1hc3gtYXVkLXdyYXAvMTMyNDgzNzTSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMyNDgzNzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Why She’s Running and What She Brings:

The school board needs to call attention to accountability implementation and assessment. There is a reason why the school board members are elected and not handpicked by administration: to represent their community ask questions on behalf of their teachers parents and students and continue to have the difficult conversations that will challenge each other because that is when change will start to happen.

From the administrative side I have experience with leadership transitions budget maintenance and policy implementation. As the current Evanston/Skokie PTA Council President I supported initiatives including bulk school supplies LGBTQIA+ and BLM curriculum Green Team and enrichment opportunities for all D65 students.

Top Three Priorities and Reasons for Them

The District 65 School Board represents to me a collaboration of different voices and strengths to guide the district and our superintendent while also representing. To me the top three priorities as a District 65 School Board member will be representative of the community and support for the district administration and Dr. Horton during this pivotal time for our district:

Transparency and communication around finances curriculum changes and development and process. As many residents are not able to go through a full report they still want to know why the district budget is in a deficit. Same is reflected in changes to the curriculum where teachers appear to have little input or training. Levels of communication have not been consistent from school to school which has led to differing levels of understanding. Policies through Equity assessment –Not only do we need to develop policies to promote equity in all aspects of our schools but we need to see them through. The board needs to prioritize supporting initiatives that were developed and created several years ago. There has been little to no discussion lately about our students in special education or our TWI population. Creating and implementing equitable policies is just part of the success. What skills and tools are being provided to be successful? What steps and metrics are checked regularly to decide if there needs to be changes and adjustments? Collaboration with the community. For example – Return to School Fall 2012 – As District 65 has begun a hybrid return to school the board’s top priority should be on preparing for Return to School Fall 2021 just as the previous summer had a task force made up of key representatives this summer should have similar goals in creating scenarios and plans to be implemented. Ensuring a safe return would also include health and medical professionals teacher and staff protection and support. Another example for community collaboration would be the recent announcement around exploring school redistricting and a 5th ward school. In these cases the research and discovery phase needs to have the right balance between industry professionals but also local residents that have may past or present experience with the district.

Two Recent Board Positives

In the past two years the current board has begun some important initiatives to benefit all children of District 65 including the school discipline policy that was amended with positive behavior expectations and restorative practices to be in alignment with the district’s equity policy to support all students. In 2019 the school discipline policy developed the creation of a Restorative Practices Model focused on equity social-emotional support positivity and restorative practices for administration. This minimized the disproportionate rate of office referrals for district students which is critical to reducing out of school instruction time for students.

Additionally the district with teachers developed curriculum around Black Lives Matter LBTQIA+ and Latinx equity weeks. As part of the PTA Council we collaborated with the district in bringing them into our regular meetings where representatives from each of the D65 PTA leadership were present to share curriculum training and information. The process wasn’t a perfect implementation but the school board has been reflective and encouraging with further developing and enhancing equity week curriculum for following years.

As the PTA Council Treasurer in 2018-2019 I surveyed our schools and then presented the disparity of differences between schools whether they participated in bulk school supplies (each student pays a set amount) or not. Even though the majority of schools participated in the bulk school supply process it was time consuming for parent volunteers pricing varied and even the process of supplies purchasing varied. After sharing this with the school board we requested for the district to absorb this process for various reasons including being able to have that consistency and equity. In January 2020 school board representatives shared during a PTA Council meeting that the district would be absorbing this process and the fees would be reassessed. This would be an example of an important initiative that affects all District 65 students as a collaborative effort with both the PTAs and the School Board.

Addressing 5Essentials Survey Results

Depending on whether the remedy is related to the dialogue or correcting the issue at hand. Given the investment of time and resources the 5Essentials survey is the best indicator for climate and culture in our schools it important to bring forth vehicles for our teachers and leaders to discuss these concerns with the board especially around specific programming curriculum and school dynamics. Parents and students were encouraged to fill out the surveys and meet the minimum of 20% participation as it “provides our school leaders with valuable insights that are used to develop effective school improvement plans”.

The School Board has stated their investment in previous programming with monies and staff/teacher time and will need to follow through on previous commitments. One example is that climate teams were organized in 2017 and as we are coming up on the 5 year mark there has not been much progress or updates shared. To continue to build on the need for transparency the school board should be having that open dialogue with teacher collaboration to understand where the breakdown is happening and begin taking steps to gain ground that has been lost. The lack of communication leads to a general lack of trust desire for more transparency and a better form of voicing concerns and addressing issues.

Addressing the Joint Literacy Goal

As the numbers indicate District 65 students are coming into District 202 less and less prepared not only in literacy but also in math. The joint literacy goal is comprised of a variety of different plans and actions but spread thinly and not enough in one particular focus to make a significant impact. With the PreK – 3rd grade literacy curriculum doesn’t align with the science of reading where literacy carries over into all of the other interdisciplinary parts of education. Shouldn’t literacy be reinforced and specific skills enhanced thorugh science social studies and other general education curriculum? Even as equity week curriculum is introduced having the same thread of literacy carry throughout continues to develop the child’s literacy comfort and confidence.

There are different phases throughout a student’s time within District 65 where there is opportunity. Early childhood components focus on school preparedness which leads to the key transition phases of elementary school and then middle school where interventions should double down. In previous years there was some work that was done around the 8th grade level which reduced the number of student below the reading proficiency levels but doesn’t appear to have continued. It is concerning to hear that in recent budget cuts reading specialists were cut. One of the clear and single largest issue is with literacy and yet we are shifting resources away from that? The process has been called reorganization but how is the new reorganization going to be better in outcomes for kids and are we even giving a program enough time to be effective?

Additional supports should also be given to the TWI population and ESL students (not native speakers) continuously throughout the years within District 65. Focus has traditionally been on early childhood but not all students will come into the system throughout the years and not just during the early years. District administration are the curriculum experts and should be giving both the teachers and students the right tools to succeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hY2FkaWFuYS9uYW1lL3N1c2FuLWplbmtpbnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjkzNjYyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Susan Jenkins Obituary (1958 - 2021) - Lafayette LA - The Acadiana Advocate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/acadiana/name/susan-jenkins-obituary?id=6936622 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hY2FkaWFuYS9uYW1lL3N1c2FuLWplbmtpbnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjkzNjYyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZXZhbnN0b25yb3VuZHRhYmxlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2pvZXktaGFpbHBlcm4tY2FuZGlkYXRlLWZvci1kaXN0cmljdC02NS1zY2hvb2wtYm9hcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joey Hailpern Candidate for District 65 School Board,"The thumbnail sketch and reasons for running were compiled by Mary Helt Gavin from information provided by the candidate.

Top Three Priorities and Reasons for Them

Looking to the next four years my top three priorities are kids kids kids (in no particular order)

We need to spend time addressing the fiscal sustainability of the district so that students can have the services support and opportunities that provide a well rounded school experience. We will do this initially by making reductions in any area that does not impact the overall experience for students. As the next two years roll out we need to assess our enrollment boundary structures and make sure that our schooling models match the needs of the district. This has implications that include the possibility of closing a school or two all of which need to be considered for fiscal sustainability.

My second priority is focusing on student opportunity and outcomes in a post-pandemic environment. We need schools to be open fully and I support a full reopening of schools in conjunction with proper mitigation efforts including teacher vaccines. As a board we can take the years ahead to engage with our new superintendent in working with teachers to develop alter or get rid of structures that are in the way of opportunity and outcomes for students. We know what was not working before and for whom the systems were not benefiting. This is our opportunity to reset the system and offer and opportunity for all students particularly those who have historically been marginalized by the system.

Lastly but certainly not least is our equity work. As a board we have adopted policy. We have requested formal reporting on district wide efforts through the annual accountability reports and discipline reports. We have added support and training for all staff with SEED Beyond Diversity and coaching. What I want to see next is the implementation within classrooms in an effort to provide equitable learning opportunities to students in a manner different than we have seen before. We will see this through the implementation of more versatile core offerings like in middle school math. We will see this in higher percentages of early learners hitting their critical learning benchmarks for literacy. Everything we currently use to monitor progress will move along with great execution of our policies within classrooms.

Two Recent Board Positives

Two things the current board has done to benefit all children include leadership and sustainability.

This board has employed a superintendent that has a powerful voice in education on a national level. He is a regular participant in national forums on equity best instructional practice and more. His vision for our schools is well thought out is inspiring and it is attainable. Dr. Hotron’s MIRACLES framework does not just benefit all of District 65’s current children but also their future children. He is showing this board what systems of accountability can look like from the head of our organization and that is something we have desperately needed. The board can stay in their governing lane with Dr. Horton at the helm and that will benefit consistency and alignment throughout the district. All of this will have an impact on culture and climate in the district and as a result benefit children.

The second thing this board has done is engage in an effort to correct the fiscal issues that have plagued the district for decades. Knowing that we have only so many years left of the referendum that provided time to make changes this board has laid out a three year plan of action that will have a significant impact on the sustainability of the district. Failure to execute this plan could result in massive loss of programming high class sizes and an environment that is hard for both students and staff. Our goal with the multi-faceted approach is to consider changes that will reduce expenditures but strengthen programming.

Ideas like consolidating the TWI program and extending it through middle school has an impact on where people go to school. It also provides more streamlined service that has continuity to the high school and college and careers. As we continue to move through this next phase of action we will look back and know that starting it when we did was a critical step for all children and the experience we want them to have in District 65.

Addressing 5Essentials Survey Results

Climate and culture in a district are critical indicators that lead to student success. In D65 there is a longstanding battle for trust between district leadership and the teacher ranks. I remember hearing about this dynamic at my dinner table from my mother who worked in the front office at Washington School for 30 years. I lived this dynamic during my first year teaching at Kingsley School as an employee. As a result this rating is no longer a surprise and discussing with interim superintendents last spring would not have been as fruitful a conversation as hiring a superintendent to help solve the problem. This is what needed to be done and what was done to take the step forward. In Dr. Horton one of our biggest goals was to build bridges between stakeholder groups including leaders and their educators.

Addressing the Joint Literacy Goal

There are two main things that need to be done to address the reading proficiency gap in District 65: review and action.

We have to give solid time and attention in the curriculum review process to the Student Academic Partners study on the last 40 years of reading research and their breakdown of the Lucy Calkins reading and writing program. The breadth of the research and their analysis of Calkins scream loudly to the missing foundational skill components of District 65’s core literacy program. We have to honor what the research says and be adaptive to the needs of students and the reality that our current program has not allowed our teachers to be successful with our students.

The second thing that needs to be done is take action to make our system work for students. This is already underway in the reorganization of the reading support services proposed within the context of our budget reduction and efficiency process. Applying the latest research to our programming we now know that foundational skills can successfully be intervened far earlier and faster than ever before. This means that one of our current support services that requires 1:1 instruction for a period of 30-45 minutes can be actualized with a more targeted approach over a shorter period of time.

Answers to the questions are in the candidate’s own words.

Thumbnail Sketch: Education: B.A. DePauw University; M.A. DePaul University Human Services/Counseling. Current employment: For 15 years I taught classes on Civic Engagement Diversity Gender and Agents of Change at DePaul. I was the Director of Programs at Northwestern University’s Women’s Center for 8 years. Evanston ties: resident for 18 years; child at Chute and twins at Dawes. Volunteer/Civic activities: co-founder of the PTA Equity Project (PEP) a former Board member of Cherry Preschool a commissioner and coach for EBSA softball a basketball coach and a Girl Scout Leader.

Why She’s Running and What She Brings:

I am passionate about education which is the focus of my professional life. I am an equity diversity and inclusion consultant working with schools and school districts. These experiences informed my perspective built my capacity to center equity in decision-making and strengthened my skill in developing systems and practices that benefit all our children. For these reasons I believe I am an asset to the District 65 Board.

Top Three Priorities and Reasons for Them

First I want to be part of transforming District 65 schools into places where all of our students are valued welcomed included respected and equally successful. I will dedicate my time and talents to work towards the elimination of the gap in opportunity to achieve and to create school communities where every student feels they belong. I want to ensure that all District 65 students do not face racial predictability in their present or their future.

Second I believe every student deserves to have access to resources in their home school and will use an equity lens to address our challenges around student assignment and fiscal management. We have difficult decisions ahead and I am committed to making sure our conversations focus on working smarter so that our financial challenges do not impact the quality of education provided and equity remains at the center of decision-making. In looking ahead my focus will include bussing a 5th Ward school emergent bilingual services and special education.

Third I remain committed to supporting the safe reopening and return to school for District 65 students teachers and administrators. By closely following the direction of the CDC ISBE IDPH and medical advisors I will continue to work closely with District 65 leadership to reopen schools as safely as possible for all of our students teachers administrators and staff. The pandemic has exacerbated the challenges for our most vulnerable students and their families. I have consistently advocated for the inclusion of students with IEPs and 504s in our reopening prioritization plans because I know how remote learning is falling short of meeting many students’ needs. However our failures to serve our special education population cannot be blamed on the pandemic alone. There is critical work that needs to be done to ensure our special education students have an equitable experience in our district and I commit to giving voice to that need and working towards solutions with educators and families.

Two Recent Board Positives

First I am proud of the work that the current board did to bring on the current superintendent Dr. Devon Horton. Using an equity lens the board worked to substantially increase stakeholder input to develop a leadership profile that reflected the needs of our district. Dr. Horton was selected as a visionary leader with the demonstrated skills and experience that our district needs.

Second I have been working collaboratively to advocate over many years for District 65 to approve gender support policy and procedures. We must be committed to addressing the needs and concerns of transgender and gender expansive employees to ensure safe affirming and healthy workplaces and school environments. By approving a new gender support policy we are creating an environment that respects and values all staff and fosters understanding of gender identity and expression within the school community to ensure that all employees have a safe and welcoming work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment where they can bring their whole selves to work reach their fullest potential and provide healthy models for students.

Addressing 5Essentials Survey Results

Last school year District 65 Board had to face a full year of interim leadership a national superintendent search and hiring process and an emergency stay at home order caused by COVID19. Critical to addressing all of the concerns highlighted in the 5Essentials about effective leadership is having a superintendent that is a visionary and capable of implementing that vision. Our district has lacked the systems necessary to progress on a variety of metrics and the accountability systems that would allow the district to reach its fullest potential. Effective systems protocols and structures create the scaffolding for everyone to do their best work and collaborate most effectively. Hiring the right leadership and supporting system change is a critical role the board can play in transforming school culture. While new district leadership continues to meet the pressing challenges of COVID-19 the school board and district leadership are focused on building capacity and establishing systems to support effective leadership and collaborative teachers over the long-term. This investment in structures should be reflected in

Addressing the Joint Literacy Goal

The scope of the literacy problem has been well documented and discussed. Now District 65 has been focusing on moving from conversation to implementation. The research is clear that early childhood education has a significant impact on a student’s trajectory. Our district has invested in a multitude of interventions in our early childhood programs that are yielding significant improvements in the racial disparity in Kindergarten readiness as measured by the KIDS Assessment. We will continue to prioritize this work and apply this learning to our K-3 work that we know is critical to addressing the literacy goal for our Black and Latinx students.

Additionally we are in the process of revamping our literacy supports so that we can shift from a siloed approach to literacy intervention to a collectivist approach that allows our educators to collaborate more effectively to meet the needs of a broader base of students through Tier 1 instruction within the classroom and allowing schools to customize and improve supports for those that struggle and need additional support in Tier 2 and Tier 3.

While we continue to commit to addressing these needs in pre-K and K-3 I also believe we need to revisit our interventions and support systems for middle school students. Too many struggling students are entering high school unprepared. We need more robust support for literacy in our middle schools. Many District 65 students are not getting the educational support they need to meet standards. All of our support systems to address these needs must be data driven and results oriented. In addition to academic interventions and rigorous instructional practices including culturally responsive pedagogy the value of reducing threats to students’ emotional safety through reducing racial disparity in discipline and focusing on school culture and climate through investment in EDI training to foster a sense of belonging for all students teachers and families can not be underestimated in its impact on student outcomes.

We will also need to continue to partner with ETHS to share data and best practices to collectively problem-solve for more effective interventions and support.",,,

But experts suggest putting off certain outdoor chores such as burning or bagging up leaves and sticks in order to protect our native pollinators.

The yard waste we often dispose of in early spring actually provides winter shelter for butterflies moths bees and other pollinating insects. Those insects are still hibernating inside debris like leaves stems and twigs this time of year says Kristen LeForce resident biologist and pollinator expert at DTE Energy.

In fact some insect’s winter disguises may even resemble yard waste — such as the beautiful black swallowtail butterfly who overwinters as a pupa that looks like a dried-up leaf.

These pollinators’ numbers have been in steady decline in Michigan and across the country due to habitat loss pesticide use and even simple actions like homeowners unknowingly disposing of these beneficial insects during spring clean-up LeForce says.

The pollinator-friendly option is instead to hold off on spring yardwork until daytime temperatures are consistently in the 50′s — usually May in Michigan — which gives those bees and butterflies the time they need to safely emerge.

“They’re already very vulnerable to habitat loss” LeForce says. “It’s a little thing we can do in our own backyards just to help the local populations.”

These insects play a vital role in our world says LeForce from pollinating home veggie gardens to providing a food source for backyard birds to feed their babies who don’t eat birdseed.

Here are LeForce’s tips for protecting pollinators this time of year:

- Avoid burning or bagging up leaf litter and sticks. If you must move leaves and other yard debris rake them into a pile or to the side somewhere and wait to dispose of them until temperatures are consistently in the 50′s.

- Avoid cutting back dead stems from last year’s garden. Some pollinators burrow into stems of plants like old raspberry canes to overwinter.

- Avoid spraying or digging up dandelions which provide one of the first food sources for pollinators.

- Avoid using pesticides or other chemicals on your lawn or if you feel you must consider spraying only part of your lawn and leaving some of the lawn safe for pollinators.

- Plant pollinator-friendly native plants and flowers. Examples include purple coneflower bee balm and milkweed.

LeForce works on DTE Energy initiatives such as land restoration and the creation of pollinator gardens for native bees and monarch butterflies. For more tips on protecting pollinators visit pollinator.org.

Antoine Dupont scores against England after 65 seconds

Barely a minute had passed in the Six Nations encounter between England and France when red-hot scrum-half Antoine Dupont got himself on the scoresheet. England would win a pulsating affair 23-20 but the standard was set for a classic encounter from the off.

At the very start of the match the French backline worked the ball wide when it came to wing Teddy Thomas…

He put a chip over the top. It bounced well for Dupont and as he raced forward after juggling it he took control and went over for the match’s opening try.

England came roaring right back though scoring a try through wing Anthony Watson – who is celebrating his 50th England cap today. and ended up winning the Man of the Match.

With England under the shadow of the french posts the ball made it to George Ford who slung it wide to Watson. With Thomas flying up the England star had a clear run-in.

From here England pinned les Bleus down in their own territory with Owen Farrell penalties edging the hosts in front.

Dupont was even charged down in his own 22 by breakaway Tom curry but the nine made up for it seconds later by forcing Ben Youngs to knock-on at the very next ruck.

Damian Penaud scored just after the half-hour mark. From a lovely lineout move over the top Gael Fickou passed back inside to Dupont. He found Matthieu Jalibert and a looping ball made it over to the rangy wing. The try made it 17-13 in France’s favour.

Penalty kicks brought it to within four points at 16-20 before Maro Itoje’s try edged England ahead and Farrell made it 23-20.

The asking price is a cocaine-kingpin worthy $2.2 million.

Short for International Race of Champions IROC is a defunct racing series that featured drivers from different disciplines in identical cars. It's mostly associated with the Chevrolet Camaro thanks to a tie-in road car but the series started out with 15 identically-equipped Porsches (12 for the drivers plus three spares) prepared by Roger Penske.

The 1973-1974 IROC had an impressive lineup with Mark Donohue Peter Revson Bobby Unser David Pearson Richard Petty A.J. Foyt George Follmer Denny Hulme Bobby Allison Gordon Johncock and Roger McCluskey alongside Fittipaldi. The field encompassed Formula One NASCAR Indianapolis 500 and 24 Hours of Le Mans veterans. Donohue won the championship his last major racing accomplishment before being killed during practice for the 1975 Formula One Austrian Grand Prix.

After one season in the IROC the Fittipaldi-driven 911 RSR was sold to privateer racer John Tunstall who drove it in a handful of IMSA races along with Charlie Kemp. The car was used in IMSA until at least 1978 when it was entered in the Daytona 24 Hours according to the listing.

The car was subsequently sold to Escobar who raced it with 935-style flat-nose bodywork. It's since been restored to its IROC appearance and comes with full documentation according to the listing.

The asking price lines up with the $2.3 million paid for Revson-driven IROC 911 at a 2016 auction of cars from comedian Jerry Seinfeld's collection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV0aW1lcy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlL2EtYmlnLWJhbGwtb2YtbXVzY2xlLWEtbG9jay1jZW50cmUtaHlicmlkLWFuZC11bmRlcnN0dWR5LXN0ZXBwaW5nLXVwLWZyYW5jZXMtdGhyZWUtdG8td2F0Y2gtbjNzZDYyajNj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A big ball of muscle a lock-centre hybrid and understudy stepping up – France's three to watch,"Antoine Dupont – ‘Even at 18 he was a big ball of muscle’

You rarely hear of a scrum half being described as the best rugby player in the world. You’ll hear of him described as the best No9 in the world but it’s probably since George Gregan that someone has been tagged as the best player overall. But I think Antoine Dupont is up there the way he’s playing.

Eddie Jones' side trailed 17-13 at the break after dazzling scores from Antoine Dupont and Damian Penaud had put France in front.

The hosts' pressure told in a cagey second half as Maro Itoje barged over for a 77th-minute score.

Even then France threatened to land a decisive counter-punch but Brice Dulin's break was snuffed out.

Wales' win over Italy earlier in the day means England's victory is too late to salvage a Six Nations title defence.

But victory went some way to re-establishing England's credentials as the northern hemisphere's superpower in world rankings at least.

The 2019 World Cup runners-up had slipped to fourth below France after defeats by Scotland and Wales in their opening three games of this year's campaign.

Today's victory takes them back above their opponents to third.

But with Wales and Scotland upwardly mobile and France a few minutes away from a first win at Twickenham since 2005 any claims to being Europe's number one side are far from conclusive.

France who play unbeaten Wales in Paris next weekend can still win the title for the first time since 2010."

When I moved to Vancouver from Australia in the mid-1980s locals had already had a dozen years to get used to Pacific Centre and the “Great White Urinal”—the name they’d not so affectionately dubbed the Eaton’s department store building. But it wasn’t until several years ago when I saw a 1924 photo showing the Strand Theatre the Birks Building and the second Hotel Vancouver lined up along Georgia at Granville that I realized how much we had lost.

In the 1960s city council wanted a redevelopment of downtown Vancouver with Georgia and Granville Streets as the epicentre. The fear was that the downtown core would lose business to suburban malls and the hope was that a new modern shopping centre would attract people and breathe life back into that intersection. The thought was that this retail vibrancy would come through a superblock and underground parking that spread across several blocks.

Superblock:

The superblock was made up of Block 52—bounded by Granville Georgia Howe and Robson; and Block 42—bounded by Granville Georgia Howe and Dunsmuir. The problem was that the T. Eaton Company which owned all of Block 52 wasn’t in a hurry to move from West Hastings (now SFU Harbour Centre) and a new department store was essential to anchor the proposed shopping mall.

The other problem was 18 individual landowners owned Block 42 and none of them wanted to sell. By the fifth redevelopment report in July 1964 a frustrated city council led by Mayor William Rathie were figuring out ways to expropriate their land.

Vancouver’s Greatest Day:

In May 1968 the city held a plebiscite to allow them to buy up all the properties in Block 42 and 70 percent of voters agreed. The next mayor Tom Campbell told the press: “We’ve got a united city which wants a heart. Vancouver had only a past—today it has a future. This is Vancouver’s greatest day.”

By 1974 we had the Pacific Centre and Vancouver Centre shopping malls much of it as an underground bunker. We’d rid the streets of gorgeous brick buildings and gained the IBM tower the former Four Seasons Hotel the Scotia Tower and a 30-storey black glass monument to capitalism in the TD Tower. Rather than revitalize the Granville and Georgia intersection we sucked the life right out of it.

Australia

Closing the divide between East and West: Building and Construction Industry (Security of Payment) Bill 2020 (WA)

Spencer Flay Perth

Michael Barnes Perth

Kristy Eaton Perth

Each Australian state and territory has security of payment legislation (not unlike the statutory adjudication regime in Malaysia New Zealand Singapore and the United Kingdom) which seeks to ensure the flow of money in the contracting chain.

As the esteemed authors of Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts observe: ‘The Australian adjudication legislation although based upon the process introduced by the UK legislation is subject to a broad dichotomy of approach.’1

Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory have since 2004 championed the ‘West Coast Model’ of security of payment legislation. The balance of the states and territories (the Australian Capital Territory New South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania and Victoria) have on the other hand each (at different times) enacted legislation that broadly subscribes to the ‘East Coast Model’ of security of payment legislation.

At a very high level the West Coast Model legislation seeks to uphold contractual freedom by giving primacy to the terms of the contract including any contractual payment regime. The East Coast Model legislation is far more prescriptive. It establishes a statutory payment regime which runs alongside any contractual payment regime and treats very harshly a payment respondent that fails either to issue a payment schedule or include in its payment schedule any reasons for withholding payment.

Again to quote words from Hudson’s:

‘The lack of uniformity resulting from this dichotomy and the variation in the details of the legislation made under each model have obvious disadvantages for parties involved in interstate projects resulting from a lack of familiarity with the relevant procedure.’2

Since at least 2003 (with the Cole Report3) and particularly since 2017 (with the Murray Report4 and the Fiocco Report5) there have been calls to harmonise Australia’s security of payment laws. It now seems extremely likely that the calls for national harmony will shortly result in the Northern Territory being the only Australian state or territory with West Coast Model security of payment legislation.

On 23 September 2020 the Government of WA introduced to Parliament the Building and Construction Industry (Security of Payment) Bill 2020 (WA) (Bill). The Bill passed the lower house (Legislative Assembly) on 10 November 2020. It now sits in the upper house (Legislative Council) where it will remain until after the WA state election on 13 March 2021. The Bill which draws on many of the recommendations in the Murray and Fiocco reports represents the most significant reform to WA’s security of payment laws in more than a decade. It seeks to replace WA’s current (2004) Construction Contracts Act with laws that better protect subcontractors and are generally more consistent with security of payment laws on the East Coast of Australia.

As currently drafted the Bill proposes amendments in four key areas:

• regulating certain contract terms;

• reforming the payment dispute adjudication process;

• creating deemed trusts for retention money; and

• enhancing the powers of the Building Services Board to manage the commercial conduct and behaviour of registered building service providers under the Building Services Registration Act 2011 (WA).

Application of the Bill

The Bill proposes to apply to building and construction contracts entered into after its commencement. The substantive provisions are set to apply to construction contracts entered into after the date or dates on which they come into operation by proclamation. The Bill would not apply to some construction contracts including:

• building contracts with homeowners worth less than AU$500000;

• contracts between employers and employees for construction work or related goods and services;

• contracts relating to loan agreements with financial institutions;

• contracts for drilling for or extracting minerals oil and gas-related works (this is a narrower exception than the current ‘mining exception’ in section 4(3) of the CCA);

• contracts to build watercraft; and

• contracts involving works where a party fails to hold a registration in contravention of the Building Services (Registration) Act 2011.

The narrowing of the so-called ‘mining exclusion’ is particularly significant and will likely expand significantly the ambit of security of payment laws in WA.

Contract terms

As with the existing legislation the Bill contains a ‘no contracting out’ clause. Importantly the Bill proposes to:

• give adjudicators arbitrators and courts power to declare ‘unfair’ time-bar clauses void in prescribed circumstances;

• extend the prohibition in the current CCA of ‘paid-when-paid’ provisions; and

• create statutory rights (which may be inconsistent with the terms of a contract) to:

– receive advance notice of an intention to call on a performance security;

– substitute a performance bond for retention money;

– make progress payment claims (and provide minimum requirements and procedure for making progress payment claims); and

– require a principal to respond by way of a payment schedule.

Time bars

Notice-based time-bar provisions are common in construction contracts. The Bill proposes to regulate these provisions by giving an arbitrator adjudicator or court the power to declare void any notice-based time bar provision that it considers unfair in the particular circumstances of each case.

A declaration that a provision is unfair (and thus void) in respect of one payment claim would apply only to that claim and would not void the provision otherwise. The provision would continue to operate with respect to other payment claims.

The proposed power to declare unfair (and therefore void) a notice-based time bar provision is unique to the Bill. It would represent a significant departure from the current treatment of notice-based time-bar provisions in common law.6

The Bill considers the operation of a time-bar unfair where compliance with the provision ‘is not reasonably possible’ or ‘would be unreasonably onerous’. This is largely consistent with the recommendation in the Fiocco Report which considered the Murray Report (Murray J Review of Security of Payment Laws (December 2017) Recommendation 84) recommendation. The meaning of ‘is not reasonably possible’ and ‘would be unreasonably onerous’ however is open to debate and will almost certainly consume pages of law reports should the Bill become law in its current form.

A claimant seeking to argue that any notice-based time bar is unfair will bear the onus of proof.

‘Pay when paid’ provisions

As with the CCA ‘pay when paid’ provisions will continue to be prohibited. The Bill proposes to extend the prohibition beyond contract terms that make payment dependent on payment from another party to other provisions that are contingent or dependent on the operation of another contract such as the:

• due date for payment of an amount owing;

• making of a claim for an amount owing; or

• release of retention money or of a performance bond.

Performance security

A party seeking recourse to a performance security will be required to give a notice of intention to call to the party proving the security. The notice of intention must be given at least five business days before the party has recourse to the performance security (or any longer period provided for in the contract).

The notice of intention must:

• be in writing;

• identify the construction contract and the relevant provisions of the contract that the party relies on to have recourse to the performance security; and

• describe the circumstances that entitle the party to have recourse to the performance security.

The Bill proposes an entitlement to seek the release of retention money under a contract by substituting a performance bond for retention money in a payment claim. To do so the payment claim will need to include a draft of the proposed performance bond (or multiple bonds) in a final form that meet minimum requirements prescribed in the Bill.

Right to make payment claims and receive payment

The Bill proposes that a party that carries out or undertakes to carry out construction work or to supply related goods and services has a statutory right to receive progress payments and to make a payment claim every month (or more often if provided for in the relevant contract). This is consistent with security of payment statutes in other states.

The Bill prescribes when and how payment claims may be made and how a party receiving the claim must respond. They must do so in the form of a payment schedule to be provided within 15 days of receiving the payment claim. Any payment dispute may then be referred to adjudication.

Adjudication procedures

The Bill introduces an adjudication process that will be more consistent with those in most other Australian states and territories.

The adjudication procedures in Part 3 of the Bill remain broadly similar to those in the CCA. Their purpose is to determine payment disputes on an interim basis as quickly and inexpensively as possible while ensuring the principles of natural justice are adhered to within the compressed timeframe. The key differences proposed by the Bill include:

• a requirement to provide notice of intention to apply for adjudication where a response to a payment claim is provided and the claimed amount is unpaid;

• shortening the time frame in which to bring an adjudication application to 20 business days following the payment claim and response procedure;

• penalising a party that does not provide a response to a payment claim in the form of a payment schedule or fails to provide reasons for rejecting the claimed amount by not allowing the responding party to submit an adjudication response where no payment schedule is issued or restricting the adjudication response to only the reasons given in the payment schedule; and

• introducing a new review process under which another (and presumably more senior) adjudicator may be appointed to review an adjudication determination. However the parties still retain their full rights to litigate or refer the dispute to another form of dispute resolution in accordance with the construction contract.

Deemed retention trusts

The Bill introduces a retention money trust scheme to provide security for builders contractors subcontractors and suppliers if their immediate contractual counterpart becomes insolvent. The scheme grants a first priority to the retention money retained as security under a contract over other security interests effectively ‘ring-fencing’ the money from being claimed by other creditors.

The Bill proposes requiring all construction contracts that exceed AU$20000 to have retention money trust accounts established. A trust will not need to be established for construction contracts with government principals or home owners if the contract is for home building works worth more than AU$500000 (with a few exceptions).

The retention money trust account works by having the party procuring the construction work or service (Principal or Trustee) retain money in a trust account in accordance with the construction contract. This is held as security for the other party’s (Contractor or Beneficiary) performance of works or services under the contract. The Bill contemplates allowing a Trustee to engage an agent to manage the trust account at their own expense and at their own risk. A Trustee will be liable for an agent’s acts and defaults as if they were acts and defaults of the Principal themselves.

Enhanced powers of the Building Services Board

Finally the Bill proposes to amend the Building Services (Registration) Act 2011 (WA) and the Building Services (Complaint Resolution and Administration) Act 2011 (WA) to give the Building Services Board enhanced powers to manage the commercial conduct and behaviour of registered building services providers.

The Building Services Board will be empowered to:

• declare an individual or non-corporate body an ‘excluded contractor’ where an event resulting in their insolvency has occurred;

• exclude people with a history of insolvency from registering as a building service contractor either temporarily (for a period of three years) or permanently in the case of repeated insolvency events; and

• discipline a building service provider for their failure to pay a ‘building service debt’ (a judgment debt or adjudication determination).

The Building Services Board’s powers to remove building contractors with a history of insolvency from the industry allows for the piercing of the ‘corporate veil’; the Building Services Board will have powers to exclude a corporation or non-corporate body in connection with an insolvency event which is tied to an officer of that body.

United States

US Supreme Court rules that state-law principles allow non-signatory to enforce arbitration provision against signatory

Sarah Biser New York City

Craig Tractenberg New York City

Oksana Wright New York City

In cases involving contracts between US companies courts frequently allow a non-signatory to a contract to enforce an arbitration provision in the contract against a signatory when the signatory to the contract relies on the terms of that agreement in asserting its claims against the non-signatory. On 1 June 2020 the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that this principle – known as ‘equitable estoppel’ – may also be applied to international contracts governed by the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards also known as the New York Convention. This is because nothing in that Convention conflicts with the enforcement of arbitration agreements by non-signatories under domestic-law equitable estoppel doctrines.

The Supreme Court’s decision in GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS Corp v Outokumpu Stainless USA LLC1 overturned a ruling of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and resolves a split on this issue between the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits on the one hand and the First and Fourth Circuits on the other.

GE Energy concerned a company that had entered into three contracts with F L Industries Inc for the construction of cold rolling mills at a steel manufacturing plant in Alabama. Each of the contracts contained an identical arbitration clause providing for arbitration of disputes to take place in German in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. After executing these agreements F L Industries entered into a subcontract agreement with GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS Corp (GE Energy) for the design manufacture and supply of motors for the cold rolling mills. The owner of the steel plant and its insurers filed suit against GE Energy in the Alabama State Court alleging that the motors that it supplied failed resulting in substantial damages.

GE Energy removed the action to federal court and then moved to dismiss and compel arbitration of the claims relying on the arbitration clauses in the contracts between F L Industries and the original owner of the plant. The District Court ruled that GE Energy qualified as a party under the arbitration clauses because the contracts defined the terms ‘seller’ and ‘parties’ to include subcontractors and compelled arbitration.2

The Eleventh Circuit reversed ruling that the New York Convention includes a requirement that the parties actually sign an agreement to arbitrate their disputes in order to compel arbitration.3 It then ruled that GE Energy could not rely on state-law equitable estoppel doctrines to enforce the arbitration agreement as a non-signatory because in the Court’s view equitable estoppel conflicts with the New York Convention’s signatory requirement. The Eleventh Circuit’s ruling on the equitable estoppel was consistent with an earlier Ninth Circuit decision4 and inconsistent with decisions of the First and Fourth Circuits.5

The Supreme Court reversed. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Thomas the Court noted that it had previously ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act permits non-signatories to rely on state-law equitable estoppel doctrines to enforce an arbitration agreement. The Court ruled that nothing in the New York Convention prohibits the application of domestic equitable estoppel doctrines to international contracts providing for arbitration and that the treaty’s silence on that issue was dispositive. The Court also found support for its interpretation by looking to decisions by courts of other New York Convention signatories which it found also permitted enforcement of arbitration agreements by entities that did not sign the agreement.

Because the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the New York Convention prohibited enforcement by non-signatories it did not determine whether GE Energy could enforce the arbitration clauses under principles of equitable estoppel or which body of law governed that determination. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Eleventh Circuit to make those determinations.

The Supreme Court’s decision therefore resolved an issue on which the federal appeals courts were split. It also brings the enforcement of arbitration provisions in international contracts into conformity with the enforcement of such provision in domestic contracts in regard to the potential for non-signatories to compel a signatory to bring its claims in arbitration rather than to litigate against the non-signatory in court. The decision provides non-signatories with an option to compel arbitration when the conditions for equitable estoppel are met.

Story and photos from Vancouver Exposed: Searching for the City’s Hidden History

The Great White Urinal:

Projects originating on it have gone on to earn virtually every big film accolade from debuts at major festivals to Oscars. But for every Elstree 1976 or I Am Big Bird it feels like Kickstarter offers at least 50 projects that seem a bit too niche a bit too low-budget or a bit too amateurish. At the beginning of this very month you could back a film about the life of a UK-based skateboarding Staffordshire Bull Terrier or about what common weeds you can eat for instance. (Disclosure: I once backed a Kickstarter documentary about a group of friends traveling to see LCD Soundsystem play ""All My Friends"" because... I was a foolish college kid?)

On paper Mother to Earth sounds like it belongs among the '50s not the ones. It's a video game documentary not about Earthbound not about the franchise that game belongs to (the Mother trilogy) and not even about the original release in the trilogy that inspires the documentary name. Instead directors Joshua Bone-Christian and Evan Butler had a hyperfocus in mind within this (admittedly already niche) realm: they wanted to track down the story of a specific English-language Mother prototype cartridge. They wanted to learn every detail about how it leaked out of Nintendo headquarters in the early 1990s landed online in a ROM dump around the turn of the century then ultimately encouraged Nintendo to release the game on the WiiU virtual console as Earthbound Beginnings in 2015. (Phew.)

To put it bluntly Mother to Earth is the kind of documentary you almost can't believe exists. It's a niche project about a niche project the kind of thing the production team probably wouldn't have been able to make in an era before crowdfunding. But if you have even a moderate interest in online fandom Earthbound or video game-history preservation you'll be glad they succeeded. Mother to Earth turns out to be a surprising reminder that nowadays even the oddest of topics has the potential to find an audience grow with the encouragement of that small but dedicated support system and ultimately deliver something fascinating.

All over the Earth

It's impossible not to admire the exhaustive research behind Mother to Earth. Ostensibly this film centers on a small moment (one prototype cartridge being listed on eBay) for a small project (an NES JRPG that was never released in the US). But this never feels like a glorified YouTube explainer because of all the legwork thought and care transparently put into the film. The team members had already put two years of work research and investigation into connecting all the disparate bits of known info behind the eBay Mother prototype when they launched and funded the Kickstarter in 2016.... and the finished film didn't debut until late 2019. This is a documentary that isn't afraid to show its work and it feels like Bone-Christian and Butler earned that right. The topic may be narrow but Mother to Earth explores every facet of it in just over 90 minutes.

Advertisement

Without giving away all the juicy nerdy details uncovered through this research just consider the scale of it. The Mother to Earth team goes to Japan just to interview an obsessed merch collector and a first-time video game-score composer. The filmmakers track down the real people behind the comments or online handles that claimed ""first!"" on message board threads about this prototype's existence. And on top of all that they also make the effort to snag all the established voices you'd want chiming in on this moment—the Nintendo employees who translated the game or tested it legal experts who can comment on the shades of gray involved with ROM dumping an old unreleased game and the DIY hackers who initially did the thing that inspired this whole project.

The most impressive feat however might be that Mother to Earth doesn't get lost in these details. Instead the film constantly frames each granular research adventure within the context of Bone-Christian and Butler's central quest. A lot of this happens through the filmmakers appearing on camera in quick interstitials to contextualize what we just saw and how it fits within the larger picture. Well Bone-Christian and Butler ""appear""—some of Mother to Earth's crowdfunding likely went to the charming stage production touches on display. For instance the directors often appear as cutouts against a Twin Peak-y curtain to provide narration or illustrate important moments interviewees reference (but that happened years ago meaning there's no footage to offer).

If you're the type who relishes exhaustive homework and tiny details Mother to Earth will hit a sweet spot. As the filmmakers sum it up toward the end of their work ""We traced a random file we downloaded over two decades ago on some random website from where it came to where it is today within two decades."" But another one of the Mother/Earthbound obsessives interviewed for Mother to Earth may have an even better encapsulation of what awaits viewers. ""In any culture"" begins Koala a pseudonymous Earthbound merch collector/archivist based in Japan ""if there aren't crazy people culture won't be preserved right?""

Mother to Earth is available to rent or buy on Vimeo. The film has also been doing select regional screenings in places where theaters are open like Texas. Watch the film's Facebook page for updates.

Dominating the game for more than four decades Jordan sneakers remain as popular as ever kept in the spotlight by high-profile collabs and long-awaited retroes. With new colorways being dropped on the regular and Netflix's The Last Dance making Michael Jordan even more of a household name the shopping and trading of his signature footwear line show no sign of slowing. Last year auction house Sotheby's sold a pair of Air Jordan 1s worn in-game by MJ for a record-breaking $560000.

While we certainly won't be copping Jordan sneakers with that kind of price tag anytime soon we took to eBay to check out some of the resale options out there that make for a far smarter way to spend your hard-earned dollar.

Whether it's AJ3 sneakers that went criminally under-the-radar or a safe-bet Air Jordan 1 these are the items that are worth parting with your cash for. Better yet eBay's Authenticity Guarantee now covers new condition Jordans and YEEZYs over $200. The marketplace plans to expand the guarantee to all collectible sneakers both new and used priced over $100 this year.

Check the investment Jordan sneakers we found at eBay below.

As a lead into the facts of the Seresto concerns for pet owner I will relate three scenarios that commonly occur in my office.

Scenario 1: I tell an owner about the need for flea and tick prevention for their safety and protection as well as their pets’ health. About 25% of clients reply (this way or similarly) “I can buy the product you are recommending for ¼ of the cost you quoted.” I reply “There are many fake and counterfeit products being sold on the internet. The price you are quoted comes with a manufacturer warranty and I buy at the best price as part of a larger buying group and pass savings and rebates directly to you. At best internet-purchased products may not protect you and your pet and at worst you can actually be introducing toxins such as other insecticides and heavy metals which can be fatal to you and your pets.” Client says “You are just trying to make money and I am buying the Seresto online (from Amazon Ebay or some other non-trusted source) anyway to save 0-15 bucks.”

Scenario 2: I enter an exam room doing an exam noticing an obvious counterfeit Seresto collar (wrong color no serial number or some other distinguishing factor) and pointing it out to the owner. The owner invariably notes it was purchased online or through a place without verifiable direct sales.

Scenario 3: The sick pet that “was perfectly fine when we put the collar on him.” Every week I speak with clients who claim their pet was perfectly healthy when some adverse event occurred. When I have had past interactions with the clients I read through the chart and find that the pet has had health concerns for months to years which have prompted my recommendations of blood work treatment of persistent dental infections elevated/impaired liver functions or a history of Lyme disease. Those pets are not perfectly healthy and are at risk for difficulties in metabolizing drugs. Their owners will often believe their pets are “perfectly healthy” because they are not looking at their pets as a veterinarian does. Buying online flea and tick products for these dogs with potential contaminants and sometimes using multiple products “because the first application didn’t work” can lead to negative results.

On March 2 2021 an article was published in USA Today inciting fear in the minds of all pet owners who have used Seresto Flea and Tick Collars on their pets.

In case you didn’t read it the basic message was: The EPA has received reports about pets who may have had adverse reactions to the Seresto collar and they have taken no action against the manufacturer. Some of the animals whose owners believed their pets reacted to the collars reported that their pets died.

Pet owners immediately began calling my office and my colleagues’ offices in a panic asking about the safety of the collars.

In evaluating the article in USA Today (and in evaluating all articles both scientific and journalistic) I use multiple resources to determine the legitimacy of the reported data. In this case the following facts are important:

The article simply reports that consumers reported their pets had a Seresto collar and they had some sort of health problem or death and the consumer thought it was linked to the collar.

There are no percentages of events relative to the number of collars sold worldwide since 2012.

There are no veterinarians no representatives of Elanco or Bayer and no medical references cited in the article.

My first action was to contact Elanco for data regarding the collar and to discover whether there had been any human deaths as a result of the collar. The following are key data points from Dr. Sabine Bongaerts vice president Elanco Regulatory Affairs and Pharmacovigilance.

There is no established link between death and exposure to the active ingredients contained in Seresto.

Since its initial approval in 2012 more than 25 million Seresto collars have protected dogs and cats in the U.S. from fleas ticks and the resulting tick-borne illnesses that can impact their quality of life.

Over 80 regulatory authorities around the world including the U.S. EPA rigorously reviewed the safety data collected over the course of Seresto’s development prior to registration and/or approval as appropriate. The safety and efficacy of Seresto are continuously monitored by global regulatory bodies.

All adverse events product-related or not are collected evaluated and reported. It is critically important to understand that a report is not an indication of the cause.

Since its approval the reporting rate for all incidents related to Seresto is less than 0.3% in the U.S. The majority of these incidents relate to non-serious effects such as temporary hair loss and mild skin irritation around the application site. It is important to make sure the collar is not fitted too tightly around an animal’s neck. We recommend the collar be snug while still being able to fit two to three fingers under it.

It is important that consumers purchase collars from an authorized clinic or retailer to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the products they are buying.

The take away for clients in all this?

Become a critical thinker for everything you are reading from healthcare to politics. Because it is written it isn’t necessarily true!

Talk to your veterinarian before jumping to conclusions and stopping use of proven and effective products.

Get your pet tested and examined prior to using products.

Stop buying health care products supplements and flea/tick and other preventives on the internet. You may be saving a few bucks while creating fatal and toxic reactions.

Report any suspected adverse event to your veterinarian and the manufacturer.

Give away too much information and somebody could use it to steal your identity. Most of us are aware of the pitfalls and take steps to prevent any exploits.

But sometimes your information can be leaked or gathered through means unaware to you. Have you ever taken the time to read through the terms and conditions of an online service like Facebook? Tap or click here for the eight apps you need to delete from your phone now.

It might come as a surprise to you to learn that many apps share your data with other third parties. Do you know which apps share the most of your data? We’re about to tell you.

Here’s the backstory

Apple requires all apps on its App Store to get your permission to share data across applications. If the app fails to do so it will be kicked off the App Store.

With Apple’s updated privacy policy in mind pCloud did some digging to determine how different apps use your data and where the information goes. While you can revoke an app’s access it will often require all your device’s functions requested to work.

So which apps require the most access and what happens to the information that’s collected? Unsurprisingly 52% of the apps tested shared your information with third parties for targeted advertising.

Apps that share the most data with third parties

It should be no shock that social media apps like Instagram Facebook and YouTube collect the most of your information. It must be explained though that you willingly supply the services with your information in most cases. Here’s a list of apps sharing the most data.

Top 10 apps that share the most of your information:

Instagram (79% of personal data collected) Facebook (57% of personal data collected) LinkedIn (50% of personal data collected) Uber Eats (50% of personal data collected) Trainline (43% of personal data collected) YouTube (43% of personal data collected) YouTube Music (43% of personal data collected) Deliveroo (36% of personal data collected) Duolingo (36% of personal data collected) eBay (36% of personal data collected)

“YouTube isn’t the worst when it comes to selling your information on. That award goes to Instagram which shares a staggering 79% of your data with other companies. Including everything from purchasing information personal data and browsing history. No wonder there’s so much promoted content on your feed” pCloud noted.

But just because the apps share a massive amount of your data doesn’t mean that it’s for nefarious reasons. In most cases your data is passed on to third parties who are associated with the app.

Apps that collect data for their own benefit

Speaking of the biggest social media apps they are also at the top of the list of collecting your information for their own benefit. This is done for several reasons but the most common is to serve you advertising.

In other cases the data collected is for your benefit. Think about receiving a discount coupon on your birthday. The app stored that info to send you a code and hopefully you make a purchase.

Top 10 apps that collect data for their benefit:

Most invasive apps

Taking all the data from the study into account you are probably eager to find out who the biggest culprits are. Well would it be a shock if 40% of the top 10 list are social media applications? Probably not.

Top 10 most invasive apps:

Instagram (62% of personal data tracked) Facebook (55% of personal data tracked) Uber Eats (50% of personal data tracked) Trainline (43% of personal data tracked) eBay (40% of personal data tracked) LinkedIn (40% of personal data tracked) Twitter (40% of personal data tracked) YouTube (36% of personal data tracked) YouTube Music (36% of personal data tracked) Grubhub (36% of personal data tracked)

The safest apps

With the most personal data-hungry apps out of the way some of the safest app in terms of the amount of data that’s tracked can be surprising. Thrust into prominence during the ongoing pandemic apps like Clubhouse Netflix and Microsoft Teams are in the top five.

Even with video calling service Zoom’s conferencing flaw from last year it managed to crack the top 10.

Apps that don’t share your data:

Signal Clubhouse Netflix Microsoft teams Google Classroom Shazam Etsy Skype Telegram Boohoo

Apps like Signal Telegram and Clubhouse have been extremely vocal on user privacy and actively advocate for data protection. Signal and Telegram saw a massive influx of users earlier this year when WhatsApp updated (and subsequently retracted) its terms of service.

Earlier this week Eurogamer reported on how the FIFA community had unearthed direct messages that appeared to show an EA employee selling coveted Ultimate Team cards for thousands of pounds on the black market.

These direct messages mentioned FUT Icon cards in packages priced 750-1000 euros. In one WhatsApp message three Prime Icon Moments cards were offered for 1700 euros.

Icon cards are among the most sought after in FIFA Ultimate Team. They include legendary players such as Brazilian Ronaldo Pele Ronaldinho Zinedine Zidane and Ruud Gullit and are near impossible to obtain through the mode's controversial loot boxes.

Even rarer are Prime Icon Moments - special versions of Icon cards that mark one game or tournament that was special for the players.

EA launched an investigation in response and overnight provided an update:

""Earlier this week we were made aware of suspicious activity relating to highly rated content in FIFA Ultimate Team"" EA said.

""We learned that FUT items were granted to individual accounts that did not earn them through gameplay - i.e. by opening a pack purchasing through the transfer market completing a reward challenge (e.g. an SBC completion) or other engagement (e.g. viewing a Twitch Broadcast).

""It appears that one or more EA accounts which were either compromised or being used inappropriately by someone within EA directly entitled items to these individual accounts.

""The alleged behaviour is unacceptable and in no way do we condone granting or purchasing player items in exchange for money. This practice runs counter to the game's competitive integrity is a violation of EA's User Agreement and is not something we tolerate. We do not allow the trade or sale of items outside our game for many reasons including that it would create an unequal playing field for our community.""

Of course EA does grant purchasing player items in exchange for money - via loot boxes.

EA insisted its initial investigation has shown questionable activity involving ""a very small number of accounts and items"" but despite this called the alleged activity ""unacceptable"".

EA then vowed to take action against any employee found to have been engaging in this activity to remove any items granted from the FUT ecosystem and permanently ban any player known to have bought them.

EA then apologised to the FIFA community: ""Regardless of these actions we appreciate how concerning this is to all of our players and we apologise for the impact of these improper grants within the community.

""We also appreciate how extremely annoying and frustrating it is that this practice might have come from within EA. We're angry too. We know that the trust of our communities is hard-earned and is based on principles of Fair Play. This illicit activity shakes that trust. We've also been clear since the creation of Ultimate Team that items cannot be exchanged outside our game and that's key to how we keep our game safe from manipulation and bad actors. This is a breach of that principle as well - and we won't let it stand.""

EA goes on to discuss content granting - something it rarely does. This is when EA gives Ultimate Team content to player accounts. EA said that unless these items are issued to replace lost content they are usually non-tradeable items which means they have no exchange value in the game cannot be sold on the transfer market and cannot be shared with other players. Examples include items used in testing and quality verification and discretionary content granting to athletes EA's partners and employees.

Every now and then the community will discover a famous footballer's Ultimate Team because they've run up against them online and you'll sometimes see the footballers use a special 99-rated version of themselves in-game. That's discretionary content granting to athletes.

""The items granted on a discretionary basis to these partners or employees are always non-tradeable and can be used only by the account to which they were originally granted"" EA insisted. ""We do not use this discretionary process to grant content to professional video game influencers.""

Of course this content can be used in Ultimate Team's competitive pay-to-win multiplayer against other players online - a balance issue EA does not address in its statement.

EA said the sum of items granted through these three scenarios (customer experience testing and partners) combined is less than 0.0006 per cent of the total player items in the FIFA 21 ecosystem. EA insisted these grants have no impact on the odds of any player in the ecosystem acquiring these players they have no bearing on the overall volume of available content and all content that is granted is untradeable with no associated coin value.

""Obviously the actions being alleged in this case fall far outside of these legitimate scenarios for granting content"" EA said.

EA's investigation is ongoing but the company said it has narrowed how this happened and identified the accounts that have received the content. Meanwhile EA has suspended all discretionary content granting for an indefinite period.

""Once again we highly value and appreciate the commitment and support of the FIFA community in helping identify this issue and will continue to provide updates as the investigation progresses towards conclusion"" EA said.

One of the many issues with Ultimate Team the ""EA Gate"" scandal highlights is the artificial scarcity of these highly-coveted items. Some of the most powerful and most sought after cards in the game - the Prime Icon Moments versions of Ronaldo Pele Ronaldinho Zinedine Zidane and Ruud Gullit for example - have a below one per cent chance of dropping from a loot box. The exact probability of getting an Icon from a pack is unknown because EA does not disclose exact percentage chances below one percent - a lack of transparency that has been criticised for some time.

EA is already facing two other lawsuits connected to Ultimate Team one in the United States alleging the mode breaks California state gambling laws and one in Canada accusing EA of running ""an unlicensed illegal gaming system through their loot boxes"".

Loot boxes have come under increased scrutiny from government authorities in recent years too particularly in relation to their impact on young people. In January 2019 EA stopped selling FIFA Points in Belgium following government pressure over loot boxes. The Netherlands Gambling Authority has also declared loot boxes illegal because they are considered a game of chance and therefore violate the country's Gambling Act. The Dutch authorities ended up issuing EA with a fine of up to €10m over loot boxes in FIFA.

FIFA loot boxes are currently not considered a form of gambling in the UK although the government is taking a close look at them in that context. In July the House of Lords gambling committee urged the government to ""act immediately"" to regulate them. The Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport launched a consultation on loot boxes in September and a review of the Gambling Act 2005 in December last year. It is due to publish a white paper before the end of this year.

FIFA hit the mainstream headlines last weekend with a Sunday Times investigation titled ""FIFA's ugly game lures teens to gamble"".

EA has called FIFA loot boxes ""surprise mechanics"" and in a statement given to the Sunday Times likened them to Kinder eggs. A spokeswoman told the paper there was ""no advantage to purchasing Ultimate Team packs rather than earning them"" and that the majority of player packs were awarded through in-game accomplishments. She said users could track or limit their spend through FIFA Playtime a new in-game tool and said access to online gameplay could be restricted using parental controls on consoles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmlsbHlwZW5uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS10aW55LWhvdXNlLXN0cmVldC1hcnQtZWxlY3RyaWMtcGVyY3ktbXVyYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A tiny tile rowhome appears in South Philly's 'electric' art alley,"💌 Love Philly? Sign up for the free Billy Penn email newsletter to get everything you need to know about Philadelphia every day.

Carefully laid brickwork making up the facade. Cornices marked by fleur de lis designs. A trio of marble steps at the front door. Though just a couple feet tall the mosaic that sits at eye level in a South Philly alleyway is a pretty accurate representation of a Philadelphia rowhome.

The dollhouse-sized tilework appeared last summer. For several months no one was sure who’d created it.

“I know not who made it or why but it’s so cool and so Philly and I think you should go see it” Eric in Philly a street art tour guide posted on Instagram. “That street is turning into a real art corridor!”

Known as “The Electric Street” the semi-hidden alley begins just south of Pat’s King of Steaks.

Curving to connect 9th Street to Reed in parallel to Passyunk Avenue the stretch gained international renown last year as home to the Percy Street Project a series of abstract murals that light up in neon after dark.

The LED artwork by David Guinn and Drew Billiau is funded by Mural Arts and the Knight Foundation. It’s meant to increase safety and walkability while also beautifying the neighborhood. Several other murals now flank the “electric” design and plans call for the entire block to be covered with artists paid for their creations.

The tiny tile house doesn’t quite fit in with the overarching plan — exactly as its creator intended they told Billy Penn.

“There’s kind of a dichotomy with the art on this block” said tile artist who goes by the pseudonym Klapaucius Frink. “There’s the planned stuff and then the more spontaneous stuff.”

Frink is on a mission to encourage more people to contribute to the spontaneity.

The artist who said they own the property has plastered the rest of the wall near the little house with action figures and plastic dinosaurs. (It’s reminiscent of a similar installation at Philly Aids Thrift part of which was also Frink’s handiwork.)

Each toy is arranged perpendicular to the building exterior so it can cradle a large chunk of sidewalk chalk. Serendipitously — or really because Frink convinced a couple of neighbors to go along with the idea — a few nearby walls are covered with chalkboard paint leading to an ever-changing array of pastel drawings and messages.

With its earth tones and intricate details the petite rowhome also contrasts with the bright murals at the other end of the alley offering a bonus for visitors who walk the loop.

It came about when Frink happened on some found materials that begged for it they explained.

The marble that showed up first and “I realized it was just like a stoop!” Frink said. Then came a set of thin clay tiles which could be easily carved to look like miniature brickwork. Add an etched slab for the doorway some delicate pieces for the windows and the miniature house was born.

Per the artist it’s likely to stick around for a while offering plenty of chances to check it out next time you’re in the neighborhood.

At one point in Electronic which opened in July 2020 you come to an array of variously sized plastic circles packed tightly together and lit at an angle so as to project their shadow on to the wall behind and above them. There’s a moment when you wonder what these shapes are: some kind of abstract art a mountain-range silhouette a heartbeat. Then you realise of course that it’s a spectrogram for the song you’ve just listened to through your headphones – and that these black plastic circles are supposed to look like records. It’s a lovely reflection of electronic music’s ways of generating meaning without necessarily relying on lyrics. These signs could mean anything; they could mean everything.

Electronic music has always had a utopian impulse to it. The critic Owen Hatherley has written that Kraftwerk’s music was “an imaginary universal language that anyone could learn anyone could speak anyone could dance to”. The 1988 “second summer of love” could easily be contextualised as a moment of escape from the Thatcher-era Conservative rule. The origins of techno in post-industrial Detroit testify to black creativity under repressive conditions. Captions in this exhibition note that the dancefloor has often acted as a space of freedom for the queer community. Peter Gay once wrote in a different context that “the cure for the ills of modernity is more and the right kind of modernity”; electronic music might be the best evidence yet.

Certainly visiting the Design Museum felt like a relief after months of lockdown albeit a strange one: branding its atmosphere as “clublike” while having to enforce social distancing and make people bring their own headphones is a difficult balancing act to pull off. Seeing people dancing an activity that necessitates proximity in photographs or on video felt instinctively unsettling. But in terms of range and quality the exhibition’s subtitle – “from Kraftwerk to the Chemical Brothers’” – actually undersells it. The material on display encompasses the music’s origins in cold war-era science experiments through to present-day promotional nightclub graphics.

There’s a nice detail about how the Moog synthesiser first came to prominence at the 1967 Monterey pop festival an occasion otherwise noted as a touchstone of rock’n’roll authenticity all feedback and free love. How fitting given that in terms of staying power – and perhaps countercultural cool – electronic musicians have long outstripped hippies. It’s also pleasing to see due credit given to disco sometimes still a too-easy shorthand for 70s lameness and bad clothes. Amazingly sensual photographs by Tina Paul and Bill Bernstein are on hand to amend the genre’s public image.

The placement of Detroit techno within the city’s industrial history and a whole room dedicated to Kraftwerk do enough to emphasise the music’s avant-garde “man machine” element: this is and always has been the sound of the future. Dub might have been given a bigger role than a sole mention of Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry though it’s easy to nitpick about an exhibition that aims for and mostly achieves comprehensive coverage; it’s both one for the heads and a beginner’s guide.

One way to tell the story of electronic music is as a transition from private to public settings solo to shared pleasure. For all of its long and storied history as communal musical space it has a parallel one as domestic sonic world-building. One of the earliest ways in which electronic sound first found an audience was via the home technology of the radio and the television for which the BBC Radiophonic Workshop started producing incidental noise and music in 1958.

It’s understandable that the exhibition emphasises the sexier narrative of dance music. Two ecstatic large-format photographs by Andreas Gursky including 1985’s Union Rave are some of the first and best things on display. But under the circumstances when we have had to domesticate our musical experiences more than usual it’s worth paying attention to this shadow history too.

A risk of exhibiting in a museum something so lively so current is that it gets framed as a specialist interest one taste among many whereas the value of electronic music is at its most visible when it seems to synthesise and connect an entire culture. The curators seem to know this. A 1990 cover of the Face magazine on display near the end as part of a section on acid house predicts a “third summer of love” and features mentions of the Stone Roses Prince and Madonna alongside a pre-fame Kate Moss. None of these people on the face of it have that much to do with electronic music; yet here they all become drawn into a cultural moment spawned by just that. Ultimately the exhibition’s message sounds true: electronic music is now the air we all breathe the ocean we all swim in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTIvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vYmVlcGxlLW5vbmZ1bmdpYmxlLW5mdC1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beeple Has Won. Here's What We've Lost. (Published 2021),"“I want to be a machine” Andy Warhol once said. Apparently the public wouldn’t mind either.

Lately a digital artist from South Carolina known mononymously as Beeple has won a following by using 3-D rendering software to make colorful digestible pastiches which he now sells as files authenticated with a unique bit of code. On Thursday a montage of these digital files titled “Everydays — The First 5000 Days” went on the block in a one-lot online auction at Christie’s where it became the “What Does the Fox Say?” of art sales. A crypto whale known only by the pseudonym Metakovan paid $69 million (with fees) for some indiscriminately collated pictures of cartoon monsters gross-out gags and a breastfeeding Donald Trump — which suddenly makes this computer illustrator the third-highest-selling artist alive.

There will be hundreds of models the company promises and by the looks of things the game will let players customize them up to the smallest detail including “real-world parts from leading manufacturers.”Since it’s supposed to bring racing simulators to mobile devices Racing Master also gives players full control over the handling of each car and it’ll offer support for both tilt and touch two options that are already available in most racing games on mobile devices.At first glance it looks like multiplayer support will also be offered as Racing Master will allow you to compete “against other players in cities around the world to become a racing champion.”No further specifics have been shared such as whether Racing Master would be offered for free or not but a trailer shared on YouTube provides us with an early look at the mobile gameplay.

Additionally data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline with ranges between 20-40 percent in all secondary endpoints [Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog13) Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] with nominal statistical significance at multiple times compared to placebo. Further prespecified exploratory analyses showed donanemab slowed the accumulation of tau across key brain regions in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.

""We are confident in the results of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study"" said Daniel Skovronsky  M.D. Ph.D. Lilly 's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories . ""This is the first late-stage study in Alzheimer's disease to meet its primary endpoint at the primary analysis. Donanemab has the potential to become a very important treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We were pleased to see not only slowing of cognitive and functional decline but also very substantial clearance of amyloid plaques and slowing of spread of tau pathology. The constellation of clinical and biomarker results indicates the potential for long-term disease modification. We are grateful to the patients caregivers and investigators who participated in this landmark study.""

Specifically at 76 weeks compared to baseline treatment with donanemab slowed decline by 32 percent compared to placebo as measured by the iADRS which was statistically significant. As early as nine months (36 weeks) after initiation of treatment a significant difference in decline by iADRS was observed.

In addition 40 percent of participants treated with donanemab achieved amyloid negativity as early as six months after starting treatment and 68 percent achieved this target by 18 months. Donanemab is a monoclonal antibody that was designed to bind a specific form of post-translationally modified Aß N-terminal pyroglutamate and thereby yield rapid and complete clearance of amyloid plaques.

""Tau has become increasingly validated as a predictive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease progression as shown again in this trial"" said Liana G. Apostolova  M.D. M.Sc . FAAN Indiana University (IU) Distinguished Professor and Barbara and Peer Baekgaard Professor in Alzheimer's Disease Research at IU School of Medicine . ""A key insight of the results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study is that donanemab not only significantly reduced the amount of amyloid deposition in these patients but also slowed the clinical progression of the disease suggesting that this could be a disease-modifying therapy. We believe these amyloid and tau imaging data lay the foundation for precision medicine-based Alzheimer's disease treatments.""

The safety profile of donanemab was consistent with observations from Phase 1 data. In the donanemab treatment group amyloid-related imaging abnormalities – edema (ARIA-E) occurred in 26.7 percent of treated participants with an overall incidence of 6.1 percent experiencing symptomatic ARIA-E; the majority ARIA-E cases occurred within the first 12 weeks after initiation of treatment. Other common AEs in the donanemab treatment group include ARIA-H related events like microhemorrhages (7.6 percent) and superficial siderosis of central nervous system (13.7 percent) nausea (10.7 percent) and infusion-related reaction (IRR) (7.6 percent). Serious IRR or hypersensitivity occurred in 2.3 percent of participants treated with donanemab. In the donanemab arm 30.5 percent of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and half of these discontinuations were due to ARIA-related events. Patients with treatment discontinuations were allowed to continue in the trial.

""As a clinician and researcher I'm particularly encouraged by the significant plaque lowering and the slowing of clinical decline with donanemab"" said Stephen P. Salloway  M.S. M.D. Director of the Memory and Aging Program and the Department of Neurology at Butler Hospital and Martin M. Zucker professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Department of Neurology  Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University . ""The donanemab results are a significant and encouraging milestone for people impacted by Alzheimer's disease and we are eager to continue on in this fight.""

Discussions with regulators are ongoing and an update on the TRAILBLAZER clinical trial program will be provided on a webcast on Monday March 15 at 10:30 AM EDT including an update on the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial.

About TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Study

TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (NCT03367403) is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multi-center Phase 2 study to assess the safety tolerability and efficacy of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. The trial enrolled 272 patients who were selected based on cognitive assessments in conjunction with amyloid plaque imaging and tau staging by PET imaging. The study's primary endpoint is change from baseline until 76 weeks in the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) a composite tool combining the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL) for function. Key secondary endpoints include changes between baseline and 76 weeks in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) ADCS-iADL MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Other secondary biomarker endpoints include changes from baseline to week 76 in brain amyloid deposition and brain tau deposition and volumetric MRI. The safety tolerability and efficacy of donanemab are also being evaluated in the ongoing randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multi-center Phase 2 study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (NCT04437511).

About Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases3. There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 20504. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide implying one new case every 3 seconds and a significant increase in the caregiving burden placed on society and families. In the US alone there was an increase of 8 million new caregivers from 2015 to 20205. The current annual societal and economic cost of dementia is estimated at $1 trillion  an amount that is expected to double by 2030 unless we find a way to slow the disease4.

The facility had no generator or clean water a Forbes story reported. Some children walked six miles to the school because the broken-down bus was stranded in the orphanage’s yard.

DeHaan could have easily signed a check boarded a plane back to Indianapolis and patted herself on the back. It wouldn’t have made a dent in her net worth. Two years earlier she had sold her company Resort Condominiums International for $825 million. But covering immediate maintenance needs wasn’t going to change the future for these orphans. DeHaan knew that and she wanted to do more. So one of the richest self-made businesswomen in the world came out of retirement to build Christel House.

The mission of the nonprofit organization was and still is to break the cycle of poverty around the world through education in conjunction with other services provided through its schools. Today Christel House operates two charter schools in Indianapolis and private schools on three continents. In October 2020 its newest school opened in Jamaica serving children in the second-poorest country in the Caribbean. This was the first Christel House school opening without its ambitious founder though. DeHaan died four months earlier. By the time of her death last June at the age of 77 she had donated $174 million to the organization.

In the nonprofit world a visionary founder’s death can be devastating especially if that person micromanaged the organization. There’s even a name for it: “founder’s syndrome” when a nonprofit team behaves more according to what they think the founder will approve of as opposed to focusing on a mission.

DeHaan was certainly a big part of the brand at Christel House but she never fell into that trap. She prepared the nonprofit for the day when she would be gone. That planning went far beyond making sure it was well funded. By putting in place many of the same policies and organizational structures that made her business so successful she gave Christel House the fighting chance she always wanted for at-risk students.

To understand what motivated DeHaan to dedicate her last years to poor kids consider where she came from. In 1942 in the depths of World War II she was born in Nördlingen Germany. Her father German soldier Adolf Stark died when she was 3. Germany’s economy was in ruins and food was scarce. Christel’s mother Anna was left to fend for herself and her daughters on her own. She started an ironing business and taught Christel how to haul coal and forage for food. Despite their own hardships the girls watched their mom help neighbors in need. DeHaan said later in life “Our mother instilled in me the philosophy of giving that has guided my actions throughout my life.”

After high school DeHaan spent a year as a nanny in England before returning to Nördlingen and taking a job as a secretary at a U.S. Army base. There she met a medic from Indiana. They married and moved with their first son to Indianapolis. By the early 1970s though she and her first husband had divorced. She attended what is now known as the University of Indianapolis while raising two sons and working as a secretary. She married Jon DeHaan in 1973 and they began developing RCI.

To support causes they cared about the DeHaans established the RCI Foundation. Two years after they divorced in 1987 Christel bought Jon’s half of the company for $67.5 million. She continued to expand RCI which at its peak employed 4000 people across 38 countries. Cheryl Wendling a former colleague there says DeHaan demanded excellence from everyone and modeled the hard work she expected of others. It wasn’t unusual to get emails from her in the middle of the night. It paid off when she sold the company profiting an estimated $550 million.

When DeHaan retired she reorganized the RCI Foundation into a private family fund the Christel DeHaan Family Foundation. She now had the means to carry out her mother’s philosophy of giving on a grand scale. DeHaan could dole out grants and enjoy her retirement. The foundation was supposed to be her sole philanthropic vehicle when she retired from RCI but things didn’t work out that way. When she decided to found Christel House after that trip to Mexico in 1998 DeHaan asked herself if there was a practical way to change the life course of children trapped in deep poverty. She decided there was but it was going to involve a more holistic approach than just opening a standard school.

“She had an unreasonable belief in the ability to get things done” says former Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson who now serves as president and CEO of Christel House International. “She was totally dismissive of barriers and obstacles and that’s how she has been able to achieve the impossible. Normal people don’t have that. That’s how the world changes.”

For example people told her that locating schools in places like Tacubaya one of the poorest sections of Mexico City was too dangerous. There were more promising spots for a safe school. But she continued to choose communities where danger was an obstacle. Peterson tells the story of a young boy who was absent from class two days in a row at the first Christel House location. On the third day a representative from the school went to the child’s home. His mother said her son would be in school the next day but there had been a dead body on the apartment stairs the last two days. She wasn’t going to ask her son to use the stairs until someone removed the body. From the beginning of Christel House DeHaan put in place safety measures such as 24-hour-a-day security guards so employees could more safely look after students like that in risky neighborhoods.

Peterson says many schools like Christel House feel a temptation to admit children from slightly better backgrounds or those who are gifted and talented. They would perform better on standardized tests and make the schools look better relative to applicable benchmarks. But that was not DeHaan’s vision or the resulting education model. Instead the consistent focus was on children who came from very deep poverty. They were the customers.

“Christel House is a very businesslike organization structured by Christel to operate like a business where the ultimate goal is not profits for shareholders but high-quality education for impoverished kids” Peterson says. He equates how she ran Christel House to his experience working at Eli Lilly and Company with rigorous business plans and processes clear revenue and expenditure targets and accountability measures. Among other practices that are unusual for a nonprofit financial incentives are offered up and down the organizational chart when goals are exceeded.

DeHaan also wrote a detailed operations manual which has been guiding the organization since at least 2001 when the second and third locations opened in India and South Africa. The lengthy document focuses heavily on data collection and analysis. “Christel always said ‘What gets measured gets done’” Wendling says. What’s more Christel House entities were set up to be governed mostly by local boards minimizing the impact of changes in leadership at the corporate level.

The non-academic programming that Christel House offered from the beginning also made it unique. Each of the schools provided healthcare character development meals family assistance and college and career support. When a student graduated from high school Christel House stayed in touch for at least five years. This of course took money. DeHaan set up Christel House to operate in perpetuity. A significant portion of her estate—still in the process of being adjudicated by the courts and last estimated to be $950 million—will go to support Christel House and cover 100 percent of its administrative capital and fundraising costs.

By the time she passed away DeHaan had set a focused mission for her nonprofit drawn up some unique policies to ensure its survival and established a large endowment. But Christel House was about to face an immediate test of its ability to succeed without its founder: the takeover of troubled Manual High School.

When former Indianapolis Star columnist Matt Tully wrote a series of columns on Manual in 2009 the southside school had a graduation rate of 39 percent. Only 32 percent of its students were passing the English and math portions of the ISTEP exam. A few years later a private takeover of the school failed and Indianapolis Public Schools was at a loss for what to do with the institution. IPS officials began to have conversations with Christel House about helping to save the failing school.

Anne DePrez a close friend of DeHaan’s and chair of the board of directors of Christel House recalls those conversations and says it felt like teetering at the top of a roller coaster that was about to plunge into new territory. Nevertheless in 2020 Christel House agreed to a five-year partnership with IPS to operate Manual. The agreement allows existing Manual students to graduate as Manual students and gives Christel House Academy South and Christel House Academy West in Indianapolis more room to grow. And because Manual is a public school Christel House can use property tax funds from local taxpayers which will free up general fund money for facilities. The organization hired its first Manual staff member last March and took over operations of the high school program last July.

Although she’s not around to see the ongoing transformation of Manual DeHaan seems to have prepared the nonprofit for this challenge as well. She resigned from the Christel House board a few years ago which allowed its local leaders to acclimate to life without her. When it came to building the board DePrez says DeHaan valued diversity in terms of ethnicity gender background expertise and skill sets. “She wanted people who were not afraid to speak their minds and challenge the status quo” she says.

Like the board the new leadership at Manual has felt empowered to try new things. In addition to serving traditional students the building will soon house a Drop Out Recovery School run by Christel House for adults going back to earn their degree. Manual now has a relationship with the University of Indianapolis and Ivy Tech that provides dual credit for some classes. The school provides childcare for parents taking classes there. And they’re exploring the idea of an Early Childhood Center at Manual that would provide a pre-K program to get southside kids started on the right foot. It all adds up to a multigenerational campus where there was once just a failing high school.

Whatever happens with these new programs at Manual the larger Christel House organization will continue to operate much as it has for the last 23 years. Peterson recalls discussing its future with DeHaan before she got sick. “She said ‘I want the organization to evolve. I want it to change. You’re going to have ideas that are different from mine and that’s good. I don’t want to control things from the great beyond’” he says. What was nonnegotiable was sticking to the core mission: transforming the lives of impoverished children.

DeHaan’s hometown of Nördlingen was built in a massive crater formed by a meteor millennia ago. As a result its stone buildings are studded with diamonds. Perhaps as a child in post-war Germany DeHaan admired those tiny gems trapped inside the rock. As an adult she certainly had a talent for seeing diamonds in the rough—people who needed help breaking free from poverty—and she began to pluck them out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy96b3JvdmljLW1hcml0aW1lLWluZHVzdHJ5LWNyZXctbWFuYWdlbWVudC0wMjUyMDA2MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zorovic Maritime Industry Crew Management Recruitment Training Services Launched,"Zorovic Maritime Services is providing crew management and training services for maritime businesses seeking trained employees.

According to the report the joint venture has hired major bank BNP Paribas to find investors.

Citing “several people familiar with the matter” Reuters news agency reports that Ionity is planning to sell a minority stake worth between 400 and 500 million euros. This would correspond to a share of 20 to 25 per cent of the company. According to the insiders among the potentially interested parties are a number of investors such as Macquarie EQT Meridiam OMERS and IFM. First bids are apparently expected after Easter.

Reuters also quotes an official statement from Ionity that saying that Ionity is in constant dialogue with its joint venture partners and is examining further investment opportunities for the expansion of the fast charging infrastructure. It goes on to say: “In principle additional shareholders are welcome for the joint venture.” Ionity is backed by the carmakers Mercedes-Benz BMW Ford Volkswagen (via Audi and Porsche) and more recently Hyundai-Kia. To date the five shareholders each hold 20 per cent of the joint venture.

Managing Director Michael Hajesch recently spoke about the future of Ionity in our online conference with our German language broadcast electrive.net live focussing on High Power Charging (HPC). “For 2021 we expect a significant increase in numbers” Hajesch said. As further projects he mentioned the introduction of Plug&Charge by the second quarter in all markets and the piloting of battery-based charging stations in Spain and the UK.

Ionity is famously behind schedule in rolling out its HPC parks with only 336 of the 400 charging parks the joint venture has promised to complete by the end of 2020. The company’s CEO only hints at what activities the company is basically aiming for after the 400 completed charging parks. “We are in intensive talks with our shareholders.” What he can say is that “we are certainly not letting off the gas in our progressive approach”.

However two or three of Hajesch’s comments on the digital electrive stage left further room for interpretation: firstly he welcomed the German government’s initiative to build 1000 DC “federal charging parks” and indicated that Ionity would “of course look at the tender although everything depends on what the regulation looks like at the end of the day”. On the other hand Hajesch advocated “more HPC and denser coverage” to prevent long queues at Ionity charging parks in the future especially on weekends.

Incidentally in January in line with the current Reuters report the German publication Manager Magazin also reported that the owners were considering attracting private equity capital for Ionity “because the expansion of the fast-charging network is progressing too slowly”. The article spoke of at least 500 million euros in fresh capital. At the time the German business publication cited “financial circles” as sources.

According to the company those files contain names addresses social insurance numbers and banking information of employees both past and present.

Greg Gill vice-president of marketing told CBC News the company's IT team discovered and quickly stopped the attack — while it was in progress — on the weekend of Feb. 20.

Gill said the company issued letters to all employees and former employees informing them of the attack.

""There's evidence to suggest that there was activity or access to certain files on a server. It's not always easy to determine exactly what may have been access or copied"" Gill said.

""We as a company thought it was best to contact all of our employees current and former to do what we thought was the right thing to protect them.""

The Coleman Group hired a cybersecurity consultant firm to help in the investigation and arranged credit monitoring services for current and former employees through Equifax Canada for the next 12 months at no cost to users. The service also comes with identity theft insurance.

Gill said the company is investigating.

But one former employee wonders what information of his was still on file after not having worked for the company in two decades. Jimmy Short posted the company letter on Twitter on Thursday wondering if others had received the same.

Gill wouldn't say if it's standard practice to retain employee information for so long but said the company got in touch with everyone on its contact list to offer them protection ""out of an abundance of caution.""

According to Newfoundland and Labrador labour standards every employer must keep payroll records for each employee for a period of four years from the date of the last entry.

""We just looked at this situation and thought it's best to reach out to everybody and I can imagine if you were an employee who hasn't worked for us in a number of years you might wonder what's the situation there"" Gill said.

""We just said 'Look let's just go back to everybody that we have contacts for and let them know this happened and extend that service to them.'""

Gill said the IT team shut down internal internet and email services to halt the attack but that move didn't have any negative impacts on business and the company continued to operate its grocery furniture and clothing outlets.

""Most of the disruption is just stuff related to the current situation with the COVID pandemic. As it pertains to the breach we're back to business and just carrying on"" Gill said.

""I think cyberattacks right now seem to be more and more prevalent. They happen. It's unfortunate. We wanted to make sure we followed best practices.""

Each structure makes adaptive reuse of low-rise commercial sites to add 205 new apartments to the Berkeley housing market. Mill Creek Residential is sponsoring as the project applicant after acquiring the site from Equity Residential in 2016.

The six-story MacFarlane at the corner of University and Shattuck will yield 64290 square feet with 1160 square feet for ground-level retail and 3000 square feet for a roof deck. The site will yield 69 units. Unit sizes will range from studios to three-bedrooms. Construction is expected to cost $16.2 million.

The MacFarlane and the Acheson Physicians Building at 2131 University Avenue are separated by an existing structure unrelated to the Modera project. 2131 University’s exterior will remain unchanged though the interior will convert from offices to housing. The four-story building will be renovated for $7.8 million to produce 21 apartments and 7940 square feet of ground-floor retail.

The Ace Building at 2145 University Avenue is halfway to its 86 foot pinnacle. The six-story building will yield 36690 square feet for a roof deck 5120 square feet of ground-floor retail and 35 residences. Construction will cost $4.7 million.

Around the block at the intersection of Walnut Street and Berkeley Way is the Walnut Building at 1900 Walnut Street. Construction will eventually bring the structure up to its 78-foot roof height creating 67990 square feet with 78 houses and 2790 square feet of retail. Construction will cost $15.7 million.

Kirk E. Peterson & Associates is the project architect. The firm describes their work as embodying the Spanish Revival style referencing the area’s Spanish colonial history. The full project will offer 15980 square feet and on-site parking for fifty vehicles an improvement from the recommended 180 spaces. The four sites are expecting to receive LEED Gold certification.

The address is located just two blocks north of the Downtown Berkeley BART Station and one block west of the famed UC Berkeley college campus. Construction has not yet started on facade installation though preparation has been made on the MacFarlane’s exteriors. An expected completion date has not been announced.

Here's how to finance it,"Open this photo in gallery: Many Canadians are tapping into their home equity to purchase a second property.Natalia Duryagina/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

The work and lifestyle changes brought on by the pandemic have many Canadian homeowners thinking about buying second properties – whether it’s a cottage a pied-à-terre or helping adult children buy a home in a hot housing market.

Record-low interest rates are driving the search for these places and some Canadians are using the considerable equity built up in their principal residences to seal the deal.

“The goal is to unlock the equity in your home” says Elan Weintraub co-founder and mortgage broker at Mortgageoutlet.ca.

There are many issues and strategies to consider with this kind of financing Mr. Weintraub says depending on your real estate status and objectives.

Ways to finance a second property

Often the best option is to refinance your current mortgage. This loan called the “first-position charge on the title” is likely to come at the lowest rate so it’s the best way to free up funds from the equity in your current property Mr. Weintraub says.

If that’s not possible or advantageous due to fees rates or terms you can use the equity in your home as security against another loan which becomes a “second-position charge on the title.” A popular option for this is through a home equity line of credit or HELOC a loan offered by a bank credit union or other lender that’s secured by the value of your home so it comes at a relatively low rate Mr. Weintraub says.

Depending on your credit and income the interest on a HELOC may be just half a per cent above prime. This rate is typically slightly higher than a first mortgage reflecting the added risk to the lender of being paid second if you default.

There are also “second mortgages” offered by private lenders he notes which are typically used to consolidate debt if the borrower has suffered a job loss or credit problems. These come at a higher rate even into the double digits given the greater risk involved.

John Webster head of real estate and secured lending at Bank of Nova Scotia says second-position loans have evolved a lot from the classic “vendor take-back” second mortgages that often had to be offered by the sellers of homes back in the 1960s when buyers did not have adequate down payments or couldn’t qualify for sufficient mortgages.

Today Mr. Webster says homeowners are looking for ways to take advantage of their properties’ rapid appreciation. They are also rushing to snag vacation places as the pandemic drives up demand he notes with cottage prices jumping 30 per cent in some parts of the country.

Lenders are more than willing to offer solutions through home equity plans. Indeed in many cases when borrowers get a first mortgage they are automatically eligible for a HELOC that reflects the accrued equity in the property.

“Your credit limit goes up with the value in your home” explains Mr. Webster noting that HELOC funds can be used to finance a secondary property for yourself or your children to fund renovations buy a new car or myriad other purposes. A HELOC is typically flexible so the money can be withdrawn repaid and even reborrowed at any time; you just pay interest on the amount you owe he says.

Canadians can get up to 65 per cent of the value of their home through a HELOC Mr. Webster says. However the outstanding mortgage loan balance plus the HELOC generally can’t equal more than 80 per cent of the home’s value.

Mr. Weintraub says using funds from a HELOC makes the most sense when buying land rustic cottages or foreign places which can all be difficult to finance. “If you add a HELOC to your existing property you can write a cheque for the new place” he says.

Seek advice for a second home purchase

Taking an additional mortgage is a big decision for many Canadians. Mr. Weintraub suggests homeowners discuss their goals and options with their current lender and seek a second opinion from a mortgage broker. Also get some financial planning legal and accounting advice. For example if you borrow funds for a property that generates income you may get a tax benefit on the interest you pay.

It’s also possible to customize second mortgages Mr. Weintraub says such as when parents gift or loan funds to help their children buy a home when they get married. Rather than simply write a cheque the amount can come as a second charge on the property which he calls an interest-free “mom and dad second mortgage.” This allows the parents to protect the money if the marriage breaks down or even to recoup their funds when the home is sold.

Jonathan Hacohen a partner at Kormans LLP practicing real estate and commercial law says parents who give funds to their children for real estate should be aware of “extra complications.” If several family members contribute to such transactions they might have different tax exposures or expectations about being repaid for example.

“Get all the uncomfortableness out of the way” upfront he says and involve advisers to make sure things are properly structured.

Can you manage a second property?

Mr. Hacohen’s No. 1 rule for people buying secondary properties: “Do not sign a contract to buy real estate unless you are sure the money is going to be there to carry it.”

He has seen clients take what they consider to be “free money” from their principal residences and invest it in rural properties that then require massive upkeep.

“It comes at a price” he says of purchasing a second home. “Speak to professionals have a game plan and be sensible about it.”

People looking to buy a second property should be comfortable that their income level will be there to support it Mr. Webster adds based on factors such as their age and stage of life.

He suggests looking at the breakdown of borrowing options given related fees rates and rules.

“Typically you’re going to take the path that’s simplest cleanest and cheapest” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGZpbi5jb20vbmV3cy9yZWRsaW5pbmctZmxvb2Qtcmlzay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Racist Past a Flooded Future: Formerly Redlined Areas Have $107 Billion Worth of Homes Facing High Flood Risk ...,As a data journalist Lily is passionate about helping readers understand complex facets of the housing market.

Thankfully thrift stores exist. Do you have any tips on finding good pieces in either a brick and mortar or online secondhand store? — Julie Portland Ore.

Welcome to the age of re-commerce. It’s one of my favorite new terms.

Thrifting — indeed the whole secondhand market — is probably going to be one of the biggest fashion phenomena of the 2020s whether it takes the form of vintage shopping upcycling or swap meets. According to a report from GlobalData Retail and thredUP the secondhand clothing site the market will grow from $28 billion last year to $64 billion by 2024.

The drivers are multiple: the growing cost of both designer fashion and independent fashion in which companies can’t achieve any economies of scale; the environmental and human cost of fast fashion now broadly recognized (even by fast fashion companies themselves); and a new generation of consumers that finds creative and political satisfaction in reinventing old stuff.

It’s no accident that Depop the social secondhand shopping site has 27 million users in 147 countries — and 90 percent of them are part of Gen Z. Or that brands like Stella McCartney and Gucci are getting in on the game with their own shop-in-shop on TheRealReal.com.

As you point out though it can be hard to navigate this brave new world especially when you can’t feel or try on a used garment for yourself. So for some concrete suggestions I turned to two expert advisers: Brynn Heminway the founder of Display Copy a magazine dedicated to covering used fashion as if it were new fashion; and Sarah Sophie Flicker the artist and activist — and one of the most stylish proponents of vintage fashion I know. Here’s what they said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy90aGUtYmVzdC1zdC1wYXRyaWNrcy1kYXktZ2lmdHMtZm9yLXN0LXBhdHJpY2tzLWRheS0yMDIxLTE0MjA3MDE2L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy90aGUtYmVzdC1zdC1wYXRyaWNrcy1kYXktZ2lmdHMtZm9yLXN0LXBhdHJpY2tzLWRheS0yMDIxLTE0MjA3MDE2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best St Patrick's Day Gifts for St Patrick's Day 2021,"Add these gifts to your list (Picture: Getty)

But the VHS tape itself may be immortal. Today a robust marketplace exists virtually and in real life for this ephemera.

On Instagram sellers tout videos for sale like the 2003 Jerry Bruckheimer film ""Kangaroo Jack"" a comedy involving a beauty salon owner — played by Jerry O'Connell — and a kangaroo. Asking price $190. (O'Connell commented on the post from his personal account writing ""Hold steady. Price seems fair. It is a Classic."")

If $190 feels outrageous for a film about a kangaroo accidentally coming into money consider the price of a limited-edition copy of the 1989 Disney film ""The Little Mermaid"" which is listed on Etsy for $45000. The cover art for this hard-to-find copy is said to contain a male anatomical part drawn into a sea castle.

There is it turns out much demand for these old VHS tapes price tags notwithstanding and despite post-2006 advancements in technology. Driving the passionate collection of this form of media is the belief that VHS offers something that other types of media cannot.

""The general perception that people can essentially order whatever movie they want from home is flat-out wrong"" said Matthew Booth 47 the owner of Videodrome in Atlanta which sells VHS tapes in addition to its Blu-ray and DVD rental business.

Streaming Booth said was ""promised as a giant video store on the internet where a customer was only one click away from the exact film they were looking for.""

But the reality he said is that new releases are prohibitively expensive content is ""fractured"" between subscription services and movies operate in cycles often disappearing before people have the chance to watch them. In that sense the VHS tape offers something the current market cannot: a vast library of moving images that are unavailable anywhere else.

""Anything that you can think of is on VHS tape because you've got to think it was a revolutionary piece of the media"" said Josh Schafer 35 of Raleigh N.C. a founder and the editor-in-chief of Lunchmeat Magazine and LunchmeatVHS.com which are dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of VHS. ""It was a way for everyone to capture something and then put it out there.""

There is Schafer said ""just so much culture packed into VHS"" from reels depicting family gatherings to movies that just never made the jump to DVD. Schafer owns a few thousand tapes himself and his collection he said includes ""a little bit of everything"" including other people's home videos.

Michael Myerz 29 an experimental hip-hop artist in Atlanta who has a modest collection of VHS tapes finds the medium inspirational. Some of what Myerz seeks in his work he said is to replicate the sounds from ""some weird obscure movie on VHS I would have seen at my friend's house late at night after his parents were asleep."" He described his work as ""mid-lo-fi."" ""The quality feels raw but warm and full of flavor"" he said of VHS.

For collectors like April Bleakney 35 the owner and artist of Ape Made a fine art and screen-printing company in Cleveland nostalgia plays a significant role in collecting. Bleakney who has between 2400 to 2500 VHS tapes views them as a byway connecting her with the past. She inherited some of them from her grandmother a children's librarian with a vast collection.

Bleakney's VHS tapes are ""huge nostalgia"" she said for a child of the 1980s. ""I think we were the last to grow up without the internet cellphones or social media"" and clinging to the ""old analog ways"" she said feels ""very natural.""

""I think that people are nostalgic for the aura of the VHS era"" said Thomas Allen Harris 58 a creator of the television series ""Family Pictures USA"" and a senior lecturer in African American studies and film and media studies at Yale University.

""So many cultural touch points are rooted there"" Harris said of the 1980s. It was he believes ""a time when in some ways Americans knew who we were.""

The VHS tape of course had a life span. Developed in Japan in 1976 brought to the United States in 1977 and essentially discontinued in 2006 when films stopped converting to tape this medium brought all kinds of entertainment home.

Not only could film connoisseurs peruse the aisles of video stores on Friday nights but they could also compose home movies from the artful to the inane. In an era that preceded DVR technology they could tape episodes of television with the record function of the now-defunct VCR.

""In its heyday it was mass-produced and widely adopted"" Rodriguez said of the VHS tape. ""So if anyone — a movie studio an independent filmmaker a parent shooting their kid's first steps etc. — wanted a way to make moving images cheaply easily and show them to the world VHS had you covered.""

Some who are rooted in the world of VHS hope that what is currently an underground culture will become mainstream again. Record players Schafer pointed out have enjoyed a surge in popularity and it's possible that consumers can expect the same from the humble VCR.

But whether or not the VCR makes a complete comeback VHS enthusiasts agree that these tapes occupy an irreplaceable place in culture.

""It's like a time capsule"" Myerz said. ""The medium is like no other.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGNoZXpkZW1vY3JhdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9kYXJ0LXRocmVlLWdlbmVyYXRpb25zLXJ1bi1jYW5hbC1zdHJlZXQtZ2FsbGVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dart: Three generations run Canal Street Gallery - Mississippi's Best Community Newspaper | Mississippi's Best ...,"Dart: Three generations run Canal Street Gallery Published 12:00 pm Saturday March 13 2021

Sherry Hanson runs the Canal Street Gallery with her mom Stella Sharp and her daughter Sarah Hanson at 657 South Canal Street close to where the dart landed Friday.

Sherry Hanson said her mom is the owner and her daughter Sarah does the online and social media marketing.

For the last 45 years the antique and gift shop has moved from location to location Hanson said originally it was on Franklin Street. The shop features a collection of jewelry art silverware vintage clothing and fine china.

“We all contribute ideas. We are always trying to help each other” Hanson said. “Sometimes we think we can do it better than each other. It is wonderful to get to share it with each other.”

The gift shop was once a restaurant and still has a bar today. It was also the house of a drayman in 1852 Hanson said. A drayman was the FedEx delivery driver of the day.

She said the gift shop is typically only open by appointment or during tourist season which gives her time to focus on her massage therapy business. The gift shop sells items through Etsy as well.

Hanson said each person has a specialty. Hanson does the books and jewelry her daughter does the vintage clothing and her mom does all of the collectibles.

Hanson said she first moved to Natchez when she was three years old from Jackson. In college she went off to Dallas Texas to study Medical Anthropology at Southern Methodist University before coming back to Natchez.

Hanson said her mom daughter and she has different outside interests when they are not working at the gift shop. Her mom is semi-retired she said and her daughter works with costumes in the film industry.

“I’m a big advocate of natural healing” Hanson said. “Stress management is a true important part of our lives. I’m helping people to relax and be better. It is a niche I have found for myself.”"

Of course Mint is the real star of the show but JetBlue's economy product has seen some notable upgrades too. The airline is rolling out two slightly different neo models — one the regionally configured A321LD will offer 16 Mint suites while the upcoming A321LR will have 24 and will be used for flights between the U.S. and Europe.

You're likely to have a good experience regardless of where you land but as with all airliners some seats and suites are definitely more appealing than others. Let's see which you should pick whether you're traveling in Mint core or Even More Space.

Mint business class

Of course Mint is the real star of the show. This A321neo version offers eight rows of JetBlue suites arranged in a spacious and private 1-1 configuration.

Everyone gets direct access to the aisle and a sliding door for extra privacy — other passengers can see into your suite as they walk by but the door definitely helps to create a more peaceful environment especially with the seat in bed mode.

JetBlue's biz product has been completely redesigned. You'll find a more comfortable seat and additional storage plus a 17-inch HD display in Mint suites and a 22-inch screen in the carrier's slightly elevated Mint Studios available in the first row.

Which seats to pick

So where should you sit? If you can score a Mint Studio that's definitely your best pick. These bulkhead suites have significantly more space a special seat so a friend can join you for meals and two full windows. They'll also likely come along with an additional charge.

Studio passengers also get extra storage including a bulkhead closet along with larger 22-inch displays.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Behind the studios you'll find seven rows of ""regular"" suites. They're still quite posh and include sliding doors and a fair amount of space. They're all more or less identical with the exception of the final row which might be my last pick.

Which seats to avoid

At first suites in row 8 appear to be a solid pick since they do feel a bit more spacious — there are a few inches of open space behind rather than another seat.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The challenge is that 8A and 8F are located just in front of the economy cabin — the lavatory and self-serve snack and beverage bar to be more specific. There's no curtain dividing the two so I'd expect a bit of traffic and jealous looks from economy flyers coming up to sneak a peek as they grab themselves a drink.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Also of note suites at row 8 only include one window instead of two — you'll probably have it closed most of the flight to reduce screen glare anyway but it's still worth pointing out.

Even More Space

With all passengers boarding through the front of the plane at most airports you'll be getting up close and personal with JetBlue's latest business-class product even if you're seated in coach. In other words if you're feeling some buyer's remorse after passing up on a great Mint fare when you book it'll really hit after you walk past 8A.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

If you're traveling on a coach ticket Even More Space is definitely where it's at — you'll get at least three inches of additional legroom and even more in the exit and bulkhead rows. Mosaic elites can request Even More Space seats free of charge at the airport if there are still any left to reserve.

Which seats to pick

Normally I might suggest that bulkhead but that's not the case here as I'll explain in a moment. Instead I'd go with seats in row 14 the second emergency exit row. You'll have enough legroom to get in and out of the window seat without asking your fellow travelers to move and plenty of space to stretch out otherwise. Just note that window seats (14A and 14F) don't include armrests.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

And because there's a window exit in the row you won't have to worry about passengers in front reclining into your space. (Side note: don't pick a seat in row 13.)

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

From there I'd pick any other other Even More Space seat except for the bulkhead row or row 12 — seats there don't recline because of the exit in row 13.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

So to summarize in Even More Space row 14 is where it's at along with rows 10 and 11 plus 15 all of which also offer considerable space and full recline.

Which seats to avoid

Normally I might consider sitting in the bulkhead row to take advantage of extra legroom — just not on this plane.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

While the bulkhead is the place to be in Mint in the economy cabin the lavatory and snack bar are positioned just inches away from row 9 making this an especially high-traffic area.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The snack bar is another big concern — chips candy and drinks available free of charge so expect a steady stream of passengers coming up for a refreshment even on shorter flights (where ""to-go"" items might be especially in-demand).

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

These bulkhead seats also have slightly reduced width since the display folds away and down between each seat. Another reason to avoid sitting there.

As a reminder you'll also want to avoid the first exit row 13 along with row 12 in front since seats in both rows don't recline.

Core (economy)

Beyond Even More space you'll find 17 rows of regular economy which JetBlue calls ""Core."" The airline offers 32 inches of pitch — an inch of two more than you'll find on most competitors but less than the 34 inches the carrier once provided in economy.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

All seats include on-demand entertainment and power outlets — two per row in Core compared with three in each Even More Space row.

Which seats to pick

Regular economy starts at row 16 — while it's perhaps a bit annoying to be just inches away from passengers with extra legroom they're also a bit less likely to recline their seats all the way given that they have more space to begin with. Row 16 also has the benefit of having excellent window alignment — passengers in 16A and 16F have almost two full windows to enjoy.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

From there I'd pick any other row from 17 onward with the exception of rows 23 24 and 32 which I'll detail below.

Which seats to avoid

You may want to avoid rows 23 and 24 since there's a missing window. That's not to say you'll have two windows at every other row in economy but you definitely won't in this row. Personally I could work with row 24 — the only window you can see in row 23 is blocked slightly by the seat in front though and may not be visible at all with 22A or 22F reclined.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I'd also consider avoiding the last row of the cabin 32. Window alignment is fine and the seats do recline but you'll be just steps away from the bathroom and like the bulkhead it's an area where passengers are more likely to gather as they wait for the lav.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Bottom line

Overall I'd be happy flying in just about any seat on JetBlue's new A321neo — which the exception of the middle unless I were traveling with family members or friends.

Mint should obviously be your first pick but you'll generally pay a fair bit more to sit there. JetBlue's fares can be somewhat wonky at times though — I've noticed some flights where Mint is cheaper than coach on flights to leisure destinations especially in the Caribbean.

Keep the family moving

Life can get busy. From school drop-offs and footy practice to weekend trips and visits from the in-laws you need a family vehicle that keeps you moving. Enter the LDV G10 Executive

Designed with families in mind the LDV G10 Executive offers a touch of luxury you won’t find elsewhere. With plenty of space and tons of features for the whole crew you’ll always ride in comfort in this people pleaser.

Whether you need a little extra room or a lot the G10 has got you covered. Choose from 7 or 9 seats and a powerful 165 kW twin cam turbo charged petrol engine or gutsy yet economical 110kW turbo diesel.

LDV G10 Executive is a large 9 Seater People Mover

Through my new car brokerage company Car Business I get to see and drive a vast number of brands and models before they’re handed over to their new owners. Recently I had the opportunity to drive an LDV G10 Executive Wagon and here’s a quick snapshot

What is it? LDV G10 Executive is a 9-seat people mover with an extraordinarily wonderful use of the interior space. Obviously in the front row there are 2 vehy comfortable chairs for the driver and passenger. Second row and third row occupants get similar seats – 2 x ‘Captains Chairs’ while the 4th row can really only be used for car seats on the outer and a child in the middle position.

Competitors? Under $60000 there are really 4 competitors. Kia Carnival Honda Odyssey Volkswagen Multivan and Hyundai Imax. And then over $60000 you’re staring at the box-like Toyota Granvia (Replaced the Toyota Tarago) the very competent Hyundai Palisade and Mercedes-Benz V-Class.

Exterior

In anyones language it’s a big unit.

What can you really do with a 9-seater vehicle? Not too much as far as design is concerned. Boxy is the standard and if you really want to carry a cricket team around you’ll just have to put up with it

Interior

Plush – In my opionion and looking at value for money the LDV G10 Executive is one of the best. I love the Captain Chair concept for three rows and there’s room enough.

Storage With all seats in use there’s sufficient storage for a few umbrellas and that’s it. With the 4th row stowed you’ll probably fit enough luggage in soft bags for a weekend. Taking the tribe? Better get a trailer or on roof luggage pod.

In Summary

Nice touch – 3 rows of Captains Chairs

Front seats are very comfortable

Plenty of room

At least a netball team

If only this had a bit more safety tech. 3.5 Stars is pretty good for a 9-seat people mover

At A Glance I

Price: This one sold for $40790 Drive Away including metallic paint tow bar and dual dash cameras.

Engine/Transmission 2.0 Litre Turbo Charged Petrol Engine with 6-Speed ZF automatic transmission

Warranty/Service Disappointingly LDV only offer a 3-year/100000-kilometre warranty. Looking at the class leader Kia Carnival they’re providing 7-years unlimited kilometres. Serious question to be asked with a Chinese made vehicle as to why only 3.

Insurance I always get a comprehensive insurance quote from RACQ online. I use my personal details to get a number but you should use your own to get a comparison. Whenever I have a car insurance policy due I always get quotes from a number of companies. (RACQ Youi Budget Direct NRMA Elders Allianz Suncorp). Just because an insurance company advertises on the radio and television extensively doesn’t change the way you price compare.

When I check the price for the LDV Executive RACQ Online quote $491.86 with a $750 Excess.

Safety According to ANCAP

Load Area LDV doesn’t publish load area figures but I’ll try my best to give you some sense of what’s usable. With all rows in place the luggage area is nil. With the 4th row down you’ll arguably have enough room for some weekend luggage for 6 people. Best to inspect yourself.

Which Dealer?

Whenever I’m looking for a new car dealer I always search on Google.

In this case I’d search for “LDV Dealers” and then the city (Brisbane) or even the suburb I live in. In South-East Queensland for LDV here are the dealers I’d consider visiting. Google provides a star rating and I suggest that you look for dealers who score more than 4 stars in the Google rankings with at least 10 reviews and stay clear of dealers who don’t measure up to the Google standard – after all its real customers who are rating the dealers.

Basilashvili saved a match point in the final set of his quarterfinal to beat 20-times Grand Slam winner Federer who was playing his first tournament in 14 months at the Qatar Open after double knee surgery in 2020.

The 29-year-old who reached a career-high ranking of 16th in 2019 defeated Spain's former top-10 player Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6(5) 6-2 in the final Saturday.

""I had zero expectations for sure to win (the) tournament"" said the current world No. 42. ""But at the same time I was working a lot. I was feeling good on court.

""I was playing last half of year with a lot of stress in my body. I was not able to put 100% on court on any matches. This week I somehow found a way to deal with these stressful moments and very happy to get through.""

Bautista Agut defeated two top-10 players in Dominic Thiem and Andrey Rublev in consecutive matches but could not find a way past the aggressive and big-hitting Basilashvili.

The Georgian has now won his past four ATP Tour finals.

""I am somehow managing to play good in tougher conditions and tougher matches"" he told reporters. ""This tournament was one of the toughest ATP 250s I have ever seen probably.

""We had three Top 10 players. It is interesting why I am playing good in the big tournaments and big matches. (It is) surprising. At the same time (I am) happy.

""Even though he (Federer) came back after a long time for me to beat Roger my idol gave me a lot of confidence. That's why I think I played the next two matches a bit more relaxed.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qZXJzZXlldmVuaW5ncG9zdC5jb20vdWtzcG9ydC8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL25pa29sb3otYmFzaWxhc2h2aWxpLXJldHVybnMtdG8tZm9ybS1pbi1zdHlsZS1ieS13aW5uaW5nLXFhdGFyLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtb3Blbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nikoloz Basilashvili returns to form in style by winning Qatar ExxonMobil Open,"Nikoloz Basilashvili capped a remarkable return to form by lifting the Qatar ExxonMobil Open trophy.

The Georgian arrived in Doha having lost 14 of the 16 matches he had played since the tour resumed last summer with his only victories coming against opponents ranked outside the top 250.

Basilashvili’s poor form coincided with him being charged in his native country with domestic violence against his ex-wife and the legal process remains ongoing.

But the world number 42 has found the winning formula again on court this week starting with a first-round victory over John Millman.

His stand-out win of course came in the quarter-finals when he ended Roger Federer’s comeback event and he completed one of the best weeks of his career with a 7-6 (5) 6-2 victory over fifth seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Asked on court whether he imagined at the beginning of the week he would end it with the trophy Basilashvili said: “Definitely not. I’m super super happy. I had zero expectations for sure to win the tournament.”

The final of the Open 13 Provence in Marseille will be between top seed Daniil Medvedev and unseeded Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

Medvedev benefited from an injury sustained by Australian opponent Matt Ebden who retired trailing 6-4 3-0.

Herbert meanwhile is through to his first ATP singles final since 2019 after upsetting countryman Ugo Humbert 6-3 6-2.

Herbert who is better known as a doubles player has already beaten Kei Nishikori and Stefanos Tsitsipas this week and is bidding for a first singles title.

A drought was also ended in Chile as Argentinian Facundo Bagnis outlasted compatriot Federico Delbonis 7-5 6-3 to reach the final of the Chile Dove+Men Care Open – his first ATP Tour singles final in 13 years.

The report includes remarks from HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi who is also the president and CEO of Qatar Petroleum (QP) in addition to key information on Qatar’s energy sector targeted for US companies. The publication was sponsored by ConocoPhillips as Platinum Sponsor ExxonMobil as Gold Sponsor and Excelerate Energy as Silver Sponsor.

The US and Qatar have shared a rich history of partnership in the development and production of Qatar’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) fields. Through this close collaboration Qatar has become the number one LNG exporter worldwide in addition to being a major petrochemical producer.

American companies have played a leading role in Qatar’s rise with international oil company giants like ExxonMobil ConocoPhillips Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) and Excelerate Energy holding large stakes in Qatar’s energy sector.

Additionally American construction and technology companies like McDermott International Zachry Group and Honeywell have also had significant engagements in Qatar in the development of critical infrastructure projects.

Qatar and the US are expected to continue their close collaboration with the massive North Field Expansion (NFE) project which will expand Qatar’s LNG production. One of the most important aspects of the NFE is QP’s commitment to reducing its carbon emissions from its operations and recently released a strategy aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Underscoring Qatar’s interest to diversify its LNG holdings and the country’s close link with the US QP is also investing in the US’ oil and gas sector with a recent $10bn investment in a joint venture with ExxonMobil for the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas.

“Together the US and Qatar have become global LNG export leaders. Qatar Petroleum’s ambitions coupled with the country’s Tawteen initiative will create significant investment opportunities for American investors not just in exploration and production but throughout the entire supply chain” said USQBC managing director Mohamed Barakat.

Through Qatar’s commitment to diversify its economy create in-country value and attract additional American investors QP has introduced a supply chain localisation programme for the energy sector called. This localisation programme will provide hundreds of new investment opportunities and will promote the collaboration of suppliers and energy sector companies.

“Qatar and the US continue to reinforce their important business partnership in the energy sector. Not only will Qatar’s North Field Expansion project create many additional opportunities for US investors in the energy field but it will also serve as a multiplier across the spectrum of industry in Qatar’s rapidly diversifying economy” said USQBC Doha Office managing director Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad al-Thani.

The Qatar-US relationship has grown steadily and is now worth more than $200bn. The US has been a key partner in Qatar’s rapid economic growth and diversification with over 850 US businesses operating in the country.

The USQBC is the premier entity to facilitate trade and investment between the two countries and provides advisory and consulting services reports and publications and hosts events to build business relationships between the two countries. USQBC is dedicated to helping its American and Qatari members expand their business and encourage foreign investment and trade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RoZXBlbmluc3VsYXFhdGFyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0LzAzLzIwMjEvTmF0aW9uYWwtTXVzZXVtLW9mLVFhdGFyLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtcmVzZWFyY2gtZW50aXRpZXMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1zdHVkeS1vZi1EdWdvbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Museum of Qatar partners with research entities to support study of Dugong,"The Peninsula

Doha - In the lead up to the Seagrass Tales Dugongs Trails exhibition the National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) has collaborated with ExxonMobil Research Qatar (EMRQ) Qatar University the UNESCO Office for the Arab States of the Gulf and Yemen Texas A&M at Galveston and Ministry of Municipality and Environment to conduct research and a series of workshops on the Dugong – a sea mammal native to Qatar’s waters. Creating a Content Experts Committee the collaborating organisations conducted a series of workshops and collated key information that will be featured in the exhibition which will open later this month at NMOQ

The committee evaluated current research on the marine environment with a specific focus on the Dugong to assess the key themes that will be presented during the exhibition.

Seagrass Tales Dugongs Trails open from the March 30 to July 15 2021 in collaboration with EMRQ aims to introduce Dugongs to the public and present them as an important part of the Qatari Marine ecosystem and raise awareness on how to protect and preserve their environment.

In Qatar fossils of Dugongs dating back to the Miocene period (23 to 5 million years ago) were found in an area spanning from south Al-Kharayej to Al Eraiq. The Dugong has inhabited Qatari waters for more than 7500 years where herds of between 600 to 700 Dugongs can be found – the biggest herds ever recorded in the world.

After Australia the Arabian Gulf is home to the world’s second-largest population of the large long-living grass-eating sea creatures. Dugongs face extinction due to fishing activities vessel strikes and environmental pollution.

The joint research efforts by the collaborating entities have focused specifically on the Arabian Gulf Dugong and the conservation initiatives to protect their habitat. The sea mammal tends to remain solitary or in small groups usually a mother and a calf but have been seen in large herds during breeding. However in the Arabian Gulf Dugongs tend to gather in larger groups.

The first largest single Dugong group ever recorded in the world – 674 individuals – was observed between Qatar and Bahrain in 1986. Later in 2020 another but larger group of 840 Dugongs was recorded.

Since 2014 EMRQ and its partners have been collecting Dugong samples mainly from the west coast of Qatar and studying these fascinating and vulnerable marine mammals. Through the research scientists aim to obtain greater insights into why the usually solitary sea mammal can be found in large gatherings in the Arabian.

In addition scientists are also studying pollutants and their impact on seagrass and marine waters which form part of the Dugong’s natural habitat.

Lina Patmali Exhibitions Researcher NMoQ said: “In preparation for Seagrass Tales Dugongs Trails NMoQ has worked closely with the scientists as well as the local community to promote the study of these sea mammals that form a special part of Qatar’s natural history. Scientific research is vital to protecting Dugongs and their habitat.

However as individuals and a collective we can also adjust our daily habits to preserve their habitat.

“We are grateful that we were able to collaborate with these entities and their scientists and contribute their work even in a small way. The exhibition was shaped by their expertise and their experience.

He is so strong that he in fact once made Paul Wight crap his pants after taking an F5.

Brock Lesnar and Paul Wight formerly known in WWE as The Big Show wrestled each other quite a lot during Brock Lesnar's first run in WWE.

Having their first major match at the Survivor Series in 2002 live in Madison Square Garden Brock Lesnar and Paul Wight would wrestle each other in some form or fashion four more times on pay-per-view once on a WWE Network special and one time on SmackDown which would see both men break the ring after a gigantic superplex.

Recently during an appearance on Renee Paquette’s Oral Sessions podcast Paul Wight shared a story about taking an F5 from Brock Lesnar during a South African tour and accidentally pooping his pants. When Brock Lesnar heard about this he naturally stepped on Wight’s stomach perhaps trying to get more to come out of the giant.

“He gave me an F5 in South Africa and I had some bad food and I hit that mat and it came out. He covers me and is like 'Did you shit?' 'Yeah.' [Wight imitates Brock laughing]. I'm laying in the ring after the F5 and he steps on my stomach like he's trying to get more to come out. I'm like 'Get the fuck away from me.' The finish was usually I pull Paul [Heyman] out of the ring carrying him over my shoulder and go to the back. This night I wasn't doing it. Paul is like 'You gonna carry me to the back?' 'No I shit myself.' 'I can't hear you.' 'I SHIT MYSELF!' 'Oh okay. Are you alright?'”

That comedic moment aside Paul Wight credits his 2002 rivalry with Brock Lesnar as the story that turned his career around in WWE.

“Brock is the one who turned my career around in WWE. I had a lot of heat and they asked Brock who he wanted to work with and he said 'I'll work with the giant. Dumbass tells me how good he is.' We had the stretcher match and then we were off and running.”

Now Paul Wight is signed to AEW and will mostly be at the commentary booth alongside Tony Schiavone. However he is hoping to turn heel in the promotion and work with Darby Allin. You can learn more about that at this link.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But soon enough a much-anticipated box from Paris arrived and Lizzo was smiling. “She just lit up when she tried on the first dress and when she tried on the second one she lit up again” Nelson says of the custom designs created by Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing. “She told me she wanted to look like a legend and she wanted to look sexy. I knew I wanted to make a Balmain moment happen and from there Olivier and I talked about legends like Diana Ross and Cher. I wanted it to feel classic and a bit familiar but new.”

Lizzo’s pair of Grammys looks — a strapless mint-green dress and a pink asymmetrical one-shoulder gown both crafted in an Italian Lurex that resembles liquid metal — can be summed up in four words says Rousteing: “Very Parisian. Very Balmain” he tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I really wanted [to] channel the unique mastery that Pierre Balmain brought to Parisian post-war couture – his ‘New French Style’ – with that incredible draping and tailoring that this house has always been known for … [while] the draping and the ruffles obviously riff on some of the strongest most glamorous mid-century looks of this house.”

Nelson has worked with Lizzo who will present the best new artist award at Sunday night’s Grammys for roughly two years. “She’s such a beautiful woman and she really loves to look sexy – and in our world of fashion a lot of people don’t know how to do that justice” he says. “Lizzo is a sexy woman who wants to feel sexy and that made the shape of what we created really important.”

Rousteing adds that he was inspired by women Pierre Balmain used to dress for red-carpet events “those legendary Cinecittà and French actresses who wanted something extra for the Cannes red carpet or the great European singers who needed a fantastic look for a special Olympia concert” he explains. “And so knowing that – really what other kind of style could be more perfect for Lizzo?”

Jewels by Bulgari and Stuart Weitzman shoes embellished with crystals by Los Angeles-based Vincent Michael Braccia (who goes by the name The Disco Daddy and worked on the sparkling bodysuit and boots Lizzo wore at the 2020 Grammys) complete the look.

Says Nelson “She’ll wear a diamond Serpenti necklace with a tassel of diamonds that hangs from the snake’s tail – it feels a little disco but fit for a queen” he notes. “I wanted to do something that would convey that Lizzo is a rock star but also would rock Bulgari’s world a little bit.” Lizzo’s bulgari Serpenti high jewelry necklace in white gold is set with one pear-shaped 1.15 carat brilliant-cut diamond 37 pear-cut diamonds and pavé diamonds. The star also wore a Bulgari Serpenti high-jewelry bracelet Serpenti earrings in white gold and diamonds and other pieces (totaling 157 carats) by the Italian house.

Choosing the designer for Lizzo’s Grammys look ultimately was the easiest part of the equation Nelson adds especially after the awards event was delayed from its original Jan. 31 broadcast date due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown mandates in Los Angeles. “Olivier always keeps things fresh and exciting and I knew this Lizzo moment was coming” Nelson says. “Lizzo is a queen and everyone wants to dress her but as long as Balmain had the time to make sure everything was perfect I knew it was the right choice.”

For Rousteing the feeling was mutual. “OK really – who doesn’t love Lizzo?” he says. “That talent voice and power of her message. She is definitely an inspiration for me – every step song and statement she makes reflects the fact that she is a strong talented woman whose positive energy and messages are exactly what every one of us needs right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2p1c3Rpbi10aG9tYXMtbGl2ZXMtZWRnZS1yYWxsaWVzLXdpbi1wbGF5ZXJzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC80Njk1NTg4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunday's golf: Justin Thomas lives on edge rallies to win Players Championship,"Doug Ferguson

Associated Press

Ponte Vedra Beach Fla. — Justin Thomas found the right time for a near-perfect performance to put a rough start to the year behind him rallying from three shots behind with bold play to close with a 4-under 68 and win The Players Championship on Sunday.

Thomas becomes only the fourth player to win a major The Players Championship the FedEx Cup and a World Golf Championship and it couldn’t have come at a better time.

He called it as good as he has ever played tee-to-green and he needed it to outlast Lee Westwood a hard-luck runner-up for the second straight week. Westwood birdied the final hole for a 72 to finish one shot behind.

Thomas began the year with a barely audible anti-gay slur under his breath after missing a short putt. That led to one corporate sponsor dropping him and another giving him a public reprimand. The one time he had a chance to win he learned his grandfather died before the final round of the Phoenix Open.

He was shaken until Sunday at the TPC Sawgrass where he took on every shot and delivered a gem.

Thomas went birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie around the turn and put away Westwood for good with a pair of lag putts from 50 feet — one for birdie on the par-5 16th to take the lead another on the island-green 17th for a par.

Thomas still had one more shot before he was in the clear. He took on the water framing the left side of the 18th fairway the ball moving right-to-left and bouncing straight off the crown of the first cut safely in the fairway.

His approach landed on the fringe — the first green he missed all day — leaving a simple two-putt for par and the 14th victory of his PGA Tour career. He returns to No. 2 in the world.

“I fought so hard today” Thomas said. “It’s probably one of the best rounds of my life tee-to-green. I’ve seen some crazy stuff happen on TV in the past and I’m glad to be on this side of it.”

All the crazy stuff came early.

Bryson DeChambeau coming off a win last week at Bay Hill topped an iron off the tee on the par-4 fourth hole that went only about 140 yards until it plunked into the water. From 237 yards on a forward tee to a green protected by water he hit a slice with a 5-iron some 40 yards right of the green.

“Dude! I don’t know what happened!” he said to his caddie. “I’ve never done that before.”

DeChambeau made double bogey and was scratching the rest of the way to stay in the game. He still had a chance with an eagle on the 16th hole to get within two but when Thomas made par on the 17th his chances were about over. DeChambeau shot 71 and tied for third with Brian Harman who had a 69 and played the final 12 holes without a bogey.

The 47-year-old Westwood hit his tee shot into the water on the fourth hole and had to make an 8-footer to save bogey. He hit his approach out of the pine straw that clipped two branches and found water on the par-5 second hole to make bogey.

He was never far away from the lead and Westwood regained a share of the lead with an 8-foot birdie putt on the 14th.

His chances began to slip away with his second shot into the par-5 16th. It hit a big oak and dropped into the sand and his third shot found a bunker in front of the green. Instead of matching birdies with Thomas who was in the group ahead Westwood had to scramble for par to stay one behind.

And on the 17th his long birdie attempt rolled 7 feet by the hole. He faced another crucial par putt and he finally missed.

Thomas was outside the cut line after nine holes on Friday. He followed that with a 64 on Saturday to get in the mix and he finished off in style to pick up $2.7 million with a win against the strongest and deepest field in golf.

It wrapped up a year in which the PGA Tour shut down after one round of The Players a year ago. Thomas was among those serving on the Player Advisory Council that was a part in getting golf back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

He looked at the gold trophy with Commissioner Jay Monahan to soak in how far golf had come in a year. For Thomas he came a long way in three months.

European Tour

Antoine Rozner of France holed a 60-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 2-under 69 and a one-shot victory in the Qatar Masters moving him high enough in the world ranking to qualify for the World Golf Championship in Texas in two weeks.

Rozner was tied for the lead with Guido Migliozzi who had closed with a 65 at Education City Golf Club when his approach in the 18th left him far enough away that his best hope appeared to be two putts for par and a playoff. Instead he made the double-breaking putt for his second European Tour victory in 29 events.

Rozner finished at 8-under 276.

Darren Fichardt of South Africa and Gaganjeet Bhullar of India also made birdie on the 18th that allowed them to join Migliozzi in a tie for second.

Johnson 36 also chose not to compete for the United States when golf returned to the Olympics for the first time in 112 years in Rio de Janiero Brazil in 2016.

The World No.1 has made the call based on his upcoming PGA Tour schedule which sees the Olympic tournament fall just two weeks before the start of the FedEx Cup Playoffs where Johnson will bid to defend his FedEx Cup title.

The Olympic tournament also falls two weeks after The Open at Royal St George's and one week before the WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational.

""It's right in the middle of a big stretch of golf for me so that was the reason I was kind of waffling on it a little bit"" said Johnson speaking from this week's Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass.

""It's a lot of traveling at a time where it's important for me to feel like I'm focusing playing on the PGA Tour.""

Johnson then added that he would ""definitely"" have considered playing in the Olympics had there been more space in his schedule.

Seemingly fair points but not in the eyes of one-time PGA Tour winner Chamblee who vented fury at Johnson's decision.

He also launched a sly dig at Johnson's commitment to play in the Saudi International earlier this season - a tournament the American would go on to win for a second time in three years on the European Tour.

Johnson pointed out that the British Open is July 15-18 at Royal St. George’s in England which is 11 day before the men’s competition in the Olympics is scheduled to begin at Kasumigaseki Country Club 35 miles north of Tokyo.

Four days after the men’s competition ends in Japan the World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational begins in Memphis.

Then the FedEx Cup Playoffs begin two weeks after Memphis.

“I think if there was a little more time (between tournaments) especially if you weren’t trying to fly right from Tokyo to Memphis and play a WGC yeah I obviously definitely would have thought about it a lot more” Johnson said.

The top 15 players in the Olympic Golf Rankings the day after the U.S. Open ends in June are eligible for the Olympics. A country’s representation is limited to four players. The field will be set at 60 players.

As for Johnson’s play in the Players he’s shot 73-70-73 and stands well down on the leaderboard. In Saturday’s third round his tee shot on the par-3 17th hit the flagstick on the fly and rolled into the water.

It took two acquisitions one in 2002 by Royal Bank of Scotland Group and the second by Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) in 2019 and a series of expansion projects for WorldPay to emerge among the top three largest payment processing companies in the world.

The firm now has a 42 percent market share in the UK payment transactions and a wide reach into online transactions through its global e-commerce division.

Guarantee Trust Bank (GTBank) Nigeria’s fifth-largest bank by customer deposits is attempting to replicate the success of WorldPay in Nigeria and Africa. The bank’s playbook will be borne and perfected by HabariPay a fintech company it is planning to deploy later this year.

Alongside banks like Access Bank and Sterling Bank GTBank had applied for a holding company (Holdco) structure from the Central Bank of Nigeria. In November 2020 the banks announced they have been granted an approval-in-principle (AIP) by the CBN. All that is left is formal approval.

An AIP usually takes six months. But GTBank is not waiting until the approval arrives in the mail before it sets out. The bank is currently shopping for fintech talents and is quick to inform potential candidates about the mission to make HabariPay a fintech unicorn.

Habari 1.0

A search on the Google Store would not come up with Habari Pay but just Habari. It is most likely that the bank intends to replace the existing Habari product with the Habari Pay.

Nonetheless Habari possibly adapted from the Swahili word that translates to ‘information’ was unveiled by GTBank 0n 23 November 2018 at an elaborate event attended by popular personalities in entertainment.

Habari was created as a platform to offer users direct access to the largest catalogue of local and foreign music online a seamless shopping experience and an exciting way to connect with friends amongst other features.

Habari was among other things GTBank’s most ambitious effort at reinventing itself.

Segun Agbaje CEO of the bank described the platform as the bank’s way of reimagining the role of banking.

“By reimagining the role of banking and driving innovation in how we serve customers we have built a platform that is less about us as a bank and more about the customers and everything they need to enable their lifestyle” Agbaje said at the time.

Habari was the first mobile in Nigeria created by a financial institution that focuses on enabling people’s needs and lifestyles rather than providing a limited bouquet of banking products. But the jury is still out on how much of a success that Habari has been. Nigeria’s e-commerce space continues to be dominated by the likes of Jumia Konga Jiji and new entrants such as Flutterwave and Paystack.

Some experts have said the reason for Habari performing below expectation may have more to do with a traditional banking culture that does not prioritise the customer. But the bank would likely argue that it was constrained by lack of holding company structure licence to deploy as many resources as it would have desired to compete in the market.

It is also possible the bank may have been distracted by the too many services it needed to keep running. It operates GTPay a payments gateway similar to Paystack; GTCollections a payments aggregator; QuickCredit a digital lending platform; and Habari an e-commerce super-app.

Habari 2.0

Habari Pay offers GTBank an opportunity to get back on track to compete in the payment market.

“Nigerian banks need to be retooled and reinvented and fast” Aloy Chife managing partner and CEO SAANA Capital a venture capital and high-impact firm said.

“The era of monopoly trusts mollycoddled by the regulator may be fast approaching its expiration date (Nigeria is broke and there’s only so much paper the regulator can print after all)” Chife said.

He highlighted two lessons from the US regulator the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) first in 2019 when it opened up the core business of banking – receiving deposits paying checks lending money – to fintech. This move meant that any fintech firm was free to venture into any of the banking areas. Secondly in 2020 the OCC authorised banks to open custodial services for crypto assets.

The CBN is expected to give final approval for the Holdco structure by the second quarter of 2021 enabling GTBank to deploy Habari Pay. GTBank is promising to prioritise agility with Habari Pay: “We fail fast we invest faster and we drive value for customers.”

Chife said the deployment of Habari Pay may signal a new era of a recalibration by banks that want to become technology companies.

“A bank that wants to become a financial technology company must completely reinvent itself” Chife said.

In the past banks have prided themselves on being among the first financial institutions in Africa to deploy digital banking services to customers. They often point to Kenya where the banks delayed taking the initiative only to see their lunch taken away by a telecom operator in Safaricom.

However while many of them invested heavily in digital technology less priority was given to improving customer service. Many banks got overwhelmed deploying too many services than they were able to handle.

However Habari Pay gives GTBank the opportunity to house all its digital banking services on one platform and deploy commensurate human resources to manage them efficiently. It also allows the bank to truly inculcate the DNA – agility quick decision-making innovativeness – of a startup and truly prioritise the evolving needs of customers.

GTbank would need to stay the course long enough – running a tech startup is a long-term venture that requires patient capital – and be more open to collaboration to replicate the feat of WorldPay in Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of lyrical content throughout his discography boils down to philosophically speculative wonderment at the infinite beauty of the cosmos. What can essentially be stargazing is easily universalized no principled positions necessary. Yet the more Jacob Buczarski looks to the stars the more his poetic ruminations reflect back to home culminating in his most critically scathing album yet: Solar Paroxysm.

Buczarski has made a career of musically embodying sheer awe. Alternately a lone desperate figure screaming into the cosmic void and the gloriously chaotic cosmos itself. Part of what made last year’s Wanderers collaboration with Spectral Lore so fresh and exciting was the new twist on this approach—exploring the more human and spiritual aspects of each planet in our own solar system. In fact the aggression and urgency of “Mars (The Warrior)” now feels like a foreshadowing of Solar Paroxysm. Ruminating on the horrific human propensity for organized violence and the correspondent distillation of Mare Cognitum’s most ruthless musical tendencies make for one hell of a primer for this new album.

Immediately we get down to business and back to the basics that made a name for Mare Cognitum: the epic riffs. “Antaresian” soars immediately into a beautiful atmospheric melody with a relentless energy. Bold interplay between elegantly arcing tremolos and pummeling barrages build the dramatic mood. With rapid cymbal work and explosive riffs “Frozen Star Divinization” somehow bursts with even more intensity than the first track like everything we’ve ever heard was just a warm up. “Terra Requiem” is the midpoint and a surprising interruption. As the pounding percussion comes in the album grinds down to a crawl. In the heat of the moment hot on the heels of the furious first two tracks it feels like a bit of a trudge. On its own legs though or taken as blackened doom in the vein of Mizmor the song rightfully rips us away from the ascendant mood. The back and forth between pummeling kicks and steady beats create a grand sweeping sense of tragedy. The longest and most complex track is the closer “Ataraxia Tunnels” a true showcase of Buczarski’s phenomenal songwriting. The melodic riff shines just gentle enough to be delightfully catchy but still thrillingly furious. Each component works together toward the solemn air. The tremolo soars over a haunting synthesized chorus undergirded by a heavy foundation of distortion. The melody bends down to meet the rhythmic line twisting together before climbing in steps toward an even greater height.

The story of the album begins with a Mare Cognitum classic: spiritual attunement to the infinite cosmos. “Antaresian” is a post-human utopian tale of an advanced people in a different galaxy united in their understanding of the universe gracefully facing the inevitable death of their binary suns and confident of the immortal impact of their achievements. An entirely alien story as he goes on to demonstrate but perhaps an inspiring one. This beautiful dream contrasts sharply with “Terra Requiem” a concise and straightforward poem on the vanity and inevitable downfall of humanity. “So great is the debt we have incurred / So too will we wilt and fade into dust … And the earth will forget our name.”

The dramatic conclusion further complicates the juxtaposition between our doom and the first act’s utopia. We could have built any future imaginable but instead we choke on the fumes of failure. With the expansive luminary power of the human brain to imagine futures free of scarcity and fear how have we not yet learned to be better? And at this point is it still possible? As Buczarski ponders the wasted potential of humanity’s imagination his metaphors reach Bryan Funck-level philosophizing. “Reduction of wisdom into basest impulse / The faintest glimpse of the reflections remain / The visage presenting itself as a wretched beast / A gruesome debasement of vigilance released … Bastardized abomination reveling in self-destruction.” The resolution of the album is not the outright defeat of this abomination but rather its obsolescence. As everything slowly fades out the final words describe a tranquil departure. Is this simply death? Or the post-human Antaresian ascendance? The room for interpretation is slim and hope barely seems to be in the question. Yet like any provocative science fiction saga one need not have a detailed map explaining each verse to appreciate the journey.

Alexandra Ford English is about to be the first female member of the Ford family elected to the board of the automaker that the men in her family have run since 1903.

Ford English is the 33-year-old daughter of William Clay Ford Jr. the company’s executive chairman. Also poised to join the board is Henry Ford III 40 son of current director Edsel Ford II who is retiring from that position. The cousins are the first great-great-grandchildren of company founder Henry Ford to be board members.

The two family members still must be elected by shareholders but there’s little chance they won’t be. The Ford (F) family has controlled the majority of Ford (F) stock voting shares since it went public in 1956.

A Ford family member has been chairman CEO or president of the company for all but nearly 20 years of its 118-year history. And there has always been at least one and more often two Ford men serving on the board.

Women members of the Ford family have served as executives at the company and women from outside the family have served on its board including three currently. “I am pleased and proud that we have a new generation of Ford family leaders who believe in serving the company and ensuring it remains a successful and positive force in the world for years to come” said Bill Ford.

The move was also praised by the United Auto Workers union which represents hourly US workers at the company. “While UAW members will always have differences at the table with management there is certainty in knowing that there are members of the board whose corporate decisions are informed by their history not just for short-term performance but in the interest of the company’s long-term future as well” said the union.

English Ford who joined Ford in 2017 has been involved in the company’s push to move toward electric and autonomous vehicles. She is currently a director of corporate strategy at the company responsible for enterprise connectivity and digital network strategic plans.

Before that she was director of market and operations for Ford’s separate autonomous vehicles unit and responsible for the successful deployment and operations of Ford’s autonomous vehicle business in Miami Florida Austin Texas and Washington DC. She also is Ford’s representative on the board of electric truck maker Rivian in which it has a stake.

Time for the younger generation to step up.

Assuring that relatives carry on the tradition of their namesake two great-great grandchildren of Henry Ford founder of Ford Motor Co. plan to join the company's board of directors.

Alexandra Ford English 33 the daughter of Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford and Henry Ford III 40 the son of Edsel B. Ford II have been nominated to stand for election to the company’s board of directors at its annual meeting of shareholders on May 13 the company said in a press release Friday.

""Their nominations to the board continue the Ford family’s nearly 118 years of active involvement with and stewardship of the company"" the Dearborn-based auto giant said.

The move comes as Edsel B. Ford II son of the Henry Ford II aka ""Hank the Deuce"" plans to retire from the board of directors in May after 33 years. Ford 72 currently is on the board’s Finance Committee and Sustainability and Innovation Committee.

Ford English is currently a director in Corporate Strategy at Ford responsible for enterprise connectivity and digital network strategic plans according to the release. Before that she was director of market and operations for Ford Autonomous Vehicles and responsible for the deployment and operations of Ford’s autonomous vehicle business in Miami Austin and Washington D.C.

She is also Ford’s representative to the board of directors of Rivian the electric carmaker in which Ford owns equity Before joining Ford in 2017 she ran merchandising divisions for Tory Burch in New York and Gap Inc. in San Francisco. She has a bachelor’s degree from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Henry Ford III 40 is a director in Ford Investor Relations. Since joining the company in 2006 he has held positions in labor relations purchasing marketing sales and corporate strategy. He was part of the team that negotiated the 2008 master labor agreement with the UAW.

He also played a role launching the latest Ford GT the company said. He has a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.

“Henry and Alexandra are both passionate and capable young business leaders who care deeply about Ford Motor Company and the welfare of our customers employees dealers and shareholders” Bill Ford said in a statement “I am pleased and proud that we have a new generation of Ford family leaders who believe in serving the company and ensuring it remains a successful and positive force in the world for years to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9mb3JkLWZhbWlseS1zLWZpZnRoLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tdG8tdGFrZS1zZWF0cy1vbi1jYXJtYWtlci1zLWJvYXJkLTExNjE1NjAxMjkxNjcxLmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9uZXdzL2ZvcmQtZmFtaWx5LXMtZmlmdGgtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi10by10YWtlLXNlYXRzLW9uLWNhcm1ha2VyLXMtYm9hcmQvYW1wLTExNjE1NjAxMjkxNjcxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford family’s fifth generation to take seats on carmaker’s board | Mint,"Ford Motor Co. is elevating two of founder Henry Ford’s great-great grandchildren to its board continuing the family’s control over the industrial dynasty he created nearly 118 years ago.

Alexandra Ford English 33 who works in corporate strategy at the company and Henry Ford III 40 who works in investor relations were nominated to stand for election to the board at Ford’s annual meeting in May the company said Friday. Ford English who also sits on the board of Rivian Automotive Inc. is the daughter of Executive Chairman Bill Ford 63 and Ford III is the son of Edsel Ford II 72 who is retiring as a company director after 33 years.

Their ascension marks a coming of age for the Ford family’s fifth generation as the auto industry undergoes a massive transformation to electric and autonomous cars with new players like Tesla Inc. and Rivian staking claims to the future of transportation. For all but 20 of its years Ford has been led by a family member. Corporate governance experts say that has made the company too insular and backward looking while supporters argue it has provided stability that helped Ford avoid the bankruptcies that befell its Detroit rivals during the Great Recession of 2009.

“We didn’t go bankrupt when our competitors did and from a shareholder’s standpoint that kind of counts for a lot"" Bill Ford said in an interview. “The family has always been quick to act even when it hurts their interest like stopping the dividend to help the company. The less tangible value is that it humanizes us and makes us more than just a paycheck.""

Shares Gain

Ford shares have risen 52% this year amid plans by the automaker to invest $29 billion in electric and self-driving vehicles by 2025 and climbed as much as 4.7% to $13.41 Friday in New York on pace for the highest price in almost five years. The company continues to work to reverse its fortunes in the traditional automotive business with new models that include the electric Mustang Mach-E and the revival of the Bronco sport utility vehicle.

And while new Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley is winning praise on Wall Street the Ford family remains firmly in control of the company through a special class of stock that gives them 40% voting power. Some investors have long complained that super-voting stock weighs down the value of publicly traded companies and gives founding families sometimes unwarranted control.

“This is the reason we don’t have monarchies running things anymore"" said Nell Minow vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors a shareholder advisory firm. “Every time you put somebody on the board you’re saying to your shareholders and your customers this is the best person in the world for this spot not the best person in the family.""

The United Auto Workers praised the latest elevation of Ford family members as directors.

“In an age of short-term Wall Street-focused management decisions Ford Motor Company has benefited from the stability and continuity of the Ford family’s involvement"" UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement.

Autonomous Vehicles

Ford English previously worked in the company’s autonomous-vehicle operations and now has a front-row seat on an electric-vehicle startup at Rivian in which Ford has a significant ownership stake. Prior to joining Ford in 2017 she ran merchandising divisions of Tory Burch in New York and the Gap Inc. in San Francisco. She has a bachelor’s degree from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Ford III has worked in labor relations helping to craft the 2008 contract with the UAW as well as in purchasing corporate strategy and marketing with the company’s racing operations. Before joining the company in 2006 he taught middle school and high school math and history. He has a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bill Ford said they each bring hands-on experience in the emerging technologies that are profoundly changing the auto industry.

“The world we’re heading into very much plays to their strengths"" he said. “And their understanding of that world is perhaps greater than some of our older or less-involved board members.""

Ford also said continuing the family’s involvement strengthens the company for the long term.

“If we didn’t have exceptionally qualified and caring family members it would all have stopped with me"" he said. “But very fortunately we have two of those candidates in Henry and Alexandra and it makes me feel -- as a father an uncle and an executive chairman -- very good about our future.""

The streamer will likely start with original movies but is also exploring episodic TV shows and is speaking with potential advertisers about partnerships the report states.

Fox Corp. acquired Tubi for $440 million last March in an attempt to get in on the streaming wars. Before the acquisition Fox didn’t have its own streaming offering. Fox said at the time it planned to offer a large number of its older shows and movies to Tubi subscribers for free as well as some sports programming.

Sometime around 1659 it is reported that Pequots sold the small island Nonequasset off Bissell Cove in North Kingstown to Samuel Gorton and Randall Holden. Gorton is known as the founder of Warwick.

The island had a multitude of native names but today it is known as Fox Island.

Presently the entire Island is owned by a Rhode Island corporation controlled by venture capitalist David Mixer.

The island is actually part of North Kingstown. According to town tax records Mixer's company purchased the island in 2000 for just $725000 -- today the entire island the main house and a series of other structures are appraised for just over $1.7 million

Mixer made tens of millions as a founding partner at Columbia Capital in the 1990s — a venture capital firm focused on the communications industry which now claims to have raised $4.8 billion. At Columbia he was a partner in the firm with now-U.S. Senator Mark Warner. Previous to his tenure at Columbia he worked for the Providence-Journal Corporation. Efforts to reach Mixer were unsuccessful.

Later he was a co-founder of Point Judith Capital along with now U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.

Point Judith web records show Mixer and Raimondo remained partners for nearly a decade until Raimondo ran for Rhode Island General Treasurer in 2010.

According to Crunchbase ""Dave also founded Rex Capital an early-stage venture capital firm focused on technology investments. In his career he has been a member of the investment committee for 77 investments for an aggregate of over $400 million invested and in excess of $1 billion returned. Dave is currently serving as a mentor to investors and entrepreneurs."" Rex Capital located in Providence is managing over $800 million according to WallMine.com.

An Incomplete History

The island’s history has many gaps but also some intriguing history.

""In 1880 Rev. William Pendleton Chapman the pastor at Quidnessett Church used the island as a setting for one of the many children’s books he wrote. In Budd Boyd’s Triumph: The Boy Firm of Fox Island he spun adventurous tales of two boys who lived in an abandoned house on the island and sailed Narragansett Bay in their boat Sea Witch surviving by selling fish and clams to locals and taking out sailing parties. Their stories consisted of brushes with jewel thieves and jails” wrote the South County Independent in 2010.

Fox Island is just one of a series of islands across the bay with rich and mysterious histories. See the other stories of RI's islands below.

Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story misidentified Bissel Cove's location - it is in North Kingstown.

Firefly written and directed by Joss Whedon was a space Western that aired for just one season in the fall of 2002.

Although Fox canceled the TV show before the first season had even wrapped the science fiction drama was a critical success. It won numerous awards including an Emmy Award and multiple Saturn Awards and it also launched an entire media franchise (including the 2005 blockbuster film Serenity).

The show was prized for its complex storylines and massive cast and it was easy to miss small details and Easter eggs that Whedon liked to hide in each episode. That includes a major science fiction reference buried in Firefly‘s very first episode.

‘Firefly’ was set in the year 2517

Firefly follows the lives of space pioneers who have survived an intergalactic civil war. The character Derrial Book played by actor Ron Glass often provides recaps and explanatory narratives at the start of each episode. At the start of episode two he explains the premise of Firefly. “After the Earth was used up we found a new solar system and hundreds of new Earths were terraformed and colonized” the character says as reported in The Mary Sue.

The planets controlled by the United States and China form a new government known as the Alliance but some planets refused to join the new government and a civil war broke out. “After the war many of the Independents who had fought and lost drifted to the edges of the system far from Alliance control” says Book. “Out here people struggle to get by with the most basic technologies. A ship would bring you work. A gun would help you keep it. A captain’s goal was simple: Find a crew. Find a job. Keep flying.”

The show was canceled before its first season was even finished

Firefly encapsulated numerous worlds and dozens of characters and it would have taken several seasons to fully tell their stories. “I designed this world and these characters in this ensemble to sustain seven years’ worth [of stories]” says Whedon in an interview published by Digital Spy. However the entire series was shut down by Fox before the first season was done airing.

“Fox had touted Firefly for its 2002 season as a show that could potentially fill the sci-fi gap in its sked created by the end of the aging X-Files franchise” explained Variety at the time. “But just 11 of the 14 Firefly episodes produced made it to air. Interrupted by baseball and dropped for November sweeps (much to Whedon’s chagrin) the show never caught on with a big enough audience to justify its 8 p.m. Friday slot.”

However AV Club lays some of the blame for Firefly‘s cancellation on Fox itself. “By airing the episodes out of order withholding the pilot until months after the series launched sticking the show with a difficult time slot limiting network advertising support and canceling the show partway through its initial run Fox publicly declared that Firefly was a risk not worth taking” the site argues.

With only one season to watch fans have poured over every detail. And they’ve uncovered some surprising Easter eggs hidden by Whedon.

The pilot of ‘Firefly’ has a hidden mention of another major science fiction franchise

In the pilot of Firefly audiences see a battle between those who are loyal to the Alliance and those who are fighting for independence. In one scene you see captain Malcolm “Mal” Reynolds (played by Nathan Fillion) take control of a cannon. And eagle-eyed viewers noticed an interesting logo emblazoned on the side of the weapon: The logo for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

This corporation is a major player in the Alien franchise leading and controlling most aspects of space colonization and research in the many Alien movies. For instance it’s the enterprise that is set on studying the Xenomorph XX121 (the main Alien in Alien).

“Easter egg shows Firefly and Prometheus exist in the same universe” reports SyFy. “It seems that writing Alien: Resurrection wasn’t the only time Joss Whedon got to work in the Alien universe: The inclusion of one tiny logo—the Weyland-Yutani Corporation logo—in Firefly reveals that Ripley and Mal Reynolds could’ve gone drinking together.”"

With a 34mm case it’s the smallest smartwatch I’ve ever strapped to my tiny bird wrist. And after years of testing bulky gargantuan smartwatches it felt like my prayers had been answered.

The small size was only one reason I was excited to unbox the Lily. Another reason was that Garmin finally put out another smartwatch that wasn’t a bulky eyesore and fairly reasonably priced. (Nothing will be quite as gorgeous as Garmin’s Vivomove Luxe but its $799 price tag was too much for a hybrid.) Plus I was extremely curious to see for myself how well a teeny smartwatch like this would function compared to larger smartwatches with beefier components.

Garmin Lily What is it? The smallest smartwatch ever Price $329 Like Stylish and comfortable to wear on petite wrists. Full-featured for a hybrid analogue. No Like The interface is too swipe heavy. Screen not as responsive as I'd like. Tethered GPS is sometimes unreliable. Automatic activity tracking is wildly inaccurate.

After a few weeks of testing I have to admit I like the way my review unit looks on my wrist. There are six design SKUs. There are “Classic” models with leather straps and the other three are “Sport” models with silicone straps. Mine was the black-and-gold Classic model and features a plaid pattern on the lens. It caught me off guard but the fact that each of the six Lily models has its own unique patterned lens made choosing which one I wanted to wear feel more personal. In renders I thought the T-bar lug was kind of ugly but I didn’t mind it so much in person. The smaller case size also meant the Lily was one of the most comfortable smartwatches I’ve tested for 24/7 wear.

However while I appreciated the smaller size overall there was one unavoidable drawback. Notifications were harder to read just because there’s less screen to work with. It wasn’t ideal but it was workable. The only time it was a major problem was when I panicked because the Lily was telling me I was late for a call with my friend Tom (a meeting I had no recollection of making). In reality it was a reminder for a meeting the next day because the word “tomorrow” was cut off. To be fair this is simply a trade-off you have to accept. The only way to cram everything into the 34mm screen would be to make the font too small to read.

My bigger issue was that gestures weren’t always reliable and the monochrome LCD touchscreen wasn’t as responsive as I’d like. On more than one occasion I’d raise my wrist only to be greeted by a blank screen. Swipes were 50/50. Half the time they registered fine other times the response was laggy. During exercise it often took multiple attempts to stop a workout because my fingers were too sweaty.

It looks neat on my wrist! The textured patterned lens is also prettier than I expected. (Photo: Victoria Song/Gizmodo)

I also didn’t love the interface. Swiping left and right will let you scroll through widgets while swiping down will give you quick access to settings. Tapping the tiny home button will bring you to a limited list of features like changing settings starting an activity setting an alarm or changing your clock face. That’s pretty standard menu navigation for smartwatches! So is swiping up to view your notifications — which the Lily doesn’t do. The only way to easily go through your notifications on your wrist is to make sure the notifications widget is enabled. I didn’t do that during setup and spent a good 20 minutes wondering why the hell I couldn’t find my notifications. (I also highly recommend putting the notifications at the top of the widgets list when customising or you’ll have to do a lot of swiping through widgets.) In general there’s just a lot of left-and-right swiping which means it can be hard to access any menus quickly.

You’re also limited as to what you can do from your wrist. For example you can’t edit or add alarms without going through the Garmin Connect app. You can only toggle them on or off. Actually you can’t do a lot of things without first going through the app. It’s not a problem for everyone but if you want a watch that’s somewhat independent of your phone this ain’t it.

The Garmin Lily is the smallest smartwatch I’ve tested. The Suunto 7 is the largest. Look at that massive size difference! (Photo: Victoria Song/Gizmodo)

These quibbles aside I love that the Lily is a full-featured hybrid proving smaller size doesn’t mean you have to give up excellent features. You get SpO2 sensors continuous heart rate-monitoring an ambient light sensor and an accelerometer. It also has neat Garmin-specific features like Body Battery (which is surprisingly accurate at measuring how stressed or well-rested you are) and pregnancy-tracking (though this isn’t exclusive to the Lily). Also included are metrics like 24/7 respiration rate blood oxygen saturation levels breathing and move reminders sleep tracking and the ability to track water intake. You can also control your music view calendar events find your phone and if you’re on Android respond to texts and reject phone calls. The main things you’re missing are NFC payments and built-in GPS. (The Lily opts for connected GPS more on that below.) The Garmin Connect app can feel clunky at times but you won’t be lacking in data by opting for the Lily.

As for battery Garmin says the Lily has an estimated 5 days but I never got anywhere close to that. That’s probably because I enabled Garmin’s Pulse Ox tracking which is their version of blood oxygen-monitoring. With Pulse Ox turned on I got maybe 2.5 or 3 days of battery on a single charge. That’s way better than the Apple Watch and probably every Wear OS watch. It’s also on par with Samsung’s watches. However it pales in comparison to Fitbits or other hybrid analogs which can often get up to two weeks.

Garmin is one of the best companies out there for fitness-tracking but if fitness is your top priority the Lily isn’t the Garmin watch you want. It’s not that it’s bad. You still get really in-depth metrics in the app and the heart rate-tracking was on par with the Apple Watch SE and my Polar H10 chest strap. It’s more that you’re not getting what Garmin watches are best known for: a great GPS-tracking experience. Compared to other Garmin watches I’ve tested the Lily’s tethered GPS left me hanging. On a few runs I had to stand there shivering in the winter wind waiting for the watch to find a signal via my phone. Twice I rebooted the Garmin Connect app re-synced the watch and fiddled with my phone’s Bluetooth settings to no avail. The times when the Lily managed to get a tethered GPS signal the performance was on par with my Apple Watch SE but lagged compared to my phone. However I never knew on a given day whether the GPS gods would favour the Lily.

While you have the option of enabling automatic activity-tracking I found it was wildly off. For instance on one 5 km run the Lily auto-tracked that I ran 3 km. Similarly an auto-tracked 23-minute walk was cut off after 10 minutes. I’d recommend manually starting each activity but that involves a lot of swiping compared to other smartwatches.

I’ve already gone into why I think the “for women” marketing on the Lily isn’t necessary so I won’t rehash it too much here. But after my testing the only feature that’s truly woman-centric on the Lily is pregnancy-tracking. However pregnancy-tracking is available on several other Garmin watches so I’m really not seeing why a small watch means it’s for women. I’m sure plenty of men and nonbinary folks would love the Lily while some women may prefer larger screens for readability. After all women are not the sole gender that cares about style and women are not monolith in their gadget preferences.

It might sound like I’m harping on the Lily but even with the spotty GPS connectivity mixed fitness-tracking and the not-ideal interface I really think it’s a decent option for casual users. It’d just be an excellent pick if these things weren’t an issue. Garmin’s done a great job here marketing schlock aside in proving that you can make a decent smartwatch in a smaller form factor.

The only thing that gives me slight pause is that at $379 it’s about $70 more expensive than similar watches. Fossil’s hybrid analogs are also great on the style front (though not as great on the health tracking) and are around $250 The Withings Steel HR is also another sleek hybrid analogue that costs $298. Meanwhile the Fitbit Versa 3 isn’t too shabby-looking either and offers built-in GPS NFC payments and digital assistants for $290. Arguably Garmin does get you access to a more robust fitness platform but again the Lily’s strengths are its small size and stylish design. At the end of the day a roughly $70 price difference isn’t the worst — especially if you find the Lily on sale. It’s just a question of whether you think it’s worth paying more for what boils down to smaller size and style.

Ultimately I was hoping the Lily would be a tiny powerhouse that also looked chic and felt comfortable on my small wrist. It’s not a powerhouse and I’m definitely left wanting a bit more. But you know what? Two out of three isn’t bad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhbGViLWV3YW4tcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXRpcnJlbm8tYWRyaWF0aWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caleb Ewan pulls out of Tirreno-Adriatico,"Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) abandoned Tirreno-Adriatico on Friday's stage 3 suffering with stomach problems.

The Australian climbed off his bike with around 100km to go on the stage that was won by Mathieu van der Poel in an uphill sprint.

His team later stated he had 'mild gastro-enteritis' and his abandon was more of a precaution ahead of one of his major goals.

""Caleb Ewan has withdrawn from the race as he has been suffering from mild gastro-enteretis"" said the team. ""The decision to abandon was taken in order to not jeopardise his participation at Milan-San Remo this coming Saturday.""

Ewan came into Tirreno-Adriatico after starting his season at the UAE Tour where despite not feeling happy with his performances he took home a stage win.

He was considered the favourite for the flat bunch sprint on the opening day of Tirreno but was beaten to the line by Wout Van Aert (Jumbo-Visma).

He finished 164th and 15 minutes down on stage 2 before leaving the race on stage 3.

Ewan will now rest up before completing his final preparations for next weekend's Milan-San Remo where he was runner-up in 2018. He'll lead the line for Lotto Soudal alongside Philippe Gilbert who's looking to complete the collection of five Monuments.

The rest of Ewan's season is set to involve visits to the Giro d'Italia Tour de France and Vuelta a España. The 26-year-old has won stages at all three races in the past but is aiming to become the first rider since Alessandro Petacchi in 2003 to do so in the same calendar year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGVhbHRoeWFwcGxlLmNvbS9nYWx2YW5pYy1za2luLXNlbnNvci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LW9uLXdlYXJhYmxlcy1pcy1qdXN0LWdldHRpbmctc3RhcnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galvanic Skin Sensor technology on wearables is just getting started,"Wearables with Galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors first made headlines when Jawbone UP3 was being planned for released way back in 2014.

While Products like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit Charge HR use optical heart rate monitoring which flashes light on the skin to track blood flowing through the capillaries below Jawbone’s UP3 was the first tracker with bioimpedance capabilities.

Long History of GSR Sensors on Wearables

Research showing Galvanic Skin response and detection of stress were becoming popular as early as 2012. [1]

Instead of simply relying on light sensors the Jawbone UP3 was designed to send a small electrical current through the body and measure tissue’s resistance to it.

The plan was to release a whole set of over-the-air updates in 2015 to track moment-to-moment heart rate respiration hydration and galvanic skin response.

Unfortunately in 2017 Jawbone went out of business and the founder Hosain Rahman started a new company called Jawbone Health with some of the former employees. Interestingly Jawbone Health raised $65 million in 2019 for the company’s new health ambitions.

Other wearable companies also tried the GSR route in the past. The headliner in 2016/2017 was a London-based startup called Vinaya.

The company’s wearable Zenta was expected to house GSR sensors that could help with tracking emotions and stress.

Although the UP3 or Zenta never made it big GSR technology came back to the forefront one more time with the release of Fitbit Sense just this last year.

The Fitbit Sense added two new sensors.

The first is the electrodermal activity sensor that measures minute changes in skin conductance to measure stress levels and the second was the skin temperature sensor.

Both HRV(Heart rate variability) and skin temperature can be sensitive indicators of stress.

Research shows that skin temperature decreases in cases of stressful events from an average of 32 to 35 degree Celsius.

By combining the readings from the GSR and linking it with other heart rate metrics Fitbit Sense is able to detect a meaningful Stress level indicator.

Just not Fitbit. Apple has been exploring the idea since the inception of the Apple Watch

Given the potential it is no surprise that companies such as Apple have been also looking at incorporating a GSR sensor into the Apple Watch.

If you review the original Apple Watch patent filing carefully that had Johny Ive as one of the inventors you will be amazed at how much of the functionality originally planned for the Apple Watch is yet to come to fruition.

“A second light source of the array of light sources may include an infrared LED adapted to detect the water content of the body. The health metric may include one or more of: a heart rate a respiration rate a blood oxygenation level and a blood volume estimate.

In some embodiments the device also includes at least one pair of electrodes disposed on an exterior surface of the housing. In some cases the signal is used to compute an additional health metric that includes one or more of: a heart function a body fat estimate and a body fat estimate.”

This same Apple patent further describes:

“In some aspects the consumer product includes one or more biosensors. Example health metrics include without limitation a heart rate a respiration rate blood oxygenation level a blood volume estimate blood pressure or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments the biosensors include an electrical sensor that may be used to measure electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics galvanic skin resistance and other electrical properties of the user’s body.

An example consumer product having multiple biosensors is described below with respect to FIG. 16 and with respect to other examples herein. “

Of all the features described in the original Apple patent the one that users finally received via Apple Watch Series 6 was the blood oxygenation level.

It will not be surprising to see a GSR sensor in the upcoming Apple Watch Series that can detect skin temperature and more.

There are plenty of rumors out there that both the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch will be able to perform non-invasive blood glucose monitoring soon.

Novel Applications of Galvanic Skin Response Sensors

In general sweat sensing technologies have enormous potential for applications ranging from athletics to neonatology pharmacological monitoring to personal digital health to name a few applications.

This is because sweat contains many of the same biomarkers chemicals or solutes that are carried in the blood which can provide significant information enabling the diagnosis of ailments health status toxins performance and other physiological attributes even in advance of any physical sign.

Furthermore sweat itself and the action of sweating or other parameters attributes solutes or features on or near the skin or beneath the skin can be measured to further reveal physiological information.

A good article published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering titled “Adhesive RFID Sensor Patch for Monitoring of Sweat Electrolytes”; and the article published in the journal AIP Biomicrofluidics 9 031301 (2015) titled “The Microfluidics of the Eccrine Sweat Gland Including Biomarker Partitioning Transport and Biosensing Implications” showcases a large number of interesting potential commercial applications based on Galvanic Skin response and Analyte sensors.

It was demonstrated in various studies such as the “Stress and alcohol: Epidemiologic evidence” article of Keyes et al. (2012) that people who are often stressed are more likely to be diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) than people who are less stressed.

Also the results of the research conducted by Pohorecky (1991) titled “Stress and alcohol interaction: An update of human research” stated that a high level of stress may lead to an excessive intake of alcohol.

Electrodermal sensors can not only detect stress but can also be used to monitor blood alcohol levels and therefore be helpful in helping to combat Alchohol abuse disorders.

How does an electrodermal sensor exactly work?

When an individual experiences stress a chain of biological events transpires starting with the hypothalamus gland secreting a hormone called “Corticopin Releasing Factor” (CRF). As CRF enters the bloodstream it launches several events.

To start with it causes the pituitary gland to help with releasing a hormone called ACTH that subsequently signals the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands.

As the hormone cortisol is released it increases glucose in the blood and the rapid chemical processing of fats and amino acids.

This in turn provides excess energy for muscles to respond to the stimulus (stressor).

This phenomenon known as the “stress response” can be characterized by changes in body temperature heart rate and physiological-arousal state.

It is possible to quantify these physiological biomarkers and measure their relationship to the onset of stress triggers.

What can electrodermal sensing help with?

Studies have also shown the benefits of GSR monitoring for epilepsy patients. “Effect of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Biofeedback Treatment in Patients with Epilepsy.” Jun. 2003 Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.

Other applications that have been studied extensively are around monitoring depression with GSR sensors [2].

Along the same lines researchers are also using GSR-based wearables and patches to learn more about Parkinson’s disease detection and stroke. [3]

A new breed of sweat sensors is being developed today that could be leading us into the next level of transformation. From monitoring biophysical signals to monitoring biochemical signals for disease detection and more.

Sweat contains many indicators relating to cell health and organ function (such as electrolytes) the immune system (cytokines) and drug interactions (metabolites).

Sweat sensors are being developed that capture chloride glucose lactate urea creatinine alcohol pH and even heavy metals. [4].

Quantifying protein and hormone levels in sweat would increase these sensors’ applicability further.

Wearable technology with EDA sensors

Senstream a SanFrancisco based company founded by Hugh lusted who was at Stanford University School of Medicine is exploring this avenue.

The company is pursuing a wearable of the ‘ring’ type that can help with continuous monitoring of the sympathetic nervous system via an electrodermal sensor.

The ring is designed to house an EDA sensor along with a biosensor that gets activated in certain situations and triggers the bio-essay so that a chemical analysis can be done to determine an appropriate biomarker.

Empatica wearable is another device that has an electrodermal sensor and is being used in different health monitoring and research applications.

Biofourmis is another company that has a wearable called Everion that is used for remote health monitoring applications. This wearable also has electrodermal sensors and skin temperature sensors that can help with understanding emotional responses and more.

The Sports Patch by Gatorade

More recently Gatorade launched a path that can help monitor your hydration levels.

Gatorade says the patch should be worn on the left inner arm during a single workout. After finishing the workout users can scan their patch using Gatorade’s app Gx to reveal their unique sweat profile.

The sweat profile is based on sweat levels sodium losses in the forearm body weight and workout type or intensity.

The aim is to provide users with hydration strategies to maximize performance and avoid cramping or dehydration. Results can tell you everything from fluid and sodium loss to the rate you sweat and compare it with other workouts. These patches will sell for $24.99.

We hope that this article provided you with a good overview of the history of electrodermal sensors in wearables current products with GSR sensors and some of the novel research that is being currently done in this area.

In the early days of the Caps’ existence the Flyers would dominate the Capitals but eventually the matchup became more even. In this piece NoVa Caps looks back at a game that took place between the Capitals and Flyers on March 13 1982 at the Capital Center in Landover Maryland.

Preview

Going into the game the Caps had a record of 22-37-9. The Flyers had a record of 34-27-8 and were trying to catch the New York Rangers in the standings. The goalie matchup was Dave Parro for the Capitals against Rick St. Croix for the Flyers.

First Period

The most notable action to begin the first period was two Flyers getting penalized in quick succession. First Brad March was penalized for hooking at 4:52 then Darryl Sittler was penalized for tripping at 5:23 giving the Capitals a 5-on-3 power play. Bobby Gould scored his 17th goal over a minute after the second penalty at 6:32. He got assists from Chris Valentine and Dennis Maruk. This put the Caps ahead 1-0.

There was no more scoring for the remainder of the period but plenty of penalties. A battle between Dennis Maruk and Bob Hoffmeyer at 12:22 resulted in a high sticking penalty for Maruk and two penalties for Hoffmeyer one for slashing and one for roughing.

At 18:24 in the period Randy Holt of the Caps and Tim Kerr of the Flyers got into a fight with Holt earning an extra two minutes for roughing. This put the Flyers on a power play that spilled into second period.

Second Period

After Holt’s roughing penalty expired Glen Currie scored the Caps second goal of the game and his fifth goal of the season just 40 seconds into the second period. He got assists from Bobby Gould and Timo Blomqvist.

At 1:39 the Flyers’ Bobby Clark was assessed a tripping minor which put the Caps on the power play. Nearly 80 minutes later at 2:54 Caps’ Darren Veitch scored on the ensuing power play getting assists from Rick Green and Bengt Gustafsson. The Caps now led 3-0.

There were more fisticuffs less than two minutes later. At 4:19 Gaetan Duchesne of the Caps cross checked Paul Holmgren who elbowed him in return. After that Doug Hicks of the Caps fought Paul Holmgren. Both teams earned a fighting major and a minor penalty.

The Flyers finally made the scoresheet when Ken Linseman scored his 20th goal of the season at 8:38 getting assists from Reggie Leach and Bob Hoffmeyer.

At 15:31 Mike Gartner and Bobby Clarke got into a high sticking battle. At the same time Bengt Gustafsson and Ken Linseman got into a fight. Gartner and Clarke both got two minor penalties apiece one for high sticking and one for roughing. Gustafsson and Linseman both got fighting majors.

Third Period

Jimmy Watson narrowed the Capitals’ lead to 3-2 when he scored on a 15-foot wrist shot at 2:24 into the final period. He got assists from Linseman and Clarke which gave Linseman a Gordy Howe hat trick.

At 8:40 Brian Propp of the Flyers high-sticked Randy Holt which put both teams on a 4-on-4 situation. During this 4-on-4 Gustafsson struck back with an eight-foot backhander to put the Caps ahead by two goals again. Gustafsson was assisted by Reggie Leach.

This was Gustafsson’s 21st goal of the season and also gave him a Gordie Howe hat trick as like his fighting partner Linseman also had a goal and an assist the prior period. So now both the Capitals and Flyers had recorded a Gordie Howe Hat Trick between two players who had fought one another.

Bobby Carpenter added his 27th goal at 16:10 to put the Caps ahead 5-3. He got assists from Gartner and Gustafsson. Darryl Sittler of the Flyers scored his 27th game at 18:24 getting an assist from Ilkka Sinisalo. The score was now 5-3.

With exactly a minute to go in the game there were more fisticuffs. Randy Holt and Paul Holmgren got into a battle which resulted in a fight. Besides the fighting majors Holmgren also earned slashing and roughing penalties.

Holt also earned a cross checking penalty. This put the Caps on the power play. Dennis Maruk scored his 55th goal of the season on the ensuing power play just 14 seconds later. He got assists from Glen Currie and Bobby Gould. The final score was 6-3. This Caps’ win kept the Flyers two points behind the division leading New York Rangers.

The Flyers lived up to their Broad Street Bullies’ reputation in this game. It featured four fights and included two Gordie Howe hat tricks one for each team. Over 80 total minutes of penalties were doled out. In addition to his fighting major Gustafsson scored a goal and had two assists.

Snow falling off a roof was one common theory along with training at the Ethan Allen Firing Range or even a frost quake (another mysterious noisy winter phenomena). Social media lit up with people weighing in from Essex to Wolcott Duxbury to Williamstown.

“It sounded as though someone dropped an elephant on the roof” Sarah Page commented from Duxbury.

“We were outside and heard it but did not see anything. Thought it might have been a military plane” suggested Kamala Kelton in Waterbury Center.

In no time reports began popping up on a site run by the American Meteor Society ranging from Hinesburg to Quebec all around 5:38 p.m. Within three hours of these sightings NASA had received enough eyewitness reports and footage to confidently identify the fireball as an asteroid fragment that traveled above Vermont’s Mount Mansfield State Forest its path covering a wide swath of the state where people below took notice.

The WCAX-Channel 3 late news shared a short video clip captured by the station’s stationary camera at the Burlington International Airport showing a brilliant streak crossing the sky in an easterly direction.

In the object’s descent through Earth’s atmosphere NASA’s Meteor Watch Facebook page reported pressure built up in its front and created a vacuum directly behind it. The difference between the two forces led to an explosive reaction within the meteor’s structure.“The space rock fragmented violently producing a pressure wave that rattled buildings and generated the sound heard by those near the trajectory” NASA’s post said.

Instruments on the ground helped the agency calculate that the explosion was the equivalent of 440 pounds of TNT. And at its peak velocity the meteor was traveling at 42000 miles per hour and got as close as 30 miles to the Earth’s surface before it reached its fiery demise. Its size was no greater than a watermelon when it released its shockwave.

Before you hop in your car and ready your snowshoes to try and find evidence of the space object though heed the words of Johnathan Kemp from Middlebury College’s Mittelman Observatory.

“Sunday's event was large enough to create a great show in the sky but unlikely to be sufficiently large so as to result in a potential specimen for recovery on the ground” Kemp said. “Estimates by scientists of the meteor's size before atmospheric entry imply that it is quite unlikely that a part survived the trip through the atmosphere.”

The display reminded one veteran Vermont reporter Stefan Hard of his brush with a similar celestial object in 1994. On June 15 of that year Hard was at his house in Fairfield when the dim evening sky was illuminated by an unnatural color.

“I’m just standing there doing my dishes and all of the sudden around 8 p.m. this thing lit up the whole sky in this weird eerie green hue” Hard recalled. “At that point [the object] started to break up and it kept going until it disappeared behind Jay Peak. I was just flabbergasted my jaw was on the floor. I had never seen anything like that.”

The following day Hard was tasked by his editor at the Country Courier with tracking down the object and recording eyewitness accounts. He began by calling every police station and dispatch center to the northeast of Fairfield and combing through reports — the hunt was on.

After a day of phone calls Hard said he headed out in his car and kept driving north asking if anybody saw anything.

Sure enough they did. His journey took him all the way to the Quebec border by Great Averill Pond in Essex County. “There were some camps that were facing the right way and I found one or two people up there that had seen it” Hard said. “They were pretty impressed by it as well and I think a few days later I started hearing reports from Quebec that pieces had come down in Quebec.”

The border however was the end of Hard’s journey. “I was like ‘Damn.’ It was logistically a little too difficult to keep pursuing it” he professed.

Unlike Sunday’s fragment the object Hard pursued not only reached the ground but broke into 20 sizable fragments that weighed roughly 56 lbs altogether. A detailed report published in the Meteoritics & Planetary Science Journal determined that the explosion of the 1994 object was the equivalent of a half of a kiloton of TNT more than twice the energy of the Sunday spectacular.

Both events will stay in their audience’s memories for quite some time.

GE,GE Aerospace,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9qZXQtZW5naW5lLW1ha2Vycy1mYWNlLWEtbG9uZy1yZWNvdmVyeS1mcm9tLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jet-engine makers face a long recovery from the pandemic,"T HE ABSENCE of vapour trails in a clear sky is an obvious sign that commercial aviation has been hit hard by covid-19. The upshot for the makers of the jet engines that create those ephemeral streaks—fewer planes sold fewer flying hours and older aircraft retiring early as fleets are pruned—is a triple blow for an industry that mostly profits by keeping them in the air for years after they are sold.

The immediate impact for the business which is dominated by a handful of manufacturers was on full display on March 11th. Rolls-Royce a British company that competes with the aviation division of America’s General Electric ( GE ) to power long-haul wide-body jets published grim results for 2020. The hit to commercial aerospace source of half its revenues in 2019 led to an operating loss of £2bn ($2.8bn). It sold just 264 large engines down from 510 the year before.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20veHdiLWV4dGVuc2lvbi1zZWN1cmVzLWxvbmctdGVybS1wb3NpdGlvbi1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1vbi10aGUtYTM1MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,XWB-extension secures long-term position Rolls-Royce on the A350 |,"Care to share?

The extension of the contract that confirms Rolls-Royce as the exclusive supplier until 2030 for the Airbus A350-family is a major boost for the Derby-based engine manufacturer. It secures its return on investment on the twin-aisle program although the Covid-crisis will have a significant impact on sales of the aircraft model in the next coming years as the recovery of long-haul travel lags behind that of short-haul.

The contract extension with Airbus on the A350-900 by five years until 2030 was announced during Rolls’ 2020-results presentation on March 11. It means the Trent XWB-84 will remain the sole engine on the smallest version of the A350. Rolls-Royce already had an exclusive agreement for the XWB-97 on the stretched A350-1000.

The renewal ends one and a half years of speculation in which Airbus and General Electric were said to study the option to offer the GEnx on the -900 from 2025-2026. This would have required a redesign of the A350 engine mounting as well as an engine upgrade on power as the maximum output of the current GEnx-1B and -2B on the Boeing 747-8 and 787-10 is only 76.000 lbs. Offering a second engine on the A350 would have made sense for Airbus to make the A350-900 more attractive to loyal GE-customers.

This option might have been attractive in 2019 when reports first emerged but in a (post)-Covid world where A350-sales are likely to stay behind the original forecast investing in a second engine option will likely have cast doubts at both Airbus and GE. Is there a market big enough for two engine suppliers? As of March 1 the A350-900 had sold 745 with 355 delivered. Of the larger A350-1000 on which Rolls has the exclusive rights only 168 have been sold and 53 delivered. The XWB has clocked up over seven million flight hours since entry into service in 2015.

Who made the decision to end discussions on the GEnx-powered A350 (Airbus GE?) isn’t clear but Rolls-Royce is delighted with the opportunity to extend the contract. As Warren East said: “The -900 is the volume variant it’s a hugely successful airplane. Technically yes the aircraft could be dual-sourced (with another engine option – RS) at the end of 2031 but the 2030 date pretty much coincides with the development timeline of our next-generation UltraFan engine program.”

In other words: when the contract on the XWB-84 expires in 2030 Airbus and Rolls-Royce might be willing to re-engine the A350 with newer engine designs like the UltraFan. If that makes sense that is as the A350 design will be 25 years old by then. In September Airbus outlined plans to have a new hydrogen-based airliner available from 2035. This could well be an A350 derivative.

The UltraFan is expected to have its first proper run in early 2022. (Rolls-Royce)

UltraFan still waiting for its first customer

Rolls-Royce is relying heavily on the future success of the new UltraFan which after years of studying and designing is now entering a new phase. The first engine is under assembly and is expected to have its first run later in 2021 although East said that early 2022 is more likely. Thanks to its advanced combustor and fan technology a 15:1 by-pass ratio and 60:1 pressure ratio and operating at higher temperatures UltraFan will be 25 percent more fuel-efficient compared to the current Trent family. The engine is also 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible a key factor at a time when the industry is actively involved with the use of SAF’s in all sorts and forms.

When it launched UltraFan Rolls-Royce had hoped to have a customer for the scaleable engine by now. However it hasn’t been confirmed on any existing or new aircraft design. Rolls-Royce had offered the engine to Boeing for its muted New Market Aircraft but in February 2019 pulled out and left the bidding to GE and Pratt & Whitney as it said its development timeline was out of sync with that of Boeing’s. After Boeing itself has deferred the NMA in early 2020 the two timelines seem to converge again. Boeing reviewed its new airplane options and according to CEO David Calhoun has made strong progress on this which could offer new opportunities for the UltraFan.

“Our UltraFan development has gone well since then (2019) and is gearing up for demonstration early next year. It will depend on whether we will go ahead at that stage or pause. It will depend on the timing of new aircraft programs. UltraFan will be scaleable across single-aisle and dual-aisle. We will have to see if programs actually materialize when they do” explained East.

2020 loss of 3.1 billion

Rolls-Royce reported a GBP-3.169 billion loss over 2020 compared to GBP-1.311 billion the previous year with an operating loss of GBP-2.081 billion (-852 million). Revenues were at GBP 11.824 billion versus 16.857 billion the previous year. Free cash flow was down to GBP -4.185 billion reflecting the impact of the Covid crisis on its Civil Aerospace business segment. The large and business engine divisions reported an underlying loss of GBP-2.574 billion on revenues of GBP 5.089 billion (-37 percent).

During the year Rolls-Royce delivered 264 large engines compared to 510 in 2019. This year and in 2022 it expects to deliver between 200 and 250 large engines but this is dependent on the build rates of Airbus and Boeing. Delays of 787 deliveries will trigger payments by R-R to customers that will have a negative impact on cash flow East said. Fewer deliveries reflect the impact of the Covid-crisis on the long-haul segment of air travel although XWB-powered A350s and Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787s form the backbone of operations with most airlines. Talking about the Trent 1000: as most issues with the intermediate-pressure compressor and turbine and high-pressure turbine blades are resolved Rolls expects these issues to result in GBP 300 million lower cash costs this year compared to GBP 524 million in 2020 (578 million in 2019).



Slide showing the status of engine flying hours (EFH): the XWB recovered to 60 percent in December. (Rolls-Royce)

Engine flying hours at only 43 percent

An important parameter for Rolls-Royce is engine flying hours (EFH) which tells how active the fleet has been and how this translates into maintenance repair and overhaul. In 2020 large engine flying hours were 43 percent of 2019 levels with engine shop visits down by 14 percent. EFHs of the newer XWBs have recovered to some sixty percent by December with those of the Trent 7000 (Airbus A330neo) and Trent 1000 slightly behind. Older Trent family engines are lagging behind as many aircraft remain grounded or have been retired with the Trent 900 on the Airbus A380 at the bottom of the EFH-list.

East said EFH is expected to recover to 55 percent this year and to over eighty percent in 2022. This should have a positive effect on cash flow which should improve by GBP 1.2 billion thanks to better EFH alone. Overall free cash this year is expected to be around GBP -2.0 billion and recover to a positive GBP 750 million once eighty percent EFH is achieved.

Rolls-Royce continued its restructuring plan and reduced the operating costs by GBP 1 billion in 2020. It is on track to meet GBP 1.3 billion in annual savings by the end of 2022. Some 7.000 employees (many in Civil Aerospace) have left the company through voluntary leave and compulsory redundancies out of 9.000 or one-third headcount that is to be made redundant. Spending is under strict control including one-third of subcontractor spending at Civil Aero. Capital expenditures are about fifty percent lower compared to 2019 levels. As announced production of engine parts at five locations will be consolidated in a “fundamental transformation is Civil Aero cost base.” Discussion on the disposal of surplus sites are underway including that of subsidiary ITP Aero. The disposal of more sites is not excluded.

The OEM secured GBP 7.3 billion in additional liquidity last year including GBP 2.0 billion through a rights issue. Total liquidity is GBP 9.0 billion with another GBP 5.5 billion available in undrawn debt.

Recovery through investing in low-carbon technology

Rolls-Royce wants to position itself for recovery by maximizing the value of its existing capabilities. Warren East outlined that Civil Aero has largely completed its major investment cycle in large engines and now wants to capitalize on extracting aftermarket value from its 5.000 plus installed engines by improving time-on-wing and by reducing costs of components.

A second pillar of the recovery of Civil Aero is by investing in sustainable low-carbon technology like hybrid-electric propulsion which will “really be the lion share” of self-funded Research and Development. The engine maker target to increase funding in low carbon technology like UltraFan and lower carbon/next generation of aero engines from a combined 45 percent last year to some 75 percent mid-term.

In the commuter and regional aircraft market. Rolls-Royce announced earlier this week that it will expand its collaboration with Tecnam and Norwegian airline Wideroe on the development of an 11-seat commuter aircraft based on the P-Volt to be available in 2026.

Rolls is most interested in the use of hydrogen which can be used relatively easily on current engine technology but will push the boundaries on the engineering side. “I am confident we will have the technical capability to support our aviation customers if indeed this is the direction the industry moves” said East.

If you have a disc version of the game you'll still need to use that in order to play the game.

If you're on PlayStation you'll need to manually find and download the PlayStation 5 version of the game from the PlayStation Store. Search for it and if you're eligible the game's icon will have ""Free Upgrade"" on it in a white box.

If you have the disc version of the game you'll need to have the PlayStation 4 disc inserted in your PlayStation 5 for this to register. This will of course require having the disc drive version of the PS5: you can't insert your disc into the PS5 Digital Edition.



How to Transfer Your Saves to the Next-Gen Version of Crash Bandicoot 4



Now that you have the next-gen version of the game you'll need to transfer your progress over. There's a few things to note before we begin:

Save transfers are one-way. You can upload any save to retrieve on the next-gen version but you can't take a next-gen save and retrieve it in the last-gen version.

You can upload any save to retrieve on the next-gen version but you can't take a next-gen save and retrieve it in the last-gen version. You cannot transfer a save from one console family to another. That means you cannot take an Xbox One save of Crash 4 and import it into the PlayStation 5 version for example.

That means you cannot take an Xbox One save of Crash 4 and import it into the PlayStation 5 version for example. You can only transfer one save at a time. If you have multiple saves you want to transfer you'll need to bounce back and forth between the two versions of the game.

If you have multiple saves you want to transfer you'll need to bounce back and forth between the two versions of the game. The PS5 version has a separate Trophy List. This means that all your PS4 Trophies will pop again for the PS5 list. If you're a Trophy hunter you may want to consider getting all the Trophies on PS4 then transferring the save to PS5 to pop them all a second time.

With that knowledge in mind here's what you need to do to transfer your saves:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdGF0ZXNtYW4uY29tL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uLWh1Yi9zb3VyYWJoLXNoYXJtYS1pcy1pbi1zeW5jLXdpdGgtY2hhbmdpbmctZGlnaXRhbC1sYW5kc2NhcGUtYW5kLXRoZS1wdWxzZS1vZi1nZW4tei0xNTAyOTU3Mjc1Lmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS9pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi1odWIvc291cmFiaC1zaGFybWEtaXMtaW4tc3luYy13aXRoLWNoYW5naW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtbGFuZHNjYXBlLWFuZC10aGUtcHVsc2Utb2YtZ2VuLXotMTUwMjk1NzI3NS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sourabh Sharma is in sync with changing digital landscape and the pulse of Gen Z,"“The difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money with the sole purpose of making money” Alan Watts once rightfully pointed out.

Only sixty companies on the Fortune 500 list for 1955 remained on the list in 2017. That is just 12%. In addition a research study estimates that 40% of today’s Fortune 500 companies will not exist in ten years ahead. They will fail because they focus on delivering short-term shareholder returns and of investors at the expense of understanding the shopping behaviours of their customers which is most important for the growth and survival of any company.Many companies worldwide are trying to find about Millennials and Generation-Z customers. Millennials are people born between 1981 and 1996 and who are 24 to 39 years of age. But much current discussion of Millennials is about teenagers who are part of Gen-Z a class of people born between 1996 and 2015 who now range from 5 to 24 years. The companies are more interested in understanding the expectations of young Millennials (those in their 20’s) and older member of Gen-Z (those in their late teens and twenties). They are also called by iGeneration Digital natives and dot.com These new generation of customers have very peculiar shopping behaviour patterns from other generation of customers.This Generation is going to become most influential as they are more than 2 billion of them globally and over 1.2 billion or more than 60% reside in Asia and 400 million or 20% in Africa. Of the remaining 400 million 150 million live in Europe and Latin America/Caribbean with the rest in North America and Oceania. (United Nations 2019). On a global scale marketer should pay close attention in researching and understanding the shopping behaviour of this new generation specially in Asia and Africa. Young Millennials and Generation Z are the new disruptive economic force that possess US$ 200 billion of annual purchasing power.Generations are shaped by the context in which they emerged and their preferences change over time. As Dr. Samuel Johnson an English writer said “.” Disruption can be a death sentence to a business but it does not have to be. Companies can use the threat to focus on what is important for their customers and they can use disruption to keep pace by developing new solutions that address the changing preferences and shopping behaviours of customers.Generation-Z grew up during the mid and late 2000 years characterised by severe economic recession and banking crises which fed them with harder sense of realism and experienced the economic recovery which led to providing them with a lot of financial power that they can use freely. Gen- Z is influenced by lack of trust in the banking system and save less as compared to their predecessors. They have grown in fully digital era and globally connected world and want everything digital. They do not know how to have real conversations and very difficult to predict and understand what their next move would be? They use social media as a source for ‘reality checks’ for shopping decisions in which they are not confident. They read product & service reviews and recognize peer validation to self-evaluate before making purchase decisions. Ultimately they typically gather information from sources that they do trust to be accurate & authentic before taking any buying decision. That is why when planning a marketing mix strategy companies need to incorporate ‘’ marketing practice as part of their strategy to build trust among them. when it comes to customer relationships they live in virtual world but look for benefits akin to those of real world. These benefits include regular engagements through coupons emails and text messages and opportunity to be heard through ‘Co-creation’ with the brands/companies they associate with. Companies like Nike Adidas Volkswagen Starbucks Diesel and Gucci have capitalized on their desire by developing platforms for ‘Co-creation’ which can directly deliver to them customizable products & services. They have strong financial power and constant connectivity with newest trends with close relationship with their parents which lead them to influence their parents also in buying decisions. Companies need to incorporate ‘’ as part of their marketing strategy by rethinking customer offerings creating agile operations and reducing waste. this generation of customers expects brands/companies to give back to society and think that they ‘know better’ so they do not want companies to put human’s in their way if they could complete the task on their own. They do not see the need for another person to be involved when technology is there to help them. They tend to consider technology more reliable than human beings. They have grown up by playing video games on Sony Microsoft and Nintendo consoles and on smart phones so they have learned that an initial failure to accomplish a task doesn’t mean that they cannot accomplish it but it just means to them that they need to try again by putting consistent efforts to solve problems on their own using technology. This is the reason why Chatbots and Artificial Intelligence will dominate all customer services interactions in the future.

After all they believe in genderless and in this respect the marketers can call them ‘’.These customers value self-expression as opposed to buying brands to fit in with the norms of the group. They are willing to pay a premium for brands that highlight their individuality. They value brands that do not classify items as male or female and for most brands that is truly new territory.

They try to purchase products from companies they consider ethical and try to seek the origins of anything they buy—where it is made what it is made from and how it is made. They refuse to buy products from companies involved in scandals. Companies must therefore not only clearly identify the themes on which they will take positions but also ensure that everyone throughout the value chain gets on board. For the same reason companies ought to think carefully about the marketing agents who represent their brands and products. The companies need to incorporate ‘’ as a part of marketing strategy for Generation -Z consumers.New generation of customers might not be today’s target customers for marketers but they act as today’s disruptors and influence their parents in purchasing decisions in most product categories so companies need to pay close attention to this generation of customers and to be cautious of their shopping behaviour patterns as this will dictate marketing dynamics and economic growth over next decade.-The author is professor of marketing at Amity University Uttar Pradesh (AUUP) Noida Campus.

The U.S. Army’s ambitious Next Generation Squad Weapon intended to be a catch-all replacement for the iconic M16 M4 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. There are currently three firms in the running and have offered fairly different platforms — and testing is now in its final phase.

All three of the contenders are built around the 6.8mm Special Purpose Cartridge a government-designed medium-caliber rifle cartridge that falls in-between the 7.62mm and 5.56mm NATO cartridges in terms of bullet diameter. Though the actual bullet is mandated what the cartridge looks like is up to the individual NGSW entrants. One thing that all three firms’ entrants have in common however is a removable suppressor.

Next Generation Squad Weapon: Who Is In the Running?

The Defense firm General Dynamics’ offering is perhaps the most radical of the three. Their bullpup design sees magazines loaded behind the trigger group offering a longer barrel length — and therefore higher muzzle velocities and increased maximum effective range — while maintaining a very compact overall length.

General Dynamics partnered with True Velocity to develop what they think could be the next revolution in ammunition. A Texas-based polymer ammunition manufacturer TV’s ammunition is radical — by exchanging brass ammunition casings for plastic TV claims that significant weight savings can be gleaned and therefore allow grunts to hump more ammunition around.

Sig Sauer’s entry is perhaps one of the more conventional of the three competing designs. A conventional non-bullpup layout is completed by hybrid ammunition. By using a steel base and polymer cartridge body Sig Sauer claims that sufficient weight reduction can be made with sufficient case strength to handle the 6.8 SPC’s increased chamber pressure.

On the other hand Textron’s ammunition is the most bizzare-looking — they decided to design their platform around telescopic ammunition wherein the entire bullet and propellant are encased within the cartridge case offering a more compact lighter cartridge. Though on paper there are significant gains to be made with such ammunition the technology is extremely green and untested.

Changing Times

It’s not just the U.S. Army that is going through a small-arms evolution. The U.S. Marine Corps has also fairly recently forgone their M16 rifles and M4 carbines in favor of the M27 rifle which is still being rolled out. However new isn’t always better.

The supposed weight savings touted by the Army by using plastic casing rather than brass may not be as great as they seem. Individual soldiers don’t always carry enough ammunition to take full benefit of a reduction in ammunition weight — the greatest benefit would be logistically to the ships planes and trucks that move large quantities of ammunition not to the individual soldier.

Furthermore using plastic cases could come at an inopportune time. Dr. Allan Orr a Sydney-based anti-terrorism specialist explained just why the Army’s new ammunition might not be the best idea explaining that “the Great Pacific garbage patch over the next 50 years will only increase at a time when the world is trying to get on top of it.” This has also led to some speculation that light-weight plastic ammunition could be a hard sell for European NATO Allies due to potential difficulties in getting more environmentally-friendly countries onboard with plastic NATO-standard ammunition.

Postscript

All three contenders have two versions of their weapon systems in the running: 15 rifles and 15 automatic rifles plus 180000 rounds of their own cartridges. The various platforms are currently being tested and evaluated by U.S. Army soldiers. There should soon be a winner.

According to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report the U.S. is committed to spending $494 billion on its nuclear forces over the next decade or about $50 billion per year. Over the next three decades nuclear weapons modernization plans could cost as much as $1.5-$2 trillion.

This total includes investment in a $100 billion Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) a land-based nuclear missile which is slated to replace the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).

Manufactured by Northrop Grumman under a $13 billion contract—with assistance from other major defense contractors like Bechtel Honeywell General Dynamics Lockheed Martin L3 Harris and Textron—the GBSD is supposed to be made operational by 2029

The U.S. Air Force plans to order more than 600 of them.

Elizabeth Eaves characterized the GBSD in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as a “new weapon of mass destruction the length of a bowling lane which will be able to travel some 6000 miles carrying a warhead more than 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.”

The human tragedy associated with the development of the GBSD is compounded by the fact that military experts believe it will not actually enhance U.S. national security.

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015 that getting rid of America’s land-based nuclear missiles would “reduce the false alarm danger.”

Like its predecessor the Minuteman III the GBSD is designed to be activated in the face of a Russian nuclear attack.

The computer systems that warn of such incoming fire may be vulnerable to hacking and false alarms.

During the Cold War military computer glitches caused numerous close calls.

President Biden has in the past supported arms control and nuclear weapons reduction treaties.

In 1988 he helped negotiate ratification of the Inter-Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed between Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan which required the U.S. and USSR to eliminate and permanently forswear all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5500 kilometers.

More recently though Biden has taken a hard line against both Russia and China whose supposed existential threats to U.S. interests has provided a basis for the massive government investment in nuclear weapons.

In an op-ed published during the presidential campaign Biden supported a no first-use policy for nuclear weapons  and wrote inthat the purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterrence—and if necessary retaliating against attack

The Democratic Party’s platform adopted at the July 2020 convention called Donald Trump’s proposal for new nuclear weapons “unnecessary wasteful and indefensible.”

So far however Biden’s top Pentagon nominees have publicly backed all three legs of the nuclear triad—including the land-based missiles.

A major factor inhibiting the prospects for disarmament is the clout of defense contractors like Northrop Grumman which spent more than $12 million in lobbying in 2020 and provided Biden with $403072 during the 2020 election campaign.

Last July when Ro Khanna (D-CA) proposed an amendment that would transfer $1 billion or one percent of the GBSD’s projected cost into a pandemic preparedness fund  the amendment was voted down and Khanna was accused by Liz Cheney (R-WY) of playing into the hands of China which according to Cheney had caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cheney represents the district encompassing Cheyenne Wyoming which is home to the F.E. Warren Air Force Base where the GBSD will be based.

The city and surrounding region anticipate a major economic windfall from the GBSD.

In 2018 Cheney received $12000 from Northrop Grumman-affiliated Political Action Committees (PACs) and $10000 in 2020.(1)

Northrop donated money to congressional candidates in all the six states— Utah Wyoming Colorado Nebraska Montana and North Dakota —which would be beneficiaries of the new missile.

Polling data indicates that public support for developing nuclear weapons is lukewarm at best.

The freeze movement was a large-scale grassroots movement that promoted a reduction and ultimately elimination of nuclear weapons.

Placing a strong emphasis on grass-roots education it helped lay the groundwork for the INF Treaty which the Trump administration repealed in 2019.

At a zoom conference on Wednesday February 24th sponsored by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Katrina Vanden Heuval publisher of The Nation Magazine suggested that disarmament advocates should link up with the climate change movement which has generated a lot of enthusiasm.

In November of last year the U.S. Navy began to look into how it could extend the service lives of its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines beyond the now forty-two year planned life of the SSBNs. This could be necessary to ensure that that the Navy will be able to maintain its submarine force as the replacement Columbia-class SSBNs enter service.

A History

Designed in the 1970s the Ohio-class are the largest submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy and only the Russian Navy's Soviet-design Typhoon-class and Borei­-class are larger. However despite a smaller size than the Soviet/Russian boats the Ohio­-class subs were developed to carry twenty-four Trident II missiles – compared to the twenty missiles carried by the Typhoon-class and just sixteen by the original Borei class.

Throughout their service the Ohio-class SSBNs have been a key component of the United States ""nuclear-deterrent triad"" and currently the fourteen operational subs carry half of the nation's active strategic thermonuclear warheads.

A total of eighteen Ohio-class boats were constructed between 1981 and 1997 by the Groton Connecticut-based Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics. The U.S. Navy's submarines of the Pacific Fleet are currently based at Bangor Washington while those of the Atlantic Fleet are based at King's Bay Georgia. During deployment the submarines spend approximately seventy days at sea followed by twenty-five days in the dock for overhaul. Each of the SSBNs spends at least sixty-six percent of the time at sea.

(March 15 2004) - Night falls at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility Bremerton Wash. as work continues on the strategic missile submarine USS Ohio (SSGN-726). The USS Ohio is one of four Trident Submarines undergoing conversion to a new class of guided missile submarines. The SSGN conversion program takes Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines through an extensive overhaul that will improve their capability to support and launch up to 154 Tomahawk missiles. They will also provide the capability to carry other payloads such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Special Forces equipment. This new platform will also have the capability to carry and support more than 66 Navy SEALs (Sea Air and Land) and insert them clandestinely into potential conflict areas.

To reduce the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment the submarines were built with three large logistics hatches – and these provide large diameter supply and repair openings. The hatches allow the sailors to rapidly transfer supply pallets equipment replacement modules and other machinery components quickly. The SSBNs were also developed to operate for fifteen years or longer between overhauls.

Each SSBN has two crews – Blue and Gold which alternate manning the boats while on patrol. The crew consists of fifteen officers and one hundred forty four enlisted sailors. This further maximizes the SSBN's strategic availability while reducing the number of boats that are required to meet the strategic requirements and yet allow for proper crew training readiness and morale.

The Tech

The Ohio-class subs are powered by a pressurized water reactor (PWR) which drives the steam turbines to a single propeller shaft. The boats can attain depths in excess of eight hundred feet at speeds in excess of twenty-five knots.

Each of the submarines can carry the aforementioned twenty-four ballistic missiles with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads that can be accurately delivered to selected targets from almost anywhere in the world's oceans.

In accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) which was agreed in June 1992 the number of U.S. Navy strategic missile submarines was limited to fourteen beginning in 2002. Four of the boats of the Ohio-class were converted to conventionally-armed nuclear-powered (SSGNs) submarines.

The F-16 Fighting Falcon bears an unusual distinctions: it is one of the only top jet fighters in the world to also be cost efficient. Fast and extremely agile the light fighter does have some shortcomings in range and payload compared to larger twin-engine fighters like the F-15 Eagle but that was easy to forgive due to costing less than half as much—around $18 million in 1999 ($27 million in 2017 dollars). This favorable bang-for-buck ratio has not been lost on air forces across the world—the F-16 currently remains the most popular aircraft in modern military service: out of 4500 produced nearly 2700 currently remain in service in around twenty-six countries. Needless to say the cutting-edge fourth-generation fighter of the 1980s will remain with us for a good while longer.

The F-16 was born out of the conundrum experienced by the Air Force in the Vietnam War. Fast and heavy F-4 Phantom fighters had underperformed against the North Vietnamese Air Force due to their immature long-range missile technology and lack of aptitude for tight maneuvering in dogfights. This led a faction known as the Fighter Mafia to argue that Air Force had its design priorities all wrong and that what was really needed was a relatively cheap lightweight airframe that maximized energy for short-range dogfights rather than another heavy twin-engine fighter like the F-15 Eagle that was then under development which would doubtlessly be over-reliant on defective guided missiles. (In fact the Eagle went on to prove it was in fact possible to create a very maneuverable twin-engine jet fighter if you didn’t mind the cost—and air-to-air missiles would improve dramatically as well.)

Support for a light fighter eventually consolidated in the Pentagon due to simple economics: the Air Force liked the F-15 but realized it was too expensive to equip all of its fighter squadrons so it came to seek a “high-low” force mix. Eventually two prototypes faced off in a competitive trial in 1974: the Northrop YF-17 and the General Dynamics YF-16. The latter was unanimously found to be more responsive while the former evolved into the Hornet fighters now serving in the Marines and U.S. Navy. The first production F-16As went on to enter service in 1980 joined by the two-seat F-16B variant.

The single-engine F-16 leveraged new design technologies to maximize kinematic performance. A powerful Pratt & Whitney F100 engine with the intake slung under the fuselage could generate an excellent thrust-to-weight ratio due to the overall lightness of the Falcon propelling the F-16 to twice the speed of sound at high altitude. Pronounced strakes bulged out like the hood of a cobra from the fuselage to support the cropped delta wings enabling very high roll rates. A bulging bubble canopy afforded an excellent field of view for the pilot who was lounged in a seat angled thirty degrees back so as to mitigate the G-forces from violent maneuvers. And the F-16 could pull off very violent maneuvers indeed becoming the first jet fighter able to pull nine Gs in a turn—tighter than any other U.S. fighter until the advent of the F-22 Raptor. This explains the type’s service in the Air Force’s Thunderbirds aerobatics team.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ol4ZhV8WX0I"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In fact to maximize its maneuverability the F-16 was intentionally designed to be aerodynamically unstable—a deficit which its Flight Control System automatically compensated for. This worked thanks to the F-16’s then-revolutionary fly-by-wire control scheme which basically meant that the pilot’s controls were interpreted via an electronic interface instead of via hydraulic or cable-connected manual controls. Not only were fly-by-wire controls more reliable but they made it possible for the flight computer to correct the pilot’s maneuvers as necessary to avoid exceeding the Falcon’s tolerances. Another feature was an integrated throttle in the joystick known as Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) enabling much smoother operation by the pilot. Fly-by-wire and HOTAS have since become standard features in modern combat aircraft.

Unlike the early model F-14 and F-15s the Falcon was also designed as a multirole fighter and it could lug up to seventeen thousand pounds of munitions or electronic-warfare gear on its eleven hardpoints including a new generation of precision guided weapons such as Maverick missiles and laser-guided bombs. A twenty-millimeter Vulcan cannon in the lower fuselage served as a backup weapon.

Ironically while the Fighter Mafia had little faith in guided missile technology the F-16 arrived just when such weapons attained a new level of efficiency and the Falcon’s APG-66 doppler radar Heads Up Display and targeting computers were able to leverage these weapons to deadly effect. This was demonstrated in June 1982 when Israeli F-15s and F-16As engaged in a massive three-day air battle over the Bekaa Valley against Syrian jet fighters. The Israeli Falcons downed forty-four Syrian MiG-21s and -23s without suffering a single loss. A year earlier in 1981 the Falcons had demonstrated their versatility when eight of the brand-new fighters bombed the Osirak reactor in Baghdad with sixteen two-thousand-pound Mark 84 bombs bringing Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program to a halt.

By the mid-1980s the currently serving F-16C and two-seat D models entered service. These boasted modernized avionics such as liquid-crystal displays and new APG-68 radars that allowed for long-range missile engagements with newer AIM-7 Sparrow and forthcoming AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. The C and D have since undergone several more incremental upgrades including better radars GPS-targeted weapon capabilities and the integration of the AIM-9X Sidewinder heat-seeking missile which the pilot can target using a helmet-mounted cuing system—permitting an F-16 to shoot at an enemy within visual range without having to line them up directly in front of its nose.

The U.S. F-16 fleet first saw action in the 1991 Gulf War where it flew more than thirteen thousand strike missions loaded down with two-thousand-pound bombs and Maverick missiles. F-16s embarked on the largest air strike ever over downtown Baghdad during the seventy-two-ship Form Q—though two of the Falcons were shot down by air-defense missiles during the raid and their pilots captured. One squadron took on “Wild Weasel” duties by hunting down Iraqi surface-to-air missile batteries with AGM-88 Harm missiles.

The Air Force also attempted to boost the F-16 as a replacement for the A-10 Thunderbolt in the Close Air Support role by equipping F-16Cs and Ds of the 138th Fighter Squadron with Pave Claw thirty-millimeter Gatling cannon pods. However the lightweight jets were so shaken up by the weapon’s recoil that the idea was abandoned and the A-10 fleet survived yet another of many assassination attempts by the Air Force brass.

After the formal end of hostilities F-16s enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq scored the first kill using the long-range AIM-120 Scorpion missile when they downed a speedy MiG-25 Foxbat.

Since the Gulf War the Falcon has been ubiquitous in U.S. and NATO air campaigns over the former Yugoslavia Iraq and Syria. American and Belgian F-16s shot down additional enemy fighters over Serbia and Kosovo during the 1990s though two were brought down by Serb surface-to-air missiles. The F-16s sold abroad have also seen action in plenty of conflicts. Pakistani F-16s shot down ten Soviet and Afghan aircraft on its border during the 1980s. In 1992 two Venezuelan Falcons pilots played a key role in defeating a coup by supporters of Hugo Chávez by shooting down two rebel OV-10 Broncos and a Tucano trainer.

By one count the Falcon has shot down seventy-six enemy aircraft while only suffering one or two losses in aerial combat generally under ambiguous circumstances (a Pakistani F-16 shot down another by accident; a Greek Mirage downed a Turkish F-16 in what had formerly been mock aerial combat). And of course Falcons have continued to serve as bomb-toting workhorses for air strikes on targets in Lebanon Iraq Libya Syria Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The most sophisticated F-16 in service today aren’t in the U.S. Air Force unit but rather Block 62 F-16Es and Fs ordered by the United Arab Emirates. The new F-16s boast conformal fuel tanks that greatly extend the Falcon’s short range at minimal aerodynamic cost as well as an APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar. AESA radars represent the cutting edge of fighter-borne radar technology due to their superior resolution and lower visibility to enemy radars. Currently an even more advanced Block 70 version is being considered for production in India. However the costs for these newer Falcons have also skyrocketed.

Due to delays and cost overruns in the F-35 stealth fighter program the U.S. Air Force intends to continue flying its 1200 F-16s well into the 2040s by extending the airframe’s service life from eight to twelve thousand hours. The Fighting Falcon has proven to be a fine and versatile combat jet—and furthermore by one count it costs $22000 per flight hour to operate compared to $42000 for a twin-engine F-15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbTYxLXZ1bGNhbi1ndW4tY2FuLWZpcmUtNjAwMC1yb3VuZC1taW51dGUtMTgwMTk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M61 Vulcan: The Gun That Can Fire 6000 Round Per Minute,"The Vulcan first saw use in April 1965 in Vietnam when it was employed on an F-105 Thunderchief and has been used with the Air Force's F-15 F-16 and F-22 and the Navy's F-14 and F/A-18. It has also been fitted in side-firing installations on the Fairchild AC-11 as well as the Lockheed AC-130 gunships.

Just before the outbreak of the American Civil War inventor Richard Jordan Gatling designed the world's first successful rapid-fire weapon. Technically not a ""machine gun"" in the modern sense it was spring-loaded and hand-cranked. The forerunner to the weapons that were to come the Gatling gun's operation centered on a cyclic multi-barrel design that allowed for its rapid-fire but also facilitated cooling of the barrels.

The Gatling gun did see some limited use in the Civil War but proved its worth during the Spanish-American War when it was employed to great success in the campaign in Cuba. Declared obsolete in 1911 after 45 years of service with the U.S. military the concept of multi-barrels was explored again at the end of the Second World War.

A New Gatling Gun?

With the development of jet aircraft engineers with the United States Army Air Force determined that a higher rate of fire would be necessary and determined that single-barrel ""revolver cannons"" would not be up to the task. Instead designers at the Armament Division of General Electric considered the 19th-century concept of utilizing multi-barrels instead. Gatling had actually developed a prototype of his gun in the early 20th century that was fitted with an electric motor – replacing the hand crank – and it was able to reach a rate-of-fire of nearly 3000 rounds per minute.

However the U.S. military saw problems with the technology and in truth the concept was ahead of its time.

General Electric took up ""Project Vulcan"" in 1946 to develop the 20mm rotary cannon that could be capable of firing 7200 rounds per minute. The use of multiple barrels minimized barrel erosion and heat generation which prolonged the weapon's life. In modern aircraft the M61 was designed to be hydraulically driven and electrically primed. It was also developed to utilize a linkless ammunition feed system.

The Vulcan War Born

The Vulcan first saw use in April 1965 in Vietnam when it was employed on an F-105 Thunderchief and has been used with the Air Force's F-15 F-16 and F-22 and the Navy's F-14 and F/A-18. It has also been fitted in side-firing installations on the Fairchild AC-11 as well as the Lockheed AC-130 gunships. The weapon can fire 6000 RPM (or rounds per minute)

General Dynamics which acquired the Armament Division of General Electric currently produces the M61A1 and M61A2 improved versions with the latter being 20 percent lighter and is meant for applications where weapon system weight reduction is critical.

Other variants of the Vulcan platform have also been deployed on AH-1G Cobra helicopters. In addition to use in aircraft the M61 Vulcan also serves as the basis for the U.S. Navy's Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system – the rapid-fire computer-controlled radar-guided gun that can be used against anti-ship missiles and other close-in threats on land and at sea.

There are various foods and snacks that instantly remind you of your childhood and many of us probably have at least one cereal that does just that. If yours is General Mills’ Trix then we have some very good news for you: There are new Trix Treats that will remind you of a simpler time when all we had to worry about was having enough milk for a second bowl of cereal.

The new Trix Treats are bars that let you eat cereal on the go (which also means that you don’t have to worry about having enough milk). They’re made up of Trix cereal in six shapes — that’s right the actual fruit shapes not the round puffs — including watermelon grapes and orange. They’re held together by a confectionary coating aka the milk element.

The General Mills treats have been spotted in Walmart by various Instagram accounts including @cereallife. They were also recently listed on Meijer’s website so the good news is that they’re not exclusive to any store. The cereal bars come in packs of 16 so you’ll have plenty to keep in your pantry or bag for when you need a quick breakfast or snack.

The Trix treats join an already solid list of other bars modeled after General Mills cereals. Hopefully they earn in a spot in your rotation of Cinnamon Toast Crunch Bars Lucky Charms Bars Golden Grahams S’mores Bars and more. They even join another Trix bar that if you ask us doesn’t look nearly as good as this new one.

But when Leslie Park and Edward Baker came together in Minneapolis more than 60 years ago they changed the face of downtown — creating the city's first skyways.

The son of a general store merchant Park was born in 1901 in Balsam Lake a northwestern Wisconsin town of a few hundred. Baker was born in 1926 in bustling Chicago the son of a Russian-born Jewish traveling salesman.

Park moved from Wisconsin to Minneapolis in the 1920s and eclipsed his father's business success back in Balsam Lake. By the early 1960s he had emerged as a major downtown real estate developer and forged a partnership with Baker an architect who had moved as a boy with his family to Minneapolis in 1932 graduating from West High School and the University of Minnesota.

Today Park and Baker are considered the fathers of Minneapolis' skyway system — downtown's nearly 10-mile human hamster maze response to the climate-controlled suburban malls that first sprang up in the 1950s.

As the pandemic casts doubt about the future viability of workaday downtowns it's fitting to flash back to this pair of downtown boosters who spawned the largest contiguous system of enclosed second-story bridges in the world.

When Southdale in Edina became the nation's first indoor mall in 1956 Park grew worried. The year before General Mills had bailed out as one of downtown Minneapolis' major employers relocating to a new campus in Golden Valley. ""He knew that downtown had to compete with the suburbs … or go down the tube"" Baker said later.

So Park began touting covered walkways to try to offset the weatherproof advantages of suburban malls despite concerns they would dampen street-level commerce. Baker's sketches turned Park's idea into glass-and-steel reality in 1962: a pedestrian bridge spanning Marquette Avenue connecting Park's new Northstar Center development with Northwestern National Bank across the street.

""Leslie Park was more so the designer/visionary and Baker was the one who executed the projects"" said Katie Thornton a Minneapolis historian and Fulbright-National Geographic digital storytelling fellow. Her 47-minute podcast explores the good the bad and the ugly of skyways (99percentinvisible.org/episode/beneath-the-skyway).

That first glass-sheathed walkway was razed in the late 1980s during construction of the Norwest Bank (later Wells Fargo) tower. But on June 12 1963 Park opened a second skyway that still spans 7th Street linking Northstar Center to the Roanoke Building.

The name ""skyway"" came from the Campbell Mithun (now Mithun) advertising agency one of Park's tenants; other cities called their pedestrian bridges skywalks or skybridges. Minneapolis' skyways eventually grew to connect 80 downtown blocks.

Park ""was really my Medici"" Baker told the Star Tribune in 2004 (referring to the powerful Italian medieval bankers) two years before he died at the age of 80.

Baker was especially proud of his design contributions to the 57-story IDS Tower which opened in 1972 as the tallest skyscraper in Minneapolis and the first major downtown development with skyway connections on four sides. By then a dozen skyways had been built prompting boosters to hail downtown's growing national reputation as ""a 'second-floor' city of the future.""

In a 2002 interview with Skyway News which he had purchased in 1990 Baker said: ""Before the skyways second-floor space wasn't too desirable. So much of it was pawnshops watch and eyeglass repair and sewing and seamstress shops."" Calling the skyways ""a network rather than as individual bridges"" he said they revitalized Minneapolis' core: ""People can live downtown and also be connected with it.""

More than just skyway pioneers Baker and Park each were deeply involved in civic causes. Baker was president and founder of the Hennepin Center for the Arts among other contributions and Park was a charter member and president of the Downtown Council and a founder of the Citizens League of Minneapolis.

When Park died at 76 in 1977 the Minneapolis Tribune lauded his civic role and said ""he combined a rare ability to envision what might be done and the business skill needed to turn visions into reality.""

That reality now has morphed into ""a giant octopus reaching its tentacles ever deeper into downtown"" according to historian Iric Nathanson who has written about skyways for MinnPost and MNopedia.com.

It was just as downtown retailers had predicted in 1972 just as the IDS Tower kicked the skyway system into hyperdrive: ""Government and business leaders throughout the nation and from foreign countries have come to downtown Minneapolis to see Les Park's dream become a reality this major new way of life for downtown Minneapolitans.""

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wMy93aHktZ20tYWRkZWQtbmV3LTIwMjEtY2hldnktc2lsdmVyYWRvLWdtYy1zaWVycmEtdHJpbS1sZXZlbHMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzAzL3doeS1nbS1hZGRlZC1uZXctMjAyMS1jaGV2eS1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tZ21jLXNpZXJyYS10cmltLWxldmVscy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why GM Added New 2021 Chevy Silverado GMC Sierra Trim Levels,"As GM Authority covered previously General Motors is introducing a new trim level for the 2021 Chevy Silverado and 2021 GMC Sierra. The new trim for the Chevy Silverado is tagged with RPO code 2FL and is based on the LT while the new trim for the GMC Sierra trim is tagged with RPO code 3VL and is based on the Elevation. However the question is this – why did GM introduce these new trim levels for the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra?

Before we launch into the why behind the new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra trim levels let’s start by looking at the what. Both new trims are available exclusively in Double Cab 4WD and Crew Cab / Short Bed 4WD body configurations and come equipped with the turbocharged 2.7L I4 L3B gasoline engine and GM eight-speed automatic transmission. Both also come with all-terrain blackwall tires offered as optional on other trims while the new Silverado trim gets an eight-inch touchscreen and wired Apple CarPlay / Android Auto as standard.

Breaking it down it looks as though the new trim levels for the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra will offer a better lease deal than the respective trims upon which they are based which in this case would be the LT trim for the Silverado (RPO code 1LT) and the Elevation trim for the Sierra (RPO code 3SB). The reasoning behind this is higher residual values for the new trims namely the 2FL trim for the Silverado and the 3VL trim for the Sierra. Thus GM will be able to “discount” the standard turbocharged engine with regard to the vehicle sticker price.

In other words General Motors is expecting a higher residual value for the new trim levels which means lower lease payments given the overall vehicle depreciation factor.

In downtown Flint Mich. stands a pantheon of statues dedicated to automotive pioneers. David Buick and Louis Chevrolet the namesakes of two of General Motors’ classic brands are both world famous. Some Flintstones would like to add a statue of a lesser-known figure: Genora Johnson leader of the Women’s Emergency Brigade during the 1936-37 Flint Sit Down Strike.

The strike began on December 30 1936 when autoworkers occupied GM’s Fisher One plant demanding better wages more job security and an end to the hated assembly line “speed up” which so exhausted the workers that they could barely pick up a fork to eat at the end of the shift. That night the “cut and sew” women in the upholstery department were ordered to leave the plant to deter rumors of sexual mingling among strikers.

When Genora Johnson first offered to volunteer at strike headquarters in Flint’s Pengelly Building she was assigned to the kitchen like all the other members of the Ladies’ Auxiliary. Johnson a striker’s wife long devoted to socialist causes thought women belonged on the front lines of the strike beside their husbands brothers fathers and sons. First she organized a picket line outside Fisher One. Her two-year-old son held a placard reading “My Daddy Strikes for Us Little Tykes.”

From With Babies and Banners

On February 11 1937 the Flint police attacked Fisher Two in what became known as the Battle of the Running Bulls. The strikers repelled the police by pelting them with door hinges and spraying them with fire hoses. During their retreat the police opened fire wounding 14 unionists. After the shooting stopped Johnson urged a group of women to break through the police lines and protect the men inside the plant from further violence.

“I ask all the women here tonight to come down and stand with your husbands and brothers” she declared through a loudspeaker mounted on a sound car. “If the police are cowards enough to shoot down defenseless men they’re cowards enough to shoot down women. Women of the city of Flint break through these police lines and come down here and stand with your husbands and your brothers your sons and your sweethearts.”

The Battle of the Running Bulls transformed the Ladies’ Auxiliary from a homemakers’ sodality to a quasi-military force. After the women formed a human shield outside Fisher Two they realized they were just as courageous as the men and just as capable of standing up to the police—maybe more so because the “flatfeet” as they call the cops wouldn’t attack women.

“We have got to organize the women” Johnson declared that night. “We have got to have a military formation of the women. If the cops start firing into the men the women can take the front line ranks. Let them dare to shoot women!”

The next day fifty mothers daughters wives and sisters gathered at the Pengelly Building in answer to Johnson’s call for women willing to place their bodies between police and strikers. “It can’t be somebody who’s weak of heart!” she announced. “You can’t get hysterical if your sister beside you drops down on a pool of blood. We can’t be bothered with having to take care of two people if one is injured and another is going to go hysterical. Do not sign up for the Women’s Brigade take your role in the strike kitchen take your role in the first aid station in the Ladies’ Auxiliary.”

The first to stand was a woman in her seventies.

“This is going to be difficult for you” Johnson cautioned.

“You can’t keep me out” the old woman insisted. “My sons work in that factory. My husband worked in that factory before he died and I have grandsons there.”

Of the thousand women who belonged to the Ladies’ Auxiliary four hundred joined the Women’s Emergency Brigade. Every member was issued a red beret and red armband with the white letters “E. B.” Johnson appointed herself captain. Tall with raw-boned features a deep background in labor rhetoric and a commanding manner she was a natural leader. Her five lieutenants each commanded a squadron ready to gather outside a factory at the summons of a phone call.

The women adopted a military-style costume of jodhpurs a waist-length jacket and knee-high boots. And they armed themselves. From the men inside Fisher One one woman acquired a blackjack attaching it to a wristlet concealed inside her sleeve so she could flick it out at the first sign of trouble. All the women in the Brigade carried billy clubs their handles whittled down to fit a female grip.

Women's Emergency Brigade picketer smashes a window at Chevrolet Plant 9. From With Babies and Banners.

The Brigade got its first taste of battle when the strikers attempted to capture and occupy two Chevrolet engine plants. At Chevy Nine plant police resisted the takeover by firing tear gas at workers inside the plant. As the close air of the shop floor filled with the choking smoke a striker broke a window. Pushing his bloodied face through the hole in the glass he shouted to the women on the sidewalk “They are gassing us! They are gassing us!”

“Smash the windows!” ordered a voice from the union sound car.

Dressed for battle in red berets and armbands parading with an American flag at the head of their column thirty Brigade members pulled billy clubs out from under their long winter coats and swung them at the bank of windows.

“They’re gassing our husbands!” one woman yelled. “Give them air!”

The women shattered every pane they could reach littering the shop floor with tinkling shards of glass. Tear gas flowed out through the jagged holes. When the Flint police attempted to arrest a club-wielding Brigade member she wriggled in their grasp shrieking “Get your hands off me!”

From With Babies and Banners

(The next day’s New York Times reported their action under the headline “Women’s Brigade Uses Heavy Clubs.” The Flint Journal wrote “These women smashed scores of windows in the plant in a hysterical frenzy seemingly with an urge to destroy for officials could find no other reason for smashing glass in window after window.”)

After the strikers captured Chevy Four the Brigade formed a barricade around the plant.

“What kind of cowards hide behind women?” a cop bellowed loudly enough so the men inside the plant could hear.

Johnson took this taunt personally. Climbing into the sound car she grabbed the microphone to denounce the company’s “hired thugs.”

“We don’t want any violence” she declared. “We don’t want any trouble. My husband is one of the Sit Down Strikers. We are going to fight to protect our men.”

From With Babies and Banners

The strikers occupied GM’s plants for 44 days before the company capitulated allowing the United Auto Workers to negotiate on their behalf. The strike guaranteed middle class wages and benefits for autoworkers for generations to come.

Wearing the red beret of the Women's Emergency Brigade Genora Johnson Dollinger addresses the UAW in 1977 using the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Flint strikes to demand the union include issues like child care in contract negotiations. From With Babies and Banners.

At the Sit-Downers Memorial Park outside UAW Region 1-D in Flint there is a bronze statue of an anonymous Women’s Emergency Brigade member smashing a window with a billy club. On White Shirt Day held every February 11 in Flint to commemorate the strike’s end women dressed in red berets and armbands serve bean soup bread and apples food the Sit Downers ate in the plants. Genora Johnson though has never been memorialized. A downtown statue of Flint’s Spartan woman would honor not only her but all the women who played a role in winning the Sit-Down Strike.

The Japanese started it — the small pickup truck craze that swept America in the ’70s and ’80s. Back then pickup trucks were utilitarian devices meant for picking stuff up here and dropping it off there. Those early models from Datsun and Toyota were minimalistic practical tough as nails and cheap. Their interiors featured painted metal and vinyl. That was before the pickup truck morphed into a version of the Lincoln Town Car complete with heated and cooled seats 27 speaker stereos 4 zone climate systems and 10 speed automatic transmissions.

Today electric vehicle startups are popping up everywhere. One of the latest is Alpha Motor located in sunny Irvine California. Like most of its contemporaries it starts with a reconfigurable skateboard that incorporates the battery motor(s) BMS and chassis components. Once you have that you can plop any body you want on top much as Canoo is doing.

Since December Alpha has unleashed a series of proposed electric vehicles it says will be available to the public in 2023. All of them are computer renderings at this stage. No actual vehicles have been built so far as we know. Those renderings show the Ace a 2 door coupe and two variations — one for off-road use and the second with more sporting intentions. Now the company has pulled the cover off another design exercise a small electric pickup truck bulked up with some serious off-road equipment it calls the Alpha Wolf.

Available as either a single-motor front-wheel-drive truck or as a dual-motor all-wheel-drive vehicle this canyon basher is said to have a 75 kWh battery a range of 250 miles and a towing capacity of 3000 lb. Its two seats vertical center touchscreen large frunk and a toolbox in the 5½ foot-long load bed are complemented by huge wheel arches big knobledy tires a front push bar and a roll bar festooned with extra lighting. All in all it’s an off-roaders dream that sells for $36000 before tax credits and incentives. The dual-motor version lists for $46000.

As Autoblog points out the Alpha Wolf is fully 2 feet shorter than a basic Toyota Tacoma Access Cab and priced well below electric pickups coming from General Motors Ford Rivian and Bollinger. The Tesla Cybertruck will give it a run for its money but for those who like the look of a mini-truck from the ’70s the Alpha Wolf is just the ticket. It’s even painted the same color blue that was so popular on the Datsun 620 trucks of 50 years ago.

The Ace Coupe

Last December Alpha Motor unveiled its Ace coupe a retro-styled two-door car based on the same electric car platform as the Wolf but two feet shorter overall. Since then it has teased two other variations of that car a Performance Edition and a jacked up off-roader called Jax that appropriately enough closely resembles the Wolf. It differs from the Coupe primarily by having two half doors in front to the rear wheels for easier access to the vestigial jump seats in back.

Will Alpha Motor ever actually produce one (or all) of these cars? That remains to be seen. Every shade tree mechanic in the land wants to build electric cars these days just as every blacksmith and bicycle mechanic wanted to build horseless carriages 120 years ago. Some succeeded but most never got off the ground or failed shortly after they started production.

We applaud anyone who wants to take a shot at the EV market today but without a factory and an established supply chain the odds of success are very much against these visionaries. That being said if Alpha Motor ever calls to offer us a test drive we will be out the door and on an airplane faster than you can say “EV startup!” Picking winners and losers is easy to do after the fact. Doing it in advance is the tricky part.

Mexico on Friday approved the anti-viral drug remdesivir for emergency use treating COVID-19 patients in the Latin American country one of the worst hit by the pandemic.

Regulatory agency Cofepris said it had authorized the medicine for use exclusively by hospitals and specialist doctors during the early stages of the illness.

Mexico joins other countries including the United States Canada and Japan as well as the European Commission that have approved the treatment for use against the coronavirus.

Remdesivir made by US pharma giant Gilead was one of the first drugs to show relative promise in shortening the time to recovery in some COVID-19 patients.

But its efficacy in reducing the mortality rate is unproven.

A World Health Organization-backed study said in October that the drug had ""little or no effect"" on COVID mortality.

Mexico a country of 126 million people has recorded more than 193000 known COVID-19 deaths—the world's third-highest toll.

Processing over $120 billion in payments annually WEX focuses on transactions across four main divisions—corporate payments travel healthcare and fleet. As WEX added some of the world’s largest virtual card portfolios and online travel agencies to its client roster it was clear the company needed to rethink its tech infrastructure. WEX had to simultaneously scale up the number of payments processed and reduce the amount of time it took to process those payments. “The financial technology payments space requires immediate scalability with subsecond response times for creating and processing cards” says Mark Aquilina senior vice president of product and strategy for corporate payment solutions at WEX. “Before we migrated to AWS it took us 2 to 3 seconds to generate cards and facilitate card payments. After migrating our proprietary processing environment to AWS we were able to process almost all card requests in subseconds. This has been critical to our success in signing multiple large global online travel agencies and financial technology partners.” WEX considered multiple cloud providers and chose AWS because of its size scale and ease of use. Plus the tech tools AWS provided put it over the top in WEX’s evaluation. “The primary reason for migrating to AWS was so that WEX could maintain multiple services—across our card processing card management and payment delivery functions—that are instantly scalable highly deliverable and distributed in the cloud” says Aquilina.



Using Cloud Capabilities to Stay above the Competition

WEX began building on AWS in 2014 starting its digital transformation process by developing its payment processing engine and supplier services for its financial institution customers. For those large customers that sometimes completed over 500 million transactions per day WEX needed a solution that enhanced uptime and dependability while also enabling the company to scale rapidly in response to future growth opportunities. To accomplish this massive project successfully teams from WEX consulted AWS and the team from AWS took the time to learn and understand WEX’s business. “It wasn’t just a lift and shift” says Aquilina. “It was a thoughtful migration to the cloud. AWS made recommendations reviewed our plans responded to our request for new features and helped streamline our larger migration moves.” In addition to using Amazon EFS the company used Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) which makes it simple to set up operate and scale a relational database in the cloud. WEX also used Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) a web service that provides secure resizable compute capacity designed to make cloud computing simpler for developers and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) a high-performance block storage service designed for use in Amazon EC2 for transaction-intensive workloads—like the ones WEX was deploying in the cloud. “Because we’re not manually purchasing and deploying infrastructure and server racks we can build experiment with and deploy solutions on AWS very quickly” says Aquilina. “There are many things we can now do with ease on AWS that were extremely difficult and time consuming for us to do before.” One challenge for WEX—and in the business-to-business space at large—is developing systems and services that bridge the gap between accounts payable and accounts receivable. Invoices generated from accounts-payable systems are often challenging for accounts-receivable systems to interpret. But by using AWS services WEX was able to build connectivity and interpretation layers between its cloud-based card-issuing and merchant-payments services that help bridge the gap between the two market spaces. “We can facilitate data-rich payments from buyers to suppliers with ease and scale those services up quickly on AWS and that creates a unique position for WEX in the marketplace—one that we think is completely unmatched by any other provider” says Aquilina. WEX has been able to migrate multiple corporate payment services to AWS enabling the company to create new features for its customers and develop new analytics tools for itself. “AWS is really effective in making recommendations that help us achieve rapid time to market with new features” says Aquilina. “Now we’re able to focus our time on enhancing solutions versus supporting the underlying infrastructure.”



Automating Payments around the World

WEX is localized in six countries and issues in 21 currencies. “We have the ability to scale in many places and with many currencies and capabilities” Aquilina says. “We could never have achieved this level of global scale or such a rich capability set without having the nimbleness and the scalability of the cloud.” WEX is working on migrating its payment delivery service onto AWS next. This migration slated for early 2021 will enable WEX to use its industry-leading payment robotics tools to automate the placement and delivery of payments to partners and merchants all around the world. By the fourth quarter of 2021 WEX plans on migrating its EnCompass service—a front-end card account management system for clients—to AWS. For WEX building natively on AWS means the company has more freedom to experiment with new features to entice new customers as well as the scalability to bring those customers on quickly and simply. “Some of our largest legacy services—like our Transact Global (TAG) card processing service—have been cloud native since 2014” says Aquilina. “And our resulting nimbleness and agility in serving our partners has been a key differentiator that continues to enable WEX to outpace its competitors.”

The company has closed in on another $600 million at a valuation of $95 billion.

Stripe said it will use the funding to expand its business in Europe with a focus on its European HQ and also to beef up its global payments and treasury network.

“We’re investing a ton more in Europe this year particularly in Ireland” said John Collison president and co-founder of Stripe in a statement. “Whether in fintech mobility retail or SaaS the growth opportunity for the European digital economy is immense.”

Stripe said the financing included backing from two major insurance players. Allianz via its Allianz X fund and Axa are in the round along with Baillie Gifford Fidelity Management & Research Company Sequoia Capital and an investor from the founders’ home country Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).

The insurance angle may point to which direction the company is looking to go next. After all fintech and insurance are closely aligned.

“Stripe is an accelerator of global economic growth and a leader in sustainable finance. We are convinced that despite making great progress over the last 10 years most of Stripe’s success is yet to come” said Conor O’Kelly CEO of NTMA in a statement. “We’re delighted to back Ireland’s and Europe’s most prominent success story and in doing so to help millions of other ambitious companies become more competitive in the global economy.”

The big round rising valuation and growing cap table will inevitably lead to questions around where the company is standing with regard to its next steps and whether that will include a public listing. Stripe has long kept its cards close to its chest when it comes to user numbers revenues and profit and those details once again are not being disclosed with the news today nor has it made any comments on IPO plans.

Notably the confirmation of the news today is at a lower valuation than the valuation Stripe was reportedly trading at on the secondary market which was $115 billion. The round that closed at a $95 billion valuation was also rumored to be coming in at a higher number over $100 billion.

It’s not clear whether those numbers were never accurate or if COVID had an impact on pricing or if European investors simply drove a hard bargain.

The focus on growing in Europe also puts the hiring of Peter Barron — the former EMEA VP of communications for Google and a former journalist — into some context.

Founded in 2010 by John and his brother Patrick Collison (the CEO) Stripe is one of a wave of commerce startups that saw the value of building a simple way for developers to integrate payments into any app or site by way of a few lines of code at a time when digital and specifically online payments were starting to take off.

Behind that code the company had done all the hard work of integrating all the different and complex pieces needed to make payments work both in countries and across borders. Over the years the company has built out a bigger platform around that a suite of services to position itself as a one-stop shop not just for helping businesses run all of the commercial aspects of their operations including incorporation managing fraud managing cash flow and more.

Within that Stripe has built out a decent footprint in Europe with the region accounting for 31 of the 42 countries where it has customers today. While Stripe may have had its start and early traction providing payments infrastructure for startups (and especially small new startups) today that list includes a lot of big names too. In Europe customers include Axel Springer Jaguar Land Rover Maersk Metro Mountain Warehouse and Waitrose alongside Deliveroo (U.K.) Doctolib (France) Glofox (Ireland) Klarna (Sweden) ManoMano (France) N26 (Germany) UiPath (Romania) and Vinted (Lithuania).

Even with heavy competition in payments and adjacent services there is a huge opportunity for more growth. Stripe says that in the wake of COVID and the rise of people shopping considerably more across the web and apps rather than in person currently some 14% of commerce happens online a big shift considering that just a year ago it was about 10%.

Cryptocurrencies are still a novel asset class and a true understanding of their valuation and price movement is elusive compared with traditional asset classes within a well-diversified portfolio. It’s also important to remember that Bitcoin has only existed in a world of rising equity markets and low inflation. That said it is still useful to think about the future trajectory of Bitcoin and assess the challenges that must be overcome for cryptocurrencies to emerge as a credible allocation for institutional investors.

Challenges Facing Bitcoin Investors

A variety of challenges need to be overcome in order for Bitcoin to be considered a defensible choice for institutional investors. These include valuation concerns risks stemming from the complexities inherent to the asset and the long-term sustainability of the Bitcoin market.

Valuation. The lack of a tangible backing yield or income makes assessing the value of Bitcoin a complicated process and partly explains its elevated volatility levels.

The challenges in determining the intrinsic value of an unbacked cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin are numerous and complex. Existing fiat currency valuations are determined partly via expected cashflows and valuation metrics that are ultimately tied to a country’s growth and inflation patterns. With Bitcoin there are no expected future cash flows that can be discounted to the present. Valuation is therefore based solely on supply/demand factors and predicated on the hope that future investors will pay more for this intangible asset. As a result the risk of Bitcoin losing almost all of its value is not negligible.

The wide dispersion of Bitcoin price targets among different market observers is one indicator of the difficulty in valuing cryptocurrencies. Some commentators believe that Bitcoin has the potential to displace gold as a primary alternative store of value in the form of “digital gold.” In this vein based on an equalization with the US$2.7 trillion global private stock of gold JP Morgan recently suggested a long-term target price for Bitcoin of US$146000.[5] In December the CIO of Guggenheim Investments suggested a fair value of US$400000.[6] On the other hand UBS recently expressed that they “are somewhat skeptical of any essential real-world use cases… [and]are cognizant of the real risk of losing one’s entire investment.”[7]

Risks. The boundary between theory and practice is considerable in the case of cryptocurrencies – and even more so for institutional investors looking to gain exposure to them. Outside of valuation the complexities of investing in Bitcoin are multifaceted and include a range of risks that few investors are equipped to manage. These risks include those posed by a lack of understanding of the technology underpinning the crypto; fragmented regulatory frameworks; technical vulnerabilities (e.g. bugs in the code risk of cybertheft); competitive risks (e.g. low barriers to entry for new cryptoassets); uncertainty in the application of accounting rules to cryptocurrencies; and environmental concerns related to the energy required for mining new Bitcoins.

Sustainability. In a non-asset-backed cryptocurrency market that moves purely on supply and demand –and is deliberately divorced from all discernible investing fundamentals – a logical question remains as to whether a particular cryptocurrency will continue to exist over the time horizon of an institutional portfolio. The comment provided by UBS above certainly gave us pause.

The Way Forward: Regulation

We are firm believers that the technological innovation that underpins cryptocurrencies will transform the global payments market going forward. The notion of waiting days for a transaction to clear will soon become as archaic as mailing a personal check and waiting for the mail carrier to deliver it. The remaining question however is whether Bitcoin is that payments future. At the moment it is not.

Though the prospect of regulation seeks to deny the rogue birthright of cryptocurrencies regulated cryptocurrencies would become more stable mediums of exchange and stores of value which would open them up for consideration as a currency-like asset class. With rules and regulations in place mainstream acceptance and adoption would follow and higher acceptance would attract more capital to the space providing more liquidity and ultimately reducing volatility.

Recent regulatory guidance in both the United States[8] and Europe[9] offers examples of regulators’ initial attempts to provide clarity which should accelerate the legitimization process of cryptocurrencies as a whole. Conversely further regulation may have the offsetting effect of dampening the interest of investors who are wary of authority and who were attracted to cryptocurrencies by the anonymity they provided. Nonetheless we believe regulation is a requirement for widespread institutional adoption.

Closing Thoughts

Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has grown over the years. Despite the potential diversification benefits of Bitcoin the challenge of determining its value and identifying its fundamental risk and return drivers is a major hurdle to understanding its role and purpose within a broader portfolio.

Although Bitcoin is the current cryptocurrency leader no one can be assured that this dominant position will last. For investors who are determined to take on a cryptocurrency allocation as a strategic long-term holding a diversified basket of cryptocurrencies may be appropriate. Another option is gaining exposure via trend-following Commodity Trading Advisors or other types of hedge funds many of which implement real-time risk monitoring with defined risk guidelines.

Ultimately we believe each investment in a portfolio should have known drivers and relationships that allow investors to reasonably anticipate the environments in which it will excel or underperform. We currently characterize Bitcoin’s behavior as that of a speculative risk asset; we continue to follow its development and look to further define its place within a diversified portfolio.

The Associated Press

SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — Joey Gallo has spent several spring trainings in Arizona so the Texas Rangers slugger knows the difference between a real homer and the cheap high fly balls that can drift out of the park in the forgiving desert air.

The 27-year-old says his power surge through the first two weeks of exhibition games is real.

“It’s a different environment; it’s a different field” Gallo said. “But for me look I know I have power. I know the balls that I’ve hit so far this spring would probably go out of Globe Life Field anyway.”

Going into Saturday's games Gallo was tied with Joc Pederson of the Chicago Cubs for the major league lead with five homers through his first eight games and his nine RBIs matched six others for the lead.

That gives the Rangers hope that Gallo can bounce back from a tough 2020 season. The 6-foot-5 250-pounder has always had an all-or-nothing approach that often ends in a homer a walk or a strikeout.

But in last year's pandemic-shortened season it was a lot more “nothing” than “all.""

He finished with a .181 batting average and 10 homers — among the many reasons the Rangers finished last in the American League West with a 22-38 record.

Gallo is hoping to return to his All-Star form of 2019 when he had a career-high .253 average and a .389 on-base percentage.

He's pleased with his start but understands it matters only if it carries over into April.

“I wish these counted” Gallo said. “That would be awesome but they don’t.”

Here are a few other players who have been impressive during the first two weeks of exhibition action:

1B Matt Olson Athletics: The Oakland slugger is much like Gallo in trying to bounce back from an uneven 2020 when he hit just .195 though he did have a team-high 14 homers. He's had a good start with seven hits in his first 16 at-bats including three homers and three doubles.

LHP Madison Bumgarner Diamondbacks: The four-time All-Star had an encouraging first outing striking out six batters over two innings while giving up one hit. The 31-year-old signed an $85 million five-year deal with Arizona before last season but struggled to a 1-4 record and a 6.48 ERA. Also encouraging: His fastball velocity was back in the 90- to 91-mph range after sitting in the high 80s for much of last year.

2B/SS/3B Nico Hoerner Cubs: The versatile Hoerner can play just about anywhere and is looking as if he might be ready to take a step forward offensively. Chicago's 2018 first-round pick out of Stanford has nine hits in his first 17 at-bats including three doubles and a homer. He could be the team's starting second baseman on opening day.

LHP Robbie Ray Blue Jays: The 2017 All-Star had a tough time with his control last season — walking 45 batters in 51 2/3 innings — and was dealt at the trade deadline from Arizona to Toronto. He's shown dominant stuff at different points throughout his career and struck out a career-high 235 batters in 2019. He's looked closer to that version through three starts striking out 11 batters in 8 1/3 innings.

2B Brendan Rodgers Rockies: The third overall draft pick in 2015 has seven hits in his first 21 at-bats including two homers and looks as if he might be able to seize the starting job at second base. The 24-year-old has been a top prospect for several years and hit .350 with nine homers in 2019 at Triple-A Albuquerque.

RHP Lance Lynn White Sox: Chicago added the 33-year-old in an offseason trade and his first two starts have been solid. He's given up no runs over 4 2/3 innings while striking out eight. The durable right-hander pitched an MLB-high 84 innings for the Rangers last season and had a 6-3 record with a 3.32 ERA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNsb3NhbmdlbGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nwb3J0cy9kb2RnZXJzLWNvdWxkLWhhdmUtb3Zlci0xMTAwMC1mYW5zLWZvci1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMtcmluZy1jZXJlbW9ueS8yNTQ5NTEwL9IBhgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNsb3NhbmdlbGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nwb3J0cy9kb2RnZXJzLWNvdWxkLWhhdmUtb3Zlci0xMTAwMC1mYW5zLWZvci1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMtcmluZy1jZXJlbW9ueS8yNTQ5NTEwLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dodgers Could Have Over 11000 Fans For Opening Day World Series Ring Ceremony,"The Los Angeles Dodgers are a champion with the blues.

Last season was supposed to be the Dodgers turn to celebrate winning the Fall Classic on their own field. At the very least host a parade down Vin Scully Ave. Instead the bittersweet victory was filled with both jubilation and controversy.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the Dodgers were unable to host fans during the 2020 regular season when fans were finally allowed it was on a neutral field in Arlington Texas. And when they did finally vanquish the demons and win their first World Series since 1988 they were not allowed to celebrate with their fans.

Thankfully all that is about to change.

Thanks in large part to the county's vaccination efforts fans could be allowed back at Dodger Stadium on April 9th when the Dodgers play their first game at Dodger Stadium of the 2021 season against the Washington Nationals.

Los Angeles County is expected to move into the red tier of the state's four-tier coronavirus guidelines on Monday. That tier will allow Dodger Stadium to host fans at 20 percent occupancy roughly 11200 fans.

""It's going to be great. We miss them"" said World Series MVP Corey Seager when told of the news. ""To be the first time to celebrate with them winning the World Series it's going to be pretty special for sure.""

Ironically the last game Dodger fans were able to watch the team play live at Dodger Stadium was also against the Washington Nationals during Game 5 of the National League Division Series in October of 2019.

The Washington Post

The details on how the team will allocate available tickets has yet to be released but Monday's announcement of moving into the red tier means that fans will finally be able to celebrate with Clayton Kershaw and the rest of the team as they receive their World Series rings during the home opener.

The move in tier also means that fans will finally be able to watch Mookie Betts play baseball in a Dodger uniform for the first time at Dodger Stadium.

Tickets are expected to sellout fast if and when they do become available to the general public. Last month after 2400 tickets (also 20 percent capacity) were made available at Camelback Ranch for the Dodgers first spring training game they sold out in less than two hours.

In an another ironic twist Dodger Stadium is currently home to one of the largest vaccination sites in the country. That means that as more and more people become vaccinated more fans will be allowed inside the stadium to watch the Boys in Blue.

California currently has a four-tier format for reopening safely. Currently Los Angeles county is in the purple tier the most restrictive of all the tiers. Under the purple tier only 100 fans would be allowed in the stadium and no concessions would be sold.

In the red tier the stadium is allowed to open to 20 percent capacity and will be able to sell concessions. Shortly thereafter as more people are inoculated and conditions improve Los Angeles County can move into the more moderate orange tier.

Under the orange tier Dodger Stadium will be allowed to open to 33% capacity meaning over 18000 fans could be allowed inside Chavez Ravine after the month of April.

The fourth and final tier would be the yellow tier. Once LA County enters the yellow tier Dodger Stadium will be allowed to open to 67% capacity which would equal nearly 37000 fans.

On Thursday President Biden announced that he will direct all states to make every adult eligible to receive a vaccination by May 1. If that happens it remains within the realm of possibility that Dodger Stadium could open up to full capacity by the end of the 2021 season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMy8xNC9waG90b3Mtc3ByaW5nLWZvb3RiYWxsLWZsZXhpbmctcHJhaXJpZS12aWV3LWFtLWRlZmVhdHMtZ3JhbWJsaW5nLWluLWNvdmlkLTE5LWRlbGF5ZWQtc3RhdGUtZmFpci1jbGFzc2ljL9IBswFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMy8xNC9waG90b3Mtc3ByaW5nLWZvb3RiYWxsLWZsZXhpbmctcHJhaXJpZS12aWV3LWFtLWRlZmVhdHMtZ3JhbWJsaW5nLWluLWNvdmlkLTE5LWRlbGF5ZWQtc3RhdGUtZmFpci1jbGFzc2ljLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Spring football flexing!

BARTON Vt. — It’s a rambling old place a beloved five-story pale-blue clapboard building with icicles hanging from one roof and an old weathervane at the peak of another that sits just above a sign that reads: “Est. 1896.”

Walk the wooden floors and you’ll find something else that can be scarce at those big-box stores with massive parking lots fluorescent lighting and homogenized concrete aisles:

“Practically everything that you would want is here’' said Deborah Richards 74 who lives eight miles away in Westmore. “If they don’t have it they’ll get it for you. I wanted to make a bookshelf. They found the wood cut it to size. “I said ‘How much?’ And Art said ‘Take my wife to lunch.’ ’'

Art is Art LaPlante 53 who with his partner Mark Royer 50 are the proprietors of E.M. Brown & Son Inc. which is marking its 125th anniversary this year.

It’s a milepost of longevity.

And it’s a testament to customer loyalty earned across generations of people who have come to rely on the rambling old place for paint and for patience.

“Without them I wouldn’t have rebuilt my house’' 81-year-old Roy Gero who lives just up the road told me the other afternoon. “They’re friends. And they’re local.’'

Friends. Local. Art LaPlante and Mark Royer may as well have that stamped on their business cards because that’s precisely the way they describe their professional plan their approach to working beside one another after they first met 20 years ago.

LaPlante managed a hardware store a tad north of here. Royer who owned a small gourmet specialty food business was a customer at Art’s place.

When Barton’s hardware store came up for sale in 2007 they decided their skills complemented one another. LaPlante knew what makes hardware stores tick. Royer could run a business and he knew his way around payables and receivables.

“We always felt where one of us has a weakness the other has a strength’’' LaPlante told me as we talked over a wooden table upstairs from the cash registers. “We felt we could lean on each other.’’

So they have.

They’ve adjusted along the way. Their grain is now stored across the street so when a tractor-trailer pulls in to unload it doesn’t affect the flow of customers to their store.

“Being a hardware store in a small town you become a major hub’' LaPlante said. “I always tell people ‘Listen. You really need to listen. No matter who you are or where you’re from you need to become one of them.’ ’'

That has been the easy part for LaPlante and Royer. They’re working 50- to 80-hour workweeks.

“It seems like you’re always doing it’' LaPlante said. “If you’ve got a day when you’re not here you’re driving somewhere and you’re thinking about it. It’s basically seven days a week even though we’re closed on Sundays.’'

They have each other’s backs. And are there for each other when a delivery truck arrives at 5 a.m. or long after the sun sets.

“We’re right in the middle of it’' LaPlante said. “We’re not golfers. We don’t get those trucks at 5 a.m. or at 5 p.m. and look at our guys and say ‘OK you got that right?’ And then leave. We’re the ones. You are married to it.’'

They are married to their jobs. And to their families. They each have three children of similar ages: a teenager and two twentysomethings. They have similar work schedules too logging long hours together.

Along the way they’ve collected a loyal customer base and a catalog of stories that testify to a colorful life behind the counter in the heart of Barton.

With the big-box stores and the Walmarts of the world pressing in they know they need more than nostalgia — that Norman Rockwell image of the kindly shopkeeper — to survive in the 21st century marketplace.

“We tell our staff that no matter how big a smile a customer has when they walk in the door it’s important that they leave with a bigger smile’' Royer said.

They are collecting memories from their customers — favorite stories shared over the years — and are placing it on the counter so those special moments become a sort of community glue.

Those tales of this place stretch back more than a century now. It’s part of its secret sauce.

Stories like the customer who came in to recall his days as a kid when he and his buddies would run around the hardware store at night after closing time.

“He said ‘Well there was a place down back where you could pop the window out and come in and a whole group of us would run around and play tag’ ’' LaPlante said retelling the tale. “He said ‘Nobody ever knew we were in here. Nobody ever broke anything. Nobody ever stole anything. We just played tag.’ ’'

Sweet memories of a simpler time.

And then there was the time when a large man in bib overalls walked in.

“He was 6-foot-8 6-foot-9. Just a big guy’' LaPlante said. “And I said ‘Can I help you sir?’ And he said ‘Nope. All set. Just checking my weight.’ ’'

And then the man who clearly remembered his way around walked over to the store’s large scale used to weigh grain and other bulk products. As he stood on the industrial scale its measuring hand whipped around.

“It came around on that scale to around 8 o’clock so I’m guessing it was like 320 or a little more. I remember he would come in later and he’d wave and I knew right where he was going. Right to the scale.

“A lot of times it’s mothers in with multiple children and they go to that scale and the whole family will get on that scale. And the mother will say ‘When I was little my parents would bring me to this place.’ ’’

That’s an anecdote any smart retailer would relish.

“We’ve always talked about: ‘Market that. Market that.’ And we do’' LaPlante said.

It means remembering names. Honoring special events. Taking that extra step even after the close of business.

“We’re at a funeral or we’re at a wake. LaPlante told me. “We get invited to an anniversary party. A lot of that stuff comes with being business owners in this community. We looked at all those things and we said ‘Boy this community relies on us.’ ’'

And even now they’re looking ahead to the next owner. The next caretaker of something special.

So the heart of a small town doesn’t go the way of the buggy whip.

But I was asked to fix something’,"Mark Carney is no ordinary banker. He is the banker’s banker the superstar banker the George Clooney of banking possibly even the James Bond of banking. The accolades bestowed on him are many: he was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010 the world’s most trusted Canadian in 2011 and hailed as Britain’s most influential Catholic (by The Tablet) in 2015.

Since leaving his post as governor of the Bank of England in March last year Carney has turned his attention to saving the planet. He is now the United Nations’ special envoy for climate action and finance and has been appointed by Boris Johnson as finance adviser for the UK presidency of the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November. Then there is his new job at Brookfield Asset Management the world’s second-largest investor in climate-friendly businesses where he is in charge of the impact fund. (In February Carney was accused by climate experts of greenwashing after he claimed Brookfield was a “net zero” company. A few days later he tweeted an acknowledgment that Brookfield’s investments in renewable energy are not the same as having net-zero emissions.) Last month it was announced he had joined the board of US digital payments giant Stripe tasked with helping businesses fund emerging carbon-removal technologies. And he’s also managed to squeeze in a 600-page book Value(s): Building A Better World For All. In it Carney analyses the three global 21st-century crises: the financial crash Covid the climate crisis. He concludes that our values have been sacrificed at the altar of what is simply valuable; if we are to have any hope of avoiding an environmental Armageddon we must recover them.

Carney has just joined Twitter. He had no need for social media when he was at Threadneedle Street: pretty much anything he had to say was covered by the press. But fake Twitter accounts moved into the vacuum: Mark Dreamy Carney for example carries the biog “intercontinental banking superstar financial market heart-throb one of Canada’s greatest exports”.

His first real tweet on 15 February was accompanied by a short film in which a freezing red-nosed Carney said: “Hi I’m Mark Carney. No I’m really Mark Carney. This is part of the Twitter verification process and I’m here standing in a snowbank in Ottawa and I’m joining social media because I’ve been isolating like everybody else for the last several months and I want to reach out. And also because during that isolation I’ve written a book called Value(s)… And yes it’s really me.” Carney’s astonishment at finding himself on Twitter is in itself rather astonishing; at times like these even he appears to believe the hype.

When we speak on Zoom late last month he’s back in the warmth of his Ottawa home. “Hiya Simon good to see you. Where do I find you?” Carney is the epitome of urbane open-necked-shirt charm. “I know it’s been cold in the UK and it’s been snowing but we’ve got you beat. It’s minus 19 this morning.” I’ve always wondered whether -19C feels that much colder than say -2C in Britain. “It’s a good question. Some of the coldest I’ve felt has been in the UK because the humidity goes right through you. But at -20C you really feel it.” Carney is a natural schmoozer praising your questions stressing his candour.

So before getting to the book we segue to music football (he’s a huge Everton fan) and his exercise regime – he’s still running marathons in his mid-50s but only 7km a day in the extreme cold. Carney who holds Canadian Irish and UK passports waxes nostalgic about the great gigs he saw in Canada as a teenager: the Clash Bowie the Police. He smiles. “It wasn’t quite so embarrassing at the time to say ‘I went to see the Police.’” Why is it embarrassing now? “Well between you and me they went through a weird phase right? Sting got a bit…” And he comes to a cautious stop. In his seven years at the Bank of England Carney had to be very careful – one misplaced word could cause a run on the pound. He has not quite exorcised his instinct to self-censor; rather than answer a question fully he will raise an ironic eyebrow or offer a knowing smile.

He moves on to house prices. For all his focus on non-monetary values Carney is still plenty interested in market value. He tells me about the house he rented in London. “The people who owned it sold it when we left. I think they marketed it as my house because I noticed in many newspapers that my house was being sold! Then it was claimed that I had made great money which I hadn’t because I didn’t own it. We were in West Hampstead basically Swiss Cottage. I like it. Fun. Great there. Not too many bankers!” The way he tells it you could be forgiven for thinking that the Carneys were slumming it. But the house with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms was on sale at £5.5m.

Does he prefer to live in an area with few bankers? “Yeah! Do you want to be surrounded by people in finance?” He arches his left eyebrow. “If part of your job is to oversee it then when you’re home it’s all around you – that’s less attractive. A little diversity in life is not a bad thing.”

Carney’s life story is often told as a fairytale – the kid from the western wilderness who struggled to make ends meet and went on to become a master of the universe. There is some truth in that but he is the first to admit it’s a gross simplification. He spent the first years of his life in Fort Smith a tiny town by the Slave River on the edge of Wood Buffalo national park in Canada’s Northwest Territories. He grew up with two brothers and a sister. His father Bob was the principal of the local high school and his mother Verlie stayed at home to bring up the children before returning to teaching. When Carney was six the family moved to Edmonton and Bob worked in the civil service on Native American and northern affairs before becoming a professor of education at the University of Alberta.

“I certainly grew up in an academic household. There were lots of books around. He was always going off to social justice workshops.” Carney knows his audience. He pauses when I don’t react. “Doesn’t that sound good Simon social justice workshops?” Did his father inculcate him with those values? “Yes I think so. In terms of the value of knowledge the sense of community responsibility which I think is where the public service bent came from.”

Did he always want to be a banker? “It’s a good question. Candidly I’d gone from Canada to Harvard had a lot of student loans and the most effective way to pay that off was to become a banker.” Actually he says he fancied being a marine biologist. Was he good at science? “Yes.” Was he very academic? “Yep. Yep. Yep.”

The limits of Thatcher and Reagan’s approach that the answer to everything is to create a market are clear

He was a talented hockey player and dreamed of playing in North America’s National Hockey League. “I played at a pretty high level in the end – US college Division I. I was the backup keeper. I was good enough to get to that level but I knew I wasn’t good enough to get to the top level. A number of my teammates ended up playing in the NHL.”

After completing a PhD at Oxford where he met his wife the British economist Diana Fox Carney he worked for 13 years at Goldman Sachs and earned a fortune. As soon as I mention it he talks about working on the ANC contract when they came to power in post-apartheid South Africa. Even at Goldman Sachs he seems to be saying he was on the right side of history.

He returned to Canada became deputy governor and then governor of the Bank of Canada before being headhunted by then chancellor George Osborne to head up the Bank of England. He famously played hard to get rejecting Osborne’s advances time and again refusing to do the conventional eight-year term and forcing the chancellor to improve his offer. Carney’s stint is regarded as successful. Sure the odd government minister said he was too outspoken notably on Brexit and the climate crisis. Jacob Rees-Mogg called for Carney’s resignation after he suggested that leaving the EU might trigger a recession while former chancellor Lord Lamont and former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith warned Carney to be “careful” that his own words did not plunge the country into crisis. But under Carney’s tenure Britain’s banks continued to recover their reputation after they were hammered for their reckless greed following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The financial journalists I speak to tell me how clever Carney is. They also say he knows it and likes to show that he is the smartest person in the room. For all his charm Carney is known for being thin-skinned when criticised. And for all the ways in which he appears to be a thoroughly modern banker (turning up at festivals in shorts) he is wholly traditional in others: his press conferences were famously turgid and unquotable. He may well argue that this is how it should have been: part of the job was not to attract headlines.

What does he think was his greatest achievement at the Bank? “Probably the bit that is least visible – changing the way we made decisions. Who’s around the table? The author is always in the room when a decision is made so the more junior person who has really done the work is there. A more inclusive decision-making process with a more diverse staff. It’s got a long way to go to properly reflect society but it was an organisation that reflected being more than three centuries old in a world that’s very hierarchical naturally. And it’s much less so now.”

Why did he write the book? “Part of it is selfish to be candid. I wanted to get my thinking straight. I felt the relationship between value and values was important but that in the process of writing the book I would come to a more settled and considered view. And the second thing is I had this one window where I could do it. I got six months’ gardening leave after leaving and then I found myself locked down. And thirdly I did feel I should record some aspect of what I’d seen.”

So how did his thinking change? “It became much sharper. I’d underappreciated the commodification factor of putting a price on certain activities.” The book charts the way society evolved until everything had a market value and how that market value distorts real values. So for example an experiment was conducted in which some people were paid to raise money for charity and others did it for nothing; those who did it for nothing raised more. “Paying for blood donation or fundraising actually corrodes the value of the activity and it’s less successful. The related point is that civic and social virtue is like a muscle: it grows with regular exercise. Literally from a contagion perspective it becomes what one does as a member of society. So the fact that a million people are volunteering for the NHS now promotes other voluntary activity.”

I don’t shy away from the fact I worked for Goldman Sachs. I learned a lot I have no regrets

I wonder how personal the book is. In 2013 columnist Alex Brummer memorably described Goldman Sachs as “the shrewdest but most toxic brand in global finance”. Does Carney look back at his time there and think he prioritised value over values? “It’s an interesting question. When I worked for Goldman Sachs it wasn’t the most toxic brand in global finance it was the best brand in world finance.” Maybe but as Brummer points out the two are not mutually exclusive. “I don’t shy away from the fact I worked there. I learned a lot; I have no regrets. Look it clarifies some things for me but I did leave a fairly successful career with prospects in the private sector to work in the public sector on these issues for the greater good. And I spend half my time now working on the issues of climate health and corporate governance.”

Carney is by no means the first Goldman Sachs alumnus to have forged a career in public service (they include Italian prime minister and former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi and former US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin). Does earning vast sums liberate people to pursue more meaningful careers? “Erm yeah it certainly helps.”

Value(s) is an unusual hybrid; at times it reads like an A-level economics textbook taking us from the history of barter to gold and then paper money; from Adam Smith to Karl Marx and Milton Friedman. At others it reads like a smart contemporary analysis of the limits of the markets when it comes to the economic crash Covid and the climate crisis. Sometimes it feels like a wink and a nod to old friends in the City to get in quick on the green gig because this is where the big bucks are. So you’re telling business people you can do good and make a profit? “Yes exactly. What’s changed in the UK and Europe is that clearly people are saying ‘Let’s get to net zero sort it out put climate above economy.’ And guess what? It flips it around because if I’m doing something that makes it more likely we’re going to get to net zero: that is valuable in society by definition. If I’m Elon Musk and I’m creating good electric vehicles then I’ve created something valuable. The most valuable energy company in the US is a renewable energy company. If I can solve the hydrogen equation…”

He stops worried that he may be misunderstood. “But I’m obviously not a market fundamentalist right? I believe there are many things we shouldn’t put in the market. I think Milton Friedman was fundamentally wrong. Look Friedman was a brilliant man but I fundamentally disagree with him that the only purpose of business is to profit providing you follow the basic social norms or standards.”

Does he regard his book as optimistic? “It turned out to be more optimistic than I thought it would be. Partly because of the momentum that’s there on climate and secondly because of what was revealed about people’s values in terms of Covid which was heartening.” By and large he believes people have shown solidarity and a degree of selflessness during the pandemic. “In the arc of history over our lifetime we had this swing to quite an extreme with Thatcher and Reagan that the answer to everything is to create a market to put a price on things whether it’s health provision or finance. And the limits and consequences of that approach are increasingly clear.”

Last year Carney delivered the BBC’s Reith Lectures in front of virtual audiences composed largely of the great and the good each of them concluding with a Q&A session. Few shared Carney’s optimism that the climate crisis can be tackled largely through the market. Paul Krugman professor of economics at the City University of New York asked Carney to “argue me out of the pessimism that I’m feeling right now”. The banker failed. Sir David King former government chief scientific adviser and climate negotiator was asked if he shared Carney’s optimism. He replied: “I am extremely worried and the optimism I have is now rapidly melting away as the ice begins to melt from the two polar regions.”

I didn’t want to do the Bank of England job. But it was a challenge. The financial system had basically failed

Is Carney’s book too rose-tinted? No he says and he talks about how much Greta Thunberg has done to move the conversation on. When he used to bang on about a net zero carbon economy or “stranded assets” (fossil fuels rendered worthless because they cannot be burned) few people knew what he was on about. Now he says both terms are common parlance in business. “I raised it years ago and took a reasonable amount of abuse for exceeding my remit. And here we are today and it’s ‘How big are the stranded assets? How do I get out? Here’s my net zero plan.’ The whole momentum has shifted. Again I’m not taking credit for it but that shows you things can move.” The suggestion that the book is overly optimistic touches a nerve. “I’m not Pollyanna-ish about it. I have been around. I’m not just some guy coming up with an abstract theory.”

Carney’s wife Diana a development economist born to a wealthy pig farming family has been described in newspapers as a “strident environmental activist”. In 2012 she wrote that Occupy the protest movement that pitched tents outside the Bank of England a few months before Carney took over “has provided a voice to many unhappy people”. I ask Carney if his wife thinks he is a woolly liberal and that it’s impossible to save the planet by appealing to self-interest? “Well I think two things. I think she is very capable of speaking for herself so I won’t speak for her. Secondly I don’t think it’s right to say that what I’m saying is ‘Make some tweaks here and the market will take care of everything.’ But given the time frame given the scale of the technological challenges we need all hands on deck. We need the core of the market focused on this issue as the issue.”

Can I ask Diana what she thinks? “Erm I doubt she would but erm let her decide that. I will ask. I will ask.” (He never gets back to me with her response.) Has she influenced him politically? He laughs but sounds affronted. “I’m the one who grew up with the father with the social justice workshop. So I know where my values come from.”

Carney and Diana have four daughters in their teens and 20s. I ask if they have changed him. He nods. How? “It’s not great to admit but you’re instantly attuned to the still structural embedded barriers that exist around gender and how you actively have to work to break those down. And the values of my children on issues such as sustainability broader issues of equality are strongly held so all of that feeds back.”

The day before we talked I listened to his Reith Lectures and one moment shocked me. It was nothing to do with economics or the climate. It was when he said: “You don’t get rich in public service.” But Mark I say you were earning £879000 a year at the Bank of England. “I get it” he says. “But let’s be clear: I was asked to come and fix something. I didn’t seek it out. I basically had the same job in Canada. I know the UK is the centre of the universe and everything but I was a G7 governor I was in charge of all the global financial reforms in my country and I was asked to come and sort this out.”

Did part of him not want the job? “I didn’t want to do it.” So why did he? “Because it was a challenge. The financial system had basically failed. The new Bank of England had been put together and I had a chance to make that work. Look I’m grateful and I don’t want to come across as… ” His sentence collapses in on itself. “It was an important experience but it was not something I wanted to do.”

Is he glad he did? The seconds pass. One two three four. “I did it.” He chuckles. “It helped me write the book.” Another pause. “Yeah I’m glad I did it” he concedes eventually. “I have a pride in what was accomplished yeah.”

Who is the most impressive British politician? ‘Gordon Brown. He has a mind like a hyperlink. Brown is a person of action’

But he didn’t regard £879000 a year as good money? He looks embarrassed. “Yes absolutely. Two things. First the actual salary was what the salary of the governor was previously and they converted the pension into part of the salary. And as I pointed out at the time I rented out this house in Ottawa and the rent was 9% of the cost of the rent in the UK.” He received a £250000-a-year housing allowance with the job. “And second if I had stayed in private finance the opportunity cost of me being in public service for 20 years is enormous. Do I care about money? Obviously I have a family to provide for and stuff but I am in bloody Ottawa. I am back in Ottawa. If I wanted to maximise my net present value I’d be sitting on top of some pile of capital.” You can take the man out of the City but you can’t take the City out of the man.

Most people who know him will tell you that Mark Carney is a good thing; that if anybody can change the practices of entrepreneurs and investors it is him. He is effective not because he threatens their world but because he is part of it. Or as he might say he understands their values.

At the Bank of England and now as finance adviser for Cop26 he has been in constant touch with British politicians. Who is the most impressive? “Gordon Brown” he answers instantly. Why? “He’s got a comprehensive view of the world that goes from a fair version of an open globalisation and drops down to what’s needed to support individuals. And he has a mind like a hyperlink. I’m not damning the others but I’ve always felt if you’re going to have a meeting what are you trying to accomplish and how can you move the issue forward? Brown is a person of action.”

At 55 Carney is still a relatively young man. His current roles paid-for and voluntary seem more an interregnum than a new start. It has often been suggested that his ultimate ambition is to become Canada’s prime minister. There was talk that he initially agreed to only five years at the Bank of England because it would give him time to challenge for the leadership of the Liberal party and stand for election in 2019. Ultimately he stayed on at the bank and in October 2019 Justin Trudeau won a second term for the Liberals. The first two people Carney followed on Twitter were Trudeau and former Liberal party leader Michael Ignatieff.

Is he going to be prime minister of Canada one day? “Er look at the time!” Carney laughs raises an eyebrow and is gone.

As home to the American Irish Historical Society the mansion has long symbolized the immigrant ascent of Irish America. The Irish tricolor and the American stars and stripes flying from its bowed facade staked claim on rarefied pavement directly across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

But for nearly a half-century the building and society have been the fief of an eminent physician named Dr. Kevin M. Cahill his family and his friends. Those who ventured to reform its nepotistic ways have historically been shown the ornate door.

Now the sudden plan to sell the mansion has exposed the profound problems beneath its mansard roof — including a very public and nearly violent confrontation provoked by its executive director Dr. Cahill’s son — and elevated what might be dismissed as an internal squabble to international embarrassment."

That's a conversation for LaMelo Ball and Tyrese Halliburton.

But he's certainly making a case as the most exciting.

The No. 1 overall pick who delivered one of the nastiest in-game dunks any of us has ever seen just last month executed another poster-worthy slam on Sunday. He did so en route to a career-high 34 points. And this time the Minnesota Timberwolves actually won.

Edwards punishes rim RoCo

Edwards was excellent in Sunday's 114-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers notching his point tally on a 12-of-24 shooting effort including 6 of 14 from 3-point distance. None of his buckets was more enthralling than a key fourth-quarter dunk.

Edwards broke free on a screen above the 3-point line and dribbled through four Blazers defenders before punishing the rim for a 100-90 Minnesota lead.

Anthony Edwards. Look the **** out. pic.twitter.com/1tsX5yBnlJ — Tas Melas (@TasMelas) March 15 2021

Portland forward Robert Covington made a half-hearted effort to slow Edwards but wisely stayed out of his way to escape the full brunt of the Yuta Watanabe treatment.

Edwards lets Carmelo have it too

Edwards didn't limit his feistiness to strictly at the rim. He was feeling his 3-point stroke and let Carmelo Anthony know about after burying one over the former NBA scoring champ.

Anthony Edwards hit a three on Melo then did his celebration 🔥 pic.twitter.com/kEEbvNwZ5o — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) March 15 2021

That little right-handed gesture? That's Melo's move. Would he have dared use it if Anthony was facing him?

It's hard to say. Either way it was a bold move on a bold night from the Timberwolves rookie.

UMass Lowell’s America East Conference tournament run ended with a 64-50 loss to Hartford in the title game Saturday.

The visiting River Hawks (11-12) had produced two spectacular comebacks but failed to turn on the afterburners as they were held scoreless from the field for a 7:07 span down the stretch. Hartford (15-8) which earned a bid to the NCAA tournament with its fifth successive victory stopped Obadiah Noel and Connor Withers and the Lowell supporting cast failed to compensate.

UMass Lowell survived a 0-for-11 shooting slump and an eight-minute scoring drought to take an early 11-10 lead on a Kalil Thomas 3-pointer with 8:09 remaining in the first half. It took 15:52 for Noel break into the scoring column but Withers was held scoreless in the opening half. Hartford shot 7 for 29 (24.1 percent) in the first half but closed with four foul shots in the final 2:12 to take a 24-18 lead.

Lowell started the second half strong and Noel’s 3-point play and Withers’s 3-pointer provided a 26-25 advantage with 17:10 remaining. The River Hawks appeared poised for a rally down the stretch as Noel’s free throw pulled them within 42-39 and set up a bonus situation with 9:19 left. Instead Hartford went on a 15-2 run a Traci Carter jumper off the dribble providing a 57-41 lead with 3:32 remaining.

Noel’s 4-point play with 3:19 left brought some hope to the River Hawks.

WEST HARTFORD CT — For the first time in program history the University of Hartford men's basketball team is headed to the NCAA tournament after topping UMass Lowell 64-50 in the America East Conference championship game Saturday inside Chase Arena at Reich Family Pavilion.

The Hawks now await the NCAA Selection Show which airs Sunday at 6 p.m. on CBS to find out their first-round opponent. ""If you know anything about me we're not going to [Indianapolis] to say hello; we're going there to win"" head coach John Gallagher said.

Senior Austin Williams was named the America East Championship’s Most Outstanding Player. In the title game he tallied 17 points and grabbed eight rebounds. He was joined on the All-Championship team by grad student Traci Carter who poured in a game-high 19 points and junior Hunter Marks who scored 14 points. Marks also received the Elite 18 award for having the highest GPA of all participants in the league’s title game. ""I love Traci Carter the way he managed the game and Austin Williams really had a huge second half"" Gallagher said. ""As we move forward here we've got to get other guys playing well.""

Hartford's tenacious defense limited the River Hawks to 29.5 percent shooting from the floor. The victory clinched the first conference championship for the Hawks since moving to Division I 37 years ago.

""For our program what do you say?"" Gallagher said. ""Four best years in school history. They were firing me four years ago and rightfully so; wasn't getting it done. We just buckled down."" Former Hartford player Terry Preston a team member just prior to the switch to Division I in the early 1980s told Patch ""It's a great achievement for the university coaches players and the people who laid the groundwork for this moment - former president Trachtenberg Bob Chernak and Jack Phelan.

Spinning off from the 1984 comedy classic The Real Ghostbusters was an animated series that ran from 1986 to 1990 which back then was pretty much forever. “The Real” was added after a dispute with Filmation which owned the Ghostbusters name and produced its own animated series around the same time simply called Ghostbusters. The Real Ghostbusters is the show with all the movie clout following the further adventures of Venkman Stantz Zeddemore Spengler and the gang. Man this is a lot of exposition for a post about toys.

The Real Ghostbusters toy line was a delightful combination of cool tech and gross ghosts. Hasbro’s Kenner reissues which go up for preorder exclusively at Walmart on March 15 represent the best the line had to offer. Take the $US50 ($65) Ecto-1 for example. It’s so bulbous and cartoony. It’s got a tailgate that opens and closes a roof-mounted swivel seat and a ghost claw for grappling with the restless dead. Has a hearse ever been this fun? Yes but this one is kid-friendly.

Not quite as kid-friendly is Fearsome Flush a toilet that’s sure to set your child’s potty-training back a decade. One moment it’s a normal toilet. The next it’s got a tongue and teeth and I don’t need to point out where those will likely end up going.

Hey kids maybe cut down on the grape Kool-Aid. (Photo: Hasbro)

Compared to that toilet terror Bug-Eye is pretty tame. He’s either scary or scary while also holding a giant eyeball attached to a string.

What kind of person in life becomes this in death? (Photo: Hasbro)

Both $US15 ($19) ghosts and the Ecto-1 go up for preorder on March 15 at Walmart in the U.S. with toys arriving in stores in April where they will be bought up by employees and put on eBay for double or triple the price. Ain’t nostalgia grand?

It was a bit of schooling for the Pioneer Athletic Conference duo in their first Class 3A PIAA Championships tournament at the Giant Center in Hershey but with state medals now around their necks Kakos and Babb are ready to build going forward.

The tournament alternated sessions between the 106-138-pound weight classes and 145-285 and Kakos (132 pounds) and Babb (138) finished eighth in the first session of medal rounds.

“It was good for my first time” Kakos said. “I had some good matches but I have some things to work on.”

Kakos had a rough introduction to the state grind with a 12-2 loss to eventual champion Briar Priest of Hempfield. In the consolation bracket Kakos’ comeback attempt against Waynesburg Central’s Colton Stoneking came up just short 7-6.

In the seventh-place bout he saw Nazareth’s Dominic Wheatley for the second straight week and but came out on the wrong side of the rematch. Kakos wasn’t happy with his results but has now has a better base to build on.

“I have the experience and now it won’t be as new next year when I get back here” Kakos said.

The loss against Wheatley keeps Kakos at 49 victories for his career but Perk Valley coach Dave Thomas does not foresee another 44-year state medal drought that Kakos ended.

“It’s great getting kids here after 44 years of not having any place-winners” Thomas said. “We were able to get 20 tickets and got to bring some of the team. There’s some freshmen and sophomores who get a feel for being here and hopefully that’s a little motivation for them to try to get come back here and get on the mat.”

Babb made major strides as a junior after going 0-2 in Hershey as a sophomore. He reached his first regional final and went 3-1 at the East Super Regional to earn his first trip to the state podium.

“It means a lot” Babb said. “I worked hard for it but (eighth-place) is not what I wanted.”

In Hershey Babb was victim of a brutal bracket dropping a decision to Waynesburg’s eventual runner-up Cole Homet in quarters and then again to Council Rock North’s Kyle Hauserman who was upset in his opener.

For seventh Babb faced Bethlehem Catholic’s Andrew Harmon for a second straight week and could not get out from under resulting in a 1-0 loss.

“I didn’t meet my goals for this year but it will just make me work harder in the offseason” Babb said. “I’m going to push my teammates as well as myself to be the best we can.”

Babb gave Boyertown its 35th state medalist in program history and is sitting 35 wins away from 100 for his career.

With Spring-Ford’s state medalist duo Jack McGill (160) and Joey Milano (189) graduating Babb and Kakos as well as Pope John Paul II’s Alan Alexander (152) take over as the flag bearers for the PAC as returning state placers.

“Any time you have returning medalists in the PAC it shows great signs” Boyertown coach Tony Haley said. “I hope all the kids in the PAC look at those kids Kakos and Chance have done. Those two kids work and work and work and look to improve. This one stings for (Chance) but hopefully that motivates him to keep getting better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWNjZXNzbmVwYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3dhbGxlbnBhdXBhY2tzLWd1bm5hci1teWVycy1tYWtlcy1yYXJlLXJ1bi10by1oZXJzaGV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wallenpaupack’s Gunnar Myers makes rare run to Hershey,"Gunnar Myers faced a one-point deficit entering the third period.

He chose bottom and looked to at least escape to tie the match.

Win and the Wallenpaupack freshman achieves a rare feat among Lackawanna League wrestlers. Lose and his season ends with a fifth-place match later that day.

Unfazed by the moment Myers made sure his shocking postseason run continued — all the way to the podium in Hershey.

He secured a reversal against Boyertown’s Jay Maldonado ranked No. 14 in the state 20 seconds into the third period. Myers rode him out for the final 1:40 to earn a 4-3 decision in his 120-pound East Super Regional consolation semifinal match last Saturday at Quakertown High School.

Myers also became the first Lackawanna League freshman to secure a state medal in 14 years.

“I knew not many people had done it … and that was my goal” Myers said. “I got the medal. Now I just want to see how high I can place.”

To reach that goal he also knocked off the No. 1 seed in the bracket Downingtown East’s Keanu Manuel ranked 13th in the state in the quarterfinals. He earned the Super Regional bronze when Manuel forfeited the consolation finals because of an injury. The top eight finishers place at states and each weight class is limited to eight wrestlers — the top four from the East and West Super Regionals — because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Abington Heights’ Evan Craig was the last Lackawanna League freshman to earn a state medal when he placed eighth at the Class 3A tournament in 2007.

“We know it’s special to get a freshman there but what he’s done in the past two weeks is in my opinion in my 20 years of coaching wrestling other-worldly” Wallenpaupack coach Steve Krushnowski said. “We know he’s good but he beat two kids with 100-plus wins who were regional champions last year. It’s just mind-blowing to me.”

With the start of the Lackawanna League season delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic Wallenpaupack only competed in six regular-season dual meets. Myers went 6-0 with five pins and a forfeit.

With limited varsity experience Myers entered the District 2 Class 3A tournament as the No. 3 seed at 120. Also in the bracket were state-ranked wrestlers in West Scranton senior Austin Fashouer who will join Myers in Hershey on Saturday and Tunkhannock junior Owen Woods a former District 2 Class 2A champion. Myers needed to beat one of them to advance to the Northeast Regional which only advanced two qualifiers per weight class from District 2.

Myers lost to Fashouer the eventual district champion 7-2 in the semifinals but dominated Woods 10-3 in the true second-place match to qualify for regionals.

“I knew Austin was going to be a tough match but I’ve wrestled him before and it was a tough loss to take but I knew I had to come back” Myers said. “I knew Owen was going to be good. He’s a good wrestler he’s experienced and I just had to take it to him and keep the pressure on him and that’s what I did.”

Myers didn’t allow the bigger stages to shake his confidence. He pinned his Northeast Regional quarterfinal opponent George Washington’s Stephen Walker in 45 seconds before dropping into the consolation semifinals where in a do-or-die situation against Nazareth’s Jake Doone Myers produced a third-period escape in a 3-3 match to qualify for super regionals.

“(My confidence) really comes from my coaches and my parents just telling me that nobody works harder than I do … and them telling me I could beat anybody” Myers said.

Myers doesn’t compete in other sports and his work ethic in the classroom shows on the mat.

“I have him in class and usually if a kid is astute in class and he’s a hard worker that usually transfers to everything else they do” said Krushnowski who teaches English. “He’s tenacious in the classroom. He works hard. He participates and he’s smart and it’s such an asset for a kid to be tenacious everywhere he’s at and to be intelligent and to transfer that from the classroom to the mat is huge.”

Ranked 12th in the state Myers started wrestling at age 6. Years later he still faces a familiar opponent in Fashouer.

“Him and I have wrestled together with clubs since I’ve been 9 so we both know how each other wrestles so it’s like a chess match” Myers said.

This season Fashouer secured checkmate twice against Myers but the Buckhorns wrestler only lost by a point at super regionals.

“I definitely learned some things (wrestling Fashouer)” Myers said. “I need to not think about it so much. I know the first match I overthought it a little bit. I thought it was bigger than it was. I think if I wrestle him again I just need to let it go and just let everything fly and whatever happens happens.”

Myers opens the PIAA tournament Saturday against Chambersburg’s Karl Shindledecker the state’s third-ranked wrestler at 120. His side of the bracket also includes No. 2 Dante Frinzi of Bethlehem Catholic and No.6 Chad Ozias of Connellsville.

“He’s been a tournament wrestler” Krushnowski said of Myers. “He’s done it his whole life so he doesn’t shy away from the big stage. We tell our kids this year the whole year you’ve got to make your own juice. There’s no fans. Mom and dad aren’t out there so you really have to get yourself mentally ready to compete and he’s done a really good job with that.”

The Class 3A tournament is Saturday at 8:30 a.m. at the Giant Center in Hershey.

“I think it’s going to be a lot of fun. I’m excited” Myers said. “Everyone’s going to be good there so it’s going to be just who’s the best prepared right now and who’s the most experienced in certain positions and who wrestles the best.”"

In a 10-minute ""This is Paris"" podcast episode titled ""This is… the truth"" on iHeartRADIO Hilton addressed the photo as an ""awkward"" experience since she wasn’t on good terms with Lohan.

PARIS HILTON DOESN'T TRUST LINDSAY LOHAN BUT LOVES BRITNEY SPEARS

""That was a night that Britney and I went out and we were at the Beverly Hills Hotel. And we were at our friend's party and then we were deciding to leave because we wanted to go home"" Hilton recalled. ""We were just walking to the car and all of a sudden got swarmed by tons of paparazzi. Just as we were walking to the car that's when Lindsay came up. So it was kind of awkward because at this point we are just having some drama.""

""As I was getting in the car one of the paparazzi screamed at me 'Is it true that you hit Lindsay?' And at that moment all of a sudden I saw Lindsay walking towards us and I said 'Why don't you just ask her?'"" Hilton claims she said at the time.

According to Hilton’s recollection Lohan replied something along the lines of: ""'No of course not…' 'No Paris would never hit me I've known her since [age] 15.'""

LINDSAY LOHAN AND PARIS HILTON'S PARALLEL LIVES

Hilton described the question and whole situation as being ""quite awkward"" while noting that Lohan didn’t admit to any wrongdoing.

""It was just weird how the whole thing happened"" Hilton explained. ""And then they just kept flashing taking photos and then all of a sudden I looked over and she's in my car. And we weren't getting along so I was polite.""

In previous retellings Hilton has provided more insight into her ""politeness.""

The hotel heiress and DJ was more direct in 2017 when she told MTV Australia Lohan crashed her girls’ night with Spears.

""It was just Brit and I out and then she just like chased us to the car and got in"" Hilton quipped. ""She wasn’t invited.""

A year later Hilton said ""I didn’t want to humiliate her in front of all the paparazzi and be like ‘Get out of my car’"" during an appearance on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy.

During that same interview Hilton explained that she used to be close friends with Lohan until the actress did something to betray her trust.

Lohan denied crashing Hilton and Spears’ night when she interviewed by Andy Cohen in 2019.

Although that night in 2006 might not have gone as planned Hilton and Spears have maintained a sense of humor about it.

In 2019 the duo recreated the moment at the Beverly Hills Hotel with a Queen Elizabeth II impersonator.

During the March 11 episode of her This Is Paris podcast Paris revealed that the picture tells a completely different story from what actually happened.

""That was a night that Britney and I went out and we were at the Beverly Hills Hotel at our friend's party and we decided to leave to go home"" Paris said. ""We were walking to the car and all of as suddenly got swarmed by a tons of paparazzi. Just as we got to the car that's when Lindsay came up. It was kind of awkward because we were having some drama."" The drama? There was a video circulating of Lindsay where she claimed Paris had spilled a drink on and hit her at a party. ""All of a sudden I look over and she's in my car. We weren't getting along but I was polite"" Paris added. ""We saw it on the cover of the NY Post [the next morning] all these different magazines. They had literally no idea it was just me and Britney out at the Beverly Hills Hotel just going home.""

Paris and Lindsay had been close friends in the 2000s but their friendship wasn't meant to last.

Paris Hilton revealed the ""awkward"" truth behind the iconic paparazzi photograph of her Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan.

In 2006 paparazzi snapped photographs of the trio as they left the Beverly Hills Hotel and squeezed into a black vehicle waiting outside. The photo has since become a much-reproduced emblem of 2000s pop culture royalty.

In the latest episode of her ""This is Paris"" podcast Hilton said the photos don't show how the meetup came about. Shortly after leaving a friend's party Spears and Hilton were ""swarmed by tons of paparazzi.""

""Just as we were walking to the car that's when Lindsay came up"" Hilton said before saying the run-in was ""awkward"" because she and Lohan were ""having some drama.""

Hilton and Lohan's feud dominated headlines throughout 2006. Rumors swirled that Lohan was linked to Hilton's ex-boyfriend Stavros Niarchos.

At one point Lohan told paparazzi that Hilton hit her in the arm with a drink at a party. One day later Lohan was photographed with Hilton and Spears out on the town.

""So as I was getting in the car one of the paparazzi screamed at me 'Is it true that you hit Lindsay?' And at that moment all of a sudden I saw Lindsay walking towards us and I said 'Why don't you just ask her?'"" Hilton said before recounting Lohan's answer as ""something like 'No Paris would never hit me I've known her since I'm 15.'""

As Hilton tried to drive away from the cameras she said Lohan got into her car.

""I looked over and she's in my car"" Hilton said. ""We weren't getting along so I was polite.""

Hilton said she didn't want to cause a scene because ""I didn't want to humiliate her in front of all the paparazzi and be like 'Get out of my car.'""

Hilton said that people began ""inventing stories"" after the photographs were published because they had ""no idea"" what actually happened.

Since then the photographs have been transformed into merchandise like car sunshades pins tote bags and t-shirts.

Hilton shared photos from that night to her Twitter account in 2017 and later re-created the photo with Britney Spears and Queen Elizabeth II impersonators.

Hilton further explained in the ""This is Paris"" episode that she and Lohan used to be close friends but fell apart after a disagreement.

""She did a couple of things that really hurt me and just betrayed my trust and caused a lot of drama"" said Hilton adding that their friendship was ""on and off.""

However Hilton said she recognizes that they were both young and immature at the time.

""When I think about it now we were just so young and immature"" Hilton said. ""It's just kind of like that high school drama especially in the LA scene and then also having to live it out in public with the media just constantly trying to stir things up and make things even worse than they are.""

She added that back then ""the media just really enjoyed having girls feud with each other.""

Hilton ended the segment by saying that she didn't hold a grudge and wished Lohan the best.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWdsb3VjZXN0ZXJzaGlyZS01NjM3MDQyN9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWdsb3VjZXN0ZXJzaGlyZS01NjM3MDQyNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Curlew: Urgent work needed to save 'loved' endangered bird,

Special to Ventura County Star

Product bans can provide a decisive path to environmental change but when governments resort to mandates people resist. One form of resistance is to publicize information about unintended consequences of the ban.

This is the first year the full effects can be felt from a phase out of incandescent bulbs set into motion when the U.S. Congress adopted in 2007 The Energy Independence and Security Act. Now all general-purpose bulbs must produce at least 45 lumens per watt a standard which incandescent bulbs cannot meet.

When the bulb ban first was adopted the Commonwealth Foundation and the Heritage Foundation which both describe themselves on their websites as “free-market think tanks” raised concerns about disposal of compact fluorescent lights CFLs.

Commonwealth Foundation wrote in a 2010 article still posted on their web site “Families with small children who would rather stay with the traditional safer light bulb won't be able to…” pointing out inconvenient procedures recommended by the U.S. EPA for cleanup of floors after accidental breakage of a fluorescent lamp.

Eco-tip:Reusable glass bottles are gone but alternatives have advantages

Similarly Heritage Foundation wrote in 2007 again in an article still on their website ""Politicians used a distorted view of ‘creative destruction’ mixed with global warming concerns to sell the regulation (banning incandescent bulbs)… But the politicians as they typically do failed to see the unintended consequences… CFLs use high levels of mercury and exposure to mercury vapor is dangerous if the bulbs are broken.”

Now the ban is fully in place and the replacement turns out to be not the expected CFLs but light emitting diodes LEDs. Tech guru Clint DeBoer who in response to the ban invoked the Boston Tea Party on his blog-style website avgadgets.com and coined the phrase “Light cessation without representation” acknowledged LEDs are an improvement.

LEDs pay for themselves in energy savings during their long life and “LED lighting really IS better than incandescent. Maybe I just hate things being forced on me prematurely” he wrote.

However we do have to contend with the disposal of fluorescent bulbs. To find drop off sites go to earth911.com and search for “CFLs” – leaving off the “s” yields no results. Call sites before going; some listings are outdated.

For example Batteries Plus in Ventura normally accepts both fluorescent tubes and bulbs but is not accepting new drop offs while they wait for pickup from their full containers according to sales associate Andy Gonzalez.

Batteries Plus in Camarillo accepts both fluorescent tubes and bulbs including from businesses but charges $5 per bulb. Home Depot in Thousand Oaks used to accept both CFLs and tubes but now like the Home Depot in Oxnard they accept just CFLs not tubes.

Eco-tip:When recycling gives you glass keep a lid on it

Stan Wilson of Ventura emailed me asking “How do they keep mercury out of the environment” when recycling fluorescent bulbs? … Is it (recycling CFLs) just another one of those feel good things we do to pretend we are saving the environment?”

In answer Don Sheppard a Ventura County integrated waste management analyst who manages the county’s Pollution Prevention Center explained to me how collected bulbs are carefully packed into cardboard tubes and collected by Clean Earth Inc.

The tubes go to another company which removes the phosphor powder and extracts the mercury at their factory in Indiana where it is recycled for industrial uses. The remaining powder is recycled by Rare Earth Recovery Sciences which extracts rare earth metals.

Glass from lamps was previously used to make concrete powder or tile but due to low demand the glass now goes with plastic from lamps to landfills. Metal recyclers collect the aluminum end caps.

In contrast to fluorescent lights but like incandescent bulbs LEDs go to landfills for disposal.

Doug Kobold executive director of the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council said “If manufacturers were held accountable for the end-of-life costs of their products they may be more inclined to design them to be more durable reusable repairable and recyclable.”

City spokesperson Sue Jones said Friday that the Amazon facility which will occupy the building near Balsam Avenue and Bear Valley Road is “not a warehouse” but a speed package delivery outlet.

The company's delivery stations are designed to “power the last mile of Amazon’s order fulfillment process.” Packages are transported to delivery stations from the company’s fulfillment and sortation centers then loaded into vehicles for delivery to customers Amazon said.

The new Victorville delivery station inside the nearly 126000-square-foot building situated just east of Home Depot is expected to open later this year and bring 150 new jobs to the area Jones said.

Amazon pays its employees a minimum of $15 per hour and offers full-time employees medical vision and dental insurance benefits as well as a 401(k) with 50% match according to Amazon.

The delivery station will also offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to build small businesses by delivering Amazon packages.

The station will also allow independent contractors to deliver via Amazon Flex which enlists drivers to deliver packages for the nation’s largest online retailer.

“Improvements on the building have started and are expected to take four to five months” Jones said. “Updates will be made to the interior and exterior of the existing commercial building to accommodate delivery sorting and administrative functions for the new business.”

Exterior changes include the addition of roll-up bay doors on the north and west elevations and a new canopy at the north elevation to accommodate vehicle loading and staging.

A newly constructed entrance façade will be used as an employee entrance and exit and as a customer service area for the pick-up and return of items.

The traffic circulation pattern in the parking lots throughout the site will be redesigned to accommodate customer and employee parking as well as delivery vehicle parking and staging.

Landscaping will either be added or replaced along the right of way and throughout the parking lot. Balsam Road will also receive improvements to the curb gutter and sidewalk.

Access to the building will be from Balsam Road. The facility is expected to utilize a split shift schedule of 1:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. to help stagger vehicle traffic.

On Friday green construction fencing surrounded the building empty field behind the structure and most of the shopping center parking lot near several businesses including the Golden Gate Chinese and Las Carnitas Uruapan restaurants T-Shirt Emporium Elegant Hair Studio and Ciezi Insurance.

Walmart abandoned the building in September 2012 when it opened its Supercenter near Restaurant Row on Amargosa Road in Victorville the Daily Press reported.

Known as the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the U.S. Tractor Supply Company was expected to take over half the old Walmart building in 2014. But Tractor Supply's building permit expired in May of that year after nearly six months of inactivity according to the city.

After scouting several locations in the High Desert Tractor Supply eventually decided to build a new store on Main Street in Hesperia developer Brad Sobel told the Daily Press.

Jones meanwhile said Amazon's presence on Bear Valley Road means yet another large retail space in Victorville will soon be occupied.

Across the city on Palmdale Road Car X Change recently moved into the former Target building and Cardenas Markets moved into the old Ralphs supermarket. Jones noted that Inland Empire Health Plan Harbor Freight and Shark Solutions also moved into vacant space.

“This underscores the strength of Victorville’s economy and our ability to attract large businesses to our city” Jones said. “As a result once vacant retail space is being occupied and our large shopping centers are experiencing a resurgence.”

Civil rights and activist groups are turning up the pressure on large Georgia companies like Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines to oppose sweeping voting restrictions proposed by Republican state legislators.

""We've got the power of organized people. They've got the power of organized money. And between us and them we could put pressure on these legislators or worst case scenario the governor to kill these bills"" Cliff Albright co-founder of Black Voters Matter told CNBC.

Groups including Black Voters Matter the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP on Friday launched the next phase of their campaign in local press and on social media asking supporters to directly contact CEOs presidents and headquarters of major Georgia-based corporations. They're urging them to speak out publicly against the proposed voting restrictions and to stop donating money to the Republican legislators sponsoring the bills.

The voter restriction bills come after historic turnout from Georgia voters — particularly from Black voters and voters of color — during the November general and January runoff elections where Republicans lost the presidential and U.S. Senate races for the first time in decades.

""It's very very disappointing after the outpouring of civic engagement all across the state that the legislature would then seek to make it more difficult for Georgia citizens to participate in choosing their elected officials"" Andrea Young executive director of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said in an interview.

Republican lawmakers in March passed a bill in the state Senate that would eliminate no-excuse absentee voting and in the House that would limit weekend early voting increase ID requirements for absentee voting and restrict ballot drop boxes: SB 241 and HB 531. These proposed restrictions would disproportionately harm Black voters an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found.

Advocacy groups are turning to Georgia's powerful business community because they say trying to sway GOP lawmakers alone has little effect.

""These companies employ hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters who are going to directly be impacted by these laws"" Nse Ufot CEO of the New Georgia Project told CNBC. ""Voter suppression is not good for business.""

The coalition is focusing on six of the biggest companies in Georgia — Aflac  Coca-Cola  Delta Airlines  Home Depot  Southern Company and UPS — with full-page ads demonstrations and text banks. A March 3 investigation by Popular Information found the six corporations gave a combined $190800 to co-sponsors of HB 531 and SB 241 since 2018.

The activists' work seems to be seeing some results. Business boosters have come out against certain provisions in the proposed voter restrictions since advocates started their pressure campaign.

The Georgia Chamber of Commerce previously reiterated the importance of voting rights without voicing opposition against any specific legislation. In a new statement to CNBC the Georgia Chamber said it has ""expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access"" and ""continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state.""

Dave Williams SVP of public policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce said in a statement Monday: ""Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.""

The Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce told CNBC in a statement: ""As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the 'Urgency' to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is 'RIGHT'; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are 'OPPOSED'. And GGBCC represents them.""

Most of the corporations have not taken a stance in the voting rights debate instead offering broad stances on voting and elections. All six companies belong to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and all but Aflac belong to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.

Aflac  Coca-Cola Delta  Home Depot and UPS reiterated their support for fair and secure elections and equal voter participation in statements to CNBC. Southern Company did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Georgia corporations have come out strongly against legislation in the past like a ""religious liberty"" bill in 2016 that would have allowed discrimination against same-sex couples. They've also mostly stood silent in other debates like a ""heartbeat"" anti-abortion bill in 2019 that was ruled unconstitutional in 2020.

Conservative Georgia lawmakers in the past have punished Georgia corporations for certain political moves. Republican legislators killed a major airline tax break after Delta pulled discounts for a National Rifle Association members.

CNBC has reached out to the Georgia Senate and House Republican Caucuses for comment on the corporate accountability campaigns.

Voting rights activists are not impressed with the statements companies have offered so far on the voting rights debate.

""We need a full throated repudiation of these bills"" New Georgia Project's Ufot said. ""What is your affirmation of how important democracy is when you are witnessing democracy being attacked and you're silent about it?""

Jerry Gonzalez chief executive of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials compared the bills to the notorious voting restrictions that kept people of color from casting ballots in the South before the civil rights movement ushered in the Voting Rights Act in the 1960s.

""We have been talking to business partners and chambers of commerce to get them to step up"" Gonzalez told CNBC. ""Many of them have taken a strong stand on racial justice issues. Well this is a Jim Crow voting rights attack that is happening right now.""

Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said business leaders should take an unequivocal stance against the proposed voting restrictions in Georgia and other states on a Tuesday call with voting rights organizations Fair Fight Action which she founded and More Than A Vote founded by NBA superstar LeBron James The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

""There should be no silence from the business community when anyone in power is trying to strip away the right to vote from the people"" Abrams said on the call. ""There should be a hue and cry.""

Bernice King the daughter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said Wednesday she wrote a letter urging CEOs of Georgia-based corporations to oppose the bills and to use their influence with Georgia state legislators to block restrictive legislation.

""It's not going to be business as usual"" Black Voters Matter's Albright said. ""If you can't get involved in the business of fighting for democracy then we're going to have to get involved in your business.""

Read the statements from companies and business groups below:

Aflac

The right to vote in national state and local elections is the cornerstone of democracy. We need to join together to ensure accessible and secure voting while preserving election integrity and transparency. As this important issue is debated in Georgia and statehouses across the nation we expect that fairness and integrity will be the ongoing basis for discussion.

Coca-Cola

Voting is a foundational right in America and we will continue to work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country. We support efforts by the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced in the Georgia Legislature this session. The ultimate goal should be fair secure elections where access to voting is broad-based and inclusive.

Delta

Delta is more than 75000 strong - and our shared values call on us to make our voices heard and be engaged members of our communities of which voting is a vital part of that responsibility. Ensuring an election system that promotes broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and creates an environment that ensures everyone's vote is counted.

Home Depot

We believe that all elections should be accessible fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We'll continue to work to ensure our associates both in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote.

UPS

UPS believes in the importance of the democratic process and supports facilitating the ability of all eligible voters to exercise their civic duty. We are committed to voter awareness and engagement. In the last election UPS ran an education campaign for our employees called ""Drive the Vote"" to encourage employees to vote. The Drive the Vote campaign was nonpartisan and endorsed no specific candidate or party. Like other businesses in the community we are working with the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber to ensure equitable access to the polls and the integrity of the election process across the state.

Dave Williams SVP Public Policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber:

Broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and contribute to a business environment that fosters growth and vitality. We continue to work closely with members of the Georgia General Assembly to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced this session. We are carefully evaluating the impact the bills would have on equitable access to the polls and elections integrity in our state.

As we assess specific elections legislation we will continue to rely on our core values related to elections:

We believe Georgia's elections process should be fair secure accurate and equally accessible to all eligible Georgia voters.

We believe our state and local governments should do everything possible to maximize voter participation and minimize unnecessary obstacles in our elections while working to ensure election integrity.

We are committed to voter education and broad engagement in the electoral process. Our past actions have demonstrated this commitment; our future actions will do the same.

We continue to advocate for balanced legislation that makes voting more accessible and more secure. Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.

Georgia Chamber of Commerce

The Georgia Chamber continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state. We have expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access. As these two omnibus bills move through the legislative process we will continue to work on ensuring both accessibility and security within our voting system.

Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce

GGBCC affirms ""All Eligible voters should be able to vote in Georgia."" As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the ""Urgency"" to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is ""RIGHT""; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are ""OPPOSED"". And GGBCC represents them.

""Our organization plays a very vital role in contributing to the economic growth in Georgia"" states GGBCC's CEO Melinda Sylvester. ""Accordingly we believe it is our civic duty to stand with all voters in our great state. In so doing we are exhibiting our collective strength to assure that the efforts of our Bridge Builder Initiative can continue to be building blocks for continued and future success for all Georgians."" The organization is further encouraging all GGBCC business owners and aspiring business owners to get engaged and stay in contact with their respective legislators."
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmF5cy8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2JyZW50LWhvbmV5d2VsbC1zaG93ZWQtYS1sb3QtYW5kLWlzLXJlYWR5LWZvci1tb3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brent Honeywell showed a lot and is ready for more,"NORTH PORT — Brent Honeywell had much to be encouraged about after a successful and impressive 15-pitch live batting-practice session Saturday his first time facing hitters since undergoing a fourth elbow procedure in December.

On the list: increased life on his fastball (clocked around 95 mph) better command of his secondary pitches anticipated reactions from hitters and how good he felt Sunday morning.

“A pretty big step forward’' he said.

Once the Rays top pitching prospect Honeywell has been sidelined since tearing an elbow ligament in his first live batting-practice session of spring 2018 leading to Tommy John surgery and three additional procedures.

He is confident he is ready to come back and Saturday’s session provided validation and confidence.

“The hop on the fastball was a little better and the stuff was probably as crisp as it’s been in three years’' Honeywell said. “And the reaction that I’m looking for is the reactions that I was getting back when I know that my stuff was really really good. I was getting kind of the same reaction.’'

First 🍯Honey🍯 day of the year was a success 🔥 pic.twitter.com/mhcKvrkz67 — Chris Betts (@ChrisBetts26) March 13 2021

Also he noted was the support from his teammates as many gathered to watch the Saturday morning session on a back field at the team complex. “That was awesome’' he said. “That one hit me right in the heart a little bit.’'

Honeywell who turns 26 on March 31 was throwing to hitters in October as a member of the postseason taxi squad and was in his word “serviceable.” But he said he is much improved now after the latest procedure provided more freedom of movement. Enough so that he feels he is ready to start pitching in spring games.

“I haven’t pitched in a game in three years’' he said. “I feel like getting me in front of a guy with a different jersey on is pretty beneficial and I feel like I can handle that right now.’'

Manager Kevin Cash said the staff also was excited by Honeywell’s performance but it remained “pretty unlikely” he would pitch in exhibition games which end March 30. “We’ll probably just have to revisit it here down at the end of spring but he’s still got plenty of boxes to check’' Cash said.

Phillips has hamstring issue

Outfielder Brett Phillips World Series Game 4 star and Seminole native tweaked his left hamstring running the bases in the second inning Sunday against the Braves and left the game. Cash said they will know more Monday about the severity. “He’s frustrated’' Cash said. “He said he worked so hard this offseason to kind of do hamstring maintenance stuff and it crept up. ... If he feels better (Monday) there’s probably not a major reason for concern. If he’s sore then we’re going to have to take a little bit of a deeper look.’'

Nonroster reliever Stetson Allie impressed using his fastball and more importantly his slider to strike out Braves A-listers Freddie Freeman and Marcell Ozuna and get Travis d’Arnaud on a ground out in nine-pitch inning all strikes. “Encouraging’' Cash said. … The Rays (4-9) took a 7-5 lead into the ninth but Tyler Zombro allowed a one-out walk a single and a walkoff homer to Ehire Adrianza in the 8-7 loss. … Minor-leaguers Miles Mastrobuoni Dalton Kelly and Moises Gomez came off the bench and homered for the Rays. … High-leverage relievers Diego Castillo and Nick Anderson had solid one-inning outings. … Minor-league outfielder Nathan Lukes had a diving catch in right. … Prospect Drew Strotman started allowing two one-out singles then getting a double play.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvb2xpbmdwb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2hvbmV5d2VsbC10by1vZmZlci1yNDU0Yi1hcy1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS10by1yNDEwYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeywell to offer R454B as alternative to R410A,"BELGIUM: Honeywell has announced that it is now offering the lower GWP R410A replacement R454B a refrigerant previously associated with its rival Chemours as Opteon XL41.

Without the fanfare that we normally expect from a Honeywell refrigerant introduction the announcement of the addition of R454B to the Honeywell portfolio was included as a secondary item in a newsletter sent to customers this week. It will market the refrigerant as Solstice 454B.

Meanwhile the industry still awaits Honeywell’s much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

Wide acceptability

An A2L refrigerant R454B has previously always been associated with Chemours from its time as DR-5 a DuPont development refrigerant and its subsequent passage through the ASHRAE classification process in 2015.

Despite this Honeywell lays claim to a patent on this refrigerant. When asked Honeywell told the Cooling Post: “Honeywell identified the usefulness of R-454B as a R-410A replacement for air conditioning in 2009 and has patented this discovery.”

What is clear is that R454B has been accepted by an increasing number of chiller heat pump and rooftop equipment manufacturers. These include Carrier Trane York Mitsubishi Electric Rhoss MTA Swegon Flakt Engie and GI.

A blend of R32 and R1234yf with a GWP of 466 R454B appears to be the best current option for new equipment in applications where a lower-flammability refrigerant is an option.

Honeywell notes that the discharge temperature of R454B is much lower than R32 and thanks to its higher critical temperature (77°C) and broader operating envelope in low evaporating temperatures it outperforms other alternatives such as R32 in heating applications.

Where’s R466A?

The news of Honeywell’s new addition comes while the market still awaits news of its much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

First announced by Honeywell in 2018 as Solstice N41 R466A was described as “a breakthrough” with its A1 non-flammable classification addressing “one of the most vexing regulatory and safety challenges facing the HVAC industry”.

An eagerly-awaited potential option for use in VRF systems it was originally going to be available in commercial quantities in the fall of 2019 then early 2020. Since then there has been little news of this refrigerant although it is accepted that OEM testing can be a protracted process a process which may have been further delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.

A number of OEMs were initially reported to be working with R466A including Chinese manufacturer Midea and Toshiba Carrier – a company which described the new refrigerant as “promising” after initial performance testing in a VRF air conditioning system. Component manufacturers Sanhua and Parker Hannifin were also known to be carrying out compatibility testing.

There have however been rumours of stability and compatibility concerns related to the refrigerants blend’s key CF3I (R13I1) component. Honeywell has previously denied any problems telling the Cooling Post last year that R466A was stable: “As seen with past introduction of new refrigerants the stability and shelf life can be addressed with standard measures practiced in the industry” it said.

As we approach the third anniversary of the initial announcement of the refrigerant Honeywell maintains that R466A is now in the “advanced stages” of commercialisation with samples having been provided to OEMs for evaluation to ensure compatibility with their equipment.

“To date Solstice N41 has undergone extensive testing by over 15 OEMs and leading compressor manufacturers and accumulated more than 100000+ hours in different applications like commercial AC (VRF rooftops) and residential AC (unitary)” the company said but would not be drawn on a new release timetable.

Comfort and protection—now at a discount! (Photo: Amazon)

Pretty prints and patterns are great and all but sometimes you just want a quality mask that goes with whatever you plan to wear that day. That’s one of the reasons why plenty of folks have turned to Honeywell’s Dual-Layer Cloth Face Cover.

The face mask which keeps flying into carts at Amazon is currently in stock and marked down. Right now you can snag a Honeywell face cover along with eight replacement filters for $22 (was $30).

Why are these masks so popular? They’ve got a different look and feel than your typical cloth face mask. For starters they feature a seamless 3D knit construction that provides four-way stretch. That minimizes gaps to ensure proper protection and also makes them super comfortable.

The masks also have adjustable earloops and a nose clip to allow you to get that just-right fit regardless of the size or shape of your face. Another nice perk of these masks: They have a hidden filter pocket that allows you to easily slip in a Honeywell filter and remove it when you’re done.

Oh! They’re also highly breathable thanks to a contoured design that helps the mask stand off of your face while you wear it (vs. being pushed right up against your mouth).

The Honeywell mask is reusable and durable—meaning it’ll keep its shape and function after several washings.

It also comes in light grey! (Photo: Amazon)

Choose between light grey and dark grey tones or stock up on both.

These masks have an army of fans. “It’s honestly the best face mask I’ve ever tried! It’s heavy and durable. It doesn’t slip around your face the nose piece stays in place and the adjustable ear straps make for a tight fit” one happy wearer wrote. Another called this the “best mask I’ve found” noting that “glasses don’t fog when I’m wearing it.”

Plenty of reviewers say they’re repeat customers. “Hubs liked it SO much that I came back and got one for me in grey” a five-star reviewer wrote. “Overall...the best mask out there to us. And we have tried a ton. Very much recommend and already have to our friends.”

Just a heads up: The Honeywell Dual Layer Face Cover has a habit of selling out so you’ll want to act fast on this one.

The contract which supports the Kingdom’s focus on advancing the country’s healthcare sector will enable MMS to optimize its energy usage and building maintenance across its six hospital locations in Saudi Arabia.

Honeywell’s contract is part of MMS’ “digital-first” approach and involves the deployment of the company’s Honeywell Forge enterprise performance management solutions to enable better management of assets. It includes:

• Honeywell Forge Energy Optimization which autonomously and continually optimizes a building’s internal set points across hundreds of integrated assets — constantly evaluating weather occupancy levels tariffs time of day and other data — and makes adjustments every 15 minutes to improve a building’s HVAC system for peak efficiency without compromising occupant comfort. It can increase comfort performance and improve energy savings by double digits. The solution also provides intuitive dashboards as well as full visibility of energy performance across all six MMS buildings and facilities in the Kingdom.

• Honeywell Forge Digitized Maintenance which changes the way buildings and assets are maintained through a proactive maintenance process of curated recommendations. Using sensors and system integration to analyze building controllers and mechanical assets intuitive dashboards provide near real-time insights to track building performance and reduce unplanned reactive work on building systems.

• In addition to the Honeywell Forge solutions the company will also integrate proprietary and third-party systems across the six MMS locations including its Enterprise Buildings Integrator (EBI) building management system to improve building system control and a portfolio of security and fire alarm systems to maximize occupant safety.

George Bou Mitri vice president and general manager Honeywell Building Technologies Middle East Turkey and Africa said: “With more than 60 years’ experience in hospital environments and in Saudi Arabia we understand the complex challenging and highly regulated world of healthcare within the Kingdom and our collaboration with MMS demonstrates our commitment to furthering the government’s vision for the healthcare sector. We are proud to build on our long-term relationship with MMS to deploy fully integrated solutions to further its strategic goals for enhanced patient experience and energy saving optimization in line with the objectives of the Saudi Vision 2030.”

“At Mouwasat Medical Services our mission is to provide sustainable first-class medical services that will aid the economic advancement of the country’s healthcare sector. At the heart of this mission is our digitization drive across all aspects of our operations to enhance efficiency and ultimately to help us deliver the best possible care to our patients. This latest agreement with Honeywell is a reflection of our commitment to digitize operations helping us optimize energy consumption and maintenance that will lower operating cost increase comfort and maximize uptime across our facilities” said Mohammed Sulaiman Al-Saleem managing director at MMS.

MMS is a leading healthcare provider in Saudi Arabia with its facility in Alkhobar being the first digital hospital in the Eastern Province. Honeywell has previously played a key role in the digitization of MMS’ Alkhobar and Madinah hospitals and its long-term care facility at Dammam through the installation of building management systems and security fire voice alarm intrusion detection and video surveillance solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jZ3RuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDMtMTMvSG9uZXl3ZWxsLWNvbmZpZGVudC10aGF0LUNoaW5hLWNhbi1wcm92aWRlLW1vcmUtaGlnaC10ZWNoLXRhbGVudHMtWXpOY2RhOXVLSS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jZ3RuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDMtMTMvSG9uZXl3ZWxsLWNvbmZpZGVudC10aGF0LUNoaW5hLWNhbi1wcm92aWRlLW1vcmUtaGlnaC10ZWNoLXRhbGVudHMtWXpOY2RhOXVLSS9zaGFyZV9hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeywell confident that China can provide more high-tech talents,"Industrial conglomerate Honeywell opened its emerging market headquarters and innovation center in Wuhan last May despite the pandemic demonstrating its confidence in the strong potential of the Chinese market and the country's ability to provide more high-tech talents.

Robust economic growth and an improved business environment have made China a popular investment location for multinational companies like Honeywell.

Honeywell an American technology company in China since 1972 has become a local company with its strategy of ""East for East.""

Shane Tedjarati president of Global High Growth Regions has witnessed China's development over the past four decades with his own eyes.

CGTN's Michael Wang speaks with him on what opportunities Honeywell will garner as China uses innovation and technology to boost urbanization and address climate change.

The following are excerpts from the interview which have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: How is the talent pipeline for Honeywell China in terms of the quality and supply of engineers?

Tedjarati: The talent has significantly changed over the past 10 years. We used to hire for potential and train a lot of people maybe 15 years ago. And then make it through the training and all that continue to grow on the company. Today China is producing a lot more talents at all levels which was something very rare 15 or even 10 years ago. Today you really have a good set of well-trained talents in engineering marketing supply chain product offering and overall leadership in program management. These are the reasons why we continue to believe that China will be able to continue to fuel growth.

We're an engine of nearly 10000 people and continue to grow and raise talent. We're looking both internally as well as externally. What you have to be a company that drives high technology to solve real problems and gives people not just the tools but also the authority the latitude the room to make an impact. If you do that then you can attract good talent. If you don't do that there's so much competition for those talents across China.

CGTN: What are the mega-trends you see in China when it comes to industry?

Tedjarati: There are several mega-trends that are particularly important. One is this continuous emergence and drive towards urbanization. Urbanization and the rise of the standard of living in China is the big mega mega-trend.

The elimination of poverty that the nation is completely committed to we've seen that play out really well in the past 30 years. And I think it has a lot of way moving forward. The rise of the standard of living requires solving problems of low arable land and high-density population and all that with great technology. And those technologies in safety security energy efficiency e-commerce supply chain warehousing green buildings healthy buildings healthy hospitals schools. And then underlying enabling technologies are artificial intelligence and the intersection of software and hardware

CGTN: What about sustainability? China has huge ambitions in terms of going green. And Honeywell said it can change the cost equation when it comes to renewable energy. When you speak to Chinese policymakers are they receptive? Do they want to adapt to this kind of change as soon as possible?

Tedjarati: Absolutely a lot more than they were just a few years ago. Because I think the emphasis of the current leadership of China is on better quality of life rising of the standard of living and adopting technologies such as AI and digital technology to bring more efficiency and a definite commitment to reducing CO2 and to reducing carbon and becoming more of a carbon-neutral economy. So they are really interested in what we have to bring to the table."

If you know anything about the SPAM Museum of Austin Minnesota you may well be a SPAMbassador – according to the official SPAM Museum website SPAMbassadors are the ""noble food fellows"" who ""make sure your visit is full of wonder and hunger"" and are responsible for giving tours of the only museum devoted to the classic canned luncheon meat that's been delighting fans since its introduction to the world by Hormel Foods in 1937.

The SPAM website reports that there are 12.8 cans of SPAM luncheon meat eaten every second. There are 13 different varieties of SPAM sold in 44 different countries around the world and over eight billion cans of SPAM products have been sold. Why shouldn't this culinary phenomenon have its own museum? Truly SPAM is the star of Hormel Foods which is also behind such beloved pantry staples as Dinty Moore stew and Skippy peanut butter. In fact the museum started out as ""a small storefront company museum in a local mall"" in 1991 per Roadside America but the public cared about SPAM more than any other product and so it was renamed the SPAM Museum.

According to Wired Hormel gave up a legal challenge on its canned meat's name being used to denote unwanted e-mail. Now if it's junk mail in your inbox it's spam; if it's lunch it's SPAM. (If it's a comedy sketch it's Monty Python.)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Computer storage and memory products maker Kingston Technology Inc. is selling its gaming unit to the Palo Alto-based computer and printer giant HP.



HyperX offerings include headsets keyboards mice mouse pads USB microphones console accessories and eyewear.



“HyperX corporate offices will continue to be based in Fountain Valley on the campus of Kingston” Daniel Kelley vice president of marketing at HyperX told the Business Journal on March 1.



“HyperX offices globally will also remain at their current locations.”



He added: “It is important to both HP and HyperX to maintain the gaming culture and trust created over the years in the gaming community and to retain the people that have created it and helped build the brand.”



HP is paying $425 million subject to customary working capital and other adjustments to acquire Kingston's HyperX.



So far there’s no word on whether Kingston founders John Tu and David Sun will share proceeds with employees as they did when they sold 80% of the parent company to SoftBank Corp. in 1996. At that time Tu and Sun distributed $100 million among the workers. They bought back the share three years later.



Kingston is the largest privately owned company in Orange County with revenue expected to top $13 billion this year. It hasn’t disclosed what percentage of that figure derives from HyperX.

Gaming Attractive



“The acquisition supports HP’s strategy to drive growth in its personal systems business where gaming and peripherals are attractive segments” Kingston said in announcing the sale to HP in late February.



Kingston will retain the DRAM memory flash and SSD electronic storage products for gamers and enthusiasts since they are part of Kington’s core offerings.



The transaction is expected to close by June 30 pending regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.



Kelley says he will remain as the vice president of marketing for HyperX.



“Kingston appreciated how HP understood the value of the HyperX team that brought the brand to this level and their commitment to bring them into their family to continue providing direction and growth to the brand” Kelley told the Business Journal.



He emphasized HyperX is not moving out of Fountain Valley.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZ2V0LXRvLWtub3ctdGhlLWlvbmlxLTUtaGVyZS1hcmUtZml2ZS1pbnRlcmVzdGluZy1mYWN0cy1hYm91dC10aGUtZnV0dXJpc3RpYy1ldi0xNTc1NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get to Know the Ioniq 5: Here Are Five Interesting Facts About the Futuristic EV,"It may look more like a rendered concept vehicle yet the Ioniq 5 is very much real and will be available in all important markets later this year. Apart from its futuristic exterior design Hyundai’s latest EV offers many advanced features an innovative eco-friendly cabin and ultra-fast charging.

Not long ago the South Korean manufacturer launched the beautiful Ioniq 5  which joins the Ioniq hatchback and Konain the company’s all-electric lineup.However in terms of design and technology it stands in a league of its own showcasing the company’s vision for an all-electric future.If we take a look back at how uninspired Hyundai-branded vehicles looked a decade ago we can fully appreciate the company’s giant leap in terms of design. The Ioniq 5 is one of those rare vehicles that virtually everyone loves because it looks stunning from every angle.It’s just as impressive when it comes to the features and technologies it possesses so let’s take a closer look at the five most interesting facts about Hyundai’s innovative EV.Built on the modular E-GMP  the company’s first platform developed specifically for EVs the Ioniq 5 is available with either a 58or 72.6 kWh battery and two motor layout configurations. The first uses a single electric motor mounted on the rear axle while the second configuration adds one on the front axle and provides all-wheel-drive.The entry-level RWD powertrain which is suitable for customers who spend more time driving in urban environments uses a 58-kWh battery and produces 168 hp (125) along with 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) of torque.For more range and power those who opt for the RWD model can equip it with a 72.6 kWh battery for 215 hp (160 kW) and the same amount of torque as the standard version.Higher-end models with dual-motor configurations and AWD develop 232 hp (173 kW) and 446 lb-ft (605 Nm) of torque with the 58-kWh battery while the long-range version generates the same amount of torque and 302 hp (225 kW).Hyundai has announced that North American customers will only be able to choose between the RWD and72.6 kWh versions.Just like the Porsche Taycan and its sibling the Audi e-tron GT  the 5 uses an 800V architecture. This enables the EV’s 72.6 kWh battery to be charged from 10 to 80% in just 18 minutes using a high-power 350-kW charger.In translation the vehicle only needs 5 minutes of super fast charging for about 62 miles (100 km) of range.The architecture can also support 400V charging without the need for additional components or adapters which means it can use all existing charging infrastructures.Just as spectacular and futuristic as the exterior the Ioniq 5’s cabin provides a glimpse of how interiors will look and function when vehicles will become fully autonomous.On the dashboard two 12-inch full-touch displays are fitted in a dual-cockpit layout. One functions as an instrument panel while the other is used to control the infotainment system along with other functions such as navigation or seat adjustment.The highlight of the cabin is the ""Universal Island"" which is a central console that can slide back as much as 5.5 inches (14 cm) allowing the driver to enter and exit the vehicle on both sides which can be extremely useful when parking in tight spaces.The front seats are electronically adjustable feature footrests and look comfortable enough to take a nap in when fully reclined. The backseat also slides back up to 5.3 inches (13.5 cm) to provide even more legroom for rear passengers.Many interior components like the seats headliner door trims floor and armrest are made from eco-friendly  sustainably sourced materials such as recycled PET bottles plant-based or eco-processed leather with plant-based extracts.Hyundai has fitted the Ioniq 5 with a Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function that allows it to charge other electric devices such as smartphones laptops e-bikes or camping equipment.It can supply up to 3.6 kW of power through a port located under the backseat which can only be used when the vehicle is running or through an additional V2L port fitted on the exterior next to the charging port. This one can be used even if the vehicle is turned off.The Ioniq 5 is the first Hyundai with an augmented reality head-up display and is available with Remote Smart Parking Assist which enables drivers to remotely park or exit a parking spot from outside the vehicle using a smartphone.It also comes with Highway Driving Assist 2 that uses a front view camera radar sensors and navigation data to control the vehicle speed and following distance and assist drivers when changing lanes.Other advanced assists include Intelligent Speed Limit Assist which automatically adjusts speed to match the speed limit High Beam Assist that switches high beams on or off automatically and Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist that detects vehicles cyclists or pedestrians and helps drivers avoid them by automatically applying the brakes.The gorgeous and capable EV is set to be available in the second half of 2021 but Hyundai has yet to reveal its pricing list.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9NaWNyb3NvZnQtZXllaW5nLXVwLUtvbmFtaS1hbmQtU2VnYS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbnMtdG8tcG9zc2libHktaW52aWdvcmF0ZS13YW5pbmctWGJveC1jb25zb2xlLXNhbGVzLWluLUphcGFuLjUyNzcyNi4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft eyeing up Konami and Sega acquisitions to possibly invigorate waning Xbox console sales in Japan,"Microsoft snapping up Sega is the rumor that will never go away but it now seems that Konami could also be in the sights of the parent company of the Xbox Game Studios. Microsoft could do with a boost in Japan as recent sales figures reported 10 Xbox One consoles sold compared to 78134 Nintendo Switch units.

There’s no denying when it comes to making acquisitions Microsoft and its Xbox Game Studios are not shy about aiming high. The recent purchase of ZeniMax Media the company that owns id Software and Bethesda Softworks for a whopping US$7.5 billion proves that Microsoft is actively and aggressively seeking to enhance its company portfolio and its vital Xbox brand. A popular tech commenter has indicated that the next companies that are being lined up for potential takeovers are the Japanese gaming stalwarts Sega and Konami.

Microsoft and Sega have been linked for decades and the acquisition of the latter by the former has been rumored for many a year. It would make sense for Xbox Game Studios to obtain Sega’s specialist knowledge and experience in the console area and the Tokyo-based firm has certainly struggled over the last years in comparison to its Sega Genesis/Mega Drive heyday. Konami has also been thrown into the mix again and the company would bring along valuable gaming IPs like Silent Hill and Metal Gear with any acquisition.

As usual the believability of the rumors settles on just how important or not the Japanese market is for Microsoft/Xbox. Recent sales figures for the country are pretty dire for the Redmond company: 1508 units of the Xbox Series X and S and just 10 Xbox One consoles sold for the week ending February 27. In comparison for that same week 3249 PS4 consoles were snapped up Japanese gamers bought 33792 PS5 machines and 78134 Nintendo Switch devices were purchased.

Acquiring Konami and Sega would not only make Xbox a stronger brand in Japan but it would also appeal to the millions of fans of the two companies in other areas of the world who happen to own an Xbox console. Both Microsoft head Satya Nadella and Xbox chief Phil Spencer have made it clear that the acquisition of established game developers is the right direction to take so maybe there will be some further studio expansion coming in 2021.

In another “rabbit hole moment” I lost myself in a bout of reminiscence on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. A prehistoric SemiSerious blog post from 2009 attempted to provide updates from ISSCC 2009. TechInsights engineers Aaron Murray James Bull and Mohammad Ahmad provided the boots on the ground reports to HQ. I believe these three fine gentlemen all continue their yeoman’s work at the Ottawa company.

At ISSCC 2009 Intel was presenting a number of papers related to its Nehalem processor. Mark Bohr’s plenary indicated that Intel was putting a lot of effort into system-on-chip (SoC) development. The Core i7 Nehalem design pulled the memory controllers and DDR3 I/O’s onto a common substrate with the CPU cores. At the time Intel suggested that they were looking beyond the traditional PC market and into hotter ones like mobile. In Bohr’s words “Intel is no longer a one-size-fits-all company.”

From this there was a recollection of a “great debate” between SoC and system-in-package (SiP) advocates. Intel had been focused on package integration while Texas Instruments pounded the SoC drum. Now it would be reasonable to ask what relevance these two companies might have on the 2021 landscape considering that other players are trending higher in the conversation than these two old stalwarts. Gordon Moore’s company and the birthplace of his law was already thinking about More than Moore (MTM) back then.

The idea of the disagreggation of integrated circuit design into smaller physical pieces of silicon chiplets that can be mixed and matched Lego-style at the package level has been generating buzz for some time. For Intel’s part they have not abandoned the SoC mentality but continue to dispel the one-size-fits-all label. From Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to their central role in the State-of-the-art Heterogeneous Integration Prototype (SHIP) program it appears Intel will not be left behind. Integration of diverse designs using more specialized chiplets fit Intel as much as any other company whether direct competitors like AMD with their EPYC implementations or vendors with completely different market aspirations.

In the 2009 ISSCC coverage I predicted that Intel would be ready for mobile based on this renewed focus on the SoC. Looking back it’s easy to see how wrong I was. Fast forward and the big data age and AI accelerators are much more interesting to a company like Intel. Acquiring an FPGA company (Altera) in 2015 helped maintain Intel’s territory in the data center as cloud computing drove a more rapid advance in technology as well as market importance.

Volatile vernacular

There have been a few incarnations of terms along the way. Anyone who has posted on topics like heterogeneous integration can relate a story or two of commenters reminding them that only the term not the technology is new. But cut some slack here. We are all just trying to fill column space.

In general heterogeneous integration was a term adopted to sell MTM as an approach to keep innovation moving and industry economics headed in the right direction. A seminar or conference or at least a conference call between marketing departments would have helped. The original vernacular was heterogeneous integration technology (HIT). ASE Group truncated this to HI. Hello right back at you.

IEEE went so far as to create a new pronoun with its heterogeneous integration roadmap (HIR).

In a land before time inhabited by engineers who may tell you fond stories of rubylith days there were hybrid integrated circuits. Hybrids were collections of different component types to create a functional module. The hybrids were definitely heterogeneous. In that sense today’s lingo is just re-branding with the help of a thesaurus.

Moving on there was the multi-chip module or MCM. These were perhaps less heterogeneous than the hybrids since multiple die were assembled onto a common package substrate. But several functions and even multiple material system ICs for example silicon along with GaAs were collected into these platforms. Adding a discrete or two maybe some decoupling capacitors would definitely make this another hybrid or heterogeneous application.

Someone who was more intimately involved at the time could help shed light on this but it would seem to me that MCM was meant to denote a change where multiple individual integrated circuit die appeared on a common substrate. That was the milestone that spawned the new term.

The MCM is still important today decades after the technology was introduced. With the advent of newer enabling technologies like through-silicon vias (TSVs) and 2.5D integration with silicon interposers a More than Moore strategy moves the industry toward the 3DIC. The most influential products in this field are the so-called high bandwidth memory (HBM) products. One of these seemed to acknowledge history rather than inventing a new term. The Hybrid Memory Cube (HBC) product co-developed by Micron and Samsung used the latest TSV approach to stacking multiple DRAM die with their controller.

One term has more or less persisted. System-in-package (SiP) has been around for a couple of decades. That’s an eternity considering the pace of change in terminology at least.

The ASE Group introduction to HI illustrates and explains collecting a set of dissimilar die into a single SiP. This is an obvious representation of the chiplet concept but the term does not appear on the page.

Chiplets rising

One should never discount the importance of terminology and marketing to technology. There is spin re-spin regurgitation and recycling.

Enter chiplets.

Why not? It’s easy to say and easy to digest the concept. It’s much better than the nerdier multi-chip module (easy to interpret) or heterogeneous integration (open to interpretation).

To get an idea of when the term became popular Google Trends provides a history of chiplet as a search term going back to 2004. There was an early dalliance with the chiplet but that died down quickly. The real uptick has been since 2019.

Google Trends is useful but it will not reveal the context in which chiplet was searched. Rather than stand by the assumption that the chiplet we are considering took off only two years ago a look at patent activity will be more revealing. This information trove gives us a much longer timeline as well.

A search of the patent databases reveals use of the chiplet term as early as 1969. However in the integrated circuit field it is only in IBM applications published in late 2000 that our current understanding of the term and technology align.

Although this early use of chiplet is not in the heterogeneous sense we understand to mean a SiP of heterogeneous die. The early days of chiplets were related to driver chips for LCDs. And that makes sense if you have looked closely at any display panel larger than a cell phone. Whether on flex substrates attached to the panel glass or directly on the panel there are many tall and skinny LCD column driver chiplets attached to each large LCD panel.

Looking at this from a trending term perspective it is fair to say that use in a reasonable volume of patent applications would provide an indication of the adoption of the term. In that sense chiplets really pick up the pace in 2010. It is worth noting that several entities and inventors involved in display technology continue to represent a a large proportion of the activity related to chiplets. However for system-in-package heterogeneous integration IBM GlobalFoundries and Intel are the most active companies.

Like it or not “chiplet” is here to stay. “Googling” it and patenting it make it so.

It seems like going down a rabbit hole loves company. It’s time we all came up for air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9iYXJiYXJhLWJvdWRyZWF1eC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02ODUyMzE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbara Boudreaux Obituary (1940 - 2021) - Baton Rouge LA - The Advocate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.theadvocate.com/us/obituaries/theadvocate/name/barbara-boudreaux-obituary?id=6852317 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9iYXJiYXJhLWJvdWRyZWF1eC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02ODUyMzE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2dhcnRuZXJzLTIwMjEtbWFnaWMtcXVhZHJhbnQtY2l0ZXMtZ2x1dC1vZi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLWRhdGEtc2NpZW5jZS1hbmQtbWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant cites 'glut of innovation' in data science and ML,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/gartners-2021-magic-quadrant-cites-glut-of-innovation-in-data-science-and-ml/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2dhcnRuZXJzLTIwMjEtbWFnaWMtcXVhZHJhbnQtY2l0ZXMtZ2x1dC1vZi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLWRhdGEtc2NpZW5jZS1hbmQtbWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

With the U.S. stock market butting against record highs valuations certainly deserve a closer look. One company that may survive such scrutiny is Zoetis (ZTS 1.51%).

Zoetis specializes in making pharmaceuticals for livestock animals and pets. While the company may not be a household name among investors like Pfizer Zoetis has been a great stock to own over the long term and has continued to report strong financial results throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zoetis's record 2020

2020 was a fantastic year for Zoetis. Earnings were up due to excellent performance in its companion animal segment (companion animals include dogs cats and horses). While the livestock segment was flat for the year sales in the companion animal division were up 17% thanks to the launch of a new product Simparica Trio and gains in the company's dermatology portfolio.

Simparica Trio is a parasiticide for companion animals to prevent heartworm ticks fleas roundworms and hookworms. What makes Simparica Trio special is that it is the first ""triple threat"" parasiticide on the market that combats all the major parasites at the same time. The new drug added $150 million of incremental sales in 2020.

Another part of the company's portfolio that outperformed was dermatology. Revenues increased more than $170 million versus the prior year thanks in part to continued performance from Apoquel and Cytopoint both of which benefited from pet owners being more attuned to their pets' behavior while stuck at home.

Zoetis's livestock segment had a very challenging year due to the pandemic which caused a massive contraction in livestock demand across the globe. However China helped mitigate some of these headwinds with significant revenue contributions in an effort to replenish the still-weakened herds caused by an outbreak of African Swine Flu in 2019.

Attractive long-term growth

Zoetis is expected to carry its momentum into the new year. The company provided financial guidance for revenue to grow 9% to 11% in 2021 driven by continued performance in the companion animal segment new product launches and increased demand for livestock-related products during the economic reopening.

The companion animal segment has driven most of the company's growth with new product launches as a highlight. Zoetis has one of the most robust development pipelines in the industry. For example management has high hopes for Librela and Solensia (osteoarthritis drugs for dogs and cats) which are expected to be released during the first half of 2021.

What is unique about these pharmaceuticals is that they use monoclonal antibodies to provide effective pain relief and joint mobility with minimal kidney and liver involvement. This is truly groundbreaking for the veterinary industry at large and is difficult for competitors to replicate.

Companion animal diagnostics is another interesting growth area for the company. When Zoetis acquired Abaxis in 2019 it gained access to a suite of testing equipment and kits that allowed the company to enter the highly lucrative diagnostics space. Zoetis intends to continue growing in the pet diagnostics space through mergers and acquisitions so investors should keep an eye on what the company acquires in the future.

Zoetis is fortunate to be built on strong fundamental trends. An ever-increasing number of families are adopting pets and they're finding medical care for them at increasing rates. And the livestock division is expected to sustain its mid-single-digit growth as emerging economies consume more protein and farmers shift to work more sustainably.

Valuation too high?

With a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 40 Zoetis's stock doesn't scream ""cheap."" However Zoetis is a high-quality business with a position in the attractive market for animal healthcare. Investors are paying a high multiple in expectation of continued growth.

If you compare Zoetis to human-oriented pharma peers the stock looks expensive. Pfizer carries a P/E ratio of 20 and Eli Lilly trades for 30 times earnings.

However if you compare Zoetis to other pet companies the valuation appears to be more reasonable. Idexx Labs a veterinary diagnostics company trades for 73 times earnings while pet food company Chewy is unprofitable and trades for 6.4 times its price-to-sales -- compared with Zoetis's price-to-sales multiple of 10.

An attractive growth story

Clearly Zoetis is running red-hot right now. The challenges of 2020 proved that Zoetis can rise to the occasion and management has clearly been forward-looking -- new product launches an expansive global presence diagnostics penetration and much much more all paint the picture of a company that truly understands its business.

Zoetis has provided excellent returns for investors and only seems to grow in potential. Its top-tier pipeline and robust portfolio look poised to dominate the market for years to come. Investors keen to join in on animal health would be wise to take a look at Zoetis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When Guido Appenzeller first got a call last year to possibly work for Intel his initial reaction was ""You have the wrong number. I'm not a chip guy.""

At the time Appenzeller had worked as chief product officer at the security key startup Yubico for almost two years. He had previously worked at VMware for over four years as CTO of cloud and networking but beyond that he'd spent his career working at startups.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Still after months of conversations with a recruiter and also former Intel CEO Bob Swan where the company made it clear that it was serious about a deeper commitment to software he decided that the ""scale and ubiquity"" of Intel excited him. He joined its data platforms group as chief technical officer in January.

It's a crucial time of transition for Intel. Former VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger took the helm as Intel's new CEO in February returning to the chip giant after over 11 years. And right now Intel is transitioning from building CPU (Central Processing Units) to XPU which is more efficient for graphics media AI memory security and networking.

""It's well publicized that Intel has challenges at the moment"" Appenzeller told Insider. ""If you really want to change how computers are built in this space there's a lot you can do at Intel. That's a very exciting opportunity for me.""

He plans to help forge ""deeper"" customer partnerships

Intel has more than a 92% market share in data centers according to Mercury Research which makes Appenzeller's data platforms group a vital unit for the company. Right now Intel is building new data centers that use computing resources more efficiently.

The data platforms group which is the group Appenzeller oversees the technology strategy for also includes the network platforms group – both of which performed well last year. Last year Intel's data center group saw its revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $26.1 billion. The network platforms group which is part of the data platforms group also grew 20% year-over-year and generated $6 billion in revenue last year. Now the market that Intel sells to is changing as more people move to the cloud Appenzeller said.

""Our customers are changing"" Appenzeller said. ""Working within Azure Amazon Google — these sophisticated software companies are built on software stacks that require us to do things differently.""

The firm plans to""forge deeper partnerships"" including by expanding its cloud services. Intel also plans to build more chips and data centers for specific industries or specialties like tailoring them to run powerful AI applications.

""Designing a CPU for a general market that's a different challenge compared to building something for somebody the size of an Amazon who has very specific requirements"" Appenzeller said.

In his role Appenzeller hopes to spend plenty of time with customers many of which he has known in his past life at VMware. He will use those conversations to help plan a long-term strategy for the technology his group builds.

""There's a lot we can do to work better with them to listen more to understand how we can help them with customization for particular data center use cases for particular workloads to help them differentiate from competitors"" Appenzeller said.

Appenzeller joined Intel about a month before Gelsinger became CEO. He had previously worked under Gelsinger's leadership at VMware and he says at Intel there's now a ""renewed focus on technology and innovation.""

""Pat is a fantastic manager"" Appenzeller said. ""I'm a huge fan. I was super happy. It's almost a little bit of an Intel renaissance at the moment. There's a feeling inside of renewed energy in the organizations.""

This week marked Intel sending out initial Linux driver enablement patches for Alder Lake P mobile support to complement the existing Alder Lake S desktop support that has been coming together in recent months. In addition to the Linux kernel code for ADL-P the Intel open-source Media Driver code was also updated for video acceleration on this Intel hybrid chip.Alder Lake P open-source media acceleration support was merged this week into the GitHub repository for this video encode/decode implementation. Worth noting from that code drop is Alder Lake P having the same media capabilities / codec support as Alder Lake S and in turn the same as Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake Gen12 graphics.That Tiger Lake / Rocket Lake / Alder Lake (P and S) support includes HEVC 12-bit decode and encode (and decode for 12-bit 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 content) decode for VP9 12-bit and decode for AV1 8-bit and 10-bit content. The rest of the supported encode/decode combinations remain inline with prior Intel graphics generations. There is not yet any Intel accelerated video encode for AV1 and it doesn't appear that way through Alder Lake unless they have been holding back those patches.That initial Intel ADL-P media driver support can be found via this commit though it's quite straight-forward in building off the existing Gen12/Xe code paths. In any case great to see Intel continuing to provide punctual open-source Linux driver support well ahead of product launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xNC91c2luZy1hbi1lZ3B1LXdpdGgtYS1taW5pLXBjLWludGVsLW51Yy03LTgv0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY254LXNvZnR3YXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L3VzaW5nLWFuLWVncHUtd2l0aC1hLW1pbmktcGMtaW50ZWwtbnVjLTctOC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using an eGPU with a mini PC,"Mini PCs have grown in popularity in part due to their small form-factor offering low-powered basic computing with sufficient ports for connectivity. As such they are useful both in commercial settings such as digital signage as well as with consumers needing a small-footprint or VESA-mounted low-cost computer. However one drawback is their limited graphical performance due to using CPUs with integrated graphics which results in the options for playing games being somewhat restricted and ‘AAA’ titles typically being unplayable.

Lower-priced laptops often share the same drawback and one of the ways that users have addressed their graphical need is by utilizing an external GPU (eGPU) however the commercially available ones are both expensive and require connecting via a Thunderbolt 3 port.

Unfortunately not many Chinese-made mini PCs currently include a Thunderbolt 3 port however now that they have started to include M.2 NVMe ports this has created the possibility of adding a GPU using a ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’.

Examples of the various options available for using a GPU with a mini PC including the choices of configuration and performance impacts especially on gaming are discussed below. Reading the full article is recommended but if you are short on time check out the conclusion.

Configuration Options

The primary requirement is to use a standard graphics card that has a PCIe x16 interface. A commercial eGPU is basically a glorified ‘PCIe x16 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter’. This can effectively be replicated through using a ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ combined with a ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ and is suitable for any PC with a Thunderbolt 3 port.

However if the mini PC doesn’t have the required Thunderbolt 3 port but does have an M.2 NVMe slot then the PCIe adapter can be used in place of the NVMe SSD that occupies the M.2 NVMe slot. Then if there is no further internal storage available it becomes necessary to use external storage for example a ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’ to reuse the NVMe SSD that was replaced by the PCIe adapter.

So as long as the mini PC has an M.2 NVMe slot there are a number of options to connect a GPU:

If the mini PC also has a Thunderbolt 3 port Use a GPU in an ‘eGPU’ connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port or

Use a GPU in a ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ installed in a ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port or

Use a GPU in a ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ installed in an M.2 NVMe slot and either reuse the NVMe SSD by installing it in a ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port or reuse the NVMe SSD by installing it in a ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’ connected via a USB port or use external storage connected via a USB port If no Thunderbolt 3 port: Use a GPU in a ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ installed in an M.2 NVMe slot and either reuse the NVMe SSD by installing it in a ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’ connected via a USB port or use external storage connected via a USB port

Technical Understanding

Without going into too much detail a brief explanation of the underlying technology is useful in understanding why performance is impacted.

In a desktop PC the discrete graphics card typically uses the PCIe x16 Gen 3 slot on the motherboard and although Gen 4 slots are becoming available they are not necessarily required at this stage for gaming. A PCIe Gen 3 interface has a per-lane data transfer rate of 8 gigatransfers per second (GT/s) but the bandwidth is reduced by 2/130 percent because it uses an encoding scheme. Therefore a PCIe x16 interface is capable of (8 GT/s * 16) – 2/130% or 15.7538 GB/s whereas a PCIe x4 interface is only capable of 3.938 GB/s. Depending on how the PCIe slot is connected to the CPU there may also be a slight further performance loss when connecting a graphics card in a x4 slot compared to using a x16 slot due to whether the slot is directly connected to the CPU or through the chipset. TechPowerUp biannually tests the effect of PCIe scaling on contemporary high-end graphics cards and some examples of the loss at 1920×1080 resolution include for a GTX 1080 going from an x16 to x4 PCIe via the CPU results in a 4% loss or for PCIe via the chipset the loss is 8% for an RTX 2080 Ti going from an x16 to an x4 the loss is 9% and for a RTX 3080 going from x16 to x4 (represented by x16 Gen 1.1) the loss is 13%. So unfortunately for mini PC users a graphics card connected via PCIe x4 is going to lose some performance compared with the performance it is capable of when connected via PCIe x16.

It would also appear that Thunderbolt 3 which is marketed as providing 40 Gbps of external I/O bandwidth would offer enough bandwidth for connecting a GPU. However this is the maximum bandwidth and is calculated by including display output. Intel states that the maximum one direction data speed for Thunderbolt 3 is 22 Gbps(PDF) and this is achieved through using four lanes of PCIe Gen 3 operating at 4 * 8 Gbps or 32 Gbps from which it reserves 10 Gbps to guarantee the Type-C USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 delivery. Therefore data transfer over Thunderbolt 3 is only capable of ((8 GT/s * 4) – 10 Gbps) – 2/130% or 2.708 GB/s. The resultant lower throughput (3.938 GB/s for PCIe x4 vs 2.708 GB/s for Thunderbolt 3) means there is going to be a further loss of graphics performance when connecting a GPU via Thunderbolt 3.

Furthermore not all manufacturers implement the full x4 PCIe speed on their Thunderbolt 3 ports but instead only use the minimum of x2. Additionally there is no guarantee that the device’s BIOS can recognize an eGPU connected via Thunderbolt 3 which is the case with the Minisforum X35G and so as with laptops it is a case of ‘caveat emptor’ with mini PCs.

Additionally Thunderbolt 3 operates through the chipset rather than directly connected to the CPU and there is a Thunderbolt 3 controller at both ends of the cable resulting in latency caused by the chipset the Thunderbolt 3 controllers and the length of the cable. There are two types of Thunderbolt 3 cable: passive and active. Cable lengths of up to around 0.5 to 0.8 meter support the maximum data transfer of 40 Gbps and are typically ‘passive’. Greater lengths of up to 2 meters only support a maximum data transfer of 20 Gbps unless they are ‘active’ cables meaning they contain additional circuitry in their connectors required to achieve the maximum of 40 Gbps.

It is also worth noting that USB ports can have different data rates and transfer speeds so for example a USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 port has a data rate of 10 Gbit/s and transfer speed of 1.21 GB/s.

Finally the GPU performance depends on many variables such as the GPU and CPU architecture and power the amount of graphics memory and memory bus width the clock frequencies and the application/game design being run. Simplistically the CPU has to process the data before it can be passed to the GPU which will then do the work of rendering frames. If the CPU cannot process the data quickly enough the GPU regardless of power is always going to be waiting for the CPU creating a situation known as a ‘CPU bottleneck’ or being ‘CPU bound’. Performance degradation for gaming may also proportionately get worse when using a more powerful graphics card as to achieve the higher FPS more bandwidth is required because more data needs to be transferred making it more likely to be affected by the bandwidth limitations identified.

For this article the testing undertaken concentrates on the performance loss between an eGPU connected via M.2 NVMe slot vs being connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port and does not include testing any loss when comparing an eGPU to a dGPU.

Hardware Overview

The mini PC used for the majority of the testing was an i3 Intel NUC 8 Bean Canyon or NUC8i3BEK:

Primarily this was chosen as it had a low-powered Intel Core i3-8109U processor with an iGPU a Thunderbolt 3 port an M.2 NVMe slot and some USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 ports. Also it is currently available at the incredibly low-price of AUD 299 (or around USD 210 plus tax). The device was configured with 16GB (2 x 8GB) of G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4 2400MHz memory and a Kingston A2000 1TB NVMe SSD.

As an example ‘eGPU’ I’ve used an ASUS XG Station Pro which is a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU dock with an included 1.5m active Thunderbolt 3 cable:

For the ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ I used an ADT-Link’s R43SG:

This is better value than just a basic ‘PCIe x16 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ as it includes a stand for the GPU together with all the required power connections. It also needs an additional power supply which can either be a standard PSU power supply or a DELL DA-2 8PIN 12V/18A/220W PSU (aka Dell D220P-01) which can be bought cheaply second-hand:

To connect the R43SG via Thunderbolt 3 I used a JEYI Thunderbolt 3 M.2 NVMe Enclosure (the ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapter’) as this supports double-sided SSDs unlike some competitor adapters:

I also used an ORICO M2PAC3-G20 M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure (as the ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’):

This supports up to USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 i.e. 20 Gbps and includes both a USB Type-C to Type-C cable and a USB Type-A to Type-C cable. Technically I could have used the 10 Gbps M2PV-C3 model or similar as not many mini PCs support USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 yet.

Finally during testing I also used a couple of ‘M.2 NVMe to PCIe x4 adapters’: an EZDIY-FAB NVMe PCIe adapter with heatsink:

and a RIITOP PCIe 3.0 x4/x8/x16 to M.2 PCIe NVMe adapter with heatsink

Software Overview

For testing the performance of the NVMe SSD I used CrystalDiskMark:

To benchmark the GPU performance I used both 3DMark’s Fire Strike:

and Unigine’s Heaven:

For reviewing gaming performance I used Shadow of the Tomb Raider (SOTTR) as while it is a fairly demanding CPU intensive game it includes a repeatable benchmark with graphics presets:

To confirm the Thunderbolt 3 cables were running at full speed (i.e. 40 Gbps) I used CUDA-Z:

I also used MSI Afterburner/Rivatuner to capture data for CPU GPU usage and frame rates which were then processed in a spreadsheet.

Testing Undertaken

First of all the NUC8i3BEK mini PC was tested without an eGPU to get a set of baseline results:

Then a GTX 1650 Super was installed in the XG Station Pro and connected by a Thunderbolt 3 cable to the NUC8i3BEK mini PC with the tests being repeated to get a baseline with the 1650 Super:

2091.74 7742 10148 98.9 65 58 47

The first investigation was to see whether a ‘DIY eGPU’ consisting of the R43SG adapter combined with the JEYI adapter could replicate the commercial eGPU without any performance loss:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 1650 Super in R43SG via TB (JEYI) with NVMe via M.2 1846.82





2085.34 7693 10092 98.1 65 58 47

The results are very similar and are within the margin of testing variance indicating this is a feasible eGPU alternative.

Next prior to investigating what the amount of loss is when using Thunderbolt 3 to connect the eGPU some further verification tests were performed. First the NVMe SSD was moved to the R43SG by installing it in the EZDIY-FAB adapter and the R43SG installed in the M.2 NVMe slot. This shows that the R43SG doesn’t create any performance loss when compared with the initial baseline:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High iGPU with R43SG+EZDIY-FAB+NVMe via M.2 1826.78 2091.47 1764 1934 19.7 10 8 8

However once the R43SG with the EZDIY-FAB and NVMe SSD is installed in the JEYI and connected via Thunderbolt 3 then the results show that whilst the iGPU graphics performance remains the same the immediate impact can be seen on the SSD performance with a 29% drop in ‘Sequential Read’ and a 41% drop in ‘Sequential Write’:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High iGPU with R43SG+EZDIY-FAB+NVMe via TB (JEYI) 1289.05

1230.79 1769 1942 19.7 10 8 8

which can then be confirmed by simply installing the NVMe SSD in the JEYI:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High iGPU with NVMe via TB (JEYI) 1293.92 1229.93 1763 1932 19.4 10 8 8

A drop in read/write speeds was predicted from the technical explanation above however the magnitude seen does not actually represent the loss from using Thunderbolt 3 alone as will be discussed later below.

Finally keeping the NVMe SSD in the JEYI and installing the R43SG in the M.2 NVMe slot with the GTX 1650 Super shows around a 10% graphical improvement (based on the Firestrike Graphics and Heaven results) when directly connecting the GPU in the R32SG via PCIe or alternatively around a 9% graphical loss when connected via Thunderbolt 3:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 1650 Super in R43SG via M.2 with NVMe via TB (JEYI) 1297.92 1230.51 8287 11306 107.4 73 65 57

This graphical performance gain/loss can also be confirmed by removing Thunderbolt 3 completely through installing the NVMe SSD in the ORICO connected via USB which is also a typical configuration that can be used for a mini PC without a Thunderbolt 3 port:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 1650 Super in R43SG via M.2 with NVMe via USB (ORICO) 1042.74 902.10 8263 11326 108.4 73 65 58

Obviously the read/write performance is degraded further because of the bandwidth limitations from using the USB interface.

Looking at the GPU performance when running the SOTTR benchmarks in more detail shows both a CPU and GPU bottleneck:

So by upgrading the GPU to an RTX 2060 and therefore potentially increasing the amount of data being transferred to the GPU what is the impact when using Thunderbolt 3?

First a new baseline can be derived for the R43SG and RTX 2060 installed in the M.2 NVMe slot and with the NVMe SSD installed in the JEYI connected via Thunderbolt 3:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 2060 in R43SG via M.2 with NVMe via TB (JEYI) 1301.64 1231.80 10677 18407 197 74 71 70

Now comparing with the RTX 2060 installed in the XG Station Pro and connected via Thunderbolt 3:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 2060 in eGPU via TB with NVMe via M.2 1806.22 2096.69 9921 15856 174.0 66 63 62

or with the R43SG and RTX 2060 installed in the JEYI adapter and connected via Thunderbolt 3:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High 2060 in R43SG via TB (JEYI) with NVMe via M.2 1861.91 2089.03 9890 15708 173.8 66 64 63

shows the predicted slight increase in graphical loss due to the additional data of around 12% when connecting the eGPU or R32SG via Thunderbolt 3 or alternatively around a 14% graphical improvement when directly connecting the GPU in the R32SG via PCIe.

Now the CPU bottleneck can be seen clearly during the SOTTR benchmark:

so when the R43SG and RTX 2060 is installed in the M.2 NVMe slot of a far more powerful NUC7i7DNHE mini PC whose NVMe SSD is relocated to the ORICO because of a lack of Thunderbolt 3 port:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write Firestrike Score Firestrike Graphics Heaven SOTTR Low SOTTR Medium SOTTR High Faster NUC and 2060 in R43SG via M.2 with NVMe via USB (ORICO) 462.47 449.89 14284 18566 204.7 97 91 90

it shows that the GPU has become the bottleneck again:

As mentioned earlier the read/write speed degradation seen when using the JEYI adapter is not just due to Thunderbolt 3. There are various reports of variation in performance of ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapters’ due to the type of controller used by the NVMe SSD resulting in some brands of SSDs performing better than others.

To examine this I tested a new addlink 2TB NVMe SSD which has an advertised ‘Sequential Read’ of 3500 MB/s and ‘Sequential Write’ of 3000 MB/s. First some baseline tests:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write addlink via M.2 with NVMe via TB (JEYI)

3280.13 2993.68 R43SG+EZDIY-FAB+addlink via M.2 with NVMe via TB (JEYI) 3266.57 3004.37 addlink via M.2 with NVMe via USB (ORICO)

3271.44 3000.39

shows an average ‘Sequential Read’ of 3276 MB/s and ‘Sequential Write’ of 2997 MB/s.

Testing again but connected with various combinations using Thunderbolt 3:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write RIITOP+addlink in eGPU via TB with NVMe via M.2

2661.17 1914.25 R43SG+EZDIY-FAB+addlink via TB (JEYI) with NVMe via M.2 2663.30 1932.78 addlink via TB (JEYI) with NVMe via M.2 2663.17 1965.04 addlink via TB (JEYI) with NVMe via USB (ORICO)

2663.88 1981.75

shows a performance drop of only 19% with an average ‘Sequential Read’ of 2663 MB/s and a 35% drop for ‘Sequential Write’ to 1948 MB/s indicating that reading saturated the Thunderbolt 3 link to its theoretical maximum.

In comparison the performance drop for the Kingston 1TB NVMe SSD mentioned earlier was measured after the SSD had been used for multiple benchmarking tests and wear-leveling had reduced the speeds from the advertised ‘Sequential Read’ of 2200 MB/s and ‘Sequential Write’ of 2000 MB/s. A better comparison is to look at the results for when the tests were conducted when the SSD was new:

Configuration CDM Seq Read CDM Seq Write NVMe via M.2 2205.01 2166.21 NVMe via TB (JEYI) 1299.97 1250.21

and this shows a much larger 41% drop in ‘Sequential Read’ and a 42% drop in ‘Sequential Write’ and indicates that the addlink SSD has proportionally less of a performance drop with the JEYI adapter than the Kingston SSD.

Throughout the testing to exclude any variance attributable to the Thunderbolt 3 cable I used the JEYI cable which is a ‘passive’ cable. However separately I also ran some comparison tests using an ‘active’ Thunderbolt 3 cable but found there were no significant differences.

Additional Analysis

A summary of the results is provided in the following table:

Specifically looking just at the graphical performance (based on the Firestrike Graphics and Heaven results) clearly shows the impact of connecting via Thunderbolt 3:

When looking at just the SOTTR benchmarks the impact of the CPU can be seen on the graphics performance. With a ‘low’ graphics preset upgrading the GPU has no effect on the average FPS because as previously shown this low-powered CPU is the bottleneck. Of interest is that when the 1650 Super is connected via PCIe it is almost better than the 2060 connected via Thunderbolt 3:

The SSD read/write speeds are greatly impacted by how the SSD is connected although as noted above this does not necessarily affect the graphics performance however it will affect the gaming experience as load times will vary depending on the interface:

Conclusion

One advantage of any eGPU solution given the rarity of graphics cards at the present time is it allows the sharing of a GPU between systems (and/or users).

Most likely the ports on the mini PC will dictate exactly how an eGPU can be configured however cosmetically using an eGPU connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port is tidier than when connected via PCIe but comes at a cost of around 10% loss of graphical performance. Additionally the enclosure of an eGPU may be seen as desirable as the GPU’s fan blades are not exposed. However commercial eGPUs are expensive and can be rather large whereas ‘DIY eGPUs’ offer the same performance at a much lower cost.

If using an adapter like the R43SG in the M.2 NVMe slot for best graphical performance then consider the impact that a ‘Thunderbolt 3 to M.2 NVMe adapter’ has on SSD speeds vs the cheaper option of using a ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’.

With a low-powered CPU typical of a mini PC it is important not to over-spec the GPU to be used as its full potential will likely not totally be utilized due to being ‘CPU bound’.

Finally be aware when booting directly from an eGPU you may encounter a blank screen as initially the iGPU may only be active with the eGPU not becoming active until after the desktop starts when it is used by the primary display. You may need to press the spacebar and then enter your Windows password invisibly to get the desktop to start or simply ‘hot-swap’ the HDMI cable from the mini PC to the eGPU once booted if preferred. Disabling the iGPU is not a preferred solution as it could lead to being without a display if the eGPU fails or is removed completely.

A member of a Chiphell community has managed to get access to two unreleased 6-core Intel Rocket Lake-S CPUs.

Intel Rocket Lake-S has already been extensively tested by respected and known tech publications even before the company formally announced the new series. We have seen multiple reviews of Core i9-11900 series engineering samples weeks in advance and more recently we get to see retail Core i7-11700K CPUs showing their muscles in reviews from AnandTech and HardwareLuxx.

All these CPUs were 8-core and 16-thread SKUs which will probably become the most popular choice among Intel enthusiasts but for people on a budget the Core i5 series may still be a better deal. On Chiphell a short review of two 6-core and 12-thread Core i5 CPUs can be found. The member of this community gained access to Core i5-11600KF (unlocked CPU without integrated graphics) and Core i5-11400F (also lacking onboard graphics).

The 11600KF has a TDP of 125W and can boost up to 4.9 GHz and it has a base clock of 3.9 GHz that’s according to the CPU-Z. The 11400F on the other hand is a 65W model with a base clock of 2.6 GHz and a max turbo clock going up to 4.4 GHz. Both are based on Cypress Cove architecture and will offer PCI Gen4 support. Unfortunately both being part of the F-series will lack integrated Xe Gen12 graphics.

The CPUs were tested on Gigabyte Z490 AORUS Ultra motherboard which featured the latest available BIOS for the 11th Gen Core series. This does not mean that Gigabyte will not release even more optimized BIOS before launch and we have already seen that there still a lot to gain from the newer microcode. The system was paired with 16GB of ZADAK Spark DDR4-3600.

Both CPUs were cooled down by a triple-fan AIO kit called ‘GI-CX360 ARGB’ by PCCooler. The cooling is rated at a maximum of 350W. More than enough for these Core i5 CPUs even in their PL2 power states. Under load in the AIDA64 test the 11600KF has an average of 209W power consumption and a temperature of 85C. The 11400F on the other hand reported an average of 145W and 70C.

The reviewer notes that there may still be changes to performance once a newer BIOS will be released. He tested overclocking on i5-11600KF but the results were underwhelming. He notes that the limit is 4.8 GHz and 4.9 GHz with 1.4V applied but it was unstable. The temperature has increased noticeably as well so eventually he gave up. The 11400F being a non-K part obviously cannot be overclocked but there are tricks with PL2 and Tau modifications which the reviewer did not test. Gaming tests were not performed because the user expects better optimization with newer BIOS.

At the time we were testing on Intel’s microcode 0x2C the latest version available to the motherboard vendor. Intel has since released microcode 0x34 and we have retested our results on this new update.

The March on Microcode

What is microcode? Most consider it to be the underlying firmware for an Intel system. Microcode ultimately controls processor operation as well as the translation between the user-exposed instruction set and the underlying processor design. Within this microcode the processor can control and react to what code is flowing into the processor where to send it how to adjust voltage/frequency as well as a number of optimizations or fixes that are needed.

For example some of the initial variants of Spectre and Meltdown were ‘fixed’ by adjusting the microcode to no longer make the processor vulnerable. This required those systems to be updated to the new microcode and there was a performance penalty. Future processors were built with these fixes in hardware and so incur less of a performance drop. Microcode allows for after-production adjustments in the name of security or performance.

Leading up to a launch of a new processor family microcode is King. Intel takes its microcode and couples with it updated power management control initialization code management engine firmware device drivers/keys and UEFI drivers. This package creates an update candidate which is sent to the motherboard manufacturers. On top of this motherboard vendors sprinkle their own garnish but can also modify elements such as turbo or memory training which we’ve seen extensively done in the past. As we’ve discussed previously a number of suggested settings that Intel makes can (and often are) ignored by the motherboard vendors. But the microcode is fairly rigid in what it does.

The key point to note here is that motherboard vendors do not always update their BIOS offerings each time a new microcode package is made available to them. So for example a motherboard BIOS vendor might only deploy one new update a month even if Intel is supplying new updates for a week.

Moving Closer To Launch

So you might imagine as a new processor family and motherboard stack gets closer to launch there is an impetus to enable the latest microcode in a new BIOS every time one is made available. Motherboards are manufactured up to 3 months in advance with very early microcode and they have to be updated continuously both for Intel’s latest updates but also the motherboard vendor’s optimizations.

Even boards for retail can have super early editions of microcode. Z590 boards are already on the market with the latest versions at the time of manufacture. So far in our Rocket Lake testing we have been sent three different motherboards with the following microcode versions:

Board 1: BIOS from January 8 th  microcode 0x1B (version 27)

 microcode 0x1B (version 27) Board 2: BIOS from February 6 th  microcode 0x24 (version 36)

 microcode 0x24 (version 36) Board 3: BIOS from February 7th microcode 0x23 (version 35)

These numbers are all in hexadecimal but there are nine different versions between the first motherboard and the other two. Since then to March 6th there have been at least 16 more versions (0x34 version 52) and likely another few to come.

Not all motherboard manufacturers will release BIOSes for all of their motherboards with every microcode release just due to time and personnel plus they don’t envisage the systems being updated every 36 hours. After each new revision they would have to wrap the microcode package into a BIOS and perform regression tests make sure all of the features work as expected and if any new adjustments have been added test those too. That being said Intel might not fully release every microcode revision to the motherboard vendors but we can confirm that vendors do pick and choose what to use.

Our Testing and This Update Today

When we reviewed our Core i7-11700K prior to launch we stated that at the time we had used the latest BIOS available from the motherboard vendor. In our communications with that vendor were told that there was no indication if/when the next BIOS would drop. At the time we were using microcode 0x2C (version 44) part of a February 18th BIOS package. To date this still remains the latest BIOS for that motherboard and we’ve been told another update is to come in a week or so.

Since our review we have obtained a second motherboard. This motherboard was sent to us with microcode 0x1B from January 8th – super old in a rapid launch cycle. We did some testing on 0x1B to get a baseline of where the performance was at this time. After that testing we updated to the latest BIOS. This BIOS was compiled on March 6th version (one day after our review) with the 0x34 microcode.

In our testing today we will be focusing on the performance delta between the first motherboard on microcode 0x2C (still the latest BIOS for that board) and the second motherboard on microcode 0x34 but also refer back to some of those raw 0x1B numbers. There is some slight variation between the two boards when it comes to AVX-512 response which we will also cover.

This article will have a few choice results however our original review with the Core i7-11700K will be updated to showcase both sets of 0x2C and 0x34 numbers.

A Side Note about Motherboard Defaults

One of the comments about our original review was the state of our main memory frequency ratios compared to the memory controller frequency. Historically these ratios have been fixed in a 1:1 arrangement and are not user configurable.

Some commentary has appeared to suggest that the default setting for these ratios change between Core i9 and Core i7 – specifically that the Core i7 should default to 2:1 mode when run in DDR4-3200 effectively halving the memory controller which has historically been a limiting factor in DRAM overclocking. We cannot confirm if those are the official specifications at this point. However we can confirm that the motherboards we are testing do offer the user the choice of selecting a 1:1 ratio or a 2:1 ratio.

It should be noted that on all of the motherboards we have tested all BIOS versions the actual default operation for a Core i7 running at DDR4-3200 does appear to be the 1:1 mode. For the avoidance of doubt in our testing on every microcode to date all of our motherboards were running at a 1:1 ratio.

Performance in Microcode 0x34

So this is the bit that Intel never tells anyone externally. There may be updates for internal frequency adjustments how aggressive to enable voltage/frequency changes or even changes to default settings. Motherboard vendors very rarely publish changelogs from BIOS to BIOS – at best we get ‘better CPU support’ or ‘updated memory QVL’. So from that standpoint we have a blank page.

On the performance side the article title says it all: small performance gains.

In our CPU performance tests we are seeing an average +1.8% performance gain across all workloads. This varies between a -4.3% loss in some workloads (Handbrake) up to a +9.7% gain (Compilation). SPEC2017 single thread saw a bigger than average +3.4% gain however SPEC2017 multi thread saw a -2.1% adjustment making it slower.

In our GPU performance tests using our RTX 2080 Ti we are seeing an average +3% performance gain across all configurations. In one case at low resolution settings it was as high as +12% however +2-3% was typical at 1080p maximum quality.

Our Core i7-11700K review has all the updated benchmark numbers and microcode versions 0x2C vs 0x34 are clearly marked.

The reasons for this seem to come down to two main areas of updates that we can determine.

Indirect Cache and Memory Updates

In our original review we posted that the memory of Rocket Lake with our setup was underperforming with a regression compared to the previous generation Comet Lake. This was a ‘to be expected’ effect of backporting the design and losing some inefficiencies in that migration however the original review results showed that the memory latency increase was bigger than expected. Through the new microcode Intel has fixed this to a degree – we’re still seeing a cache structure performance regression however it is not as severe.

The L1 cache structure remains at 5 cycle vs 4 cycle as expected and the L3 is also as expected with 13 cycles similar to the Ice Lake design. In our 0x2C test the L3 latency was 50.9 cycles but with the new microcode is now at 45.1 cycles and is now more in line with the L3 cache on Comet Lake. Despite this change however we saw no adjustment in core-to-core latency.

Out at DRAM our 128 MB point reduced from 82.4 nanoseconds to 72.8 nanoseconds which is a 12% reduction and more in line with the Comet Lake memory latency response.

It is worth noting that our 12% reduction in DRAM latency is not the +40% reduction that other media outlets are reporting. Whereas others use commercial tools we feel our internal tools are more accurate. Similarly for overall DRAM bandwidth we are seeing a +12% memory bandwidth increase between 0x2C and 0x34 and not the +50% bandwidth others are claiming. (We do see a +50% bandwidth increase from 0x1B to 0x34 but between 0x2C and 0x34 it is only 12%.)

AVX-512 Performance and Power Regression: Microcode or Motherboard?

One of the big talking points about our initial review was the power draw and temperature of our AVX-512 testing. In our test with the 0x2C BIOS in our first motherboard we saw a 292 W peak power draw along with a 104ºC peak temperature. In our metrics gathering this setup ran the processor at 4.6 GHz during AVX-512 workloads.

On our second motherboard with the 0x34 BIOS the frequency of the processor under AVX-512 started at 4.6 GHz but within two seconds dropped to 200 MHz lower running at 4.4 GHz. This meant that the chip experienced 276 W peak power which very quickly dropped to 225W. At the peak this processor has saved 18 W but in the rest of the test 60 W was saved for 200 MHz. When you are pushing the silicon to those limits it really is at the inefficient end of the spectrum.

Despite this reduction in frequency and power the processor still recorded 103ºC at peak although levelled to 90ºC after hitting that limit.

The reduction in frequency and power does come at the cost of 3% performance between the 292 W and 276 W peak power modes.

The question here is though whether this change is related to microcode or motherboard. We know that different motherboard vendors apply different strategies when it comes to turbo how the system responds to high power or temperature and it very well may come to pass that they also have different attitudes when it comes to applying AVX-512 turbo frequencies. This second board here may have decided to go down the lower AVX-512 frequency route in order to increase the longevity of the components for example. Exactly how much went to microcode vs motherboard is difficult to determine and your mileage may vary.

Conclusions to Draw

Given the historically volatile nature of early processor microcode releases some of our readers were quick to question whether future BIOS updates would heavily change Rocket Lake's performance. The answer in a nutshell is no not significantly (thus far).

As with all reviews they are just segments in time. A conclusion today may be different in several weeks depending on updates for increased performance through optimization decreased performance due to security or longevity adjustments or simple increase in validated peripheral support. There are motherboards out on the market today with earlier BIOSes than the one we tested and not everyone updates the BIOS. There are advantages to updating and motherboard vendors do try and make it as easy as possible – one vendor has implemented an updater in both its AMD and Intel motherboards that starts automatically with a fresh Win10 install.

With the latest BIOS comparing the 0x2C microcode to the 0x34 microcode while the needle has been moved in the positive direction overall it hasn’t changed much and the conclusions don't change either. The CPU performance is overall an uptick especially for compilation and web workloads and gaming performance pushes the i7-11700K nearer towards the 8-core Ryzen 7 5800X now going beyond the Comet Lake version where before there was a trade-off. This means that the i7-11700K now achieves the result as being the best Intel processor in that span but until we get pricing there will be question marks as to its recommendation to the rest of the market.

Location: Conduit Gallery Dallas — Meehan’s solo exhibition After Laughter through April 3.

To be human is to be flawed. Yet in our supposed imperfections we are complete beings faultlessly diverse in our genetics and personal histories. Recognizing our shared humanity despite or because of our differences should not be dismissed as new-age blather; it is more than a facile self-help tenet to acknowledge and value our idiosyncrasies of shape and character. Margaret Meehan’s Mercy Mercy Me (For Greta) is a wonderfully effective sculpture that embodies this wisdom. It stands as a totem honoring our quirks of being while accepting the paradoxical similarity and discrepancies of our lives.

Made of terracotta cashmere cut paper eyes fabric and thread the creature Meehan envisions is part young person part owl and part different-limbed human. Washed in a pale glaze and clothed primarily in pink Meehan highlights an almost clichéd idea of girlhood. Firmly standing on three legs the owl-like face gazes upward as if pondering something of import. There is a shyness to the pose paired with an unabashed sense of self-confidence. Who has not felt fragile in one’s differences and yet at other times fully present in one’s unique power? Meehan masterfully captures the nuance of these conflicting dialogues with an expressively crafted stance that feels painfully human.

There is also a sympathetic humor in the birdish character that brings to mind the ceramic funk history of Northern California. One thinks of Viola Frey or Robert Arneson. But there is something singular and fleshed out about Meehan’s creation that reads more as an embodied person. One can intuit the humanity within the wrinkly feathered face. Further personalizing her character Meehan stitches a heart onto the sweater with a picture of climate activist Greta Thunberg within. The icon of teenage feminism is not only famous for her dogged work addressing the climate crisis but she is also well-known for being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome obsessive–compulsive disorder and selective mutism. Meehan seems to be drawing a connection between Thunberg’s fearless difference and her concerned questioning of the mechanisms of power that feed environmental degradation.

Further Meehan seems to wonder about an American crisis of character. How do we treat each other? What values do we hold dear? Like Thunberg who has called her Asperger’s a kind of superpower Meehan is holding fast to the internal muscle we all share — the all-too regular but often forgotten social glue that is behaving with compassion and humanity to all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That was the challenge presented by the worldwide manufacturing services company Jabil when it approached creative agency Leviathan to develop a projection-mapped installation in its Blue Sky Innovation Center in San Jose CA.

[The Technology Manager's Guide to Projectors and Screens]

Having a prior relationship certainly helped as a base for understanding. Leviathan had worked with Jabil on another projection mapping project in 2015 one that was focused on a single aspect of Jabil’s offerings. The goal of the new project was much wider in scope: To help a wide range of customers envision the ways Jabil’s expertise throughout its entire digital manufacturing process might specifically address their needs.

“The 2015 exhibit had been one of the most successful to date and since our working relationship with the organization had continued to grow since then we were pleased that they returned to us for the next iteration of immersive storytelling” said Chad Hutson CEO of Leviathan. “This time though the narrative went far beyond just healthcare and instead needed to tackle the lifecycle of contract manufacturing for which Jabil is an industry leader.”

Watch the video below to learn more about the projection mapping project.

Leviathan creative director Pedro Andres Sanchez and his team first examined what Jabil offers as part of the manufacturing lifecycle which includes everything from researching the idea of a product through to its creation and delivery. In addition to healthcare the company serves industries including consumer appliances food and beverage packaging and electromechanical aerospace systems.

“Given the different visitors who might come to hear about Jabil it made sense to develop something abstract and flexible” Sanchez said. “We wanted to create an exhibit that would capture the attention of visitors and serve as a visual aid that would help a docent speak about their services in a way that’s tailored specifically for that client using the interactive content as a visual support system.”

The abstract concept took shape in Maxon Cinema 4D and Adobe After Effects. Leviathan then worked with Columbian Model & Exhibit Works on the fabrication of a foam-milled and 3D-printed sculptural element. Whitlock (now AVI-SPL who is number one on the 2020 SCN Top 50 list) provided AV integration on the project installing four Christie DHD630-GS projectors driven by a Dell PC that includes an Nvidia Quadro P5000 graphics card. The projection table is powered by a custom software solution built using TouchDesigner.

“Christie 1DLP laser projectors are designed for performance and reliability in high-usage environments” said Bryan Boehme executive director of Americas enterprise sales and global business development Christie. “We’re thrilled that AVI-SPL selected Christie GS Series projectors to help visualize Jabil’s expertise in this exciting projection mapping installation.”

“This software includes a custom video playback system remote controls to allow a docent full control of the experience from anywhere in the room and a system for calibrating the four projectors as quickly and easily as possible” Sanchez added. “Using TouchDesigner as the foundation was critical in allowing us to craft a solution specific to the needs of Jabil.”

The piece is one of the last things a visitor may see on a tour so it serves as a summation of all they’ve seen throughout Jabil’s space. A docent can walk them through the presentation and the interactive design allows the docent to customize the story focusing on aspects that are more important to the client to or help answer their questions while skipping elements that are less important or don’t apply to them.

“The interactive run-of-show gives the docent the ability to expand or decrease the duration of each story beat or skip a section entirely using a controller allowing them to customize each presentation to the client’s needs” Sanchez explained. “The design also gives the docents the ability to construct various narratives to match a specific client while illustrating the concepts and ideas behind Jabil’s digital manufacturing.”

The conceptual abstraction develops as the story progresses going from a nebulous sketched idea to something that resembles an amorphous physical product with a 3D structure at the center that represents the product. The projection incorporates the visual language of various products with hints of different materials and colors suggesting but never specifying a distinct object.

“The abstract design approach invites the visitors to imagine their unique product or service at the center of the story” Sanchez said.

Having a docent interact with the installation became part of the plan in the initial stages. Some of that came from the client’s side as Jabil noted that it was likely visitors would be accompanied in the space where the installation would be. Plus they learned a bit about the company’s needs following the earlier projection mapping installation that focused on healthcare.

“That one was designed to be a bit more interactive and we expected people to interact with it” Sanchez said. “It made more sense in this situation for the docents to be the ones who would guide people and decide how much time to spend on different elements.”

With docents present to narrate and explain the project did not require audio elements. Having a guide also means customers have little direct interaction with the technology which reduces the number of possible points of friction for the visitor and minimizes maintenance tasks. Projection calibration and table clearing and resurfacing are the only anticipated upkeep needs for this particular project.

One of the biggest differences between this project and some of Leviathan’s earlier work CEO Hutson explained are the technology developments that have played a big role in improving workflows.

“When Leviathan first came onto the scene in 2010 projection mapping was one of our primary tools of the content creation trade though alignment was still very much a manual process” he said. “Both hardware and software have come a long way to automatic such tasks so even though good storytelling is always core to our clients’ work we also look forward to utilizing these updated technologies for projection well into the future.”

Storytelling definitely remains the most important part. For the recent Jabil project it turns out the abstract storytelling elements proved useful even before the installation was completed Sanchez explained. “As Jabil’s marketing strategy shifted before we finished the project the design allowed us to pivot without rethinking the concept or physical structure validating the versatility to support significant content updates in the future” he concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Read all of them here.

CARL JACOBS | Occupation: Victim advocate / Victims for Justice | Age: 35 | www.carl4anchorage.com

Carl Jacobs

1. Why are you running?

I’m running because I have a passion for public service. I’ve spent my career working to protect the public as a licensing specialist for assisted living homes and child care facilities. My work helped ensure vulnerable Alaskans were safe and treated with dignity and respect. I went on to serve as an investigator tasked with maintaining professional standards for individuals in licensed occupations across Alaska. I will bring my experience knowledge and fresh perspective to help facilitate positive change for all Anchorage School District students.

2. Why are you qualified to serve as an Anchorage School Board member?

My wife Alicia and I have served as licensed therapeutic foster parents to approximately 40 children over the last decade. We will be celebrating our 11th high school graduate this May and couldn’t be more excited to help young Alaskans successfully transition to independent life. I’m intimately familiar with not just the traditional classroom experiences but how well our systems are functioning when it comes to serving students who need extra support -- either through IEP’s 504 plans or gifted educational programming. I’ve seen what’s working what’s not and what the impact is and I have a lot of ideas about ways to make those systems work better by partnering with our community.

3. What’s your vision for education in Anchorage?

ADVERTISEMENT

I have the same vision most Anchorage residents -- that every student from every background is able to receive a high-quality public education that prepares them to live full adult lives after graduation.

4. How would you rate the school district’s performance during the pandemic — protecting public health delivering quality education services serving the community? What specifically would you have done differently?

Our board demonstrated a lack of leadership during the pandemic which negatively impacted our district and its operations. ASD failed to implement a plan to respond to the pandemic in a timely manner this year. When they established a plan they didn’t stick to it. Worse they failed to keep students parents and teachers and staff involved in the process and waited until the last possible moment to decide and communicate deviations from the plan to the public. Now there is a push for reopening which I absolutely believe is a priority and some families are being left behind who prefer a distance learning environment. I would have stayed in constant conversations. I would have brought stakeholder groups to improve operations. I would have made a commitment to follow the science so we could return kids to school sooner and keep them there longer. Finally I would have focused on long-range planning so families could know what to expect and make arrangements accordingly.

5. What do you believe is the single most important issue facing the Anchorage School District? How would you address it if elected?

Equalizing outcomes for every student who enters our schools. I think we can achieve those outcomes by centering students parents and teachers and listening to them about what they need. I believe in setting high expectations for every student and ensuring they have the resources to meet those expectations.

6. If I could change one thing in the Anchorage School District it would be _____. Explain.

Accessibility of elected office. We must limit barriers to participation to ensure our board is diverse in terms of background and thought. The dynamics of running a municipality-wide race inherently limit the pool of potential candidates and elected members. Once my time on the Anchorage School Board ends it would be a personal honor to know those who serve after me found the process of running easier to navigate and more equitable.

7. Do you have areas of concern about student achievement in the Anchorage School District? What are your specific suggestions for improvement?

Yes. Our district is transparent about shortcomings in this area and the inability to completely or even partially address many areas of concern. Approximately one in four Alaska Native/American Indian youth eligible to graduate high school failed to do so last year. Children of color those with disabilities and students classified as economically disadvantaged are typically more likely to fail a class or face disciplinary action within ASD. Addressing these concerns must involve a community-wide discussion and increased engagement between our district and the community which does not occur at present. Addressing systemic issues such as equity in access to pre-K charter schools special and gifted programs must be priorities for the board moving forward.

8. What are your thoughts on the current and proposed Anchorage School District budgets?

In any organization with a budget north of $800 million finding efficiencies and properly allocating resources is essential. Credibility and public trust are generated when our district acts as a good steward of public funds. The recent budget development process was especially noteworthy as the proposed budget shortfall of over $20 million was only filled with one-time federal funding. If ASD remains flat-funded in future years our community will face extremely challenging decisions on what we value most in our system of education. As an elected member of the Anchorage School Board I will both advocate for adequate funding necessary to ensure the success of all children and also hold our district accountable with the resources it is entrusted to spend.

9. Are there specific curriculum changes you would advocate? Describe them and the reason you want to see a change.

We constantly need to be working toward a curriculum that prepares students to function as adults. While I appreciate the goal of Alaska studies classes I think we need to be teaching comprehensive experiences and perspectives when in history and that’s best accomplished by working lessons about Native Alaskans Black history the history of the Filipino community and Pacific Islander communities throughout our lesson plans. Whether it’s in music classes English classes or science classes these contributions to our society need to be recognized at every step.

10. The school district used distance learning extensively over the past year. Once in-person classes fully return would you like to see continuing or additional distance-learning options offered?

I think it is most typical for students to get the best outcomes if they’re in a classroom with a professional whose job it is to make sure they’re mastering concepts and being challenged in the context of their own abilities. That said there are lots of reasons that traditional model may not fully meet the needs of our students and families and I support having all options on the table so that students get the education they deserve.

11. Does Anchorage need better preschool options for children? If not what are your suggestions for improvement?

Absolutely. Pre-K is the best place to invest to equalize outcomes. Impacting young children as their brains are developing the pathways that will serve them throughout their entire lives is critical to long-term success and it helps families to be more successful as well. Preschool programs should exist in every public school and should be evidence-based in implementation and evaluation. We don’t need 3-year-olds sitting in neat rows of desks learning print and times tables. We do need intentional environments set up to encourage learning through a play-based model that captures their interest early and keeps a fire for learning as they transition to school

12. What steps should ASD take to improve its career and technical education curriculum?

We must build on the vocational programming already in place including the recently-expanded King Tech High. While each of our high schools has a program focus area having more options like King Tech is in some ways the future of education where we center career skills and teach in the context of real-world applications. Encouraging growth in the areas of financial literacy career training and civic engagement via expanded access to consumer and family science courses would be an important first step.

13. Achievement gaps persist in the Anchorage School District among economic racial and ethnic groups of students. What would you do to address the gaps and what should the district do to close them?

As a parent to an incredibly diverse group of youth for the last ten years I have seen the problem firsthand. Achievement gaps are rightfully receiving attention due in part to the ongoing pandemic but these institutional challenges have gone unsolved for years. I’ve spent considerable time reaching out to parents asking questions as to how to improve outcomes for all students. Reoccurring themes include improved and more transparent communication equity in distribution of resources and increased accountability and engagement by our school board. Discussing these problems is appropriate and necessary but must be accompanied by meaningful action and follow-through.

14. Are you happy with current class sizes in the district? Would you suggest specific changes?

Generally no. Class sizes are a constant battle. As we lose teachers and struggle to recruit or retain their replacements class sizes increase and students suffer. A common consensus exists -- lower student-to-teacher ratios improve outcomes across the board. We must wisely utilize retain and advocate for resources to ensure students are given the best possible chance to succeed.

15. Are you happy with current school start times and the length of school days? Explain.

I see the benefits of altering school start times to improve outcomes and allowing students to arrive each school day ready to learn. Logistical challenges in our district and community need to be solved to make that happen and I’m interested in learning more about creative solutions to support students and families in this area if possible.

16. Is the Anchorage School District currently doing a good job of retaining quality teachers? What steps if any should the school board take to improve teacher retention? *

No. We’re one of the only states where teachers can’t access full Social Security benefits or a pension. That means for people who would choose to spend their lives building up the next generation of innovators entrepreneurs electricians doctors caregivers etc. have nothing secure to fall back on when they’re no longer able to retire. Furthermore teachers are taking pay cuts in some years because their health plan costs are rising higher than their wages. Teaching is a noble and necessary pursuit but we can’t expect people to build our futures while asking them to give up the ability to secure their own.

17. Please discuss your commitment to transparency and open government as it relates to the school board and Anchorage School District. Would you push for changes?

While school board meetings are public most people don’t know how to find them or how they work. I’d like to see structural changes to make meetings easier to follow. I’ve made it a habit attending meetings and providing short recaps on social media. That’s not something I see the current school board doing so the work that’s getting done isn’t getting done in a way that serves the public. In addition a review of publicly available information demonstrates the current board president routinely fails to show up to community council meetings where those updates need to be shared. We must include the public because it’s their students their families and their futures that we’re shaping. No one knows better how to meet those needs than the students families and teachers.

18. What other important issue would you like to discuss?

A full majority of the Anchorage School Board will be on the ballots mailed out on March 15th. It is not hyperbolic to say the future of education in Anchorage will be decided by those who participate in this election. Please vote and encourage your friends family and coworkers to do the same. As a district we have a noble and ambitious set of goals and guardrails to achieve and monitor in the next three years and beyond. Please consider if you are truly happy with current operations and can trust the leadership responsible to make our goals a reality. If you believe the Anchorage School District is in need of positive change I ask for your vote on or before April 6 2021. Thank you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wYW50YWdyYXBoL25hbWUvbG9pcy1qYWNvYnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzI3MDIzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lois Jacobs Obituary (1934 - 2021) - Bloomington IL - The Pantagraph,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pantagraph/name/lois-jacobs-obituary?id=7270232 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wYW50YWdyYXBoL25hbWUvbG9pcy1qYWNvYnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzI3MDIzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2phY29iLWNvbGxpZXItdGVsbHMtd2hlcmUtaGVsbC0wMDI5MDAzOTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Collier Tells Where He'll Put His 5th GRAMMY Award,"Sports Yahoo Sports

The 26-year-old Londoner who still lives with his mother is nominated in three categories including album of the year - where his R&B album Djesse Vol 3 faces big competition from hitmakers Coldplay Dua Lipa and Taylor Swift.

A self-taught musician Jacob has been praised in the industry for his talent with tonight's competition Chris Martin from Coldplay comparing him to Mozart and singer-songwriter Prince.

Jacob Collier (pictured in his bedroom) who still lives with his mother is nominated for three awards at the Grammys tonight and could become a record-breaking British artist

Jacob has even been compared to Mozart and singer-songwriter Prince by Coldplay's Chris Martin (pictured together)

If he wins at the awards ceremony tonight he would be the first Brit to win a Grammy for four consecutive albums something even some of the biggest names including David Bowie (left) and The Beatles (right) were unable to do

Speaking about his nomination Jacob told The Sunday Times: 'Last year was surreal at best for everybody but for me to have that year concluded with these Grammy nominations was very strange and surprising.

'I don't really mind if I win the album of the year Grammy or not. I think that in some way that nomination is the biggest possible win.'

Tonight's Grammys will feature both virtual and in person presentations and performances.

Only a few artists have been invited to attend including Jacob and they are allowed to bring one guest.

He opted to invite Ben Bloomberg a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab who Collier worked with the develop musical software for live performances.

Despite reaching such impressive heights the former Royal Academy of Music student said while he finds compliments and comparisons to other artists flattering he is 'just trying to be Jacob'.

The former Royal Academy of Music student is nominated in three categories this year including Album of the Year for his album Djesse Vol. 3

While the 26-year-old musician has reached impressive heights in his career he said he is just trying to be himself

Jacob from Finchley north London was first noticed at the age of 17 when he uploaded a video to Youtube in 2013 of a multi-instrumental version of 'Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing' by Stevie Wonder.

JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29uLXRydW1wLTdiYmU3MWI3ZmMyYWVmMjZkZTMwMzZhMzU0YWYwZDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Johnson meet for second day,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3Bvc3NpYmxlLXByb2JsZW0tc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29ucy1sZWFkZXJzaGlw0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvcG9zc2libGUtcHJvYmxlbS1zcGVha2VyLWpvaG5zb25zLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A possible problem (for Speaker Johnson's leadership),"House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. remains House Speaker Mike Johnson. For now.

Despite lots of threats Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. has not yet pulled the trigger on her resolution to unseat Johnson.

Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. huddled with Johnson for a second consecutive day Tuesday. Just last week Greene proclaimed she would initiate her resolution to dump Johnson. But Greene is holding back. Again.



CARDONA GRILLED OVER BIDEN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUTS FOR CAMPUS ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS 'BREAKING THE LAW'

She first threatened to force the House to vote on her measure in mid-March.

""We had discussions in the speaker's office and right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" said Greene.

When pressed when she might make her move against the speaker Greene replied ""It’s up to Mike Johnson.""

There are droves of unhappy House Republicans right now. Greene says she wants to get members on the record showing who is for and against Johnson. Moreover Greene could underscore what is likely widespread support for Johnson. But a prospective vote total on Greene’s unorthodox gambit to pluck Johnson from the speaker’s suite would serve as an important metric. It would serve as a gauge of what could be a cataclysmic set of political events that might unfold late this year and early next. In fact they could paralyze the republic.



To wit: If Greene ever called up her resolution the House will first vote to block Greene from ever offering her motion to ""vacate the chair"" and mandate a new vote for speaker.

Like most things it’s about the math. So let’s explore that for a moment.

Granted there will likely be some GOPers who oppose tabling. In other words there’s an unknown universe of Republicans who would be on the record preferring that the House take a vote of no confidence on Johnson. But the House will likely short circuit that effort.

No things haven’t gone well at all for House Republicans since they won back the majority in the 2022 fall midterms. The House consumed five days and 15 rounds just to elect former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. in early January 2023. And it only took House GOPers nine months to remove McCarthy. That prompted a 22-day interregnum in the House. It paralyzed the institution from doing anything until it finally elected Johnson as McCarthy’s successor.



Rank-and-file Republicans are exhausted by the daily internecine drama surrounding Johnson and Greene. Moreover most House Republicans concede they’ve had it with Greene and don’t want to fuel her enterprises.

""We don't like it. We'd be angry about it because all it does is weaken all of us"" said Rep. Don Bacon R-Neb. ""Tactically and strategically it's not smart.""

Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. had signed on to Greene’s gambit to vacate the speakership of Johnson. But Gosar is suspect about the timing.

""I don’t think it’s going to happen this week"" said Gosar. ""I hope it doesn’t happen this week. So I’ll leave it at that.""

Yours truly asked Johnson about the longstanding threat by Greene.



REPUBLICANS BELIEVE COLLEGE CAMPUS CHAOS WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR

""It’s not good for the country the conference or the cause"" replied Johnson.

The fact that Democratic leaders announced they would try to help Johnson out via a parliamentary maneuver to remove him seemed to pour accelerant on the embers of the House Republican Conference.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said she supported the move by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y. to bring in the Democratic cavalry for Johnson.

""I think he’s very much in touch with our caucus"" replied Pelosi.

I then asked Pelosi what this means about Johnson if he must lean on the minority to cling to his job.

""He doesn’t have to turn to the minority for support"" replied Pelosi. ""The minority party is saying we support the integrity of the House of Representatives and will not let it be littered by nonsense.""

A cynic might point out that Democrats never came to the rescue of McCarthy. But Democrats contend that McCarthy went back on a major spending agreement and spoke derisively of the other party. Yes there are chasms between Democrats and Johnson. But Democrats at least believe they got what they need from Johnson — a bill to fund Ukraine and an honest broker when it comes to spending deals.

However in a Machiavellian twist did Democrats actually stoke more chaos in the Republican Conference by saying they would back Johnson? Hence the reason Greene is now meeting with Johnson on a regular basis? Even if that’s not the intent the outcome is hard to argue with. There’s turmoil among House Republicans now.

Rank-and-file Republicans are also noticing how much attention Greene and Massie receive. They are grumbling about the daily drama.

""You hold a big press conference last week to say you are going to do it this week. And then you go through the same process again"" groused Rep. David Joyce R-Ohio. ""Are we fundraising or are we trying to get something accomplished on the floor?""

Joyce also suggested Johnson might ""create a revolt if he caters to any one group who threatens him.""

As Shakespeare wrote what is past is prologue. And that’s why the bedlam of House Republicans now might reveal something rather jarring about the future when it comes to Johnson any other potential Republican Speaker and the presidency.

The House has now burned 28 of the 494 days since the 118th Congress commenced on Jan. 3 2023 fighting over a speaker. By rule the House can do nothing — absolutely nothing — until there is a speaker. It can’t vote. It can’t create committees. It can’t legislate. It can’t even swear in its members. The House spent five days before it finally elected McCarthy as speaker in January 2023. It was the longest speaker election since the late 1850s. The House then torched 22 days in October after it jettisoned McCarthy before finally electing Johnson.

Here's the problem:

Let’s say for the sake of argument Republicans maintain control of the House in this fall’s elections. If Democrats win the House the party will elect Jeffries as speaker. But if the GOP prevails the path for Johnson back to the speaker’s suite — or anyone else — is far from clear. If Greene ever does call a vote on Johnson we’ll have a barometer to understand the type of deficit Johnson might face in January.

As demonstrated in January 2023 the House is required to vote. And vote. And vote – until it elects a speaker. No other business. Period. And to reiterate it cannot even swear in the members.

Under the Constitution the new Congress tapping a speaker and swearing in members must start at noon Jan. 3 2023.

It took five days to elect McCarthy 22 days to elect Johnson.

The House had time to spare in January 2023. It was coming off a midterm election. It certainly had time last fall.

However time will not be a luxury on Jan. 3 2025 when the 119th Congress convenes.

That’s because the House is supposed to certify the Electoral College Jan. 6.

Congress did not conclude certifying the electoral votes for the 2020 election until the wee hours of Jan. 7 after the riot at the Capitol.

So what happens if the House is deadlocked over electing a speaker and can’t conduct a Joint Session of Congress to certify the Electoral College?

This is the issue that may be ahead if Republicans hold the House and struggle to elect a Speaker.

Without the fanfare that we normally expect from a Honeywell refrigerant introduction the announcement of the addition of R454B to the Honeywell portfolio was included as a secondary item in a newsletter sent to customers this week. It will market the refrigerant as Solstice 454B.

Meanwhile the industry still awaits Honeywell’s much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

Wide acceptability

An A2L refrigerant R454B has previously always been associated with Chemours from its time as DR-5 a DuPont development refrigerant and its subsequent passage through the ASHRAE classification process in 2015.

Despite this Honeywell lays claim to a patent on this refrigerant. When asked Honeywell told the Cooling Post: “Honeywell identified the usefulness of R-454B as a R-410A replacement for air conditioning in 2009 and has patented this discovery.”

What is clear is that R454B has been accepted by an increasing number of chiller heat pump and rooftop equipment manufacturers. These include Carrier Trane York Mitsubishi Electric Rhoss MTA Swegon Flakt Engie and GI.

A blend of R32 and R1234yf with a GWP of 466 R454B appears to be the best current option for new equipment in applications where a lower-flammability refrigerant is an option.

Honeywell notes that the discharge temperature of R454B is much lower than R32 and thanks to its higher critical temperature (77°C) and broader operating envelope in low evaporating temperatures it outperforms other alternatives such as R32 in heating applications.

Where’s R466A?

The news of Honeywell’s new addition comes while the market still awaits news of its much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

First announced by Honeywell in 2018 as Solstice N41 R466A was described as “a breakthrough” with its A1 non-flammable classification addressing “one of the most vexing regulatory and safety challenges facing the HVAC industry”.

An eagerly-awaited potential option for use in VRF systems it was originally going to be available in commercial quantities in the fall of 2019 then early 2020. Since then there has been little news of this refrigerant although it is accepted that OEM testing can be a protracted process a process which may have been further delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.

A number of OEMs were initially reported to be working with R466A including Chinese manufacturer Midea and Toshiba Carrier – a company which described the new refrigerant as “promising” after initial performance testing in a VRF air conditioning system. Component manufacturers Sanhua and Parker Hannifin were also known to be carrying out compatibility testing.

There have however been rumours of stability and compatibility concerns related to the refrigerants blend’s key CF3I (R13I1) component. Honeywell has previously denied any problems telling the Cooling Post last year that R466A was stable: “As seen with past introduction of new refrigerants the stability and shelf life can be addressed with standard measures practiced in the industry” it said.

As we approach the third anniversary of the initial announcement of the refrigerant Honeywell maintains that R466A is now in the “advanced stages” of commercialisation with samples having been provided to OEMs for evaluation to ensure compatibility with their equipment.

“To date Solstice N41 has undergone extensive testing by over 15 OEMs and leading compressor manufacturers and accumulated more than 100000+ hours in different applications like commercial AC (VRF rooftops) and residential AC (unitary)” the company said but would not be drawn on a new release timetable.

""Did you ever see that movie I Am Legend?"" said officer worker Kevin Frisz referring to the 2007 sci-fi thriller in which Will Smith inherits a post-apocalyptic emptied out Gotham City. ""It’s just a ghost town. It's what it used to be like on a Sunday morning.""

Frisz is an investment manager in Midtown and one of the 10% of office workers who have returned to their workspaces during the pandemic according to a survey that was conducted by the business group The Partnership for New York City.

The survey asked 174 companies representing 209000 of the city's 1 million office workers when they expected to have their employees back into the office; 45% said would be back by September 2021 while 14% said they weren't sure. According to the survey 61% of employers will not require that their returning employees be vaccinated while 8% will.

Employers said that 56% of their office workers will keep working remotely at least some of the time.

""The overwhelming message is that both employers and workers are uncertain as to when they're going to come back to the office and under what circumstances"" said Kathryn Wylde CEO for the Partnership. ""From an employer standpoint they're very concerned about the mental health stress burnout impact of COVID. Many of them feel that they cannot put any more pressure on their employees in terms of the expectation of them coming back to the office even though most of the CEOs I know would like to have the team back.""

One of those executives itching to have workers back is Jamie Dimon the head of one of New York's largest employers JPMorgan Chase. “The WFH lifestyle seems to have impacted younger employees and overall productivity and ‘creative combustion’ has taken a hit” one of the bank's analysts noted in September. “Overall Jamie thinks a shift back to the office will be good for the young employees and to foster creative ideas.""

(If the pandemic negatively impacted workers' productivity it did not hurt their ability to make money: Wall Street profits increased 82% during the first half of 2020.)

A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the company's position hasn't changed since the fall and that ""any return will be in accordance with local health authority guidance and our own readiness plans.""

On Thursday President Joe Biden promised that every American adult will be eligible to receive a vaccine by May 1st and suggested that if the vaccines are quickly and equitably distributed we might be able to have small gatherings to celebrate July 4th. Unfortunately the small business owners and street vendors who rely on office workers may not be able to hang on that long.

""Certainly for Manhattan where office workers are concentrated this is not good news for the small businesses and for the restaurants"" Wylde said of the survey results. ""They have very high rents. They need very high foot traffic and the survey results suggest that that's still a long ways away.""

Frisz the investment manager said that he anticipates that New York will come to life quickly as soon as enough people are vaccinated.

""I think I’m naturally an optimistic person so I lean towards a VJ-Day type situation"" he said. ""A summer of '69-type raging party all summer.""

However he was careful to add that he had felt this way before.

Over the past two years New York lawyer Spencer Sheehan has filed more than 100 lawsuits against companies marketing products with imitation vanilla flavoring as simply ""vanilla.""

Sheehan told Insider he started these cases after noticing a bottle of A&W Root Beer had a label saying ""made with aged vanilla"" on it. He said he was skeptical about whether it contained authentic vanilla.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""I didn't really know too much about the vanilla flavoring at that time but I could sense that something was amiss and eventually I gathered more information and was able to connect with many more people who are more knowledgeable than me and after that I filed a couple of cases"" Sheehan said.

Companies like Chobani McDonald's the drink-maker Keurig Dr Pepper and the Trader Joe's grocery chain have all been targeted by the suits which involve various products from ice cream to yogurt milk and coffee creamer.

Sheehan says he believes companies are tricking customers since their products usually only have a tiny amount of pure vanilla.

Pure vanilla is harvested from vanilla beans. HuffPost reported in 2019 that a kilogram cost around $500. From planting to harvesting and curing it can take between 12 to 14 months before vanilla beans can be used to produce the vanilla extract.

Artificial vanilla which is more commonly used is made from a synthetic form of vanillin the main compound in vanilla beans that gives them their flavor. Synthetic vanillin is made from things like wood pulp clove oil and – at one point – the anal glands of beavers HuffPost reported.

Imitation vanilla can be at least 20 times cheaper to produce than natural vanilla.

Legal experts told Insider Sheehan's cases don't have much merit because customers don't expect natural vanilla in products as long as the products taste like vanilla.

But Sheehan said it's uncommon for people to know the difference and that they should be able to make up their own minds about whether or not they care.

""I object and disagree that people don't expect this. That would mean that people are so smart as to know all of these things. Like how should somebody know all of this technical stuff?"" he said. ""They know when a label shares artificial flavors on it and that's what the labels do say on most products in the supermarket ... every product it's so common on every carton artificially flavored naturally flavored.""

He added: ""I think people expect what they're told.""

What's on the label

Sheehan argues companies are violating labeling requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration by not labeling products properly when they place just a vanilla label when it's actually mostly imitation product.

He said there are more special regulations from the FDA on vanilla than on any other product used for flavoring because ""it is quite expensive and it's very easily adulterated meaning it's very difficult to tell the difference between real vanilla and fake vanilla.""

However over a 12-month period New York courts dismissed four different complaints challenging vanilla-flavoring claims.

""Multiple judicial opinions out of New York's federal courts including a decision issued earlier this week in Manhattan have dismissed cases predicated on this 'vanilla-labeling' theory"" Tommy Tobin an attorney at Perkins Coie LLP told Insider late last month.

In a recent newsletter the firm said while the vanilla cases dominated food litigation in 2020 they may be ""nearing an endpoint"" this year adding there has been ""increasing impatience"" from courts when it comes to the topic.

""This is a remarkable trend and represents about a quarter of overall food-litigation filings in 2019 and 2020"" Tobin said.

McDonald's in a filing last month to support a motion to dismiss the case Sheehan brought against it referenced several other vanilla-related cases that were dismissed.

A case Sheehan filed against Wegmans over ice cream labels was also thrown out. The court argued buyers' main concern is getting ice cream that tastes like vanilla and not necessarily something derived from the vanilla bean.

""The buyer's first desire is for ice cream and when he is in the frozen food area he must select from many choices (chocolate lemon mint lime etc.) the one he wants. Thus the large-type ""Vanilla"" is of immediate use. Of course he is not looking for a bowl of vanilla and the next largest words confirm that the container holds ice cream. Those who prefer natural ingredients will note that it has natural vanilla flavor and no artificial flavors"" District Judge Louis Stanton in the Southern District Court of New York said.

On February 22 US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District Court of New York dismissed a case Sheehan filed on behalf of a plaintiff against Oregon Chai a company that makes flavored chai.

Sheehan said he's always had a passion for consumer issues. Since he started filing vanilla lawsuits he's been able to expand his firm from just one part-time paralegal to now having two full-time attorneys. ""I have an interest in other consumer issues. I don't want to be pigeonholed"" he said.

""I may not have a lot of non-vanilla cases but vanilla is the most unique and interesting.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

British Columbia’s rare and ancient trees continue to vanish into sawmills at worrying rates despite the Great Bear Rainforest agreement reached with great fanfare five years ago to protect the largest coastal temperate rainforest on the planet.

The province’s NDP government re-elected last fall with a commitment to lead a paradigm shift in forestry is mired in planning and consultation.

“The promise of the Great Bear Rainforest was to change this broken system” said Nicole Rycroft executive director of Canopy a non-profit group that partners with forest-product customers – including Penguin Random House Kimberly Clark Scholastic and The Globe and Mail – to advance conservation.

Some of the biggest names in the print publishing world gathered for a virtual conference in early March to hear how B.C. is living up to the Great Bear Rainforest agreement. They left disappointed.

“Things are clearly substantively behind schedule” Ms. Rycroft said. Representatives for companies partnered with Canopy “left the call with a number of questions around how the government could be clearly not fulfilling the public commitment that was made.”

The 2016 Great Bear Rainforest agreement the product of 20 years of negotiations between environmentalists forestry companies Indigenous communities and the provincial government was forged under market pressure. More than 80 companies including Home Depot Staples and IKEA had been persuaded to stop selling products made from B.C.’s old-growth forests. The deal’s signing brought those customers back – with the promise that buying B.C. forestry products would help them meet their own commitments to environmental values.

British Columbia reaped international accolades for the deal which applied to 6.4 million hectares of the coast from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaska Panhandle.

The agreement promised to protect 85 per cent of the region’s old-growth forests with logging in the remaining 15 per cent subject to the most stringent standards in North America. But since it was signed more than 10 million cubic metres of timber have been harvested in the Great Bear without the enforcement mechanisms that were supposed to ensure ecosystem-based management is being applied.

Instead of setting aside the rare and iconic big trees for protection “there are a lot of very big stumps” said conservation biologist Jody Holmes an architect of the agreement.

Canopy is proposing to halt old-growth logging in the Great Bear until individual logging plans are approved – and so far not one plan has been approved. B.C. Forests Minister Katrine Conroy who would not provide that commitment told those at the March meeting that progress is being made but the issues are complex. “We have to do this right; we can’t rush this” she said later in an interview.

Marilyn Slett is the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Nation whose territory encompasses a substantial portion of the Great Bear Rainforest. “We’re not thrilled with the pace of change” she said in an interview. The Heiltsuk want to protect old growth in their territory and there is frustration that the targets in the agreement have fallen behind schedule. The process is overly complex she said.

“But relationships take time and we are in it for the long haul” she said.

British Columbia is home to 57 million hectares of forests but ancient temperate rainforests are astonishingly rare. A recent study found that those highly productive intact ecosystems make up less than 1 per cent of B.C.’s remaining forests.

In 2019 the government set up an expert panel to review the divisive issue of old-growth logging. The panel’s report was not released until last fall and during the election campaign the NDP promised to enact all of the panel’s recommendations.

But the timeline for these changes is also slipping and one long-running act of civil disobedience captures the dismay with the lack of progress.

For more than 200 days protesters have maintained a remote forest blockade against logging in a valley on Vancouver Island. Fairy Creek is part of Tree Farm Licence 46 and features increasingly rare intact stands of Western redcedar and yellow cedars trees that are up to 800 years old.

The Fairy Creek demonstrators could soon face arrest. An application brought by the logging company The Teal-Jones Group will be heard in court on March 26. The escalating conflict unfolding in Premier John Horgan’s riding underscores the gap between the Premier’s campaign commitments and the unabated harvesting of some of the biggest oldest and most valuable trees left in the province.

Mr. Horgan says his government is moving toward a new way of practising forestry one that sustains the biodiversity in B.C.’s ancient forests while allowing forestry companies to extract more value from the timber that is harvested. There are no shortcuts he said.

“This is an intractable problem in British Columbia and I believe we’ve laid the groundwork for a positive resolution but it’s a paradigm shift in how the industry operates” he said in an interview Friday.

“It is not my intention to see the last big tree felled – quite the contrary. “

He knows the iconic status attached to those old-growth forests but he said big trees will continue to fall while the new rules are developed.

His party was in government in the 1990s when more than 850 people were arrested at Clayoquot Sound a fight that was dubbed the War in the Woods. The fight to protect the Great Bear Rainforest although waged in boardrooms was the province’s second major land-use war.

Dallas Smith is president of the Nanwakolas Council which represents six of the First Nations in the Great Bear Rainforest and one of the Indigenous leaders who signed the accord five years ago.

The blockades at Fairy Creek are a symptom of rising tension he warns because the province has been dragging its heels on reform. “To have the audacity to campaign on old growth and then still just not do anything. ... I see the War in the Woods 3.0 coming pretty quick” he said.

Gerrie Kotze vice-president and CFO of The Teal-Jones Group noted that his company consulted with local First Nations before starting its harvesting plans this year.

“Engagement and reconciliation with First Nations is core to our values” he said in a written statement. The province already does balance conservation with economic activity he said. “We support this balanced approach to the province’s land base and respect that significant stands of forested lands have been set aside for conservation.”

While the blockade has halted Teal-Jones’ logging operations in Fairy Creek the company has been logging nearby in the Caycuse watershed.

Environmentalists are concerned.

“That’s the best old-growth forest that’s been destroyed on southern Vancouver Island in the last five years and it was planned applied for permitted and logged after the government commissioned the old-growth report” said Torrance Coste national campaign director for the Wilderness Committee. “Every week that we wait there’s less and less old growth to protect.”

California's Department of Justice is weighing in on a proposal for an exploratory natural gas drilling project in the North Bay's environmentally sensitive Suisun Marsh.

A letter sent Friday to the Army Corps of Engineers from Acting Attorney General Matthew Rodriquez's office expresses concern that the project could damage critical wildlife habitat and add to air and water pollution impacts already borne by nearby communities.

""Suisun Marsh ... is a unique and irreplaceable natural resource that is important to the State and to the nation as a whole"" the letter states. ""The project site is also near environmental justice communities that have been overburdened by pollution for decades.""

Specifically referencing the nearby cities of Suisun City Fairfield and Vallejo — all predominantly communities of color already impacted by pollutants from multiple nearby oil and gas facilities — the letter states that ""the proposed project would likely exacerbate harm to these environmental justice communities"" and notes that the Army Corps' public notice on the project ""does not discuss potential impacts to nearby environmental justice communities.""

""The Corps should address all potential environmental justice impacts associated with the project before it may issue the requested permit"" the letter continues. ""We urge the Corps to carefully consider these impacts and the public interest before deciding whether to grant the requested permit.""

The Army Corps of Engineers has extended the public comment period for the proposed project until today and say they will consider the possibility of an environmental impact statement after all comments have been reviewed.

Original Story:

Local political leaders and a dozen Bay Area environmental groups are urging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a permit proposal for an exploratory natural gas drilling project in Suisun Marsh.

The 88000-acre wetland in Solano County — the largest contiguous brackish marsh on the west coast of North America — lies near the North Bay cities of Fairfield and Benicia at the mouth of the vast Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta where the salty waters of San Francisco Bay mix with river water to create an estuary ecosystem that is home to hundreds of species of birds fish amphibians and mammals including river otter tule elk and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse.

The marsh provides habitat to bird species including the endangered California Ridgway's rail and the threatened California black rail and is home to rare native plants like the Suisun thistle which only grows in Suisun Marsh. It’s also an important resting and feeding area for thousands of migrating birds which use the Pacific flyway making it a popular destination for birdwatching hunting hiking and canoeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These bag-carrying stuff-accumulating shopaholics went on to transform the way the world works. Today you may tut at their hamster-on-a-wheel mindlessness and its environmental impact. Or you may celebrate their freedom to choose goods experiences and ways of life. But you cannot dispute their economic and political clout. As we explain this week in our special report a new species of shopper is emerging: less centred on America more intent on ensuring that what they buy reflects what they believe and technologically dexterous. This latest incarnation of the global consumer looks likely to change how capitalism works—for the better.

Today’s shoppers are no longer epitomised by Westerners stuffing mountains of groceries into the boots of their cars and loading up on monolithic all-American brands. For one thing they are increasingly Asian. Last year China and America were almost neck-and-neck as the world’s biggest retail markets. China’s two biggest online marketplaces Alibaba’s Taobao and TM all both do more third-party business than Amazon the American juggernaut. Just as American consumers once popularised the shopping catalogue and the mall now Asia’s shoppers are at the frontier of retail innovations whether that is live-streaming a store that sells a single book in Tokyo or browsing by WhatsApp in India.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kroger received a limited supply of vaccines through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership plan according to a news release. As doses are received they will be allocated and administered across all 103 Kroger pharmacies in Michigan.

Kroger will administer doses according to state and local health department rollout guidelines the release said.

“We are strongly encouraging all customers and associates to receive the vaccine to curb the spread of COVID-19 in our communities” Ban George health and wellness leader for the Kroger Co. of Michigan said in the release. “Through the launch of our new scheduling tool and COVID-19 Help Line Kroger is doing everything it can to ensure our communities have access to the vaccine as it becomes available.”

In February the Cincinnati-based grocery giant announced it would give a $100 bonus to its employees who get the COVID-19 vaccine when eligible.

Kroger employees including about 19000 in Michigan will receive the one-time payment upon providing proof of vaccination with the ""full manufacturer-recommended"" dose.

Individuals must meet the current phase eligibility criteria in order to make a vaccination appointment at kroger.com/covidvaccine or by calling 866-211-5320.

So far The Kroger Co. says it has administered nearly 1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses across 25 states.

Chanting “Up up up with the worker; down down down with Kroger” demonstrators called on shoppers to boycott the company handing out informational pamphlets on reasons behind their movement.

After Kroger announced last month that it plans to close both a Food 4 Less and Ralphs in the city as a result of the enforcement of hazard pay local activists have been vocal in their opposition of the corporation. During Sunday’s event participants held up signs demanding the stores remain open as organizer Anthony Bryson emphasized the importance of protesting “corporate greed.”

“This is a community of individuals from LA County responding to the gross negligence that Kroger participates in” Bryson said. “We see Food 4 Less we see Ralphs locations that do not have signs saying to wear a mask.”

Bryson argued that if Kroger does follow through with the store closures the affected workers should be relocated to the other high-volume locations that are seeing increased profits due to COVID-19.

“But we stand by that these locations should not be closed because those affected the most are Black and Brown individuals” Bryson said.

Emphasizing how workers benefit from hazard pay Steven Estrada a Long Beach State alumnus Army veteran and member of the Communist Party USA said he felt workers are deserving of sufficient pay especially during a time of economic struggle.

“In District 1 where I’m from one out of every four people live in poverty one in four are rent-burdened” said Estrada who is a candidate for the Long Beach City Council District 1 seat. “In one of the wealthiest counties in one of the wealthiest nations in the world I don’t believe that the workers who create the value of all things in society should go hungry without housing without services.”

During the event Bryson announced that he will be running for the 47th congressional district currently held by Rep. Alan Lowenthal.

“We are fighting for livable wages not minimum wages” Bryson said. “We are fighting for unity not division we are asking that no one be laid off and forced to partake in unemployment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvNC1wZW9wbGUtaW4tbWljaGlnYW4td2lsbC1zcGxpdC0xLTA1Yi1tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWphY2twb3QtZnJvbS1qYW51YXJ5LWRyYXdpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZV8xZjkzZDQzYS1kNTQ0LTU2NTUtOWEwMS0xOGE0MzFmZTNiNWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 people in Michigan will split $1.05B Mega Millions jackpot from January drawing,A man shot a would-be thief who was spotted trying to steal his car after he left it running in his driveway early Monday according to police and KIRO-TV.

The $1.05 billion jackpot was the largest in Michigan Lottery history and the third-largest in the United States. Mega Millions is played in 45 states as well as Washington D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The winning ticket was purchased almost as an afterthought at a Kroger grocery store in the Detroit suburb of Novi.

""A club member saw a sign that the jackpot was up to $1 billion and remembered that they hadn't bought their tickets yet so they pulled into the Kroger"" Panouses said. ""When you play of course you dream of winning but the reality of it has been incredible.""

Kroger said it would donate its $50000 commission to the Food Bank Council of Michigan.

""Kroger is committed to our mission of feeding our communities"" said Rachel Hurst corporate affairs manager at the Kroger Co. of Michigan.

There was much public speculation immediately after the drawing that a group of Novi teachers had won. David Ascher principal at Novi Woods Elementary School shot down the rumors.

""Everyone showed up for work today which was really good"" Escher said two days after the drawing. ""I bought them all donuts today which seemed to help too.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGlja29uZGV0cm9pdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL29ha2xhbmQtY291bnR5LWxvdHRlcnktY2x1Yi1zaGFyZXMtaG93LXRoZXktcGxhbi10by1zcGVuZC0xYi1tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWphY2twb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oakland County lottery club shares how they plan to spend $1B Mega Millions jackpot,"NOVI Mich. – The news of who won the $1 billion Mega Millions jackpot is swirling around the Kroger in Novi.

It’s where someone belonging to the four-person Wolverine FLL Lottery Club bought the winning ticket back in January. On Friday an attorney for the group announced how they’re going to spend their money.

“This is not just generational money this is multi-generational. Education is important to them. Obviously they want to do some scholarships as well and they want to see this money actually help other people just like it helped them” said Kurt D. Panouses.

The group took the lump sum option putting the grand total at $776 million. With $219 million taken in taxes the group walked away with $557 Million dividing it to $139 million for each of the four members.

Kroger will get $50000 for selling the winning ticket and plans to donate the money to the Food Bank Council of Michigan.

Two in five respondents (40%) said that the security they felt while carrying out transactions on mobile applications was their most important consideration.

This was followed by the level of service quality (25%) which referred to whether the banking applications could fulfil users' needs such as carrying out transactions and easy access to credit card services.

System quality which considers the performance of the application including compatibility with different mobile phones and loading speeds came in a close third (24%).

The results of the study were published in the Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services an academic publication by Elsevier last December.

The researchers said their study which ranked factors that are important in determining customer loyalty would be useful to financial institutions who are looking at improving their mobile banking applications.

Already widely used in China prior to COVID-19 mobile banking applications have seen a sharp rise in uptake throughout Asia during the pandemic as the touchless payment systems provided by most mobile banking applications have gained traction.

The NTU-WeBank team obtained their results after surveying 224 mobile banking users of a large bank in China in 2019. Over three-quarters of the respondents (79%) were frequent users of mobile banking meaning that they used it at least once a week.

The researchers said that although the study was conducted in China the results are applicable to other countries where mobile banking has a high level of adoption such as Singapore Thailand and Vietnam.

Associate Professor Xu Hong from NTU's School of Social Sciences who led the study said: ""It was already known that all these factors: security service quality system quality and interface design had an impact on customers and this study highlights implications for banks' strategies for retaining their mobile banking users as well as exploring how to capture new customers.""

Assistant Professor Yu Han from NTU's School of Computer Science and Engineering who co-led the research said: ""Our study has implications for banks' strategies for retaining their mobile banking users as well as exploring how to capture new customers.""

Assoc Prof Xu and Asst Prof Yu are part of the team at the Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on Fintech which initiated this study. The joint centre was launched in early 2019 with the aim of developing new technologies to support Banking 4.0 where banking can be personalised and done anytime anywhere.

Mr Joe Chen Executive Vice President of WeBank said: ""The findings are relevant to other banks who are increasingly rolling out more digital solutions which include payment lending and wealth management applications. As mobile banking worldwide is becoming increasingly accepted as replacement for branch-based banking in many countries it is important for banks to know the factors that affect and influence customer loyalty. In this regard the Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre will continue to generate research outcomes and innovations for the benefit of the Fintech industry.""

NTU Senior Vice President (Research) Professor Lam Khin Yong added: ""The NTU-WeBank partnership is another example of the University's strong links with the private sector. It also shows our strong support for industry collaborations that accelerates the translation of research into innovation and commercial adoption. This study also serves as a good example of interdisciplinary research involving faculty from the social sciences and computer science as it solves a very important issue in today's fintech industry.""

A multi-pronged approach to build customer loyalty

The team's analysis of the results also showed that a mobile application's interface design had a strong and positive impact on respondents' evaluation of system and service quality.

This is despite it scoring relatively low compared to other factors surveyed in the study. For example the team found that respondents tended to associate good interface design such as smooth transitions between pages with optimal system quality and high security.

The findings also outlined a larger correlation between several factors that were surveyed. For example service and system quality and interface design were found to be important in sparking user loyalty which the researchers defined as ""the intention to continuously use the mobile banking product and recommend it to others.""

After analysing the survey results the team advised that mobile banking operators should focus on providing multi-level security features to increase the users' sense of security when using the applications.

Such features might include pop-up messages that alert users to the potential risks that could occur when using mobile banking services as well as a well-documented policy statement from the financial institution.

Besides providing users assurance of their security while using the applications Assoc Prof Xu added: ""The level of service quality which encompasses factors such as the levels of reliability responsiveness and empathy from bank staff could enhance users' satisfaction and increase their usage of mobile banking services.""

""By providing a stable and secure mobile banking system that boasts fast responses and efficient service banks can encourage customers to continue using their mobile banking application while ultimately strengthening user loyalty. The results can also help improve their overall mobile banking strategy and cater the functions of their apps to the needs of different age groups.""

Next steps: overseas studies

To further their research on loyalty intention in mobile banking the NTU-WeBank team is looking to conduct studies in other countries and regions to identify other determinants that could affect customer loyalty.

Assoc Prof Xu said the team will continue to leverage the computing platform which it has developed to collect and analyse user experience data for future studies.

""We believe the large-scale immersive studies we will conduct using our computing platform powered by social computing and social media technologies will be able to help banks gain more insights into customers' intentions"" said Assoc Prof Xu.

Here’s what’s new.,"Restaurants stores and casino floors in Las Vegas are bumping up to 50 percent of their fire-code capacities right around the time stimulus checks arrive.

Casinos and restaurants will see their capacities bumped up to 50 percent of their occupancy levels on Monday while another development could provide additional help: Customers may have more money in their pockets when they arrive.

A month ago Gov. Steve Sisolak allowed capacity at businesses to increase from 25 percent of their buildings’ fire-code limits to 35 percent on March 1 and said that barring any setbacks it could rise to 50 percent effective March 15.

By happenstance Congress narrowly approved and President Joe Biden signed into law a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package that will put an additional $1400 in many Americans’ pockets in time for the higher capacity. Federal leaders said they expected the first stimulus checks would land in bank accounts over this past weekend.

That means restaurants retailers and casinos could see more spending flowing through their cash registers when capacity broadens. It could also mean more visitors coming in from out of state and offer hope that things are going to get better for both consumers and business operators.

“The continued increase in capacity continues to show that Las Vegas is beginning to reopen” said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Global Market Advisors. “It is a welcome number that has not been seen since last fall when capacity was cut by 50 percent by the governor. The hope is that this trend continues by reopening the economy and should so that we can continue the recovery that was started last June.”

Restaurant boost

Restaurant operators will likely be positively affected the most.

Andy Hooper owner of Locale Italian Kitchen and El Luchador Mexican Kitchen + Cantina in Mountain’s Edge expects the boost to business to come more from the messaging than any increase in capacity.

“It won’t affect us as a whole for getting more people into the restaurant because of the distance rules” Hooper says. “But it is a psychological thing. I think that people will feel more relaxed. I think that the times that we do have available for guests to come in to dine are going to be extended.”

Hooper was referring to the 6-foot social distancing rules that will still be in place despite the rise in capacity.

Amy Vandermark marketing manager for the Remedy’s Tavern and Distill Bar chains says that she and her team are “so excited” about the increase in capacity which she expects will mean more people in their 11 valley locations.

“In the past few months as capacity has gone from 25 percent to 35 percent we did hit capacity and we did have to tell (some) guests that we weren’t going to be able to welcome them in the building just yet. We did have wait lists.”

Vandermark believes that the increase in business will be “an opportunity to welcome back some team members and hire new individuals from the community.”

At Jing in Downtown Summerlin managing partner Roy Saunders expects the loosened restrictions to affect business in two ways.

Confidence booster

“The No. 1 thing that 50 percent does for us is the mentality” says Saunders. “When the governor raised the capacity from 25 to 35 percent we saw a huge increase in reservations. So I think what it does is it sends out a signal to the public that ‘Hey it’s OK to start coming out to restaurants. So come on out and enjoy yourself kind of like the old days.’ The second part for us is yeah 50 percent does mean a lot because it gives us 15 percent more capacity.”

“Of course it’s awesome” said Peggy Orth general manager of the Peppermill on the Strip. “I want it to be 100 (percent) but it’s a huge huge help. We’re getting a lot of people back full time. We’ve been really fortunate because the company has been taking care of insurance needs when we weren’t up to hours. And now we can take walk-ins and not just reservations; that’s a huge help.”

Elizabeth Blau whose restaurants include Honey Salt in Summerlin and Buddy V’s Ristorante at the Grand Canal Shoppes on the Strip had expressed displeasure a few weeks ago when capacity limits were moved to 35 percent.

“I will not criticize 50; that’s what we should have gone to last time” she said Thursday. She noted that some states were raising capacity limits to 100 percent but requiring 6 feet of social distancing.

“Here’s the thing” Blau said. “You can’t have 100 percent at 6 feet unless your restaurant is on a football field. Fifty percent is fine. We want to keep our 6-foot spacing. I think that people are still dipping a toe back into indoor dining especially at Buddy V’s where they’re coming from all over the country.”

Nehme Abouzeid president and founder of LaunchVegas LLC said the new capacity level “won’t have earth-shattering effects on hotel and casino because few were hitting their limits there.

“But increasing capacity for retail dining entertainment and events is critical to Vegas getting its groove back” he said. “A vacation is not a Vegas vacation until it includes all of the things that we excel at like headliner shows luxury shopping and over-the-top gourmet dinners.”

Abouzeid said restaurateurs will still have to play musical chairs for a while but with positivity rates trending downward and more vaccines becoming available especially for hospitality workers people won’t have to feel as though they are putting their lives on the line for their livelihoods.

“That welcoming spirit that resides in Las Vegas will come roaring back” he said.

Casino floor capacity

Casino capacity is a little different.

While representatives of casino companies declined to comment analysts and observers who follow the industry carefully say consumer confidence may be the biggest beneficiary in the capacity increase.

“I think the increased capacity will help both consumer confidence and the bottom line” said UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino. “Guests will feel more comfortable and confident; therefore they will be more likely to travel. The ability to have more guests on the floor at any one time should also help increase revenue by having more machines and tables open.

“Finally I think the casinos will have a modified version of the procedures they have in place (such as having slot machines shut down) but I think they will be largely similar to what they are doing now” she said.

Abouzeid said increasing capacity drives more trips to Southern Nevada and raises revenue overall because word will get out that vacations aren’t being ruined by closed amenities or places the public couldn’t get into. He said it’s important both in a practical sense and for optics.

Safeguards in place

“And procedurally the casino industry has already invested in the many safeguards to protect their businesses so I expect them to roll out these new limits pretty easily” he said.

Bussmann agreed that the combination of more people being vaccinated and health and safety procedures remaining in place will help bring more tourists to the city.

He said the key to recovery is fully opening up the destination — and the increased floor and restaurant capacity limits start that process.

“The key though will be the return of meetings and conventions and other amenities” Bussmann said. “While other destinations have started to fill that void the sooner the destination can get back to hosting these events the better it will be for its long-term recovery.”

The Academy Award-winning actor turns 75-years-old March 12. As the daughter of Hollywood icons Judy Garland and legendary director Vincent Minnelli Liza grew up on film sets and had talent in her blood. The star released her first album Liza! Liza! in 1964 aged 18 and continued to release music until 2010. In 2006 she took a chance on up-and-coming emo-rock band My Chemical Romance whose third album The Black Parade was in need of a female vocalist.

The Black Parade’s ninth track Mama continued with the album’s theme of war and death telling of a boy writing home to his mother from the trenches. Gerard the lead singer of the band wanted a female singer who “had a lot of character someone that was very strong sorrowful”. Emotional is what the band received with Liza crying and sobbing over the song’s outro. Liza also yelled over Gerard’s voice crying the lyrics: “And if you would call me a sweetheart I'd maybe then sing you a song.” As a life-long fan of Liza Gerard pitched bringing her on board to his producer while recording the song in early 2006.

Eventually Robert and Maureen divorced in 1983 after which Robert had no more children and is believed to have not remarried. There was a moment however when fans were a little confused and believed he had remarried thanks to a tongue-in-cheek comment. In 2012 Robert told the Independent he had “eloped and ran off to Texas” with vocalist Patty Griffin but shortly after his manager told E! News this was a joke and Robert was only discussing his being in Texas where Patty lives.

The successor to Lockheed Martin’s SR-71 Blackbird the Mach 3 long-range recon aircraft that once tore across the skies like a Cold-War era arrowhead before its retirement in 1999 may be inching closer toward reality.

According to Aviation Week a handful of visitors to the SAE International Aerotech Congress and Exhibition at Fort Worth Texas a few years ago reported catching glimpses of a “demonstrator vehicle” believed to be linked to the proposed replacement: the SR-72.

Though the SR-72’s development is (understandably) a tightly-kept secret Aviation Week reports that: In the early hours of July an “unmanned subscale aircraft” was seen flying into the Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale California where Lockheed Martin’s legendary Skunk Works division is headquartered.

With an “optionally piloted” flight research vehicle test slated for 2018 by Lockheed back in June and a test flight anticipated to occur by 2020 the presence of the demonstrator at Palmdale seems to indicate that the SR-72’s progress is in line with Lockheed Martin’s timeline.

“Although I can’t go into specifics let us just say the Skunk Works team in Palmdale California is doubling down on our commitment to speed” Orlando Carvalho the executive vice president of aeronautics at Lockheed Martin said at the exhibition which ran from Sept. 26 to 28. “Simply put I believe the United States is on the verge of a hypersonics revolution.”

Lockheed Martin has remained tight-lipped on the SR-72 program since announcing the Blackbird successor in 2013 but the aerospace giant wants to up the ante in terms of speed. And that’s saying something: the Blackbird as it's known is not only faster than any other jet-propelled aircraft — it can literally outrun missiles.

“Speed matters especially when it comes to national security” as Carvalho put it.

If the recent sightings in Palmdale are tied to the Blackbird’s replacement then the aircraft really is fast — and not just on the flight line. While still under development at Skunk Works the proposed reconnaissance plane is expected to hit Mach 6 thanks to advanced new hypersonic tech.

“Hypersonics is like stealth. It is a disruptive technology and will enable various platforms to operate at two to three times the speed of the Blackbird” Carvalho told Aviation Week. “Operational survivability and lethality is the ultimate deterrent. Security classification guidance will only allow us to say the speed is greater than Mach 5.”

The proposed hypersonic aircraft could fill a space left by the SR-71 which was retired in 1999 due to the proliferation of spy satellites enemy air defenses and ultimately its exorbitant costs — roughly $200000 per hour of operation reports the National Interest. Unlike its predecessor the SR-72 is being designed with strike capability in mind — which means it’s not just a super speedy spy plane: It can reach out and obliterate a target then zip back the way it came.

Carvalho’s comments while not explicitly linked to the SR-72 mirrored sentiments expressed by Rob Weiss executive vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Development Programs organization during the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics forum in Denver Colorado in June.

“We’ve been saying hypersonics is two years away for the last 20 years” said Weiss. “But all I can say is the technology is mature and we along with DARPA and the services are working hard to get that capability into the hands of our warfighters as soon as possible.”

Firms manufacturing them were popping up left and right they were all over the news and their promised capabilities looked just unimaginably exciting. Safe cheap sustainable fast convenient…

That happened twice actually. In the 1920s and 30s for the first time then once again between the 1990s and 2010s.

The story of the first golden age of airships is well known. They appeared at the very end of the 19th century were popular well liked and seemed to be the perfect transport offering flight distances and payload capacities not available to contemporary airplanes while soundly beating almost any land- and sea-based mode of transport with their speed.

But in the 1930s thanks in part to the wide media coverage of the Hindenburg disaster they quickly fell out of favor – just in time for the new generations or large airplanes to take the lead in air travel and air cargo.

Those early airships were bulky difficult to control and tremendously unsafe. But all of their limitations could be easily negated with new materials technologies and safety standards. Airships are perfect for many tasks contemporary aviation is not particularly good at: loitering for a long time at one place efficiently transporting heavy and oversized cargo and in general not consuming obscene amounts of fuel. On top of that airships are much quieter and much cleaner than airplanes something extremely important in our day and age. So isn’t it the perfect time to start building them?

That is the story told time and time again in thousands of sales pitches on the verge of the 21st century when numerous startups vowed to resurrect the airship and make it flyable profitable and safe again.

High hopes

Most people probably heard such a pitch with Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) Airlander 10 which held the title of world’s largest aircraft between 2012 and 2017 and was probably the most publicized of the lot. It was intended as a military surveillance platform before being rejected by the US Army and repurposed for civilian use.

Along with it many ventures were created in the hopes that airships with their long endurance are the future of surveillance. French A-NSE and British Airship Industries are amongst the most prominent of them. Blackwater the infamous private military company jumped on the trend with their Polar 400 Airship. It was followed by aeronautical giants – Lockheed Martin with the P-791 and Northrop Grumman with the LEMV. The last of them got awarded a $150 million contract by DARPA.

The P-791 project was later repurposed for civilian use just like Airlander 10. Boeing’s SkyHook was civilian from the start. German CargoLifter Italian Nimbus EosXi and several others looked into providing cargo or passenger services with unmatched efficiency; even the Zeppelin company barely active since the WWII has resurrected their aeronautical arm as Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and promised to resume manufacturing of airships.

Some of these projects planned to use non-flammable helium others – improve the reputation of hydrogen. Some tried to return to the rigid frame of pre-war airships while others constructed semi-rigid or fully collapsible airframes. Some used helicopter rotors for additional lift others made their airships with various kinds of additional lifting surfaces. The most ambitious ones – notably Walrus HULA project by DARPA and some others – proposed ships tens of times larger than Hindenburg that would lift hundreds of tons of cargo and carry it almost without consuming fuel drifting along in air currents using atmospheric ion propulsion or some other exotic technology.

All of these proposals were born between the mid-1990s and mid-2010s the time when the idea of the “renaissance of airships” floated in the air.

There were several proposals that predate that: companies like Piasecki AeroLift Aereon and Aeros were some of the forerunners offering to provide the US army with patrol cargo or other kind of airship already in the 80s and pitching the same story – that now is the perfect time to resurrect the undeservedly-forgotten concept update it with latest advances and fly straight into the lighter-than-air future. Some of them constructed a prototype or two before going bust.

What happened?

As of the early 2021 of the whole slew of airship startups only several remain. Large corporations – such as Boeing and Northrop Grumman – forgot their proposals completely. Lockheed Martin has been delaying the first flight of the commercial variant of the P-791 since 2017 and hasn’t spoken about it for the last year. The US Army’s plan to have a fleet of surveillance airships collapsed already in 2012 taking many projects with it and while some blimps saw action in Afghanistan – including Blackwater’s – they were completely superseded by new relatively cheap and available long-endurance heavier-than-air drones.

Dedicated cargo airships did not fare better. The Airlander 10 prototype crashed in 2017 HAV decided not to restore the aircraft and focus on the development of the version for mass production. It has been receiving significant backing both through crowdfunding and state grants ever since and issuing progress updates regularly. It promises entry into service in 2025.

Ironically Luftschiffbau Zeppelin – the company which pioneered the airship and was in the center of industry’s first collapse – may have been the biggest beneficiary of its rebirth. Only a fraction of its revenue is generated by manufacturing and sales of actual airships but since the resumption of this line of work in 2001 half a dozen of their N07-101s were sold mostly for advertising purposes and for performing joyrides. In fact company’s ships remain the only option for an enthusiast to experience a flight on an airship today.

That half a dozen is quite definitely not a success story though. And it along with all the other failures puts the new era of airships into a place which it could not avoid. The chasm.

What now?

Geoffrey A. Moore’s curve of new technology adoption rides somewhere between a cliché and a ubiquitously accepted fact. It proposes that every new technological achievement goes through several phases being adopted at first by risk-taking pioneers before finding its way into the mainstream audience. Between those states there is the chasm: the part where the wide public gets disillusioned with the technology its shortcomings become apparent and there is a risk that the development will stop.

New generation of airships quite clearly have entered the chasm now. Will they find a way out of it? On one hand the COVID-19 crisis and the near-collapse of the aviation industry as a whole may have been the final nail in their coffin which has already been sealed half-a-decade before.

On the other hand the same circumstances brought the rise of the cargo sector and an unparalleled appetite for efficiency. At the same time the maritime transport industry was in turmoil in 2020 showing the weakening already in 2019. Some experts are talking of the collapse of global supply chains and while the wholesale shipping apocalypse may seem far-fetched there is no denying that things are bound to change.

The resumption of airships’ renaissance rests on the question whether HAV and some other less dormant companies will be able to use this situation to their advantage. Airships sit in a gap between aircraft and ships and for the cargo industry offer some advantages of both. As both the air and maritime transport is posed to have the rise in demand a new niche may have opened providing at least a narrow possibility for us to see the giants floating in the skies once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL2FybXlzLWxhc2VyLW1hY2hpbmUtZ3VuLWNhbi12YXBvcml6ZS10YXJnZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Army's laser machine gun can 'vaporize' targets,"Imagine a laser weapon that like rifles in science fiction movies fires metal-vaporizing pulses just like a machine gun.

Now imagine that laser weapon is a million times more powerful than any used before and is capable of vaporizing its targets and disrupting enemy tech signals.

Something out of a Star Trek TV episode right?

Alas it’s not in a sci-fi movie script. The US Army is developing the device which is known as the Tactical Ultrashort Pulsed Laser for Army Platforms.

According to a report in IndustryTap.com present laser weapons developed by the US military emit continuous beams. These were typically designed to bore holes through metal.

These weapons can disable relatively close-by vehicles or drones.

But the Tactical Ultrashort Pulsed Laser (UPSL) platform will emit short pulses that rely on low energy. As a result this weapon will be powerful enough to vaporize rather than melting the metal.

Researchers are designing it to reach a terawatt for a short 200 femtoseconds or one quadrillionth of a second IndustryTap reported. In that small duration of time it would be able to vaporize a drone.

It is also capable of disrupting electronic systems in its vicinity making it a functional electromagnetic pulse (EMP).

In the future an army could use it as a standalone system or integrated onboard ground vehicles ships and aircraft. These could prove to be very useful when combating fast-moving small drones or missiles IndustryTap reported.

According to the government’s SBIR site this is how it works:

“Current high energy laser (HEL) weapon systems primarily consist of continuous wave (CW) laser sources with output powers in the kilowatts” the description says. “These kilowatt-class CW laser systems predominantly engage targets via absorption of light; either causing the target to burn and melt or overwhelming optical sensors with high intensities. Thanks to the emergence of diode and fiber laser technology these laser systems have grown increasingly ruggedized to the point they have been integrated onto platforms ranging from ground to sea. The Army is preparing the warfighter for a future battlefield with rapidly modernizing militaries while new threats and gaps are emerging. CW lasers provide solutions to many of these problems but due to their fundamental different natures lasers with pulse widths in the range of femtoseconds provide unique tactical capabilities due to their rapid discharge of enormous power.”

According to National Interest Lockheed Martin is looking to shrink down its HELIOS laser to the point where it could fit on a future fighter plane.

The US Navy has also begun to arm its destroyers with laser-based weapons.

“To destroy a cruise missile it takes higher power settings longer range attack and different types of lasers” David Stoudt a senior executive advisor to Booz Allen Hamilton said in an interview last year.

“Power levels are going up with the ability to meaningfully engage. We are doing the necessary lethality investigation. What does it take to actually kill a target?”

Officials said the prototype of the USPL will be unveiled in August 2022.

According to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report the U.S. is committed to spending $494 billion on its nuclear forces over the next decade or about $50 billion per year. Over the next three decades nuclear weapons modernization plans could cost as much as $1.5-$2 trillion.

This total includes investment in a $100 billion Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) a land-based nuclear missile which is slated to replace the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).

Manufactured by Northrop Grumman under a $13 billion contract—with assistance from other major defense contractors like Bechtel Honeywell General Dynamics Lockheed Martin L3 Harris and Textron—the GBSD is supposed to be made operational by 2029

The U.S. Air Force plans to order more than 600 of them.

Elizabeth Eaves characterized the GBSD in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as a “new weapon of mass destruction the length of a bowling lane which will be able to travel some 6000 miles carrying a warhead more than 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.”

The human tragedy associated with the development of the GBSD is compounded by the fact that military experts believe it will not actually enhance U.S. national security.

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015 that getting rid of America’s land-based nuclear missiles would “reduce the false alarm danger.”

Like its predecessor the Minuteman III the GBSD is designed to be activated in the face of a Russian nuclear attack.

The computer systems that warn of such incoming fire may be vulnerable to hacking and false alarms.

During the Cold War military computer glitches caused numerous close calls.

President Biden has in the past supported arms control and nuclear weapons reduction treaties.

In 1988 he helped negotiate ratification of the Inter-Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed between Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan which required the U.S. and USSR to eliminate and permanently forswear all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5500 kilometers.

More recently though Biden has taken a hard line against both Russia and China whose supposed existential threats to U.S. interests has provided a basis for the massive government investment in nuclear weapons.

In an op-ed published during the presidential campaign Biden supported a no first-use policy for nuclear weapons  and wrote inthat the purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterrence—and if necessary retaliating against attack

The Democratic Party’s platform adopted at the July 2020 convention called Donald Trump’s proposal for new nuclear weapons “unnecessary wasteful and indefensible.”

So far however Biden’s top Pentagon nominees have publicly backed all three legs of the nuclear triad—including the land-based missiles.

A major factor inhibiting the prospects for disarmament is the clout of defense contractors like Northrop Grumman which spent more than $12 million in lobbying in 2020 and provided Biden with $403072 during the 2020 election campaign.

Last July when Ro Khanna (D-CA) proposed an amendment that would transfer $1 billion or one percent of the GBSD’s projected cost into a pandemic preparedness fund  the amendment was voted down and Khanna was accused by Liz Cheney (R-WY) of playing into the hands of China which according to Cheney had caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cheney represents the district encompassing Cheyenne Wyoming which is home to the F.E. Warren Air Force Base where the GBSD will be based.

The city and surrounding region anticipate a major economic windfall from the GBSD.

In 2018 Cheney received $12000 from Northrop Grumman-affiliated Political Action Committees (PACs) and $10000 in 2020.(1)

Northrop donated money to congressional candidates in all the six states— Utah Wyoming Colorado Nebraska Montana and North Dakota —which would be beneficiaries of the new missile.

Polling data indicates that public support for developing nuclear weapons is lukewarm at best.

The freeze movement was a large-scale grassroots movement that promoted a reduction and ultimately elimination of nuclear weapons.

Placing a strong emphasis on grass-roots education it helped lay the groundwork for the INF Treaty which the Trump administration repealed in 2019.

At a zoom conference on Wednesday February 24th sponsored by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Katrina Vanden Heuval publisher of The Nation Magazine suggested that disarmament advocates should link up with the climate change movement which has generated a lot of enthusiasm.

Zach Lowe thinks not,"In each of the last eight years James Harden has been in the top 10 of MVP voting in the NBA including the last four in the top three. For the record he’s finished third second first second ninth second fifth and eighth. It’s an extraordinary run and it’s likely to continue this year.

Zach Lowe wrote Friday about Harden’s candidacy in 2020-21. He doesn’t think the Nets point guard will win (or should) despite averaging 25.3 points 11.2 assists 8.8 rebounds in 38.4 minutes since joining the Nets. For the season including his eight games with Houston the 31-year-old leads the league in assists and minutes per game.

Lowe thinks Harden’s “narrative” will sink him ... as will the competition which is very strong this season ... and as he writes “divisive.”

[T]he voters — about 100 media members — are people not robots. We are stricken with cognitive ticks that muddy any attempt at compartmentalization. Nagging thoughts about narrative and legacy and past and future performance figured to play an outsized role this season even before Brooklyn Nets guard James Harden entered the picture as one of the most unconventional MVP candidates in league history.

Why “unconventional?” Because no player who ever forced himself out of an unhappy situation has ever won.

The introduction of Harden is an interesting variable. No player has ever won MVP after being traded during that season. Five players have won in their first season with a particular team: Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld as rookies and then four veterans who won it after offseason trades.

There’s also the manner in which Harden departed Houston —the strip clubs the honey buns the press conference dissing his team’s chemistry (which turned out to be prophetic) and the perception that he was dogging it to get out of Houston and into Brooklyn.

[T]he barrier to winning his second MVP should be very high for Harden considering the nature of his exit from the Houston Rockets. The eight games he played there constitute 11% of this season — a non-trivial share. They will constitute an even greater percentage of Harden’s individual season because he has missed a few games He put up numbers in those eight games but if you watched them you know Harden was disengaged. Opponents outscored the Rockets by 6.6 points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor during his final Houston stretch — and won the minutes Harden rested by almost the same amount per NBA.com. You can’t erase that from his candidacy for an award based on play in this particular season.

He also suggests that while Harden “has been brilliant as a Net” he hasn’t been that good (!) good enough to warrant his MVP vote. Lowe is indeed one of the 100 media voters.

The Nets have outscored opponents by six points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor — good but not incredible. They are about even in the 308 minutes Harden has played without both Irving and Durant according to NBA.com. Harden has done a nice job carrying Brooklyn bench units. Steve Nash has entrusted Harden with the most solo minutes among his three stars and Harden is maybe the best equipped among them to thrive in those situations.

What Lowe doesn’t write about in his lengthy discussion of MVP voting is Harden’s leadership and accountability which former ESPN colleague Mike Mazzeo wrote about this week. Harden wasn’t exaggerating when in his first press conference described himself as an “elite player elite teammate and elite leader.” He’s been all three.

Lowe also admits things could change. IF Joel Embiid misses significant time due to his hyperextended knee night that “may crack the door slightly” for him. Similarly if Kevin Durant is waylaid longer than expected with his hamstring strain that could help his candidacy. (Perish the thought!) Still Lowe thinks Nikola Jokic LeBron James and Embiid have better resumes’. Lowe doesn’t compare Brooklyn’s record with KD out to the Lakers record without AD Anthony Davis. He certainly should.

It’s no secret that Harden has been miffed in the past believing he should’ve won more than one MVP. He also seems to understand that just playing in New York has helped his reputation noting last week that his leadership — and other aspects of his game — are “the same” but “It’s just I get credit now and previously I wasn’t getting credit. Same leadership. I’ve been the same person and haven’t changed not one bit.”

Back in 2002 Jason Kidd faced somewhat similar circumstances. He had a LOT of baggage from his time in Phoenix and his statistics weren’t as good as eventual MVP Tim Duncan’s —he shot only 39 percent that season as Lowe notes— but he led the previously woeful Nets to 52 wins twice the number they won the year before with essentially the same young cast. That would seem to be the very definition of “valuable.”

The second half of the season of course has only just begun and the debate will be enhanced with each week leading up to the playoffs. Harden may not win. Durant may not win. Irving may not win. Still it has to be edifying for the Nets front office that “MVP” chants are worthy for any of their “Big Three!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc25sLWNocmlzLWZhcmxleS1kYXZpZC1zcGFkZS1maWdodC1vdmVyLXJvYi1sb3dlLXRvbW15LWJveS5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'SNL' Alums Chris Farley and David Spade Got in a Fight Over Rob Lowe on the 'Tommy Boy' Set,"SNL stars and friends Chris Farley and David Spade got into a huge fight while filming Tommy Boy. Rob Lowe was the reason behind the friction it turned out as Farley was jealous that Spade hung out with the handsome actor.

Chris Farley and David Spade were close friends who worked together on Saturday Night Live and in movies but there was a moment when the two SNL alums got in a dustup over one of their co-stars — Rob Lowe. Spade recalled the time he and his SNL co-star got in an actual fight on set.

There was some friction on the set of ‘Tommy Boy’

During a 2015 appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden David Spade and Rob Lowe reminisced about working together on the movie Tommy Boy.

Lowe confirmed that Spade and Farley “fought over me like I was a chick.” He added “They’d be like ‘I was in the jacuzzi with him last night.’”

Spade recalled how Farley had been sick on the plane when they were on their way to film on set so he decided to rest because he didn’t feel well.

Spade called Lowe to hang out and the next day Farley was clearly upset with Spade saying there was “trouble’s brewing” with his co-star’s vibe.

Former ‘SNL’ stars Chris Farley and David Spade fought while filming ‘Tommy Boy’

During the Aug. 5 2020 Literally! With Rob Lowe podcast Spade shared more of the story noting how made Farley got at him because he was hanging out with Lowe.

Spade and Lowe got a drink together and didn’t invite Farley because he was sick. “We don’t tell Farley of course we don’t! We see him every goddamn f*cking day” Spade explained.

But when he saw Farley the next day it was clear that he was upset about something. Spade noted that he was “biting his lip which is about to have a fight. That’s his tell” he explained.

Spade continued “And he looks at me and he goes ‘How was your night?… How’s Rob Lowe?… Where’s your f*cking precious Rob Lowe?’”

Farley asked him “How was drinks last night?” and Spade responded “Oh is that what we’re getting at? It was alright.”

Things didn’t end there however as Farley stomped on Spade’s lunch and his hand “with his big f*cking boots with all his thousands of pounds” the actor noted. Then Spade threw his drink at Farley which kicked off a full-on fight and Farley pushed Spade down some stairs.

“I stand up and say ‘Are we in a fight?’” Spade recalled saying. Thankfully they were able to work through things quickly and get back to work.

Rob Lowe revealed a little known fact about ‘Tommy Boy’

Interestingly even though Lowe was a big part of Tommy Boy he wasn’t credited in the film. “That’s right” he told Corden when reminded that he doesn’t have a credit for the movie.

“The original concept that Lorne Michaels had was it was going to be Farley and I as brothers … no David Spade involved” Lowe explained. “And then so one thing lead to another and it shifted focus to these two guys and I was like ‘Well let me just be a happy surprise.’”

“It’s a little known fact that my name appears nowhere” he added."

Michael Middleton has been appointed as the new site manager the company said in a statement Thursday.

He replaces Alicia Matus who recently was tapped as Lyondellbasell’s new director of Global Operational Excellence Process Safety and Quality. Matus will work both at the corporate headquarters in Houston and in Corpus Christi.

Middleton has nearly three decades of experience in petrochemical manufacturing and has worked for LyondellBasell and its predecessor Equistar for the past 27 years.

LyondellBasell’s Corpus Christi Complex is located in northwest Corpus Christi between Interstate 37 and Highway 44 and has roughly 370 employees and contractors.

The 2500-acre plant is responsible for producing ethylene and propylene. Both materials that are key to making items such as food packaging automotive parts construction and roofing materials and large household appliances.

Middleton has worked in other roles within the company include operations engineering and maintenance management. Middleton who is originally from Tuscola Illinois earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1993.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

The Chicago Blackhawks completed a big piece of their offseason when they re-signed Alex Vlasic in late April. Their next steps will likely be decided by Tuesday’s NHL Draft Lottery.

If the Blackhawks win the lottery again and pick first they’ll undoubtedly take Macklin Celebrini. Like with Connor Bedard Celebrini would be expected to be in the Blackhawks’ lineup next season which would impact how Chicago approaches free agency.

Finishing second third or fourth in the lottery would also alter the Blackhawks’ roster-building and their approach this summer.

There will certainly be more news to come after Tuesday but here’s what I’m hearing about the Blackhawks heading into the draft lottery.

Things could change over the next month and a half but I don’t think Scott Wheeler’s top three draft prospects in his latest rankings are far off the Blackhawks’ thinking.

Celebrini will go No. 1 regardless of team. From there it probably depends on the situation. Wheeler has winger Ivan Demidov at No. 2 and defenseman Artyom Levshunov at No. 3. I’m not sure what order the Blackhawks have them but Demidov and Levshunov are definitely in that conversation.

If you missed it I wrote scouting reports on all three players. You can read them here:

The Blackhawks are hoping to get the first second or third pick. If they end up at No. 4 there are a lot more possibilities. The Blackhawks are scheduled to have their amateur scouting meetings next week so there could be plenty to discuss.

The Blackhawks will have a chance to see and talk to Demidov in person in June when his agent Dan Milstein brings him and some other clients to Florida for a multi-day camp. Demidov and other KHL players will not attend the NHL’s scouting combine in Buffalo N.Y.

Demidov’s season was cut short due to a knee injury. Milstein said Monday that Demidov doesn’t require surgery for the injury and should be fully recovered in 6-8 weeks.

I’ve received some questions about whether the Blackhawks can win the lottery again going forward. I went to the NHL for clarity on it and was told that beginning in 2022 no team can advance in the draft order by winning a lottery draw more than twice in five years.

For example the Blackhawks won the lottery last year by moving up two spots. If they win the lottery for the No. 1 pick again this year that would exclude them from moving up in the draft order until 2028.

But that doesn’t stop them from keeping their draft position.

As it reads in the NHL lottery rules: “This limitation will not affect a Club’s ability to retain its presumptive Draft position in any Draft Lottery nor would it preclude the possibility of the Club moving down in Draft Order to the extent other Clubs advance by reason of winning the Lottery Draws.”

I asked for clarity on that too just to make sure I was getting it right. If a team finishes in 32nd place its “presumptive” draft position is first. So if a team finished in 32nd for five consecutive years it could have the first pick for five consecutive years. The Blackhawks’ presumptive position this year is second so that five-year window only comes into play if it wins the lottery for No. 1.

The Blackhawks already know where one of their first-round picks will be. With the Vegas Golden Knights being eliminated from the playoffs on Sunday the Golden Knights will have the 19th pick in June’s draft and the Blackhawks will be selecting 20th with the Tampa Bay Lightning’s first-round pick.

If the Blackhawks don’t win the lottery I think they will likely pursue a second-line center this offseason. The Blackhawks want to be more competitive next season and bolster their top six. That includes adding another center taking some of the burden off Bedard and aligning Jason Dickinson with more of a third-line role.

Frank Nazar will be in the mix for a roster spot out of camp but there’s no guarantee he’ll win it. It wouldn’t be surprising if he spent at least part of next season with the AHL Rockford IceHogs. The same could go for Landon Slaggert. And if Nazar and/or Slaggert show they’re ready the Blackhawks will still have a few roster spots with flexibility. Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson has also promised true competition which would mean sitting veterans for young players if warranted.

All that said going to Rockford shouldn’t be seen as a negative. The Blackhawks won’t likely move most of their incoming prospects to the NHL as fast as they did with Bedard and Kevin Korchinski. They don’t want to be a developmental team in the NHL. The big-league team might be used to gauge where a player is at and there will certainly be a learning curve at the NHL level for all young players but the Blackhawks would prefer to utilize the IceHogs to prepare players.

Blackhawks prospect Roman Kantserov recently underwent left shoulder surgery after his KHL season ended. He originally injured the shoulder in December and re-aggravated it late in the season. He was in communication with the Blackhawks throughout the process.

Kantserov a Blackhawks’ 2023 second-round pick and Metallurg recently won the KHL’s Gagarin Cup. He had four goals and nine assists in 23 playoff games.

Vlasic’s contract extension was one of those rare deals where both sides were pleased with the result.

The Blackhawks would have loved a little longer contract but they were satisfied with the salary cap number and getting as much term as they did.

As for Vlasic he would have been rolling the dice if he went to arbitration. He probably would have gotten less on a two-year deal from arbitration and had to wait to get paid after that contract expired. With this he gets paid well throughout the six years and the contract is also frontloaded to make some more money early in his career.

With the IceHogs’ season ending on Sunday Lukas Reichel might be another Blackhawks player attending the upcoming World Championship in Czechia. Reichel has been invited by Germany.

When a raging snowstorm and frigid temperatures hit Texas last month oil and gas behemoths responsible for producing and processing the lion share of the nation's reserves including Exxon  Occidental and Marathon Petroleum  shut down production at oil wells and refineries across the state. For many oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico the shutdown put upstream and downstream operations in a squeeze. Downstream multiple refining operations flared during shutdowns releasing air pollutants from processing units. Upstream as oil drilling came back online there was risk of needing to flare or halt oil production in the field until the broader energy market including refining and utility generation stabilized. Indeed satellite imagery showed increased flaring at oil and gas production sites in the Permian Basin did take place according to the Environmental Defense Fund. But at Occidental a choice was made to shut down some operations. ""There were a couple of plants that had difficulty coming back online"" Occidental's CEO Vicki Hollub said during a recent CNBC Evolve event focused on energy innovation. ""We could have put our production back online and just flared the gas. We chose not to do that. We left the production shut down because we didn't want to flare."" The decisions made during the Texas power crisis are part of a broader debate with the oil and gas industry over flaring the process of releasing greenhouse gas emissions through burning which has long been a controversial topic for environmental advocates and climate policy experts. The practice which is commonly used by oil and gas companies to relieve the pressure that builds up during oil production is responsible for releasing CO2 and methane into the atmosphere.

A more ambitious Big Oil goal

The flaring issue is a global one. According to the World Bank Group global gas flares burn approximately 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas every year emitting more than 400 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. Seventy-seven endorsers encompassing governments and oil companies around the world have signed onto the organization's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative which aims to eliminate all routine flaring within the next decade. While flaring is often used in cases where there's safety concerns or maintenance issues routine flaring means the flaring of gas associated with oil production. Several big oil and gas companies including Occidental Chevron and Shell have signed onto the pact. Zubin Bamji program manager of the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership said reducing gas flaring is attainable for many of these companies and is a ""low-hanging fruit"" among other methods to reduce emissions. Some experts say U.S. companies specifically need a more ambitious goal toward stopping routine flaring. The World Bank agreement focuses predominantly on reducing emissions in countries lacking the regulatory capacity and the infrastructure but some experts say U.S. companies can accomplish the feat by 2025. ""Here in Texas we're talking about a 100-year-old basin"" said Colin Leyden the director of regulatory and legislative affairs the Environmental Defense Fund. ""2030 works on the global framework but it lacks ambition domestically here in the U.S."" But flaring often remains a cheaper alternative to pushing the gas to market and flaring often comes down to the fundamentals of supply and demand.

Alternatives to flaring

The process of halting routine flaring by methods such as rewiring gas for electricity or internal uses isn't difficult in and of itself says Gunnar Schade an atmospheric scientist and associate professor at Texas A&M University who has written extensively on the topic. The technology is there it's a question of whether the companies want to make the investment and put in the money. Occidental's New Mexico operations now use a gas gathering system linked to third-party capacity and pipeline supply arrangements which it says reduced 2019 annual carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) flaring emissions by more than 60% versus what would have been emitted otherwise and that can be used in other upstream oil and gas projects to reduce flaring the company said in an annual climate report. As one recent report on flaring stated ""If most associated gas goes to sales the dilemma about how to manage it becomes largely moot."" Getting natural gas out of the Permian Basin to market is the preferred solution of the industry but the natural gas market has been marked by oversupply and low prices for years and for many companies the economic analysis does not favor a major change in current operations. There are onsite solutions that could become scalable. Some alternatives include building pipelines to pump gas back into businesses for heat and electricity or the implementation of vapor recovery units which can collect vapors and reduce emissions. ""The important thing to realize here is that stopping entails investments because flaring is free you don't have to pay anything for it the atmosphere is a free sewer"" Schade said.

Renewed focus on climate change

If natural gas prices were higher on a consistent basis the flaring issue would not be as significant Leyden says but with a long-term low-price outlook for natural gas a new regulatory framework to realign incentives is needed. Flaring is currently legal meaning regulatory policies that encourage using gas for other purposes are required. Some states are making progress. New Mexico recently began debating a bill to manage flaring and venting while advocacy groups and legislatures in Texas are slated to debate two bills which target the practice one of which would put a 25% tax on gas vented or flared while extracting oil. Typically flaring involves burning off the gas atop a large tower or stack. It's often used when oil companies lack facilities or markets available for the leftover gas. While the practice may be more environmentally friendly than venting a process which releases natural gas straight into the atmosphere it's still a key source of methane CO2 and emissions of other problematic compounds which can have drastic effects on human health. Technological advancements over the years have streamlined the process of flaring and its efficiency but organizations still say the practice is responsible for a large portion of emissions. According to data from The World Bank between 2014 and 2018 the United States ranked among the top five flaring countries globally behind Russia Iraq and Iran. In recent years oil giants have increased focus on emissions reduction including Exxon which plans to cut methane emissions by 40% to 50% and flaring by 35% to 45% by 2025. British oil giant BP and Royal Dutch Shell outlined plans toward net zero emissions by 2050. An end to routine flaring is part of these commitments but the companies need to take the expensive steps now to reengineer their operations. ""There are a lot of different options out there but the problem is they all come with a cost"" Leyden said. ""As long as flaring is an option because of a loose regulatory framework it's going to be difficult for these options to catch on."" Occidental was the first U.S. oil company to sign onto the World Bank no flaring policy by 2030.

Texas energy crisis and new policy

Amid the Texas crisis companies struggled to procure sources of power generations like natural gas yet at the same time companies continued to burn it off as natural gas and electricity prices rose an issue that left some consumers and industry critics dumbfounded. ""I can tell you we have flared in the past we also have to flare sometimes when third party plants go down but what we're trying best to do is minimize that"" Hollub said at the recent CNBC Evolve event. Many oil and gas companies like Occidental are more sensitive to the environmental issues at the forefront of investor efforts. The world's largest money manager BlackRock  will require companies it invests in to disclose direct emissions. Earlier this year President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement calling on agencies to review and reinstate regulations dismissed under the Trump administration. ""I would much rather have us business do it ourselves and that's one of my big cries out in this letter: we need to do it ourselves before the government does it for us"" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in a CNBC interview earlier this year after releasing the company's 2021 letter to CEOs which called for more climate change disclosure from companies. ""We've had a lack of oversight on oil and gas"" Leyden said. The Railroad Commission of Texas which has jurisdiction over the industry's operations but has not in the past cracked down on it has recently moved to take a closer look as investors and legislators place more attention on the issue. The recent energy crisis could be a turning point for the self-regulation approach in the state. ""The large amounts of flaring are a microcosm of what can result from self regulation"" Leyden said. ""The investment community is lining up around 2025. It has to happen rapidly. 2030 that's a decade out and this is one of the easier things they can do from a policy standpoint."" The scale of flaring in the Permian is significant. New markets — and costs such as taxes on flaring or strict permitting requirements for new wells — could incentivize companies to see the economics of flaring differently combined with the investor focus on ESG. ""If you have a policy that says we won't tolerate routine flaring that you can't bring an oil well online can't start pumping until you have destination for the gas that will change the economics around midstream as well and increase the need to invest in the infrastructure"" Leyden said. A 2019 analysis from the Baker Institute at Rice University noted that if all flared or vented gas in the Permian was captured and liquefied it could fill a Q-Max LNG carrier (the world's largest carrier size) every 10 days. The report added ""If that vessel went to China and discharged its cargo into a power plant it could likely displace approximately 440 thousand tonnes of coal burned to generate electricity."" ""Every company that has operations with flaring is now under pressure ... not just pressure from shareholders and employees but the entire world to reduce flaring and I don't see that focus and pressure letting off"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's U.S. oil gas and chemicals sector.

By the following evening 307 signatures were in hand a solid start toward the goal of 1500 nearly double the 800 the state requires.

Campaign teams talked to workers on their doorsteps in nine cities and towns across New Jersey. Kuniansky a Walmart deli worker knocked on the door of David Roldan in Carteret who is on medical leave from his job at an Amazon warehouse. Amazon bosses don’t provide sufficient training to forklift drivers. “So of course there’s accidents all the time. They always come up with ways to blame the worker” Roldan said.

“Workers need to control production in the factories and the warehouses where we work” Kuniansky said. “We’re the only ones who will prioritize our safety and the safety of the communities nearby over the profits of the bosses.”

Roldan had heard about the efforts of workers at the Amazon distribution center in Bessemer Alabama to establish a union. “I used to work at a grocery store with a union” he said. “So I know how much better that can be even if the union isn’t perfect.”

When Kuniansky said that it would boost the union drive in Bessemer to get support from Amazon workers in New Jersey Roldan said he would talk to some of his co-workers about sending support. He bought a copy of the Militant and signed to get Kuniansky on the ballot.

Schoolteacher Miguel Fernandez told SWP campaigner Terry Evans that “safety should be the number one concern for all workers” and that “schools should not be reopened” when Evans knocked on his door in Belleville.

“The only way to fight effectively for safer working conditions in schools or any workplace is by organizing together with fellow workers to stand up to the bosses” Evans replied. “To do that workers need to be at work.” Fernandez didn’t agree but signed the petition.

A highlight of the weekend was a March 6 campaign rally attended by 39 people. John Studer the party’s national campaign director introduced Kuniansky Wagner and the party’s candidates in New York City: Róger Calero for mayor Willie Cotton for public advocate and Sara Lobman for Manhattan Borough president.

“Our candidates take our campaign to struggles by working people building support for them” Studer said. “We explain the stakes in the Amazon union drive the lockout at Marathon Petroleum in Minnesota and the fight by Steelworkers for a new contract with Allegheny Technologies.” Workers were locked out by ATI for seven months in 2015-16 as they fought boss attacks on wages and working conditions. Now they’re fighting for another agreement in the midst of company moves to shut down some union-organized plants and expand nonunion plants in North Carolina.

“The party has run in every presidential race since 1948 and fights to be on the ballot everywhere we can” Studer said. “We’ve already been certified for the ballot this year for City Council elections in Dallas and Lincoln Nebraska. Getting on the ballot helps to get the party known among larger numbers of workers as well as winning some protection against government interference.”

Studer pointed to the ruling in the SWP’s successful lawsuit in the 1970s against FBI spying and disruption of the party. “Federal Judge Thomas Griesa noted the serious efforts the party makes to get on the ballot” Studer said.

The launching of the New Jersey campaign has already received coverage in Insider NJ and the New Jersey Globe news websites.

Kuniansky read a message that Tetri Boodhoo one of her Walmart co-workers sent to Amazon workers in Bessemer.

“We work at Walmart in Secaucus New Jersey and are with you all the way” Boodhoo wrote. “From my husband who works at Amazon here I hear they treat you like a robot. He works 10-hour shifts with only 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute breaks. We also need a union at Walmart. That is why I want to say with all my heart that I want you to win!”

Profit drive causes Texas disaster

Kuniansky was an oil worker in Houston in 1987 when there was a leak of hydrofluoric acid at the Marathon oil refinery in Texas City Texas. Thousands were evacuated and over 800 treated at local hospitals. This is a key safety issue in the Marathon bosses’ lockout of refinery workers in Minnesota today. It was members of the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the refinery who spoke out against the bosses’ lies.

“That experience stuck with me” Kuniansky said. “It showed why workers need to fight to wrest control of production out of the hands of the bosses.

“No one can deny that the catastrophe facing working people in Texas and nearby states today is man-made” Wagner told the rally referring to the refusal of power companies to sacrifice profits to install protection against subfreezing temperatures.

“While the politicians on different sides of the climate-change debate point fingers at each other the truth is that wind and solar or coal gas and nuclear power are produced under capitalism with one thing in mind — the profits of big business.”

The SWP calls for workers and our unions to “fight for an immediate massive public works program” she said to put millions back to work at union-scale wages repairing damaged houses and replacing worn-out power systems and other infrastructure. We also need to fight to nationalize the energy industry under workers control Wagner said. “Such a course points toward the kind of struggles necessary to lead millions to replace capitalist rule with a workers and farmers government.”

“Nine days ago President Joseph Biden bombed Syria” New York mayoral candidate Róger Calero told the meeting. “Biden’s objective was the same as Donald Trump’s to defend the U.S. capitalist ruling families. The Democrats and Republicans both say their policies are for our country” Calero said “but countries don’t have foreign policies classes do.”

Workers need our own policies on every question at home and abroad Calero said based on support for the struggles of working people.

The process of halting routine flaring by methods such as rewiring gas for electricity or internal uses isn't difficult in and of itself says Gunnar Schade an atmospheric scientist and associate professor at Texas A&M University who has written extensively on the topic. The technology is there it's a question of whether the companies want to make the investment and put in the money. Occidental's New Mexico operations now use a gas gathering system linked to third-party capacity and pipeline supply arrangements which it says reduced 2019 annual carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) flaring emissions by more than 60% versus what would have been emitted otherwise and that can be used in other upstream oil and gas projects to reduce flaring the company said in an annual climate report. As one recent report on flaring stated ""If most associated gas goes to sales the dilemma about how to manage it becomes largely moot."" Getting natural gas out of the Permian Basin to market is the preferred solution of the industry but the natural gas market has been marked by oversupply and low prices for years and for many companies the economic analysis does not favor a major change in current operations. There are onsite solutions that could become scalable. Some alternatives include building pipelines to pump gas back into businesses for heat and electricity or the implementation of vapor recovery units which can collect vapors and reduce emissions. ""The important thing to realize here is that stopping entails investments because flaring is free you don't have to pay anything for it the atmosphere is a free sewer"" Schade said.

Renewed focus on climate change

If natural gas prices were higher on a consistent basis the flaring issue would not be as significant Leyden says but with a long-term low-price outlook for natural gas a new regulatory framework to realign incentives is needed. Flaring is currently legal meaning regulatory policies that encourage using gas for other purposes are required. Some states are making progress. New Mexico recently began debating a bill to manage flaring and venting while advocacy groups and legislatures in Texas are slated to debate two bills which target the practice one of which would put a 25% tax on gas vented or flared while extracting oil. Typically flaring involves burning off the gas atop a large tower or stack. It's often used when oil companies lack facilities or markets available for the leftover gas. While the practice may be more environmentally friendly than venting a process which releases natural gas straight into the atmosphere it's still a key source of methane CO2 and emissions of other problematic compounds which can have drastic effects on human health. Technological advancements over the years have streamlined the process of flaring and its efficiency but organizations still say the practice is responsible for a large portion of emissions. According to data from The World Bank between 2014 and 2018 the United States ranked among the top five flaring countries globally behind Russia Iraq and Iran. In recent years oil giants have increased focus on emissions reduction including Exxon which plans to cut methane emissions by 40% to 50% and flaring by 35% to 45% by 2025. British oil giant BP and Royal Dutch Shell outlined plans toward net zero emissions by 2050. An end to routine flaring is part of these commitments but the companies need to take the expensive steps now to reengineer their operations. ""There are a lot of different options out there but the problem is they all come with a cost"" Leyden said. ""As long as flaring is an option because of a loose regulatory framework it's going to be difficult for these options to catch on."" Occidental was the first U.S. oil company to sign onto the World Bank no flaring policy by 2030.

Texas energy crisis and new policy

Amid the Texas crisis companies struggled to procure sources of power generations like natural gas yet at the same time companies continued to burn it off as natural gas and electricity prices rose an issue that left some consumers and industry critics dumbfounded. ""I can tell you we have flared in the past we also have to flare sometimes when third party plants go down but what we're trying best to do is minimize that"" Hollub said at the recent CNBC Evolve event. Many oil and gas companies like Occidental are more sensitive to the environmental issues at the forefront of investor efforts. The world's largest money manager BlackRock  will require companies it invests in to disclose direct emissions. Earlier this year President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement calling on agencies to review and reinstate regulations dismissed under the Trump administration. ""I would much rather have us business do it ourselves and that's one of my big cries out in this letter: we need to do it ourselves before the government does it for us"" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in a CNBC interview earlier this year after releasing the company's 2021 letter to CEOs which called for more climate change disclosure from companies. ""We've had a lack of oversight on oil and gas"" Leyden said. The Railroad Commission of Texas which has jurisdiction over the industry's operations but has not in the past cracked down on it has recently moved to take a closer look as investors and legislators place more attention on the issue. The recent energy crisis could be a turning point for the self-regulation approach in the state. ""The large amounts of flaring are a microcosm of what can result from self regulation"" Leyden said. ""The investment community is lining up around 2025. It has to happen rapidly. 2030 that's a decade out and this is one of the easier things they can do from a policy standpoint."" The scale of flaring in the Permian is significant. New markets — and costs such as taxes on flaring or strict permitting requirements for new wells — could incentivize companies to see the economics of flaring differently combined with the investor focus on ESG. ""If you have a policy that says we won't tolerate routine flaring that you can't bring an oil well online can't start pumping until you have destination for the gas that will change the economics around midstream as well and increase the need to invest in the infrastructure"" Leyden said. A 2019 analysis from the Baker Institute at Rice University noted that if all flared or vented gas in the Permian was captured and liquefied it could fill a Q-Max LNG carrier (the world's largest carrier size) every 10 days. The report added ""If that vessel went to China and discharged its cargo into a power plant it could likely displace approximately 440 thousand tonnes of coal burned to generate electricity."" ""Every company that has operations with flaring is now under pressure ... not just pressure from shareholders and employees but the entire world to reduce flaring and I don't see that focus and pressure letting off"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's U.S. oil gas and chemicals sector.

“The issue of raising quality in short-term rentals is a fundamental one for our industry. It is so closely tied with raising standards trust guest experiences and professionalism. It’s an issue that each individual manager or host can’t ignore – nor us collectively as an industry. Many managers are already excelling in this area but for some there is still a long way to go.”

– Jeremy Gall Founder & CEO of Breezeway

Wait. Some of the most desirable vacation rental home destinations’ lure is their unique qualities. From accommodations to appointments to service what one brand or property does often is what sets it apart from the competition.

However with increasing traveler demand vacation rental operators – from boutique styled properties to larger global chains – are exploring the value that could come with setting standardization for pricing marketing operations and cleanliness.

Merilee Karr of UnderTheDoormat and Travis Riner of Homes & Villas by Marriott International offered their views on management standards during a conversation with AJL Atelier’s Simon Lehmann at Breezeway’s Elevate Operations Summit virtual event March 10-11.

“Our rental industry has been around for several decades much longer than the past 10 years when Airbnb first came on the scene” Karr said. “Professionally managed vacation rentals have existed since the 1950s but it was after the global financial crisis that the sharing economy and peer-to-peer homes managed by individuals really began to grow.”

Karr said the beauty of the industry is that it provides authentic stays. Keeping choice for consumers is very important. “I am really encouraged by companies such as Marriott entering the market and promoting standards in our industry because it is something that I am passionate about. It’s part of what we have sought to deliver at UnderTheDoormat since we began our business in 2014” she said.

“Back then having standards wasn’t something the industry had really identified or understood but I knew eventually everyone in the industry would embrace this as the industry grows and consumers demand the highest quality.”

Homes & Villas by Marriott International began in spring 2019 as a high-quality alternative to rental homes in markets that might not be ideal for hotel placements.

“Some markets just don’t support hotels” Riner said. “They are too seasonal or the homes there are too established so it doesn’t make sense to put a hotel there. When guests are using their [Marriott rewards program] Bonvoy points they expect a Marriott-level experience. This is an opportunity for us to provide that kind of service in a vacation rental.”

Riner said the unique brands within Marriott are not intended to squash any of the authenticity that comes with the homes or the neighborhoods in great destination vacation venue areas. For instance its Autograph Collection does not include any items that are Marriott-branded.

Karr says the industry would thrive with standards rather than standardization.

Finding More Time for Service

For Karr her company’s software Hospiria is a solution for smaller independent property managers and operators of five to 50 properties.

“Many property managers want to (and should) focus on the guest experience but they find themselves wrapped up in the administration of maintaining properties on the platforms managing inquiries or pricing” she said. “It takes all the marketing distribution and technology hassle away from property managers so they can focus on the hospitality experience.”

Some of that could be lost if larger companies buy up smaller ones and standardize operational practices.

“There are occasions when larger companies buy up the smaller companies as they just aren’t able to compete” Karr said. “I want to avoid that because I believe that authenticity is something the travelers want and the local companies who have local knowledge are best able to deliver. We have to avoid becoming standardized and guests getting basically the same experience in London as in Paris as in San Francisco.”

Cleaning House

Given the impression the pandemic has made and continues to make on cleanliness housekeeping has become a hot-button for any type of hospitality. Here standards could be more embraced.

“For us our cleaning standards are more about the outcome of what we want our rooms to be – get it cleaned” Riner said. “And not about you must use these steps at this regularity etc. Cleanliness and safety have moved to the forefront and customers expect the same level they would get when staying at hotels. The goal is to create the illusion to the guest that they are the only one to sleep and shower there.”

In hotels rooms typically are sized between 700 and 900 square feet of space they generally include consistent fixtures and have been maintained by the same housekeeper for years Riner said. Establishing and maintaining standards therefore would be simpler than applying them to the varied floorplans and appointments of vacation rentals.

“Vacation homes have so many more touchpoints for the guest Riner said. “It’s a more challenging job to maintain them and often the place is cleaned by a contracting company where different people service it each time unlike hotels that might have the same housekeeper cleaning the same floor of the same hotel for years.”

Sustaining Industry Growth

Ideally growth comes from a mixture of institutional companies and heart-and-soul owners Karr said.

“Short-term rentals are now commanding similar prices to what 4- or 5-star hotel rooms get” she said. “Many customers see short-term rentals as a safer option than hotels and provide a great experience for families and longer stays so there’s opportunity for our industry to grow as the sector recovers.”

She said a study by STR showed that there is an 11 percent increase in consumer preference by travelers for short-term or vacation homes since the pandemic.

Karr said that when one thinks about how corporations are now using vacation and short-term rentals as an option for their business travelers having standards is even more important.

Art is and has always been an integral part of the identity of hotels. Art at times makes a difference in the customer's mind in choosing the establishment over others. Artwork helps tell a story to guests which in return helps each brand create its own identity and maintain brand standards. Karabi Art Community has been working aggressively with hotels across the globe to help the brand narrating its unique story.Traditionally art was used to create a sense of luxury and distinction but now hotels are being designed specifically to provide guests with a unique experience through art. Karabi Art focuses on the requirements of the clients interior design and architecture of the hotel to create something unique yet merging with the concepts of the hotel.“We are art aficionados in throes of ecstasy and we work by building a concept or storyboard experimenting with different kinds of art giving attention to the local elements of the location defining frames and strategic placement of artworks and sculptures and accessorizing concept and placement” said Punit.V.Sood Co-Founder & Director at Karabi Art Community.With the current number Karabi Art stands at 72 hotel projects to its name. Primarily the company tied up with hotels in India but in recent years since 2016 Karabi Art has managed to bag international projects as well few namely Cape Weligama – Sri Lanka Marriott Weligama – Sri Lanka Intercontinental Muscat – Oman and Marriott Houston Texas – USA.Karabi Art currently has 15 upcoming projects in the pipeline but due to pandemic most of the projects are running delayed and have got pushed by a year and two. “International market looks promising as travel and hospitality as industry and raring to go and surely due for an upward bounce back” Sood added.The art collection at Karabi consists of paintings illustrations prints Mix-Media serigraphs photography pichwais tribal/folk art and all sizes and styles of sculptures. Major USP lies in the materials and local resources.“India is an amazingly talented country of Artisans and Artforms and one look at the expansive list of materials that we work with and exploit to their maximum potential would give you more & more reasons to delve deeper into the sheer range & variety. Karabi boast of mastering different materials as we have worked on projects across categories. As we get involved in a project we research the theme and local sources to get them. Using local artists helps us capture the essence and innocence of the place. We team up with local vendors share our concept and get it developed as per the requirement” Sood further added.Art is now universal global it is for all it is not just confined to luxury Hotels . Non-luxury hotels are in real need of art and Karabi is filling the gap by curating art for the mid-segment hotel ( Holiday Inn ) to luxury hotels like Taj Palace  JW Marriott to business/non-lux hotels like Holiday Inn Express and IBIS Goa & IBIS Chennai. “In the last 5 to 7 years the hospitality point of view has completely changed towards Art for good with Govt. support and mandatory push towards hotels using art all hotels now take” Sood said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhldm9pY2VzbHUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvY2liYy1maXJzdGNhcmliYmVhbnMtbW9uaXF1ZS1mcmVuY2gtd2lucy1wcmVzdGlnaW91cy13ZXF1YWwtYXdhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CIBC FirstCaribbean’s Monique French Wins Prestigious Wequal Award,"Monique French Chief Credit Officer at CIBC FirstCaribbean is the winner of the 2021 WeQual Award.

An official count from the government puts the total death toll at 83150 (as of Feb. 9) which would give China the lowest death rate per capita of any other major country: six deaths per 100000 people compared to the U.S.’s 337 and the U.K.’s 307.

But researchers who have been studying the pandemic say that China has vastly undercounted its deaths from the disease. Reporting from the New York Times rounded up four separate academic studies looking at China’s most recent COVID wave that accelerated after the government relaxed its Zero-COVID restrictions in December. They all pointed to similar results: That wave may have killed between one million and 1.5 million people.

While there is no way to confirm China’s official count researchers say that the way officials counted deaths was incomplete as it only accounted for those who died in the hospital not those who died at home. Noting gaps in the data many epidemiologists such as those from Fudan University in Shanghai developed models based on previous outbreaks to determine how the virus might spread across China’s population.

His book Quantum Marketing: Mastering the New Marketing Mindset for Tomorrow’s Consumers (2021) has been published by HarperCollins Leadership. He describes it as “a playbook written in a conversational tone.” To know more about the man and his insights about marketing read the following excerpts from an exclusive interview.

How did you develop the ‘quantum marketing’ framework described in your book?

This coinage comes from my training as an engineer. When the world became too complex to be understood through classical physics a new paradigm was needed. Quantum physics came into the picture with a radically different approach to match the altered context. Similarly we need to recognize that classical marketing is already beginning to fail and will not be effective in the brave new world ushered in by a plethora of technologies like Artificial Intelligence Augmented Reality Virtual Reality Internet of Things 5G 3D Printing Blockchain Autonomous cars Smart Speakers etc. All these will lead to an unprecedented level of disruption to marketing which cannot be tackled with an incremental approach. What is needed is a quantum leap. This is how I developed the ‘quantum marketing’ framework.

Which aspects of this framework have marketers embraced most readily?

This is a brand new framework and approach which challenges almost every concept theory and practice of classical marketing. Areas like AI smart speakers are already taking root and marketers are realising the impact and preparing for their inevitable role in marketing. Areas like infusing societal good into marketing as an essential ingredient are something that marketers are slowly warming up to. On another count Consumer Privacy is gaining ground – not just from regulatory bodies but also with recent moves from Google and Apple such as elimination of third-party cookies.

Which of your ideas have marketing professionals been most resistant to?

When I say that advertising – the way we know it – is dead marketers feel very uncomfortable. Departing from what they are accustomed to strikes panic. When I say that loyalty as we frame and practise today simply is incorrect that makes many uncomfortable. However they have to grasp the new reality reinvent and reimagine various aspects of marketing.

In your book why do you recommend that CMOs read widely?

Marketing is a confluence of various fields of knowledge including psychology sociology art and aesthetics behavioural economics anthropology communications data analytics technology business finance and so much more. There are rapid developments taking place particularly in the world of science and technology that have a direct bearing on marketing. Those who do not keep abreast of new developments will risk becoming obsolete. Tomorrow is not three or five years away. It is quite literally tomorrow.

Also CEOs and CFOs expect marketers to be able to connect the dots between marketing actions and business outcomes which requires a good level of understanding of various areas and aspects of the business. Marketers need to understand how their business makes money what the drivers of revenues and profitability are – these are the areas along with data analytics that classical marketers have not been most comfortable with. And they need to educate themselves on these.



My mother who passed away at the age of 78 in 2004 has had a profound influence on my life. She always taught me to be fair work hard help people in need and not hurt or harm in situations where I cannot help.

As a very young child maybe I was 5 years old I threw a small stone at a dog just for fun. My mother was aghast. She said “Okay now let me throw the same stone at you.” I was shocked. She said “If you don’t want the stone to be thrown at you because it will give you pain don’t you think the poor dog also felt the pain when you threw the stone at it? Unlike you the dog doesn’t even have a mother or father to protect it.”

That early lesson has stayed with me. There were many such lessons she gave me in a very impactful manner which became a part of my mindset.

What is the worst mistake that brands make while designing their communication?

Brands should not pretend to be what they are not. Messaging that is inauthentic harms the brand rather than helping. Customers can tell when a brand is being opportunistic and jumping into a conversation that they do not really care about.

How do you feel about brands supporting racial justice work and LGBTQ rights?

Consistency matters. Brands must never jump into an issue if they want to only pay lip service and take no real action. Racial justice work and LGBTQ rights are extremely important issues. Brands must get on board knowing that they are going to stay committed and not make sporadic investments or statements based on political correctness.



The first principle for engagement is to check whether there is a positive pay-off for the other party in terms of value excitement surprise or delight. So long as campaigns are proving that positive payoff for consumers and they are responding to it favourably that is engagement. There is a difference between communicating and bombarding them with messages and promotions that are more an intrusion and annoyance.

How can mentoring younger colleagues help leaders update their own learning?

My younger colleagues are digital natives. I have learnt a lot about new technologies while working with them especially Twitter Clubhouse eSports and electronic dance music. Hierarchy is an outdated concept. Each person in the company adds value. A structure is important for organizations but there is no need for anyone to be deferential to hierarchy. Younger colleagues can be valuable teachers in many areas like the ones I just mentioned.

How can Indian CMOs and CCOs incorporate global practices without alienating local customers?

Indian CMOs and CCOs or for that matter any CMOs and CCOs should keep in constant touch with the emerging and best practices campaigns approaches happening elsewhere in the world. They need to figure out which global practices seem to be promising and then adapt them to their own cultural context. Without this sensitivity to the cultural nuances a lift and play approach cannot be successful. The other scenario is the opposite wherein they reject everything that is not invented in India because they think of it as alien and irrelevant.

Even within the context of India itself it is so rich in diversity that the cultural adaptation and tapping into the nuances from one state to another or one region to another is in itself very important. For example what works in Andhra Pradesh may not work in exactly the same way with the same effectiveness in Haryana. In the digital world adapting any message or campaign to almost any degree and variety is quite easy and it is possible to connect with diverse audiences if one is creative and efficient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NjM5MDQwOdIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NjM5MDQwOS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin surges past $60000 for first time,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzA0LzYwMl8zMDU0NzEuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMwNTQ3MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin passes $60000 for first time,"A Bitcoin ATM sign is pictured in a bodega in the Manhattan borough of New York City New York U.S. February 9 2021. REUTERS-Yonhap



Bitcoin passed the $60000 mark for the first time on Saturday with analysts saying the giant US stimulus package helped boost the world's most popular virtual currency on its record-breaking run.



The cryptocurrency hit $60197 at 1234 GMT and continued to hover around $60000 according to the website CoinMarketCap.



Bitcoin has tripled in value over the last three months ― it was worth $20000 in December ― bolstered by increasing backing from corporate heavyweights.



Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said that in recent days ""Bitcoin went up as investors looked to the imminent arrival of stimulus cheques"".



Individuals in the US earning up to $75000 will receive a cheque for $1400 from this weekend after President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan into law this week.



Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise since March last year when it stood at $5000 spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would allow account holders to use cryptocurrency.



Last month Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the virtual unit while Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and rap mogul Jay-Z said they are creating a fund aimed at making Bitcoin ""the internet's currency"".



Others jumping on the bandwagon include Wall Street player BNY Mellon investment fund giant BlackRock and credit card titan Mastercard.



Bitcoin which was launched back in 2009 hit the headlines in 2017 after soaring from less than $1000 in January to almost $20000 in December of the same year.



The virtual bubble then burst in subsequent days with bitcoin's value fluctuating wildly before sinking below $5000 by October 2018.



However the last year's rise has been more steady with investors and Wall Street finance giants wooed by dizzying growth the opportunity for profit and asset diversification and a safe store of value to guard against inflation.



Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.



The system requires massive computer processing power in order to manage and implement transactions.



That power is provided by ""miners"" who do so in the hope they will receive new bitcoins for validating transaction data. (AFP)

At the 2020 Grammy Awards the teenage singer — along with her producer and collaborator brother Finneas O’Connell — took home several golden gramophones.

Finneas O’Connell is a musician just like his sister Billie Eilish

As a musician Finneas O’Connell goes by the singular name FINNEAS. Both he and his sister are the children of actor and screenwriter Maggie Baird and Finneas first emerged on the scene a decade ago — not as a musician but as an actor.

O’Connell starred alongside Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher and his own mother in the 2013 indie flick Life Inside Out. The years after that he had brief stints on TV shows including Modern Family Glee and Aquarius.

O’Connell stepped back from acting and began to pursue a music career in the mid-2010s. He produced and co-wrote Eilish’s smash 2019 album When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? and later that year he released his debut solo EP titled Blood Harmony.

O’Connell has also worked as a producer and songwriter for the likes of Selena Gomez Justin Bieber Halsey and more.

Finneas O’Connell has won several Grammy Awards

At the 2020 Grammy Awards Eilish became only the second artist in history and youngest person ever to sweep the four major categories: Best New Artist Song of the Year and Record of the Year for her number-one single “bad guy” and Album of the Year for When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? The album also took home the prize for Best Pop Vocal Album.

O’Connell shared four of those wins with his sister as well as two wins of his own for Best Engineered Album Non-Classical and Producer of the Year Non-Classical.

In 2021 O’Connell is up for three more Grammy Awards shared with his sister: “No Time to Die” for Best Song Written For Visual Media and “Everything I Wanted” for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.

In just a few short years Finneas O’Connell has accomplished things that many artists dream of. He’s now a full-fledged musician with several accolades under his belt at just 23 years old and his career is only just beginning.

In the futurist law now named after him the late Stanford University computer scientist Roy Amara once declared “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”India’s public digital infrastructure — in many ways an immense online bureaucracy — is an outlier to this principle. The effort was written-off in the short run but less than a decade after it was introduced it has mobilized technology at the grass-roots tapping into the country’s huge domestic potential. India is now ready to share its experience with the developing world.The system — built on a unique 12-digit identification code for each Indian resident — has significantly improved financial inclusion access to public documents and services tax compliance retail payments and the management of government subsidies. The key has been the Aadhaar card – the national identity document. Aadhaar was launched in 2009 by the government of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. To run the program he roped in Nandan Nilekani  a veteran of Infosys the country’s homegrown technology giant. It was an ambitious attempt to reach and electronically organize the more than 1.3-billion people living in India’s sprawling varied and sometimes inaccessible territory.While questions were raised about privacy issues Aadhaar was cleared by the Indian Supreme Court for opt-in use in September 2018; a larger bench of judges affirmed the decision in January 2021. Today most of India has chosen to join the biometric data system: there are 1.26 billion people officially registered in Aadhaar.While it began with the Manmohan Singh government Aadhaar became the backbone of the India’s public digital infrastructure in 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi combined it with his government’s Jan Dhan initiative a financial inclusion program for India’s huge number of unbanked households. These new accounts were linked to both mobile numbers and Aadhaar creating the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile or JAM. Today more than 80% of all Indians have a bank account up from half that level when the program started.The digital network is now the lynchpin for most of India’s social security and cash transfer programs — which had been notorious for corruption and unreliability. Today the government uses JAM’s direct benefit transfers for 317 programs. It made 2.6 billion transactions in the current financial year getting more than $46 billion to beneficiaries. The cumulative value of the transfers since the first programs started in 2013 stands at more than $195 billion.The four big successes of India’s public digital infrastructure have been Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Bharat QR Bharat Bill Pay System (BBPS) and the RuPay card — which work with all or parts of the digital network’s threefold components of banking secure identity and mobility.UPI allows peer-to-peer and consumer-to-merchant transactions through mobile apps and e-commerce platforms with JAM providing identification for money transfers. It registers 2-billion transactions a month and in just about four years is now in use from the largest departmental stores to roadside trinket shops.Bharat QR allows consumers to scan the graphic codes to transfer money without sharing phone numbers. This system performs 250 million transactions a month.Going live in 2018 BBPS allows Indian consumers to pay bills for practically everything online and via UPI apps — utilities school fees insurance premiums and loans.Launched in 2012 RuPay cards were meant to rival Visa and Mastercard. Already more than 600-million cards have been issued chiefly on Jan Dhan accounts. RuPay has a 30% market share in point of sale transactions and 25% in online transactions. India is working with nine countries to ensure RuPay cards are integrated with local payment systems — including Australia Bahrain Bhutan Maldives Myanmar Saudi Arabia Singapore and South Korea.Indeed other countries with the same logistical challenges and demographic needs as India may be tempted to adopt much of the digital network. In 2018 Bill Gates technology stalwart backed Aadhaar and praised Modi for fully embracing the scheme. In its March 2019 report “Digital India” McKinsey Global Institute observed that “the public sector has been one strong catalyst for India’s rapid digitization. The government’s efforts to ramp up Aadhaar has played a major role.” Exporting India’s public digital infrastructure would increase the country’s influence on a massive scale even as it improves quality of life of millions globally.In fact the digital infrastructure has only grown and adapted with the Covid-19 crisis. Two apps the JAM-linked vaccination monitor CoWin and the contact tracer Aarogya Setu were integral to India’s battle against the coronavirus. The Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network is a smartphone-based supply chain platform developed connecting 27000 vaccine storage centers supported by 50000 cold chain handlers. It deals primarily with maternal care and infant inoculation; each year it has to manage the needs of 27 million newborns.Bridging the digital divide is the best way to overcome socio-economic differences. India can lead from the front."

• Bayern have already won European silverware this season defeating UEFA Europa League winners Sevilla 2-1 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Budapest on 24 September thanks to goals from Leon Goretzka (34) and Javi Martínez (104).

• The draw at Atlético on Matchday 5 ended Bayern's run of UEFA competition victories at 16; their sole loss in their last 28 European outings is the 3-1 home defeat by Liverpool in the 2018/19 UEFA Champions League round of 16 second leg (W22 D5).

That fact that no wrestler involved was afraid to throw themselves into it really helped too.

Given his contribution to ladder matches as a whole it was fairly fitting that Edge came out the victor on this one but the match was ultimately a group effort with every competitor chipping in to ensure that fans would still be talking about it 16 years later.

Eric Holcomb has locked in its two candidates according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

Sen. Mike Braun who chose not to run for reelection to the Senate and instead opted to run for governor is projected by the NBC News Decision Desk to beat a crowded field of Republican contenders including Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch.

Braun’s focus during the campaign was on improving economic opportunity within the state citing his experience as a small business owner. He also campaigned on protecting the rights of parents in making decisions related to education and on making healthcare more affordable through increased transparency according to his campaign website.

Democratic candidate Dr. Jennifer McCormick the state’s former superintendent of public instruction ran uncontested in the primary and was projected as the winner shortly after polls closed in northwest Indiana according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

McCormick received her doctorate in education from Indiana State University. She is running on a platform that includes increased investment in public education protection of reproductive rights and finding unique solutions to eliminate wasteful spending while not eliminating key programs according to her campaign website.

McCormick was endorsed prior to the election by the American Federation for Teachers’ Indiana chapter the Indiana State Teachers Association and several other groups.

Braun and McCormick will face off in the general election this fall. Holcomb was unable to seek reelection due to term limits imposed in the state but won his 2020 reelection campaign decisively.

The state has not had a Democratic governor since Joe Kernan took over for Frank O’Bannon following his death in 2003.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L3N0ZWVsZXJzLXJvb2tpZS1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stc3RhcnRpbmctcmlnaHQtZ3VhcmQtMjAyNC1qYW1lcy1kYW5pZWxzLXRyYWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

HOUSTON — One person was killed and another was injured Friday in a parking lot shooting at a McDonald's in Midtown.

This happened at about 10:27 p.m. at the McDonald's in the 1000 block of Gray Street.

Houston police said a group of people was riding on scooters and at some point two brothers left the group and rode through the McDonald's parking lot.

The brothers came across another group of people and police said this is when an argument began. The argument escalated guns were drawn and shots were fired according to police.

At least two men were shot. The victims were found in different locations -- one near the McDonald's parking lot and the other on Fannin Street.

One of the victims died and the other remains in the hospital in an unknown condition.

Police believe a woman may have been shot during the altercation too but are not completely sure.

Investigators said they are working to gather more information and surveillance video to see who was involved.

No suspects are in custody at this time.

Holding the burger in the bag the McDonald’s fan says: “Who comes up with this stuff? I will tell you you guys are very inventive but I will try it!

“Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the McShocker.”

Rolling up his sleeves he labelled the huge burger a “giant disgusting concoction.”

He said: “Ok I’m just going to sit up because it will just fall apart. Bon appetite.”

However the $10 (£7.18) burger doesn’t seem to have gone down too well with the TikToker as he rated it “seven and a half” out of ten.

McDonald’s fans will have heard about the famous “secret menu” but does it actually exist?

Thankfully Maccies worker Jack who claims to have been a crew trainer at the fast food chain between 2015 and 2019 has lifted the lid on what you can order.

Jack responded on Quora to a person who asked if the secret menu is real.

He explained: ""There isn't a set secret menu at McDonald's. You have the ability to customise almost anything on the menus.

""Thanks to social media I have customers ask for crazy items such as the 'Mega Mac' or the 'Land Air and Sea burger.

""This isn't on our menu nor are we trained to create these orders. I usually ask the customer what the item consists of and what they would like to add. I usually remember these items for the next person that asks.""

He advised: ""Mixing McCafe items with standard McDonald’s items are the way to go to get the best secret menu items.""

Other McDonald’s workers backed him up with one saying: ""There’s no official secret menu but most McDonald’s employees know about the variations considered to be the secret menu.

""For example if you order a Monster Mac the employee will probably know what you mean.""

And another added: ""Officially it doesn’t exist. These items (Land sea & air burger etc) aren’t listed as for sale on the menu boards.

""But there are two possibilities: 1) the worker taking your order is familiar with the stories of these items and/or has taken orders for them before or 2) The worker won’t know what you’re talking about but you can explain it to them and the store will sometimes make the item as requested.""

We shared how a customer ordered Monster Mac off the ‘secret menu’ – and it dwarfs Grand Big Mac.

Charles McDowell Jr. House at Quaker Meadows. She had come to Morganton all the way from Los Angeles to participate in Historic Burke Foundation’s 2019 Revolutionary War Days activities.

Becca readily accepted the invitation when HBF board of directors’ member and Revolutionary War Days organizer Dr. Linda Lindsey asked her to portray Grace Greenlee Bowman McDowell mistress of Quaker Meadows and Becca’s fifth-great-grandmother. Her husband Jeff and son Taylor accompanied her on the cross-country trip. They fell in love with the McDowell House the area and the people.

“It’s a beautiful house it’s a nice town and the people were so warm and welcoming” Becca said.

The family was ready for a move and felt an ancestral connection to the land so they decided to move to Morganton.

They invited Becca’s mother Marsha Brychta to join them and she excitedly agreed. They put their houses on the market and within a year of that first visit the family of four made Morganton home. As serendipity would have it the house they purchased here is located on land once owned by Grace McDowell’s brother James Greenlee.

Representing her ancestor during Revolutionary War Days was a moving experience for Becca.

“It’s hard work because you’re really channeling her and her emotions” she said.

The connection to her ancestor was remarkable because only a year prior to portraying Grace Becca knew nothing about the McDowells.

Born and raised in California Becca knew her maternal great-grandmother was from Raleigh. But her family never told stories about their North Carolina roots except for a vague tale of Irish ancestors who once owned a large home that they lost after the Civil War.

Becca’s mother Marsha decided to try her luck digging for their lineage on Ancestry.com. It wasn’t long before she called Becca and said “Sit down. You’re not going to believe this.” Marsha shared that her discovery linked them to North Carolina ancestors Capt. Charles McDowell Jr. and his wife Grace.

As a knowledgeable researcher with nearly 20 years secretarial and administrative experience in the legal departments of three Hollywood film studios Becca went to work verifying the findings. Her research led to Historic Burke Foundation. Then-board member Mary Lou Furr poured through records in Morganton Public Library’s North Carolina Room and uncovered the wealth of information that Becca had hoped for.

She was proud to learn that both her ancestors risked their lives for freedom during the Revolutionary War. When Becca and Marsha relocated to Morganton they joined the Quaker Meadows Chapter of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution an organization consisting of members whose lineage goes back to a documented patriot.

Becca learned that not only was Charles McDowell a patriot but Grace McDowell was recognized as a patriot in her own right — an uncommon accomplishment for a woman at that time. She was especially proud that Grace served as a quartermaster for the militia who grew and donated crops for the war effort and even made gunpowder.

Becca is quick to point out that Grace could not have served the war effort without the labor of the enslaved people who lived on the estate — caring for the household raising the crops and working the raw materials that made the gun powder.

“The McDowells were successful because of their slaves” Becca said emphatically. “They could not have done all of this without them.”

She readily admits that while there is pride in her family’s patriotic history there is sadness in weighing her ancestors’ prominence against their use of slave labor. This conflict presses Becca to unearth and elevate the stories of the enslaved people who lived on the McDowell estate.

Becca joined the board of Historic Burke Foundation which owns and manages the McDowell House soon after relocating to Morganton. In addition to helping the organization share information about the McDowell House’s history its architecture and its role in the Revolutionary War she hopes to add the personal stories of those who lived there to the narrative — stories of McDowell family members the craftsmen the enslaved people and the women.

As a historian and a descendant of its original inhabitants Becca wants the McDowell House to be a welcoming place for everyone. She continues to research and find new stories and artifacts including a poem from the North Carolina Archives written in Grace McDowell’s handwriting.

“It’s exciting every time we discover something new” she said.

So what’s next for Becca Heacock?

She hopes to continue to portray her fifth great-grandmother in period re-enactments. One day she wants to see an angel statue erected to recognize the craftsmen and enslaved people buried in unmarked graves at the Quaker Meadows cemetery. She is considering creating family trees representing the first residents of the McDowell estate from the Revolutionary War through the Civil War. Someday she may write a book about Grace Greenlee Bowman McDowell.

And who knows with her studio connections back in Hollywood maybe one day there could be a movie.",,,,,,,,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Denver officers stopped Gordon on Oct. 13 near downtown Denver for speeding. They reported he was doing 71 mph in a 35 mph zone. An officer asked Gordon if he had been drinking and according to Denver police body camera video Gordon responded that he had one glass of ""pinot grigio."" After administering roadside sobriety tests police arrested Gordon for suspected DUI and speeding.

Although state law says DUI suspects have the choice between a breath test or a blood test one officer tells Gordon: ""I can only give you a blood test due to COVID.""

Last year after the pandemic struck Denver was one of several Colorado police departments that suspended breath tests in DUI cases due to ""extraordinary circumstances"" saying they believed administering breath tests jeopardized the health of their officers.

Natashia Kerr a Communications Specialist with the Colorado Springs Police Department said her department believes the COVID pandemic constitutes an ""extraordinary circumstance"" and justified suspending breath tests.

""Officers are not providing an option for a breath test when processing DUIs"" she said. ""Blood tests are required. Our goal as peace officers is to keep our community safe and that includes limiting the potential spread of the virus and protecting both officers and community members from unnecessary viral exposure.""

But a growing number of judges hearing officers and prosecutors are now having to dismiss or drop DUI cases like Gordon's saying COVID is not a legal excuse to deprive drivers of the right to a breath test. Denver DA's office spokeswoman Carolyn Tyler said of the blood test Gordon eventually took ""Those blood test results were obtained on a false premise. We do not like being in a position of having to drop charges."" She said Denver police not allowing breath tests ""raises broader issues.""

Prosecutors allowed Gordon to plead to a lesser charge of reckless driving.

The Broncos player's DUI case is the latest to get tossed because police refused to provide a breath test due to COVID concerns.

A CBS4 Investigation in February reported that Denver Police Aurora police the Jefferson County Sheriff and Colorado Springs police had all stopped giving breath tests to DUI suspects with varying results.

In Aurora a woman stopped for DUI last October saw a DMV hearing officer dismiss her DUI case with the officer writing there were not ""extraordinary circumstances which prevented the completion of a breath test.""

An Aurora police spokesperson said ""The risk of exposure in using breath tests is higher than taking a blood sample. We did not need people forcefully exhaling around or on our officers increasing their chances of potentially being exposed to COVID-19.""

In another case a Jefferson County judge dismissed a DUI charge in January against a driver who was not offered a breath test. According to a transcript in the case an Arvada police officer told the suspect during the stop ... ""I explained to (the suspect) due to the spread of COVID-19 he could only submit a blood test or refusal [sic]."" The man's attorney Charles Fife said that since the defendant had a previous DUI on his record he would have faced jail time if the DUI charge had stuck.

And in another Denver case last week a judge effectively killed another DUI case by suppressing blood test results since the female driver was never offered a breath test by Denver Police.In that case police told the woman: ""Because of COVID-19 we're not doing breath tests right now so the only option is to cooperate with the blood test. Are you willing to cooperate with that?""

The woman took the blood test but the judge ruled police had placed her under ""undue influence"" and disallowed the blood test.

Harvey Steinberg one of the woman's lawyers told CBS4 ""More importantly than one drunk driver is that the police follow the law.""

Steve Burstein another attorney on the case said ""We would expect the government follows the laws and makes decisions that are safe and legal for all of us.""

In an earlier interview with CBS4 Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen justified his department's policy of suspending breath tests saying ""It's important we have accountability for people who choose to drive while impaired as well as (making sure) we're not unnecessarily or unduly spreading COVID-19.""

Ironically the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has said repeatedly that breath tests in DUI cases are still safe as long as police officers take precautions.

Last March CDPHE disseminated a memo recommending some precautions to officers giving breath tests including social distancing from the suspect avoid confined spaces for breath tests and ""it is recommended that PPE be worn.""

Jeff Groff who oversees breath testing for the state department said his agency cannot order police departments to continue to administer breath tests but he has testified there have been no studies showing a breath test in a DUI case spreads the virus.

""There's nothing out there"" said Groff during a hearing last August. ""I have no reason not to believe it's not safe. So I think that performing a breath test on these instruments is no more risky than going to 7-Eleven and using your ATM card and the Pin pad.""

He said if police departments follow CDPHE guidance ""In my opinion they're going to be just fine.""

While most police departments contacted by CBS4 said they were following that CDPHE guidance and continuing to give breath tests some are not and attorney Steinberg said he believed many more DUI cases will be dismissed if some police departments refuse to provide breath tests in DUI cases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZ21lbmhxLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL255LWdpYW50cy1jb21wbGV0ZS1yb3N0ZXItYnJlYWtkb3duLXByZS1mcmVlLWFnZW5jeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NY Giants complete roster breakdown pre-free agency,,,,,,,,,,

Ten days after marking his 25th anniversary with the company MGM Resorts executive director of public relations Scott Ghertner was scrambling to make sure everything was in its proper place for the Pac-12 men’s basketball tournament at T-Mobile Arena.

Including Bill Walton’s chair.

The Hall of Fame center who towered over opponents as a player prefers to do the same as a broadcaster. Ghertner has an aide named Max Bizzarro who stacks three convention-style chairs — I’m told the process combines the preciseness of splitting an atom with a game of Jenga — so the big redhead has the airspace required to engage ESPN sidekick Dave Pasch in inimitable and nonstop banter and repartee.

But in considering his MGM career the diminutive 48-year-old media expert said being responsible for Bill Walton’s chair probably only rates an honorable mention on a highlight reel that includes:

— Frozen Fury Kings vs. Avalanche exhibition series:“That eventually led to what we have now” Ghertner said of the NHL bestowing the Golden Knights upon Las Vegas.

— Bite of the Century Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield: “When it actually happened I was on the concourse walking the arena with one of our interns who said ‘I think (Tyson) just bit his ear.”

— Opening T-Mobile Arena: “Having a major arena in which we now house the hockey team and all the other great sports and major events we host is awesome.”

— Michael Jordan’s Celebrity Invitational at Shadow Creek Golf Course: “I earned the new nickname ‘Little Man’ from the greatest basketball player of all time.”

— Vegas Madness leftovers: The last time Long Beach State which was eliminated from the Big West Tournament at Michelob Ultra Arena by UC Santa Barbara won an NCAA Tournament game was when Jerry Tarkanian was coach in 1973. … It was cool to see local products hooping it up in the Pac-12 tournaments as well as calling block or charge: Las Vegans Deldre Carr (men) and InFini Robinson (women) were among the Pac-12 referees. … The NCAA dream of former UNLV interim coach Todd Simon and top-seeded Southern Utah ended in the Big Sky semifinals when Montana State beat the buzzer to force overtime and a long 3-point attempt by SUU’s Dre Marin that would have forced a second OT rattled in and out.

— The explanation given to Las Vegas Motor Speedway by the Southern Nevada Healthy District in reducing attendance at NASCAR Weekend from 20 percent capacity to 15 was that LVMS was to serve as a “pilot program” for safely allowing spectators back to large facility sporting venues amid the pandemic.

Just days after last Sunday’s race the limit was bumped to 20 percent. On Friday it was increased to 50. When it comes to pilot programs LVMS’ must be on a par with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds who performed the flyover before the green flag.

“Nothing surprises me with our health district” LVMS president Chris Powell said sounding as if somebody had spilled Pennzoil on his corn flakes.

— Is baseball really a game of inches? The Las Vegas Aviators soon will find out when bases extended from 15 inches to 18 make their debut at the Triple-A level. “It’s going to have the most effect on the bang-bang play at first base and stolen bases at second base is what they think” Aviators president Don Logan said.

Aaron Boone is down with the new minor-league rule changes but Luke Voit says bigger bases are ""just stupid.""https://t.co/0UWW1a9kan — WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) March 12 2021

It has been announced that Rocket Mortgage will become the presenting sponsor of Michigan State’s basketball team although one social media pundit believes the company picked the wrong Spartans’ squad.

Wrote Twitter user Midwestern Hedgie: “Rocket Mortgage should have sponsored the football team instead because they tried to add seven points to my friend’s (refinance) after her initial quote.”

Rocket Mortgage should have sponsored the football team instead because they tried to add 7 points (!!!) to my friend's mortgage refi after her initial quote. (She eventually got it done elsewhere at a fair rate with no points.) — Midwestern Hedgie (@MidwestHedgie) March 12 2021

Last week I was doing a little clerical work checking a Las Vegas production company’s on-sale dates and ran across something remarkable: A long line of ticketed shows taking almost the whole screen on the KatsTop laptop.

Just like the old days almost. Lined up were more than three dozen ongoing shows (39 by my count) being performed in Las Vegas right now. I would expect any other international city would be encouraged to have safely returned to that volume of live entertainment during a pandemic.

This almost a year to the day after live entertainment across the city was closed in the statewide COVID shutdown of nonessential businesses.

That count falls far short of what Las Vegas has offered in the “old” normal. The stats vary depending on openings and closings and pauses and such but the city presented about 150 ticketed shows per night before COVID hit. Again Las Vegas sets its own standard with its pure volume of live entertainment offerings.

Checking the latest list Sunday Matt Stabile of Stabile Productions said “It’s pretty impressive considering that we had like five shows going when we started reopening. But there is demand. The town is getting much busier. All of our shows have been selling out. It’s a lower capacity of course but it has been crazy all week.”

A canvassing of the city’s ticketed shows ongoing right now gives reason for encouragement. Recent relaxing of maximum capacities for public gatherings to 50-percent of a venue’s fire-code capacity and the removal of the 25-foot ‘Moat’ at the front of stages has quickened the pace of the city’s return to live entertainment.

Following is the hot list of headliners and production shows you can see as the one-year shutdown anniversary approaches Thursday night:

Caesars Entertainment

Caesars Palace: “Absinthe” returning Wednesday Spiegeltent at Roman Plaza.

Harrah’s: “X Country” at Harrah’s Cabaret. “Tape Face” at Harrah’s Showroom.

Coming soon?

Any headliner or show not listed in that stretch is yet to be announced or (such as Gordie Brown at Golden Nugget on March 25) opening at a later date. The lineup does not include Cirque du Soleil’s plans to bring back its five Strip shows beginning July 4. Nor does it account for the many resident Strip headliners on the tarmac starting with Barry Manilow’s scheduled return to Westgate Las Vegas in June. Usher’s residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace is next in line in July continuing with Donny Osmond at Harrah’s in late-August.

And add to the ticketed lineup such ongoing “ambient” performances as shows at Mayfair Supper Club at Bellagio Italian American Club and The Vegas Room. Several hotel-casino venues are currently offering free lounge entertainment leading with Le Cabaret at Paris and Indigo at Bally’s; Napoleon’s in Le Boulevard betweent those two casinos; Harrah’s Piano Bar (topped by Pete “Big Elvis” Vallee) and Carnaval Court (my buddies in the Original Chaos classic-rock band); and the just-expanded 1923 Prohibition Bar at Mandalay Bay with Nieve Malandra now in residency.

It’s a lot unless measured pre-COVID business in Las Vegas which sets its own standard. But to answer the question about whether the city can regain its stature as entertainment capital of the world check the scoreboard. It’s already on its way.

EJY recovering

Eric Jordan Young was a late call-out from his scheduled performance at The Space on Saturday. He had good reason. EJY was rushed to the emergency room Friday night with abdominal pain and underwent appendectomy surgery Saturday morning. The malady was caught before any rupture but …

“Ooh it was bad” Young said Sunday just as he was returning home. “I’ve never been in that position to have to walk away from a performance. I was so ill was hoping everyone understood ‘the show must go on’ mentality wasn’t going to work this time. There was no way I would have been able to perform.”

Young is known for his durability. He pulled a 12-show-per-week schedule for four years in “Vegas! The Show.” His next booked gig is April 29 a return with “The Cocktail Cabaret” at Italian American Club. As the headliner says “That should be enough time to make sure I’m back in performing condition.”

Who Was Where

The city’s reopening is leading to some celeb sightings. Las Vegas Raiders Coach Jon Gruden was at Barry’s Downtown Prime steakhouse at Circa Las Vegas. So was Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Dion Dawkins (separate tables). WWE heavyweight champ Bobby Lashley was in the house Friday night easily recognizable as he carried his title belt into the kitchen for a photo opp with Chef Barry Dakake.

British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis was at Top Golf at MGM Grand on Saturday afternoon sipping mimosas with friends. No word on if she broke out the sticks.

Another WWE star Chris Jericho took in “X Burlesque” on Saturday. His photo op was a classic. Our friend known simply as Red Cup Geoff stripped off his shirt and photo-bombed the whole cast along with co-producers Angela Stabile and Tiffany Mondell. That’s him far right but not far right enough. Pretty funny actually. But next time keep your shirt on and leave the comedy to Nancy Ryan.

Samsung Electronics' silicon wafer display

SK Hynix's new 176-layer 512 Gb 4D NAND flash

South Korea’s leading chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. are at a crossroads challenged by smaller rivals such as Micron Technology Inc. that are narrowing the technology gap with the industry leaders.A sense of urgency to widen the lead with fast followers is even more pronounced in the local industry and among academics as governments in the US Europe and China promise to spend heavily to swiftly overtake Korea in technological prowess.In November of last year Micron surprised the global semiconductor market by announcing that it developed 176-layer 3D NAND flash memory the industry’s first and had begun volume shipments of the product to its clients.Korean chipmakers have yet to mass produce the highest-density NAND memory although SK Hynix unveiled samples of its own 176-layer NAND chips in December.In January of this year Micron the world’s fifth-largest NAND player again embarrassed its bigger rivals by declaring it had begun producing fourth-generation 10-nanometer DRAM chips in large quantity – also the world’s first.Samsung and SK Hynix controlled a combined 71% of the world’s DRAM market and 45% of the NAND market as of the fourth quarter of 2020 but local analysts raised concerns that their grip on the two major types of memory chips could loosen with their technology edge narrowing faster than expected.Samsung developed and mass produced the 96-layer V NAND chip in July 2018 and SK Hynix began volume production of 128-layer 4D NAND in June 2019. Just one and a half years later Micron started mass production of 128-layer NAND chips.Lee Jong-ho an electrical and computer engineering professor at Seoul National University said Korean chipmakers face difficulties extending frontiers.“Being a leader is a blessing and a curse. As an industry leader you have to keep overcoming new challenges to stay on top while latecomers just follow in the footsteps of the trailblazers -- and this has become more noticeable of late” he said.Korean chipmakers have maintained their lead over rivals in cost competitiveness and facility investments with Samsung's R&D spending in the trillion won range annually.But recent data showed they are losing ground in cost competitiveness.Micron’s operating profit margin was hovering around 19.5% in 2019 below Samsung’s 21.6% but much higher than SK Hynix’s 10.1%.In 2020 Samsung posted an operating profit margin of 25.8% higher than most other competitors. SK Hynix’s profit margin was 15.7% just 0.5 percentage point higher than that of Micron signifying that there was hardly any gap in cost competitiveness between the two.The competition to stay ahead of rivals has become fiercer not just among companies but also on the government level as the US China and some European countries back their chipmakers with generous subsidies and easier regulations.According to the final report by the US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) last week the commission called for the need to invest heavily in the chip sector to win the technology competition with other countries.Based on the report the US Senate has been working on a bill to support its chip industry with a $30 billion package.The European Union has also decided to raise chip production in the region to 20% of the global output by 2030 from the current 10% by injecting some 180 trillion won ($158 billion) until then.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently unveiled a vision for the EU’s “Digital Decade” to transform Europe into a digital society by 2030.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has also vowed to raise the country’s semiconductor production significantly from the current 20% of its own supplies. China imported $350 billion worth of chips in 2020.According to a report in June of 2020 by the Federation of Korean Industries state subsidies for China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) accounted for 6.6% of its annual sales between 2014 and 2018 while the comparable percentage for Micron of the US stood at 3.3%. Meanwhile the Korean government’s support for Samsung and SK Hynix accounted for a mere 0.8% and 0.5% of their sales respectively in the corresponding period.“The foreign nations’ fostering of the semiconductor industry and major IT companies’ move to make chips for themselves will be a big risk factor for Korean chipmakers” said Kyung Chong-min an electrical engineering professor at KAIST Korea’s national research university.“The Korean government should also expand its state support for local chipmakers with a focus on creating a favorable chip ecosystem.”Jeong-Soo Hwang and Hyung-Suk Song at hjs@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Friday the White House urged victims to patch systems and stressed the urgency: The window for updating systems could be measured in ""hours not days"" a senior administration official said.

""This is a crazy huge hack"" Christopher Krebs former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) tweeted last week.

The fallout from the hack is still being measured. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the attack and discussed it with leaders from India Japan and Australia at a summit Friday said National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The National Security Council has assembled a multi-agency government task force to address the massive breach.

The breach follows last year's Russian-linked hack which leveraged SolarWinds software to spread a virus across 18000 government and private computer networks.

The CEO of FireEye Kevin Mandia gives a tour of the cybersecurity company's unused office space in Reston Va. Tuesday March 9 2021. Mandia said 550 of his employees are working remotely and responding to a recent barrage of cyber breaches including four different zero-day attacks against Microsoft Exchange. Nathan Ellgren / AP

""Solarwinds was bad. But the mass hacking going on here is literally the largest hack I've seen in my fifteen years"" said David Kennedy CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec. ""In this specific case there was zero rhyme or reason for who [attackers] were hacking. It was literally hack everybody you can in this short time window and cause as much pandemonium and mayhem as possible.""

Here's what to know about the Microsoft Exchange exploit:

When did the attack start?

Hackers began stealthily targeting Exchange servers ""in early January"" according to cybersecurity firm Volexity which Microsoft credits for identifying initial exploits.

According to Microsoft corporate vice president Tom Burt hackers first gained access to an Exchange Server either with stolen passwords or by using the previously undiscovered vulnerabilities used to ""disguise itself as someone who should have access."" Using web shells hackers controlled servers through remote access – operated from U.S.-based private servers – to steal data from a victim's network.

Who is behind the attack?

Microsoft identified a Chinese-based group known as ""Hafnium"" as the primary actor behind initial attacks.

The Hafnium group has historically targeted ""infectious disease researchers law firms higher education institutions defense contractors policy think tanks and NGOs"" Burt wrote in a company blog post.

How did Microsoft respond?

Microsoft made the vulnerabilities public on March 2 and released ""patches"" for multiple versions of Exchange. While Microsoft typically launches updates on the second Tuesday of each month – known as ""Patch Tuesday"" – its announcement came on the first Tuesday of the month an indication of the urgency.

Days later the company also took the unusual step of releasing security patches for out-of-date versions of Exchange Server.

A Microsoft spokesperson told CBS News that the company was working closely with CISA other government agencies and security companies. In a statement provided to CBS News last week the company said ""The best protection is to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems. We continue to help customers by providing additional investigation and mitigation guidance. Impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.""

How did the attack evolve?

Experts say it's common for hackers to step up an attack immediately preceding a fix but that the pace was much faster in this case. ""Once a patch is imminent [hackers] may turn to wider exploitation because there's this 'use it or lose' it factor"" said Ben Read the director of threat analysis at the cybersecurity company Mandiant.

But in late February just days before Microsoft released its security patch security researchers saw an automated second wave of attacks targeting victims across industry sectors.

""They went very aggressive essentially hacking everybody"" Kennedy said. Hackers planted backdoors known as ""web shells"" in systems launching attacks against organizations ""without rhyme or reason."" Kennedy added ""We haven't seen that from China in the past.""

Microsoft said Friday it is investigating whether attackers were tipped off that a patch was imminent. The internal probe centers on ""what might have caused the spike of malicious activity"" at the end of February but investigators have not yet drawn any conclusions. ""We have seen no indications of a leak from Microsoft related to this attack"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CBS News.

What did the hackers want?

The goal of the hackers is unclear. ""Tens of thousands of targets most of which really don't have any intelligence value"" said Read. ""They're just sort of small towns and local businesses. Their information likely does not have any value to the Chinese government."" Read called the ""level of mass exploitation"" of haphazard bystanders a ""very rare"" show of force.

And what began as a hack led by Chinese hackers soon gave way to a feeding frenzy from criminal gangs in other countries including Russia.

At least 10 criminal espionage groups have exploited the flaws in the Exchange Server email program worldwide antivirus firm ESET said in a blog post Wednesday.

Who was targeted?

Cybersecurity experts tell CBS News that tens of thousands of private and public U.S. entities have been hit. ""Initially early estimates were 30000 people were hacked. We're seeing a number now that is much higher"" Kennedy said. ""Globally it's definitely in the multi-hundreds of thousands of servers that were hacked.""

The list of victims worldwide continues to grow to include schools hospitals cities and pharmacies.Cybersecurity firm CyberEye identified ""an array of affected victims including U.S.-based retailers local governments a university and an engineering firm"" in a blog post.

The European Banking Authority the banking regulator for the E.U. announced it had been hit.

The attack largely steered clear of Fortune-500 companies and large organizations that have migrated their servers to Microsoft Exchange Online – Microsoft's cloud-based email and calendar service. But the widespread attack will prove painful to smaller companies that run Microsoft exchange on their on-premises servers and can least afford high-end security.

""The most concerning victims by far are small- and medium-sized businesses who don't follow security news everyday who may not be aware that there is this massive patch"" Katie Nickels director of intelligence for cybersecurity firm Red Canary told CBS News. She added that victim notification has presented a ""huge challenge"" given the large number of affected organizations. ""The thing that worries me most is everyone that we don't see"" she said.

Has the federal government been breached?

Officials have not confirmed breaches of any federal agencies Eric Goldstein executive assistant director of CISA's cybersecurity division told lawmakers last week. ""At this point in time there are no federal civilian agencies that are confirmed to be compromised by this campaign.""

But National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Friday the federal government is ""still trying to determine the scope and scale"" of the hack.

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the breach ""poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies"" and issued an emergency directive on March 2 ordering all agencies to immediately implement a patch or disconnect from Exchange Server if impacted.

What's the risk?

Cybersecurity firms say they have begun to observe hackers stealing passwords from networks and installing cryptocurrency mining malware on servers.

And Microsoft said in a late-night tweet Thursday that it had detected a new strain of ""ransomware"" – a kind of malicious software designed to block access to a computer until the victim pays a sum of money.

While companies may assume their system is fixed once they install Microsoft's security patch the emergency update does not expel attackers from servers leaving already breached organizations susceptible to further exploitation.

""There's also a lot of concern now that China is going to be selling these accounts off"" to bad actors including ""ransomware authors to inflict as much damage as possible"" Kennedy said. ""So right now is a very critical period for us.""

Is this connected to Solarwinds?

The latest attack is not connected to last year's SolarWinds breach though the timing of two massive consecutive cyber hacks has strained the ability to respond.

""The big impact on the industry is timing"" Nickels said. ""We're a year into a pandemic. People are working remotely and they're exhausted and stressed.""

U.S. officials tell CBS News that while the SolarWinds hack has more national security implications given the fact that hackers in that attack accessed nine federal agencies the attack by Microsoft is far more widespread.

""This is definitely bigger than Solar Winds"" Kennedy said. ""While [SolarWinds] was bad it didn't hit near the breadth of systems here.""

""This hack is much noisier and much easier to detect but the scale is what makes this so concerning"" Nickels said.

Senior White House administration officials told reporters Friday that the Biden administration will announce executive action in the wake of the SolarWinds attack. The White House is also unveiling a new executive order on cyber in ""the next few weeks"" which includes a proposal to assign letter-grade cybersecurity ratings to software vendors used by the federal government.

It remains unclear if the upcoming cyber executive order will also address risks posed by the latest Microsoft Exchange hack.

Both Russian and Chinese officials have denied responsibility. Last week Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China ""firmly opposes and combats cyber-attacks and cyber theft in all forms.""

I had to tell the truth,"Do you love me? Screenshot by ZDNet

Competition can breed neurosis.

Especially when there's a competitor who seems against all rational odds to have secured hearts even more than minds.

Recently I wrote about a couple of very senior executives who believe with an unhealthy passion that Zoom is far far superior to Microsoft Teams.

Their emotions were oddly extreme. Their feelings were certainly unbridled.

I received quite the correspondence. Some lauding Zoom some suggesting that Teams is so much better that they'd like to meet these two executives in a very dark alley. Via Teams of course.

Yet these Teams defenders tended to point to rational attributes. For example how well Teams integrates with the other Microsoft software many employees are forced to use. Which doesn't exactly lift human spirits.

It also doesn't lift the spirits in Redmond I fear.

A few days ago I was contemplating the moral issues that have driven Piers Morgan to his exalted state of being when a survey forced itself upon my laptop apparently bypassing my pop-up blocker.

It was from Microsoft its large colorful logo at the top.

The company wanted me to answer a few questions. First question: ""How much do you know about these communication solutions?""

The options were Microsoft Teams Slack Zoom and Google Meet. Curiously WebEx wasn't there. Neither was FaceTime.

The next question was all about which of these services ""allows workers to collaborate effectively.""

Finally there was a question about how often I use Teams at work.

Yes But What Do You Really Feel About Teams?



Dutifully I answered these three questions. The minute I submitted my answers Microsoft wanted more. And that more was all about my feelings.

First which of Teams Slack Zoom or Google Meet did I prefer to use at work. Next question: Which would I describe as ""easy to use""?

It was as if this whole thing was based on the two executives' criticism of Teams. They'd both talked about how Zoom is for them so much more intuitive and easier to use than Teams. They claimed Zoom gave them more display options and even greater privacy. I didn't necessarily agree with them but they use these services far more than I do.

They said comparing Zoom to Microsoft was like comparing Lululemon to Athleta or Dick's to Big 5 Sporting Goods. One said her company went out of its way to use Zoom rather than Teams. Even though the company uses Outlook.

Next question from Microsoft: ""Which of the following communications solutions most differentiate themselves from others?""

You know the answer is Zoom don't you? It's the one that's become a verb. It's the one that's become synonymous with the whole videoconferencing genre. What did it do to achieve that? It was there when the pandemic happened and it was easy to use.

Is This Love Is This Love That I'm Feeling?



Finally like a needy youth desperate for the hometown queen to love him Microsoft went to the essence: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement Microsoft Teams is a brand I love?

There it is. There's the real concern. Love.

People love Zoom -- despite its security scandals and its possibly creepy relationship with China. Microsoft is worried that it'll never enjoy the same love. It just wants Teams to be passionately adored.

Naturally I had to tell the truth. You have to in relationships.

Kidding. It's just OK. Fine. But love? Nah. Screenshot by ZDNet

When you're asking me about love it's a deep question.

When I think of brands I love I think of the San Francisco Giants Real Betis Montalbano Honig Winery (disclosure: I'm a so-called wine ambassador there) Portugal Galaxy chocolate Tony's chocolate Cadbury's Milk Tray chocolate and Norwegian Kvikk Lunsj chocolate.

Tech brands can be tasteful exciting helpful and uplifting. But love a tech brand? I'm sorry it just hasn't happened to me though I know others have been lucky enough to experience it. (The closest for me were the early Nokia phones. I adored those things.)

Can Anybody Find Me Somebody Who Loves Me?



So I had to be honest. Microsoft Teams just isn't a brand I love. Which doesn't at all mean I loathe it.

I use Teams. It's just fine. It generally works though I've had one meeting clicked on the link and somehow the other participants were there and never saw me or heard me. Odd that.

I use Zoom marginally more often because the people I have video conferences with prefer to use Zoom. And it always works.

I don't love Zoom. And I certainly don't love Teams. How can you? They're screen-based substitutes for human interaction.

You see Microsoft wasn't hurt. Very. Screenshot by ZDNet

I couldn't help thinking though that these questions could have been asked about Apple by Microsoft circa 1997.

Just as with Macs and iPhones a lot of people do love Zoom and Microsoft wants to know how bad that love is and how to get some. The company knows it's progressed wildly -- in emotional terms -- from the cold heartless days of Bill Gates and the excitable but still essentially heartless days of Steve Ballmer.

The Microsoft brand enjoys some affection these days. It does good things. But it's worried that it's losing an emotional contest just like Apple I recently discovered is worried Microsoft Edge is a big threat to Safari.

But Zoom owns fun and ease of use while Teams has been foisted upon many via the Office 365 power brokerage.

It's hard to love something that's been forced upon you when you've been forced to work from home sometimes in very difficult circumstances.

Zoom is the iPad Teams is the Surface. There's still a lot of seduction to be done Microsoft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL2JldHRlci1idXktYXBwbGUtdnMtbWljcm9zb2Z0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Apple vs. Microsoft,"One of these decades-old rivals continues to stand out.

Apple (AAPL 0.38%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.02%) have fought each other for market share since the late 1970s. At various times one has appeared to dominate the other. But in recent years some investors have begun to believe that Apple will fall behind as its iPhone becomes commoditized and Microsoft emerges as a top player in the cloud. However two emerging trends may give stockholders a case for sticking with Apple.

Despite their rivalry both companies have enjoyed great success. Apple has amassed the world's largest market cap of around $2 trillion while Microsoft has the second-largest market cap at $1.8 trillion.

Moreover both have built cash hoards that all companies should envy. Apple holds $195.6 billion in cash on hand offset by $112 billion in various forms of debt. Over the trailing 12 months it generated $80.2 billion in free cash flow.

In comparison Microsoft holds about $132 billion in cash against $60.5 billion in total debt. Free cash flow for the company came in at about $50.4 billion over the previous 12 months. Nonetheless almost no company including Apple matches Microsoft's AAA credit rating. Despite its debt levels Microsoft has built a track record of financial stability going back to the 1980s. It could also pay off its debt immediately with existing cash lowering its credit risk.

How Apple stands out

Apple pioneered an entire industry through the iPhone its largest revenue driver for more than a decade. In time competition from lower-cost players using Alphabet's Android operating system forced Apple to offer lower-cost iPhones as the company's overall net sales fell.

However this situation may have changed. The pandemic brought about increased iPhone sales as dependence on such devices rose. Now Apple has launched the 5G iPhone 12. With the 5G iPhone's faster speeds Apple regained some pricing power. This has brought back some of the higher margins that bolstered iPhone profits in past years.

Moreover Apple has maximized wearables sales in part by promoting the health benefits of the Apple Watch. It not only monitors one's heart but also measures blood oxygen levels and sends out an alert in case of a fall. Additionally Fitness+ Apple's fitness experience that works with the Apple Watch launched on Dec. 14. Apple partially credited the Apple Watch with taking wearable sales 30% higher year over year in the latest quarter.

Also Apple's services division which includes iTunes and the App Store has achieved notable successes with a 24% 12-month surge in revenue over the same period. Some analysts speculate that services could generate half of Apple's profits by the middle of the decade.

As a result Apple earned more than $294.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months. This represents a 10% increase from the previous 12-month period. Also thanks in part to the iPhone release last fall overall revenue for the latest quarter increased 21% from year-ago levels.

This revenue improvement led to net income for the latest quarter of almost $28.8 billion 29.3% higher than year-ago levels. An increase in operating expenses of only 12% helped contribute to the higher profit surge.

This growth took Apple stock higher by more than 70% over the last 12 months. Additionally its P/E ratio has risen to 33. This stands out as Apple's multiple struggled to move above 20 before 2020. Still its 29% net income increase does not match the growth in its P/E ratio during the same time frame. Thus investors will have to also consider whether Apple now justifies its more expensive valuation.

The case for Microsoft

Microsoft has also struggled for respect at times. When Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014 he inherited a company reeling from the decline of the PC and the slowing growth of Windows.

As the previous head of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group he transitioned Microsoft to a cloud focus. This led to the company becoming the second-largest cloud provider with 15% cloud market share according to ParkMyCloud. This lags only Amazon which pioneered the industry.

Other software bolsters Microsoft as well. Microsoft 365 which constitutes its Office intelligent cloud and security suite primarily drives its productivity and business processes division. This division makes up roughly one-third of the company's revenue approximately the same as one year ago. Still revenue increased 11% from year-ago levels. Within that division the Office 365 commercial suite surged 21% during that period while its Dynamics 365 software its ERP tool registered a 38% increase for that period.

Furthermore the company released its latest generation Xbox gaming console late last year. Moreover Xbox Live its multimedia social gaming service has grown to 100 million monthly active users while GamePass now claims about 18 million subscribers. Overall Xbox content and services revenue increased 30% over the last 12 months.

Still Xbox appears to have fallen short of its peers. Sony experienced 42% growth in its game & network services division though Sony did not break out PlayStation revenue separately. Nintendo reported 38% growth in its Switch platform. Unlike its peers Nintendo has not launched a next-generation console since 2017.

Despite slightly lower gaming growth Microsoft stock has moved higher by just under 50% over the last year. Also its P/E ratio has reached 36. This far exceeds the P/E ratio of 15 where Microsoft traded at the time Nadella took over in 2014. Still the multiple has fallen from a multi-year peak above 60 in 2018 when a one-time tax charge temporarily reduced income and boosted the valuation.

Apple or Microsoft?

Between the two tech stocks I believe Apple still holds the edge. The 5G upgrade cycle will force all smartphone users to eventually upgrade supporting iPhone sales and higher margins for years to come. Additionally the growth in wearables and services could add to that revenue growth. Moreover even with Apple's rising valuation it still trades at a slightly lower multiple than Microsoft despite higher cash flows and profit margins.

While this success will not negate Microsoft's bull case it gives Apple more potential for higher returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbGVicml0eW5ldHdvcnRoLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydGljbGVzL2hhcHBlbmVkLWRheS1taWNyb3NvZnQtd2VudC1wdWJsaWMtYmFjay1tYXJjaC0xMy0xOTg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,35 Years Ago Today – March 13 1986 – Microsoft Went Public… Setting Off One Of The Greatest Generators Of Private ...,"35 Years Ago Today – March 13 1986 – Microsoft Went Public… Setting Off One Of The Greatest Generators Of Private Wealth In History

For people who enjoy reading stories about extreme wealth March 13 should be a holiday. If it was a holiday today we would be celebrating the 35th anniversary of the launch of one of the greatest wealth-creating machines in human history. What happened 35 years ago today? That's the day a little software company in Seattle called Microsoft went public.

The events of March 13 1986 would eventually mint thousands of millionaires a handful of billionaires and three of the largest personal fortunes in human history. Within a decade of its IPO company co-founder Bill Gates would be the richest person in the world a title he held for the better part of 20 years.

How much wealth did Microsoft generate for its founders and where is that wealth today? How rich would you be today if you had been lucky enough to buy $10000 worth of MSFT on March 13 1986 and held for the next 35 years collecting dividends and new shares from stock splits? Let's find out!

Early History of Microsoft

Microsoft was founded by childhood friends Bill Gates (aged 20) and Paul Allen (aged 22) in Albuquerque New Mexico on April 4 1975. Yes that's right Albuquerque. Not Seattle. The reason the company was founded in Albuquerque is because it happened to be the hometown of a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).

Allen and Gates met while they were both attending Seattle's Lakeside School. They bonded over their love of computers and programming. Allen was two years older than Gates. After getting a perfect score on the SAT Allen enrolled at Washington State University. He dropped out after two years and took a job at Honeywell in Boston whose offices happened to be a few minutes from Harvard where Bill had recently enrolled.

[Fun fact – earlier this week MacKenzie Scott (ex-wife of current richest person in the world Jeff Bezos) announced she married a science teacher named Dan Jewett. Dan is a science teacher at… Lakeside School!]

In January 1972 Popular Electronics Magazine did a feature on MITS' latest invention the Altair 8800 microcomputer. According to legend Paul saw the cover of the magazine while walking through Harvard Square. He bought the magazine tracked down Bill and frantically convinced him that they both needed to leave Boston (Bill was in the middle of his junior year) and move to Albuquerque where they would build an operating system for the Altair.

That's exactly what happened.

Executives at MITS were impressed with their OS and hired the young duo to create software for the company. But Allen and Gates had bigger ideas and soon struck out on their own.

On April 4 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded ""Micro-Soft"" in Albuquerque.

In 1976 ""Micro-Soft"" generated $16005 in revenue selling software to some of the world's first personal computers.

In January 1979 after dropping the hyphen Microsoft relocated to Seattle. In addition to being closer to their childhood homes Gates and Allen found it difficult to recruit top quality programmers to move to New Mexico.

Steve Ballmer one of Bill's friends from Harvard became Microsoft employee #30 on June 11 1980. He was hired to run business development.

One Brilliant Decision Launches A Fountain Of Wealth

That same year (1980) IBM announced its intention to hire a software company to develop an operating system that would become standard for all IBM personal computers. IBM initially approached Microsoft. Incredibly Gates suggested they get in touch with his friend Gary Kildall down in the Bay Area the founder of a company called Digital Research Inc. which had already developed an OS that could be adaptable to IBM machines. Gates even went so far as to call Gary while the IBM people were still in his office so they could set up a time to meet the following day.

Depending on who you talk to Gary's IBM meeting was bungled for a couple different reasons. Here's what is known: When the IBM executives arrived for their meeting they were greeted by Gary's wife Dorothy. Gary for reasons that have been debated for decades missed the meeting because he was out flying his plane. The stuffy IBM executives were incensed. They flew back to Seattle and asked Bill if he would reconsider building their operating system.

Bill said yes.

There was just one problem. Microsoft wasn't anywhere close to developing what could be used as an OS for IBM. Soooo Bill called up a Seattle-based developer named Tim Paterson who had developed a clone of Gary's software which he called ""86-DOS"". Bill negotiated a deal to buy 86-DOS for $100000.

Bill and his team made a couple nominal changes. They also changed the OS name from ""86-DOS"" to MS-DOS.

The IBM team was extremely happy with what they saw in MS-DOS and wanted to strike a formal partnership for that to be the standard operating system for all of their machines.

In what is arguably the most brilliant move in business history instead of selling the rights to MS-DOS directly to IBM Gates opted to license the software. As a result Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS and could therefore license it new customers.

Step back for a moment and digest the significance of that decision.

Imagine if Henry Ford hired you to invent an engine for his automobile. And imagine if instead of selling your creation to him outright you licensed it so you earned a fee every time a Ford car was sold. Then as new car companies like Dodge Buick Chevrolet Ferrari… etc… pop up you licensed your engine to them as well. So you earned a royalty every time a car was sold for the 100+ years.

That's exactly what happened with Microsoft. As the PC revolution exploded around the world MS-DOS became the standard for pretty much every computer that was built. And every time someone bought a PC they were also forced to buy a MS-DOS license from Microsoft.

When Microsoft officially incorporated in 1981 Steve Ballmer owned 8% of the company Paul Allen owned 25% and Bill Gates owned 45%. The remaining 22% was split up among some of the luckiest people ever to join a risky young startup.

""The Graphical User Interface""

In 1983 Xerox developed a revolutionary operating system that connected the PC's mouse to the computer screen. For the first time ever a human could move his or her hand and the mouse would follow. Point click. Drag drop. It was originally called the ""graphical point and click interface"". More commonly known today as the ""graphical user interface"" (GUI pronounced ""Gooey""). This little innovation is still the standard in every computer to this day.

For some insane reason Xerox invited executives from both Apple and Microsoft to check out what they had created. Literally they invited Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to come view a demonstration. This would be like inventing a new type of alcohol that didn't cause hangovers then inviting executives from all the major alcohol companies to come by and check out the ingredients.

Within a matter of months both Apple and Microsoft were working on their own operating systems that had graphical point and click mouse interfaces.

When Steve Jobs learned that Microsoft was also working on an operating system based on Xerox's innovations he was furious. He demanded Bill Gates come to Apple's headquarters and account for his actions. Here's how that legendary interaction went down in an Apple conference room:

Jobs screamed:

""You're ripping us off! I trusted you and now you're stealing from us!""

Gates sat coolly on the other side of the conference room while Steve unloaded his fury. When the Apple founder was done Gates replied:

""Well Steve I think there's more than one way of looking at it. I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.""

Microsoft Windows was released on November 20 1985. Within a matter of months the PC became the global computing standard and subsequently pushed Apple to the wayside for more than a decade. And every time a PC was sold Microsoft earned a fat royalty check for its software.

Over the next several months Microsoft would slowly gain a number of new private investors. According to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations once a company has more than 500 private shareholders it must go public. Therefore an IPO was inevitable even though Bill Gates would have preferred to stay private.

March 13 1986 – IPO DAY

Microsoft wasn't the first software company to IPO in the mid-1980s. It wasn't the only software company to go public in March of 1986! Literally one day before Microsoft's IPO Larry Ellison's Oracle Corp went public. Oracle planned to offer 2.1 million shares at $15 per share. By the end of its first trading day Oracle shares sat at $19.25. This was seen as a very positive sign by the bankers guiding Microsoft's debut so MSFT's opening price was raised from $16 to $21.

At 9:35 am on March 13 1986 MSFT opened at $25.75 per share. Goldman Sach's CEO could be heard on the trading floor shouting:

""It's wild! I've never seen anything like it — every last person here is trading Microsoft and nothing else!""

By the end of trading 3.6 million MSFT shares had been exchanged and the stock price (having peaked at $29.25) ended the day at $27.75.

So how much were Gates Allen and Ballmer worth after their smash hit IPO? $10 billion? $20 billion? $50 billion? $100 billion???? Nope nope nope and nope. Microsoft ended the day with a total market cap of $780 million.

Gates' 45% stake was worth $350 million.

Allen's 25% stake was worth $195 million.

Ballmer's 8% stake was worth $51.5 million.

That's right Bill Gates was worth ""just"" $350 million after the Microsoft IPO. What's even crazier is the fact that he personally only sold $1.6 million worth of shares on opening day. He wasn't even in Seattle when the company went public. Bill was in Australia on vacation on IPO day. He would eventually use $150000 of his IPO earnings to pay off the mortgage on his Seattle house.

Paul Allen who was at least actually in Seattle on IPO day told a local paper that he was ""very happy"" and ""might go out for some champagne later to celebrate"". What a couple of maniacs!

Fortunes Made

Here's what happened to Microsoft in the 30 years since it has been a public company.

Microsoft (both the company and the stock price) grew at an unbelievable pace after going public. By 1990 annual revenue topped $1 billion. By 1997 the company was generating $10 billion in revenue. In 2020 Microsoft generated $143 billion in revenue $53 billion in operating income while returning $35 billion to shareholders in dividends.

As of this writing the company has a market cap of $1.7 trillion.

Bill Gates officially became a billionaire for the first time about a year after the IPO in 1987. By the mid 1990s as his net worth topped $10 billion Bill was anointed the richest person in the world a title he held without contention for the next twenty years. His net worth crossed $40 billion for the first time in 1997. In 1999 at the height of dotcom fever his net worth broke $100 billion for the first time.

As of this writing Bill Gates is the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $137 billion. Interestingly he actually does not own that much Microsoft anymore. Today Bill owns less than 1.3% of the company he founded. He has donated tens of billions of dollars to charity and intends to give the majority of his fortune away before he dies.

Paul Allen actually left Microsoft in the mid-1980s but stayed on the company's board of directors until 2000. Paul used his fortune to invest in companies like Dreamworks and an impressive portfolio of real estate. He owned three sports teams the Seattle Seahawks Seattle Sounders FC and the Portland Trailblazers. He had a net worth of $20 billion at the time of his death in October 2018. His wealth will eventually be donated to charity. The estate is currently managed by his sister Jody Allen.

Steve Ballmer took over as Microsoft CEO in 2000 when Bill Gates stepped back from the company. He served as CEO until 2014. He still owns around 333 million shares of Microsoft and has a personal net worth of $87 billion. That makes him the 10th-richest person in the world. Ballmer owns the Los Angeles Clippers. As of this writing it's unclear what Ballmer plans to do with his wealth. Interestingly he is NOT joined Bill Gates' Giving Pledge.

$10000 Invested In 1986

So how much would you be worth today if you bought a bunch of MSFT shares and held on to them for 35 years?

If you had bought $10000 worth of Microsoft on the IPO day you would have been able to acquire 476 shares. After various stock splits and dividend reinvestments today you would own 137088 shares.

At today's closing price your stake would be worth $32215680.

When Microsoft pays its quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share you would receive $76769. That's $307076 per year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbmV3LXBvYy1mb3ItbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4Y2hhbmdlLWJ1Z3MtcHV0cy1hdHRhY2tzLWluLXJlYWNoLW9mLWFueW9uZS_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L25ldy1wb2MtZm9yLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1leGNoYW5nZS1idWdzLXB1dHMtYXR0YWNrcy1pbi1yZWFjaC1vZi1hbnlvbmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New PoC for Microsoft Exchange bugs puts attacks in reach of anyone,"A security researcher has released a new proof-of-concept exploit this weekend that requires slight modification to install web shells on Microsoft Exchange servers vulnerable to the actively exploited ProxyLogon vulnerabilities.

Since Microsoft disclosed actively exploited Microsoft Exchange security vulnerabilities known collectively as ProxyLogon administrators and security researchers have been scrambling to protect vulnerable servers exposed on the Internet.

These attacks are being used to drop web shells cryptominers and more recently the DearCry ransomware on exploited servers.

Earlier this week a security researcher named Nguyen Jang published a blog post detailing a proof of concept (POC) exploit for the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerability. Jang also shared a purposely broken exploit on GitHub that needs some fixes to work properly.

""Firstly the PoC I gave can not run correctly. It will be crashed with many of errors. Just for trolling the reader"" Jang told BleepingComputer.

The PoC though provided enough information that security researchers and threat actors could use it to develop a functional remote code execution exploit for Microsoft Exchange servers.

Soon after the PoC was published Jang received an email from Microsoft-owned GitHub stating that the PoC was being taken down as it violated Acceptable Use Policies.

In a statement to BleepingComputer GitHub said they took down the PoC to protect devices that are being actively exploited.

""We understand that the publication and distribution of proof of concept exploit code has educational and research value to the security community and our goal is to balance that benefit with keeping the broader ecosystem safe. In accordance with our Acceptable Use Policies GitHub disabled the gist following reports that it contains proof of concept code for a recently disclosed vulnerability that is being actively exploited."" - GitHub.

New exploit puts it in reach of script kiddies

This weekend a different security researcher published a new ProxyLogon PoC that requires very little modification to exploit a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server and drop a web shell on it.

Will Dormann a Vulnerability Analyst at the CERT/CC tested the vulnerability on a Microsoft exchange server and told BleepingComputer that it worked with very little modification.

""It's within the reach of ""script kiddie"" now"" warned Dormann in our discussion about the PoC.

As you can see from the image below Dormann used the exploit against a Microsoft Exchange server and remotely installed a web shell and executed the 'whoami' command.

Exploiting a Microsoft Exchange server

Another image shared by Dormann shows that the exploit dropped the test11.aspx web shell in the specified location on the server.

Web shell dropped on exploited Microsoft Exchange server

Didier Stevens a senior analyst at NVISO and SANS ISC senior handler also tested the exploit against a Microsoft Exchange virtual machine but did not have as much luck with the PoC.

In a conversation with BleepingComputer Stevens said that he tested the new PoC against an unpatched Exchange 2016 with no cumulative updates. Still the PoC would not work without tweaking some Active Directory settings.

However Stevens said that new information in the PoC released this weekend enabled him to get Jang's PoC working to achieve successful remote code execution against his Microsoft Exchange server.

Stevens also agreed with Dormann's assessment that the information disclosed in the new PoC would make it easier for less-skilled threat actors known as 'Script Kiddies' to create a working ProxyLogon exploit.

Due to the large number of vulnerable servers still exposed on the Internet BleepingComputer will not be sharing links to the PoC released this weekend.

80000 Exchange servers still vulnerable

With exploits for the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities becoming publicly available it is more important than ever that administrators patch their servers.

According to Palo Alto Networks' research there are approximately 80000 vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers exposed on the Internet.

""The number of vulnerable servers running old versions of Exchange that cannot directly apply the recently released security patches dropped over 30% from an estimated 125000 to 80000 according to Expanse internet scans conducted March 8 and 11"" Palo Alto Networks told BleepingComputer.

Microsoft also warned that even though there has been a significant drop of vulnerable servers there are still many that need to be patched.

""Based on telemetry from RiskIQ we saw a total universe of nearly 400000 Exchange servers on March 1. By March 9 there were a bit more than 100000 servers still vulnerable. That number has been dropping steadily with only about 82000 left to be updated"" Microsoft stated in a blog post.

Many of these servers are for older versions that did not have available security updates.

On Thursday Microsoft released additional security updates for older versions of Microsoft Exchange which now cover 95% of the servers exposed on the Internet."

When the pandemic hit business dried up for Boston-based corporate catering company Alchemista.

It had previously provided food for staff at companies including Splunk and TripAdvisor. As people switched to working from home Alchemista was left with only one main client – pharma giant Moderna which has developed a coronavirus vaccine.

But Alchemista's CEO Christine Marcus used this as an opportunity to pivot her business. It's launching a network of patent-pending food lockers which will be deployed across offices schools and residential blocks and stocked with chef-made meals.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The company is focused on expanding them to residential buildings Marcus told Insider but also plans to roll them out to offices college and university campuses.

The lockers are simple to use. You scan the QR code on the locker's tablet screen which takes you to a payment site. After you've paid the locker unlocks. This means you don't even need an app to use them – and the whole process takes four seconds Marcus said.

Because they're contactless they're suitable for use during a pandemic too.

The lockers are temperature-controlled with different versions available for heated ambient and refrigerated meals and they use UV light which the company said kills 99.9% of bacteria.

As well as an on-demand service Alchemista lets you order up to 12 hours in advance too via its website.

Alchemista doesn't just provide the lockers. It provides the food too. It has an in-house culinary team that makes the meals and delivery drivers who bring them to the lockers each day.

Alchemista pivoted to food lockers after its corporate catering business came to a ""screeching halt""

Before the pandemic companies were trying to boost their corporate perks with offerings such as free meals to attract staff in cities with competitive labor markets – like Boston.

Alchemista launched in the Massachusetts city in 2012 to provide off-site high-quality chef-made meals to businesses who would essentially outsource it with the management of their food and beverage program. At first Alchemista used third-party restaurants but by 2019 it was delivering around 2000 meals a day and restaurants might not be able to keep up.

With this in mind it decided to launch an in-house culinary team which went on to provide most of its meals. It also launched operations in New York and Washington DC where it experienced rapid growth Marcus said.

Unfortunately the pandemic caused the business to come ""to a screeching halt"" because it exclusively provided corporate catering she said. ""COVID basically brought our business to a complete stop except one customer"" which was vaccine-maker Moderna she added.

The business pivoted to food lockers selling individually boxed meals. Alchemista had the technology to deploy them before the pandemic but because corporate catering was focused on encouraging staff to be social people weren't interested.

As well as chef-made meals the lockers also sell charcuterie kits and snacks such as bagels made by a local bakery. This means the lockers can give smaller food businesses the opportunity to reach more customers.

Alchemista also provides high-tech contactless vending machines that allow customers to select products using an app.

Marcus said the trend of companies providing corporate catering would continue after the pandemic but as people adopt flexible working patterns companies might pivot to food lockers instead. ""I think it's going to be a very different world when people go back to work"" she said.

The compact nature of food lockers – Alchemista's larger versions have space for 19 meals and are roughly 6 foot by 2.6 foot – enables companies to reduce their real estate footprint compared with on-site catering.

It's not just offices that Marcus has her eyes on. In Boston she's rolling out lockers in the lobbies of residential blocks where people can collect restaurant-made meals prepared by James Beard award-winning chefs including wild mushroom risotto paella and braised beef.

Marcus hopes to expand even more in the future too. She envisages the food lockers could be deployed across train stations bus stops college campuses and schools.

Dynamify a company that provides software services to contract caterers including Alchemista told Insider demand for food lockers had ""exploded"" during the pandemic especially in pharma companies and hospitals.

""In the long-term we don't believe food lockers will completely replace traditional restaurant pick-up"" Dynamify's CEO Maxwell Harding said.

""However we do see food lockers persisting in restaurants with 24/7 customers particularly manufacturing sites and hospitals"" he added noting they're particularly useful for staff working night shifts.

Kassidi Kurill of Ogden died on February 5 after falling ill and being rushed to hospital.

Her family who are still awaiting results of her autopsy believe her death may have been the results of complications due to the COVID-19 vaccine because she had no known health issues.

Dr Erik Christensen Chief Medical Examiner for the Utah Department of Health disputed that belief this week after Kurill's death garnered national media attention saying that it was only 'temporally related' to her second vaccine dose.

Christensen said his office hasn't certified any vaccine-related deaths so far and that there doesn't appear to be a link between the death of four Utah residents - one of which is Kurill - and the vaccines.

'We don't have any evidence that there are connections between the vaccines and deaths at this point' he told Fox News. 'We don't have any indication of that.'

Dr Erik Christensen (pictured) Chief Medical Examiner for the Utah Department of Health urged the public not to jump to conclusions about Kurill's death

Christensen noted that side effects from the vaccine are common and that each person's response is determined by their unique biology.

'Certainly there are side effects of a vaccine that are directly linkable to the vaccine and what's going on in your body' he said.

'You know the pain in the arm ...the fever-like symptoms related to your immune response to what was put into you. Those kinds of things clearly happen.'

He said proving the vaccine was a cause of death is very rare unless there was an immediate case anaphylaxis which would be an instant death.

An autopsy which the family are still waiting on can potentially reveal an undiagnosed condition that may have caused the death Christensen added.

Kurill's family say the mother-of-one was healthy and had no pre-existing conditions prior to her sudden death.

'She was seemingly healthy as a horse' Kurill's father Alfred Hawley told Fox News.

'She was healthy happy and active the greatest mom you ever saw in your life and then she was so sick that in less than 12 hours intubated and on life support.'

Kurill worked as a surgical tech for several plastic surgeons. Healthcare workers in Utah were among the first to be eligible to receive the vaccine.

She received her second vaccine dose on February 1 and began complaining the following day about headaches nausea and being unable to urinate despite drinking fluids.

Her condition improved slightly on her second day post-vaccination but she took a turn for the worse and was rushed to the hospital on February 4.

'She came in early and said her heart was racing and she felt like she need to get to the emergency room' her father said.

CDC says no deaths are linked to COVID vaccine safety Of the more than 92 million COVID vaccine doses administered in the US to date fewer than 1700 deaths have been reported the CDC says. The FDA requires vaccine providers to report any death after a COVID vaccine to the Vaccine Adverse Event Report System otherwise known as VAERS. Four Utah residents are currently listed on that database and one of them is believed to be Kurill. Anyone can submit reports to the VAERS database including family next of kin and doctors. It is an unverified reporting system that does not determine if a vaccine caused the death that is reported. 'To date VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines' the CDC website states. Advertisement

When she arrived at the hospital Kurill immediately began throwing up as doctors worked to figure out an explanation.

'They did a blood test and immediately came back and said she was very very sick and her liver was not functioning' Hawley said.

Kurill was airlifted that night to the Intermountain Medical Center in Murray where doctors tried to stabilize her for a liver transplant.

Her condition continued to deteriorate to the point that she was unable to talk by the next morning and her heart and kidneys shut down.

'She got worse and worse throughout the day. And at nine o'clock she passed' Hawley said.

'It was a total shock. I was even afraid to tell my wife.'

Hawley said that until the family gets other data they 'must believe there was something with the shot'.

But he did say that he hopes his daughter's experience will not discourage others from getting vaccinated. He urged anyone experiencing symptoms after the vaccine to take them seriously.

'If you have a reaction to it don't ignore it. Don't be stoic and just say: 'Oh I'll be fine' he said. 'Pay attention. If it persists beyond a day you might ought to go see a doctor. And make sure that you're not another one in a million.'

Loved ones set up a GoFundMe campaign to support Kurill's nine-year-old daughter Emilia.

“We were gearing up to release Whango about a year ago in March 2020” said Mark Rieth Atwater Brewery president. “But then COVID disrupted our plans just as it disrupted so much of our daily lives. Atwater was proud to be able to quickly pivot to hand sanitizer production much of which we donated to first responders health care workers and others on the COVID front lines.

“Now however we’re pleased to be able to bring Whango back for its seasonal production run in 2021. Spring and summer are incredible seasons in the Midwest and nothing completes the perfect backyard BBQ trip to the beach or other outdoor celebration quite like a Whango. We say that if summer could be poured into a can it would look and taste like Whango.”

To mark the occasion Atwater will be tapping Whango at each of its Michigan taphouses on March 17 at 4:00 p.m. At the same time Whango will be available at retailers and brew pubs across Michigan and across the Great Lakes region.

Atwater’s Whango

ABV 4.90% IBU:14

Style: Fruit Beer Color: Straw

Whango is one of Atwater’s fruitiest most flavorful ales. Softly sweet and tropically aromatic Whango is an American-style wheat beer similar to but less yeasty than its German Weizen (or wheat ) cousins. German pale wheat malt lends this clean offering a lightly citric crispness at the back of the palate. The addition of real mango adds a soft sweet roundness to the body and natural mango flavoring lifts the aroma to match.

In previous years the Whango product completely sold out just a couple of months into its run. Atwater owner Mark Rieth has committed to increasing production this year to ensure Whango remains on the shelf throughout the glorious summer season.

Like all Atwater products Whango was Born in Detroit and Raised Everywhere.

Oh Hi

I was trying to cut back on my alcohol consumption when I started drinking THC-infused beverages. To my surprise it worked.My favorite these days is Oh Hi  a THC-infused seltzer made in Durango. It comes in four flavors: Pomegranate Grapefruit and Lemon Lime which each have 10 milligrams per serving and Ginger Basil Limeade with 5 milligrams.“Oh Hi is the beginning of something really big” says John Lynch the company’s head of operations and compliance. “Before COVID a lot of people were drinking less especially millennials. There were a lot of mocktail bars. We feel like this is a natural fit for people who don’t want the adverse effects of drinking alcohol. It’s a way of consuming cannabis in a lower dose in a social setting.”Since one serving isn’t enough for many people Lynch explains the company created a new line called Budtender’s Reserve for experienced cannabis users. Each bottle in this line has 100 milligrams of THC so that people who know the type of effect they want can curate their own experience.Budtender’s Reserve comes in Tropical Thunder a Budtender’s Reserve energy drink that has electrolytes and caffeine to fuel an active lifestyle and High Tea iced tea with a twist of lemon. Oh Hi is coming out with three more Budtender’s Reserve flavors in the next few months; Grateful Grape will debut in March.Lynch recommends filling a shot glass which would be about 10 milligrams and then pouring your Budtender’s Reserve of choice over ice. Budtender’s Reserve also can be mixed with other beverages such as club soda coffee or iced tea to enhance the flavor.“We’re really trying to hit everyone’s palate” he explains. “We went really heavy on citrus with the seltzers so we’re trying to expand and make sure we cover all palates.”When Oh Hi was in its infancy it formed a partnership with Stillwater Brands  the maker of the Ripple line of products which includes gummies and powders that can be mixed into beverages.I keep a couple of packets of Ripple in my purse for when I go out to add to club soda in place of a cocktail. There are three versions of Ripple dissolvables: Pure which has 10 milligrams of THC per packet; Balanced which has 5 milligrams of THC and 5 milligrams of CBD; and Relief which has 20 milligrams of CBD and 0.5 milligrams of THC.“When we first launched Ripple we launched it as a beverage enhancer because you could put it into anything but it was too wide of an application” recalls Missy Bradley Stillwater’s director of brand and marketing. “It’s still considered a beverage in many dispensaries because they don’t have a dissolvables category.”I haven’t tried it but Bradley says Ripple pairs nicely with citrus beverages. She particularly likes adding it to horchata. “It’s like a dessert and its a fun thing and tastes so good” she says.For ready-to-drink THC-infused beverages there’s Phyx  a sparkling water produced by Denver-based Spherex. The THC in the zero-calorie beverage takes effect in about ten minutes and lasts for about an hour. The drink comes in four flavors: Grapefruit Dragonfruit Lime and All Natural.Phyx which is packaged in glass bottles similar to those used by Voss Water launched with a beverage that has 2.5 milligrams of THC and 2.5 milligrams of CBD so that the consumer is not overwhelmed. The company has since increased the concentration of THC for some of the beverages in its line to 10 milligrams.“Phyx is geared toward women who are busy with work married and have families” explains Katie Bajcar director of marketing for Spherex. “They want a product without their kids knowing what they’re drinking. They’re looking for something that is a little more private and discreet and that doesn’t require accessories like a lighter or a torch.”In an effort to keep customers who might otherwise be lured away from a frosty cold one some breweries are coming out with their own lines of beverages infused with cannabidiol — including Molson Coors Beverage Co. Molson Coors recently launched its Veryvell line of non-alcoholic sparkling CBD beverages under Truss CBD USA a joint venture formed with the Ottawa Ontario-based consumer packaged goods cannabis company Hexo Corp. Veryvell had already introduced its sparkling waters in Canada including a version with THC infused into the beverage. Quicksilver Scientific provides the patent-pending nanoemulsion delivery technology for Veryvell. The droplets sheathing the minuscule CBD particles are so small that they pass between cells and enter the bloodstream directly making for faster absorption and higher bioavailability in the body.“Molson Coors saw the opportunity to bring the right brand to the U.S. and launch it in a CBD-friendly market like Colorado” says David Durkee vice president of new ventures at Louisville-based Quicksilver Scientific. “CBD had been prevalent in Colorado for more than eight years by the time legalization was happening in Canada.”Before joining Quicksilver Scientific Durkee spent nearly a decade in a wide range of roles at Molson Coors including a stint in global product development.Veryvell has zero calories zero sugar and comes in three flavors: Focus (Grapefruit Tarragon) Mind & Body (Strawberry Hibiscus) and Unwind (Blueberry Lavender). Each 12-ounce can contains 20 milligrams of CBD; the suggested retail price is $3.99 for a can or $14.99 for a four-pack. Veryvell is available at more than 150 retailers including Argonaut Applejack Bubbles Davidson’s Tipsy’s and Total Beverage.“It’s too early to speculate on sales” says Jane Armstrong Hockman general manager of Truss CBD USA. “However CBD beverages are a growing segment within the non-alcohol beverage category and we think it could become a meaningful category in Colorado.”Even companies that aren’t infusing their beverages with CBD or THC are moving toward appealing to cannabis-minded customers. Atlanta-based SweetWater Brewing Co. introduced its line in Colorado on January; the company’s flagship beer is 420 Extra Pale Ale a West Coast-style pale ale with big hops and a crisp finish that was first brewed in 1997.In November SweetWater was acquired by Canadian cannabis company Aphria which recently merged with Tilray to become the largest cannabis company in the world. Not surprisingly SweetWater plans to infuse some of its beverages with THC and CBD in the future according to Brian Miesieski head of marketing and innovation.“We consider ourselves to be the cannabis lifestyle brand in the world of beer” Miesieski says. “Aphria is eventually going to set up shop in the U.S. and get their brands into the U.S. We have that behind us to help us navigate these waters.”I’ll drink to that.",,,,,,

Dominick Cruz recently caused some noise when he called out Monster Energy’s Hans Molenkamp in his post-fight interview at UFC 259 after winning his first fight in almost 5 years against a young lion in Casey Kenney.

Many expected him to call out a big-name opponent for his next fight. However ‘The Dominator’ went for Hans Molenkamp instead.

Many fans were unaware of Molenkamp and were puzzled as they couldn’t understand the reason behind Cruz’s bizarre call out. However Cruz is not the first fighter historically to have expressed his discontent against him.

Molenkamp happens to hold a very powerful position in Monster Energy.

UFC’s middleweight champion Israel Adesanya is also another person who doesn’t want to promote the brand Monster Energy. At the UFC 259 pre-fight press conference Adesanya dropped his water bottle labeled with the company’s name from the table. He has also thrown out Monster Energy cans from his table before at the UFC 243 press-conference.

Monster Energy has been a long-time sponsor of the UFC. And they pay good amounts to the company and especially its fighters.

But some individuals of the company use this as an opportunity to use the fighters for their self promotion. UFC President Dana White has also had some tense moments in the Molenkamp in the past.

UFC fighters and Hans Molenkamp

Molenkamp is an official of Monster Energy. According to some fighters he forces UFC fighters to comment like and more on his Instagram page.

Fighters like Jorge Masvidal Tony Ferguson even Dominick Cruz and more regularly interact with Molenkamp on his social media posts.

Molenkamp often shares clips of him training with Jon Jones. However according to some fighters Molenkamp forces them to do so.

He is the one that decides who gets the bonuses from Monster and who doesn’t. And Monster pay a hefty sum to fighters as bonuses. So nobody wants to miss out on that.

Whether this saga takes any major turns remains to be seen. However it’s unlikely that the UFC will allow it to proceed any further considering the relationship they share with Monster. So eventually one might expect it to be sorted out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3N1bmRheS12aWJlcy8yMDIxLzAzLzY3MzY3MS9kaWVoYXJkLW1hbGF5c2lhbi10b3R0ZW5oYW0taG90c3B1ci1mYW4tZGl2dWxnZXMtaGlzLWVuZHVyaW5n0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnN0LmNvbS5teS9hbXAvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3N1bmRheS12aWJlcy8yMDIxLzAzLzY3MzY3MS9kaWVoYXJkLW1hbGF5c2lhbi10b3R0ZW5oYW0taG90c3B1ci1mYW4tZGl2dWxnZXMtaGlzLWVuZHVyaW5n?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diehard Malaysian Tottenham Hotspur fan divulges on his enduring love affair with the Spurs!,,,,,,,

Throughout her exceptional career Carla Harris has exemplified the highest ideals of American enterprise championed the principle that opportunity should never be denied on the basis of gender or race and generously mentored countless rising leaders” said Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins C.S.C. “Enriched by her gifts as a singer and public speaker her work in the competitive world of banking is firmly rooted in her commitment to service developing the next generation of leaders and her Catholic faith.”

Harris began her career at a time when very few of her colleagues were Black or women and her trajectory has been steadily ascendant. She was chair of the Morgan Stanley Foundation from 2005 to 2014 and is a member of the boards for Harvard University and the Walmart Corp.

In 2013 Harris was appointed by President Barack Obama to chair the National Women’s Business Council an independent counsel to the president Congress and the U.S. Small Business Administration.

Characteristic of Harris’ approach to her own success has been a mantra that has carried her beyond many obstacles and naysayers: “Never count yourself out.” Harris coaches others with a “negative motivation” approach leveraging what people say cannot be done into energy to prove them wrong. She likewise understands her successes as a responsibility to help others saying “We are blessed so that we may be a blessing to others.""

Consistent with this belief Harris has mentored hundreds of associates and led efforts focused on promoting women and people of color in business. She oversees Morgan Stanley’s multicultural client strategy and helped build the company’s Multicultural Innovation Lab which brings together companies on an accelerator program for innovative tech startups led by multicultural entrepreneurs.

Harris is the author of “Expect to Win” and “Strategize to Win” which she wrote to share what she has learned about pathways to career success.

Harris began singing at age 9 at a fourth-grade talent show and progressed to Baptist and Catholic church choirs in her teens Harvard’s renowned Radcliffe Choral Society the St. Charles Gospelites and her own band Rhythm Company. She has released multiple albums and produced and performed sold-out benefit concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theatre.

Born in Port Arthur Texas and raised in Jacksonville Florida Harris is the daughter of a school teacher and a commercial fishing boat captain. She attended Bishop Kenny High School and graduated with honors in 1980. When a guidance counselor suggested Harris avoid applying to Ivy League schools due to their competitiveness she channeled this negativity into determination and applied to state schools as well as Ivies. She was accepted to all but chose Harvard where she graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in economics; she later earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School with second-year honors.

In 2001 Harris married her high school sweetheart Victor Franklin at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Harlem where she remains an active parishioner. The couple and their two daughters Dakota and McKinley reside nearby.

The Laetare (pronounced lay-TAH-ray) Medal is so named because its recipient is announced each year in celebration of Laetare Sunday the fourth Sunday in Lent on the Church calendar. “Laetare” the Latin word for “rejoice” is the first word in the entrance antiphon of the Mass that Sunday which ritually anticipates the celebration of Easter. The medal bears the Latin inscription “Magna est veritas et praevalebit” (“Truth is mighty and it shall prevail”).

Established at Notre Dame in 1883 the Laetare Medal was conceived as an American counterpart of the Golden Rose a papal honor that antedates the 11th century. The medal has been awarded annually at Notre Dame to a Catholic “whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences illustrated the ideals of the Church and enriched the heritage of humanity.”

Previous recipients of the Laetare Medal include Civil War Gen. William Rosecrans operatic tenor John McCormack President John F. Kennedy Catholic Worker founder Dorothy Day novelist Walker Percy labor activist Monsignor George G. Higgins Homeboy Industries founder Rev. Gregory Boyle S.J. Rio Grande Valley Catholic Charities Executive Director Sister Norma Pimentel M.J. civil rights and education leader Norman Francis singer Aaron Neville and actor Martin Sheen.

Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress agree on few things but they concur on one issue: the poor state of America’s infrastructure from roads and bridges to electricity grids public transit and broadband.

A report released this month by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country’s infrastructure a grade of C- lifting it from the D range for the first time in 20 years. But the report warned that “the COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on infrastructure revenue streams threaten to derail the modest progress we’ve made over the past four years”.

Last month President Joe Biden warned that unless the US makes significant improvements in infrastructure it risks falling behind China which could in his words “eat our lunch”.

“They’re investing billions of dollars dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation the environment and . . . other things” he said. “We just have to step up.”

Many US roads bridges ports and water supply systems were built in the 1950s and 1960s so they are outdated and in need of replacement. On that deeply divided Republicans and Democrats can easily agree. However they are squaring up for a fight over who will pay for it.

Biden has made it clear that fixing America’s infrastructure is a priority for his new administration now that his initial Covid-19 relief bill has made it through Congress.

On the campaign trail last year Biden proposed spending $2tn over four years to fix highways bridges and airports build greener homes expand broadband and encourage electric car use with a charging network to serve them.

But since entering the White House he has given no details of exactly how this infrastructure spending will be organised or how he will finance it.

$2trn The amount Biden pledged to spend on infrastructure

His predecessor President Trump came into office in 2017 also promising an infrastructure boom and a rejuvenation of crumbling roads ports and bridges. Little came of it. Experts on congressional politics say the same fate could await Biden’s infrastructure ambitions with fundamental disagreements between the two sides over what counts as infrastructure — not to mention whether or not to raise taxes to pay for it.

Some believe Biden may try to move an infrastructure plan through Congress via the budget reconciliation process a parliamentary procedure that may allow him to get legislation through without significant Republican support.

But many large institutional investors are dubious about whether a big infrastructure package will get through Congress says Stephen Volkmann machinery and industrials analyst at Jefferies the investment bank. “Everybody feels like ‘we’ve seen this movie before’ we’ve been at the starting line waiting for that gun to go off and they keep cancelling the meet” he explains. “There’s a fair amount of scepticism that we will get anything really meaningful.”

One problem is that Democrats have a much broader definition of infrastructure than the Republicans says Volkmann. “So they put through a big plan that includes broadband and public transit while the Republicans think of roads and bridges” he points out. “That’s part of the reason they can’t agree on things.”

But industrials analyst Mig Dobre at investment manager Baird thinks the circumstances are different today from when efforts were made to pass infrastructure legislation in the past.

“What feels different this time is where we are in the economic cycle” he says. “We are trying to recover from an economic recession unlike anything that we have seen before I think there’s a different willingness to consider the role of government in stimulating economic growth especially on something that makes structural sense like infrastructure.”

An infrastructure package could catalyse a building-materials supercycle similar to what we saw back in the 1950s

If a significant infrastructure funding bill were to pass Congress “quite a few American manufacturing and industrial companies would benefit” he says — citing Caterpillar and John Deere because of incremental demand for their construction equipment.

He also cites smaller companies such as road building machinery maker Astec Industries and crane manufacturer Manitowoc “especially if you’re going to do a lot of bridge maintenance work”.

“But it’s not just machinery companies” he adds noting that businesses such as Eaton Corporation — the power management company — could benefit if there is increased investment in electric infrastructure or electric car charging stations.

Courtney Yakavonis US machinery analyst at banking group Morgan Stanley suggests an infrastructure programme could “catalyse a building-materials supercycle similar to what we saw back in the 1950s” — the heyday of US road building. She predicts a boom for aggregates companies that provide materials for road building such as Vulcan Materials and Summit Materials as well as Martin Marietta.

A recent Morgan Stanley report titled “Paving the way for US Infrastructure Super Cycle” found that protecting US cities from global warming could require supplies of cement and aggregates over and above that needed for repairs to roads and bridges.

Elizabeth Vermillion equity analyst at CFRA Research agrees that “if spending does happen under Biden there’s definitely going to be more of a green and climate initiative tilt to it so companies that have their foot in that arena are definitely going to be able to capitalise”.

In the transport sector she includes not just electric carmakers but also companies such as Cummins which is working on electric buses.

At the same time construction and engineering companies can get in on the work of upgrading the electrical grid and expanding the 5G network.

So is the US on the verge of another quantum leap on infrastructure as in the 1950s? Not quite — or not yet. “The need for something like that might be there but I don’t think it will be on that level of magnitude” cautions Vermillion. “Especially with the pandemic — I think people aren’t going to vote for something that dramatic”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9hLXJlbHVjdGFudC1qYXBhbi1pbmMtYXQtbGFzdC1lbnRlcnMtdGhlLWRpZ2l0YWwtYWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A reluctant Japan Inc at last enters the digital age,"A S A BUDDHIST priest performed last rites at a temple in Tokyo Naganuma Fumihiro an entrepreneur beamed.

Hodges and Sigrid Rasmussen in Milwaukee Wis. on July 13 1928. She passed away on Wednesday evening March 10 2021 at age 92. She was guided to that transition by the love of those gathered including family and friends; and by the sounds of a familiar whistle her father famously whistled while working menial jobs. Ms. Catherine is survived by two dear sons David and Robert ""Bobby"" as well as his wife Brenda. She is survived by a sister Marillyn Holmes of Grenada Hills Calif.; her nieces Hynndie Wali of Hollywood California Barbara Bullock (Gary McKay) of Memphis Tenn. and Cyrille Bullock and a nephew Bill Bullock (Teresa) of Memphis and their two boys Will and Price (Vanessa). Two grandsons Lee Hamilton and Brandon Romero (Lisa) and her two great-grandchildren Catherine and Alexander Romero. Relatives that preceded her in death include husband David Cowle Hamilton (Little Rock) and second husband Jack Hepinstall (Houston Texas); her parents; her step-mother Isabel Hodges her uncle Essie Rasmussen and aunt Ella Rasmussen. Also surviving are step-daughters Margie Kathy Becky Hepinstall and their husbands as well as a step-son Randy Hepinstall. Mrs. Hamilton was a highly regarded chemistry schoolteacher in Arkansas during the 1960's 70's and 80's retiring to a long and comfortable retirement in 1989. A few years later she married her original high school sweetheart Jack and expanded her family with four new step kids. She was also a devoted member of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral beginning in 1959. That was the year she moved ‘down from the mountain' – Petit Jean Mountain – with little David in tow big David having a job as assistant president of Winrock Enterprises and little Bobby on the way. Her earlier life began consciously in Memphis in 1932 in the depression. Memphis would become her home away from home for those 62 years spent in the Cammack Village/Kingwood area of northern Little Rock. Then at about 10 her industrious lumber mill owner dad took his family of three girls to Pass Christian. Catherine spent a couple of boarding school years at All Saints in Vicksburg Miss. During her WWII high school years she lived in New Orleans La. on Jefferson Avenue near Tulane/Newcombe where she matriculated and met returning GI David C. They married in 1949 the first pair of students to ever marry while in college there. The two ventured to Boston (Cambridge) where she worked as a graduate researcher at MIT on chemical soil modification to harden runways in Korea. She helped David C. earn an MBA at Harvard. Then in 1952 it was Queens and Brooklyn N. Y. She worked at Pfizer Corporation again as a researcher in medicine. Upon a request by Winthrop Rockefeller who met David C. at Morgan Stanley in 1957 the two came to Arkansas to work on Petit Jean. She became a housewife. In the mid 60's as a single mom she began teaching in LR Public Schools at the request of neighbor Terrell Powell (principal of Hall High School). She distinguished herself and was named science department chairman in about 1975. In 1987 she was named runner up Arkansas Teacher of the Year and began a text book consulting service to Merrill Publishing. Mrs. Hamilton blended a life of science the arts and religion. Moved by Carson's ""Silent Spring"" she initiated ecological teaching at Hall High in 1970: ""Science and Survival"" was her course's name. In 1981 she was the first woman named a commissioner to the Little Rock Sewer Committee. Later in retirement she assisted the Halberg Camp for Audubon Arkansas. Mrs. Hamilton was a super avid reader of religious books especially. She loved the Arkansas Symphony being a one-time local piano teacher and the Arts Center. She was a good soprano singer. She decorated her home very tastefully and prepared gorgeous and very tasty meals. She was an artist at life. However she was also modest not show-biz. Among the things she found illuminating were: the college at out-of-the-way Sewanee Tenn.; bird watching and gardening the Grande Maumelle Sailing Club; Rev. Dean Higgins and Rev. Joel Pugh of Trinity; smart kids; her off-grid family lodge at Low Gap Arkansas on the Buffalo river; and simple friends. In fact what she cherished most was friends. She was a member of AAUW and attended their monthly book club for years. She was very active in a monthly lunch group attended classes at Life Quest was a long time member of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and attended a weekly bible study group at Pulaski Heights Presbyterian Church. She was also a brave voyager; her life can be thought of as a very long voyage. It is epitomized in the true voyage she took with her sons and niece Cyrille and parents up and down the east coast in 1964 on her dad's sailing yacht the Man-a-wa-nui. Every major port and sight-seeing venture was taken in from the New York World's Fair and Washington DC to sleepy Hyannis Port Mass. to elegant Charleston S.C. Interspersed were ‘weeks at sea' with scary storms and majestic sunny summer days sailing with porpoises. Arrangements for a memorial service at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral are being made.

This week our 6 Questions go to Harumi Urata-Thompson chief financial officer and chief investment officer of Celsius

Harumi Urata-Thompson is the chief financial officer and chief investment officer of Celsius. Additionally she is the founder of Hut Consulting and the former chief operating officer for the CFA Society New York for which she completed a successful turnaround during her tenure. Urata-Thompson held multiple senior-level positions at Thomson Reuters and worked at Morgan Stanley and CitiGroup in investment banking. Her expertise is leading and advising organizations on taking innovative paths to achieve strategic operational and marketing success. Among her busy work schedule Harumi manages to find to speak on various topics of interest including blockchain technology cryptocurrency cybersecurity artificial intelligence Big Data outer space among others.

1 — When you tell people you’re in the blockchain industry how do they react?

I get contrasting responses from two different groups of people. If they are already involved with blockchain in one way or another and especially if they already know the company I work for I get “that’s so cool!” every time. From the other group and unfortunately more people are in this group I either get a blank look get a question of “what is Bitcoin good for?” or worse yet “oh and you support the criminals.” Regarding the first group I agree with them — I wake up excited every day still. For the second group this can be addressed with education. Financial literacy which includes cryptocurrency is a big part of me; I am a career financial services professional and a CFA charter holder. I like sharing my knowledge and experience so regardless of the venue I am asked to come to present. I always enjoy doing that.

2 — What do you think will be the biggest trend in blockchain for the next 12 months?



I am not sure if I can call this the “biggest trend” or even “trend” for that matter and it certainly will not be limited to the next 12 months but questioning the use case of blockchain as we are past the initial excitement of “what is blockchain.” That or billions of dollars raised from ICOs came and went is definitely something that we absolutely have to take a hard look at as we move forward.

I have been involved in the startup and product management world for a while now and there is always one question I have to ask myself: Whose problem am I (you) solving? The applicability of blockchain technology is endless. This is just an enabler and it was developed into different needs of multiple industries. I do not believe that we have heard the “it is definitively adopted by the masses” statement yet. So whose problem should we solve that provides us the mass adoption path? I like to address this question from the angle of if I were to invest in a blockchain-based business in the next 12 months what I might look for in the solution. First let’s think through some of the problems that are blocking us from making these technology-based solutions to become mainstream. Regulations uncertainty. This is really a thing and without any bias if I am investing in one business I will try to see if I can find a solution that doesn’t have to deal with as many regulations or on the side of being able to influence or work with the regulators to avoid this issue. Performance. It is not what it can be yet and it probably will take a while so I likely avoid solutions that require extremely fast transactions or requirements to settle millions of transactions at once. Blockchain not being the face of the solution. Unless we can find a way to use blockchain “Intel Inside” way I will not pick a solution whose marketing point #1 is “we are a blockchain company.” When I combine these thoughts together and again if I am investing in only one business at the moment then I would pick a solution that solves a government — i.e. regulator side — issue where we actually do have a known problem that can be solved by leveraging blockchain nature such as immutability transparency and security. How about we solve the problem where the government must send out massive checks like stimulus checks social benefits tax credit so on? I would investigate this kind of solution provider business. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that we have begun to focus on central bank digital currency recently and a lot of talk in the blockchain fintech [industries] is around this topic.

3 — What’s the unlikeliest-to-happen thing on your bucket list?

“500 places to see before you die” kind of has become a thing. For me the more places I go the more places I add to the list and I think my list might be 5000 if not 50000. I can take one or two vacations per year maybe? I try to “knock out” multiple places each time I go away but my ever-expanding list makes it a bit of a challenge to make the “visit every place I want to go to” bucket list a very challenging one. But I always accept the challenge and my glass is always half full so I am sure I have not given up on the idea yet!

4 — What is the single most innovative use case for blockchain you’ve ever seen? It may not be the one likeliest to succeed!

Diamond supply chain. For expensive goods like diamonds (or this can be leveraged into other gems vintage wines or artwork by famous artists from centuries ago) putting the origin and authenticity is extremely tough and diamond in particular which even gem amateurs like myself do think about where the “blood diamond” might be circulating in the economy although I personally have no way of figuring it out on my own. This opaque supply chain amongst other things of course has prohibited diamonds from becoming a major commodity in the financial services industry or having more derivatives beyond becoming someone’s necklace or ring. For the industry whose last innovation was to claim “a diamond is forever” (and thus your love should be too if you engage with it) I think this was an amazing innovation to adopt this technology to connect the whole supply chain from mining all the way to retail by creating a thumbprint of diamonds and a record and put that into the blockchain. While I have no strong opinion why the commodities market developed the way it did there is no reason there is a market for palladium weather or but not for diamond. Gems are hard to have a solid price? None of these do. The regulators and financial professionals did not want to create a product out of conflicted products? Blockchain can now solve that. Although the use might be limited to jewelry there is a fair amount of demand for this gem. While mass adoption of this technology remains to be seen this is an interesting development I’d love to address as we progress forward.

5 —What do your parents/significant other/friends/kids tell you off for? Feel free to offer more than one answer.



I like working and I like getting things done. This means there are times when I might be “disregarding” some of the needs in life and probably my significant other gets the worst end of that. He is the most patient on the planet but at some point he starts coming around trying to take away my laptop and things — as I write this I have put down dinner food on the table and still writing this!



6 —What’s the silliest conspiracy theory out there… and which one makes you pause for a moment?



The earth is flat! If the science is not by my side telling me otherwise it does feel flat it looks flat it smells flat so why not??? The one that makes me pause is things like Area 51. Do we really have something completely covered up in this society?"

But it has been a reliable one not missing a dividend since the mid-1980s and delivering profits in 19 of the last 20 years.

Now as investors are making a broad shift into companies perceived as delivering value the Roseville-based producer of chemicals and specialty ingredients is one of the hottest investments in the country.

Shares in Hawkins have risen 44% this year well above the 6% climb of the S&P 500 index. They closed Friday at $38.91 just shy of a record high set a week earlier.

In January the company reported strong quarterly results with earnings per share that rose 74% for the period ended Dec. 31. Hawkins also announced a 2-for-1 stock split at the end of January. And last month it announced an acquisition that expanded its water-treatment business which operates in 20 states and provides about 30% of revenue.

Often a string of news draws the attention of investors. The company was also recognized by Newsweek magazine in its list of 400 most responsible companies for 2021. But broadly the stocks of chemical companies have fared well in the last six months. And several market analysts have stated that small-cap stocks should outperform the larger stock indexes in 2021.

Patrick Hawkins the company's chief executive said it's hard to explain all the pieces that might contribute to a rising stock price. ""We are a small-cap stock"" he said last week. ""It doesn't take a lot to get that demand up there if people think its undervalued.""

John Parker prepared products for shipping. Hawkins’ health and nutrition business where it provides ingredients for supplements saw a 75% increase in revenue during the latest quarter.

As it did for a lot of industrial firms the coronavirus pandemic created opportunities for the company. For instance its health and nutrition business where it provides ingredients for supplements saw a 75% increase in revenue during the latest quarter.

""When the pandemic hit everybody got back into health wellness and immunity"" Hawkins said. ""We clearly saw an uptick in demand for those products starting last year and we saw that carry through the third quarter of this year.""

He said the beauty of its distribution businesses is that they can adjust the amount of product they move through their system without having to adjust the staffing too much or make capital intensive investments.

""The focus for us is to try and sustain what we've built on. So if we've gotten new customers throughout this process we want them to remain customers long-term"" Hawkins said. ""I think we are well-suited whether it continues to keep on growing or it declines somewhat. We are well-suited to be there one way or the other.""

His grandfather Howard ""Curly"" Hawkins started the company in 1938. The company went public in 1972 when it had annual revenue of $7.2 million and net income of $216000. John Hawkins a son of Curly and uncle of Patrick took it through a second generation of family leadership. After John Hawkins died in 2011 Patrick who started work at the firm's loading dock in 1992 became chief executive.

The firm has done more deals under his leadership including a key acquisition of Stauber Chemical in 2015 that essentially created its food and nutrition group.

""Patrick has an enormous amount of credibility within his organization and within the boardroom"" said James Thompson a former Cargill Inc. and Mosaic Co. executive who is the chairman of Hawkins.

""He has matured into a wonderful leader of this company and a wonderful leader of people. He cares he's responsive and he's respected by employees"" Thompson said.

For much of its history the company was a good but slow-growing commodities company that built its revenue by finding new customers securing reliable suppliers and expanding its distribution network. It has paid a dividend since 1985.

In its last fiscal year industrial customers accounted for more than half of the company's $540 million in revenue. It provides nearly 100 chemical compounds from aluminum chloride to zinc chloride to industrial firms of all sizes.

Water-treatment products accounted for 30% of revenue and health and nutrition products the rest.

For investors and corporate governance analysts Hawkins stands out for its relatively low ratio of CEO-to-employee pay. According to the company's latest proxy Patrick Hawkins' total pay for the most recent year was $1.87 million while the median employee among its 640 employees at the time earned $91452.

That's a ratio of 20-1. At many publicly traded companies the CEO's pay is much higher relative to the average employee.

In part that's because a sizable group inside of Hawkins Inc. — the 175 or so truck drivers who make sales deliver chemicals pump chemicals and do limited service work — command a relatively high salary.

""They have to sell communicate be good at math competitive want to really win but know how to drive a really big truck"" Hawkins said. ""And is willing to deliver hazardous chemicals it's unique — you have to pay them well.""

Nobody in the company is paid less than $15 an hour and the hourly wage of most production workers is well into the $20 range with some nice benefits.

Lancaster City Council’s 5-2 vote allows developer Willow Valley Living to demolish two existing buildings on the South Queen and West Vine streets property and to build a structure with an appearance as proposed.

Council took the advice of the city Historical Commission which had recommended by a 6-0 vote last month that council approve the two “certificates of appropriateness” for the project a venture that would create the county’s tallest building and cost more than $90 million. The commission weighed in because the site is in the city’s Heritage Conservation District.

The 147-unit building for people ages 55 and up would be on a site previously owned by LNP Media Group. Willow Valley Living would raze LNP’s former production building built in 1982 and a former office annex built in 1952. Willow Valley Living would save the historic former home of Jasper Yeates also on the site.

Willow Valley has no timetable set for the demolition as the project must obtain two more city approvals.

Next the proposal will get scrutinized by the city Shade Tree Commission which will review what kind of trees Willow Valley Living wants to plant and where and by the city Planning Commission which will review Willow Valley Living’s land development plan for the structure. Both commissions have final say on their respective issues not council.

All approvals could be obtained as soon as November. Completion could come as soon as 2025 creating 100 to 125 jobs adding 260 residents to downtown and pumping $12.1 million into the local economy a year according to an economic impact study commissioned by Willow Valley Living.

But council members Xavier Garcia-Molina and Janet Diaz opposed the approvals noting the venture’s absence of affordable housing while the city suffers from a chronic shortage of it.

Garcia-Molina said a conversation about affordable housing was necessary given that Mosaic would go “two blocks away our from our Duke Street affordable housing public towers that are crumbling.”

Diaz shared similar concerns.

“We’re constantly promising our community to have actual low income or affordable income housing. And we just keep building and building. And I don’t see anything going forward except — what 82 units? — while we have thousands of people sitting and waiting with their vouchers to actually have a place to live that’s affordable” Diaz said.

Diaz was referring to the number of affordable housing units to be developed at a half-dozen other projects in the city with funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The city announced the funding March 1.

“We understand the importance of affordable housing. We support that. But that is not our business model” said John Swanson CEO of Willow Valley Living. He noted that Willow Valley Living is investing in a business incubator to be created in Southern Market Center across the street from Mosaic.

Chris Delfs the city’s director of community planning and economic development indicated that the city would benefit from more rental housing at all prices.

“We need housing supply in the city. Period. We have a real supply and demand issue happening right now. The market is extremely tight which is pushing up rents” said Delfs.

“So even though it may not appear this way on the surface actually having (additional) housing units in every price point is going to (relieve) that economic pressure on the prices in the city” he continued. “I want to qualify that you can’t only have (additional) units at the higher end of the scale.

Many Vancouver Islanders consider access to the Island’s back country part of their birthright.

But in many cases it’s not it’s a privilege granted by a co-operative neighbour and one that has been jeopardized by misbehaviour.

In an effort at preventing one of Vancouver Island’s largest forest companies from locking its gates to the public a new working group has been formed to provide public access to private forest lands in the Alberni Valley.

On Tuesday March 2 Mosaic Forest Management and the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District (ACRD) announced they had entered into an agreement in partnership with the province to work together to prioritize and explore public access opportunities to areas within or adjacent to Mosaic-managed private forest lands in the Alberni-Clayoquot region.

Through this agreement a working group has been established and a pilot project has been identified.

The pilot project which is expected to launch later this year will allow increased public access on a trial basis to Scout Beach and Lowry Lake. Both of these are provincially-managed recreation sites that are accessed via Mosaic’s privately-owned roads.

Mosaic is evaluating road design signage and other modifications that will allow the public to safely use this industrial road. Once safe parameters are established says Mosaic regular public access through this corridor will be initiated.

The working group will evaluate the results of the pilot project. If it is deemed a success — with no illegal dumping vandalism or risks to the forest — the working group will start to evaluate access solutions for other areas too.

“This agreement presents a positive path forward for all parties as we look to facilitate safe and responsible public enjoyment of Mosaic’s private managed forest lands” said Jeff Zweig Mosaic’s CEO in a press release. “The working group establishes a much-needed forum to mutually address the challenges we face in opening private lands to the public.”

Josie Osborne the MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim said backcountry access is “extremely important” to residents of the Alberni-Clayoquot region.

“Through this partnership agreement the province is helping to increase people’s access to campsites trails and day trip destinations in or near managed forest lands” she said.

John Jack the chair of the ACRD board of directors agreed.

“People choose to live in the Alberni-Clayoquot region in large part because of the area’s natural beauty and the opportunities to enjoy nature and the outdoors” he said. “The ACRD sees this agreement as a significant step toward resolving public concerns related to backcountry access to sites within or adjacent to private lands and we look forward to working with Mosaic and the province to find solutions that support recreation opportunities.”

Over the past few years residents of the Alberni Valley have expressed concern about the lack of access to recreational land surrounding the Valley. The ACRD first reached out to Mosaic back in 2019 with the intention of drafting a tri-partnership agreement with Mosaic and the province in order to provide public access.

Mosaic currently offers weekend public access to some areas of its private managed forests but according to Mosaic this access is limited by issues related to legal liability wildfire risk safety concerns related to forestry operations and industrial traffic and costs associated with illegal dumping and vandalism.

(NASDAQ:LITE) Worth Looking At Closely?,"Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LITE) might not be a large cap stock but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS rising to highs of US$109 and falling to the lows of US$82.91. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Lumentum Holdings' current trading price of US$88.72 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Lumentum Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

View our latest analysis for Lumentum Holdings

What is Lumentum Holdings worth?

The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 35.28x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 34.59x which means if you buy Lumentum Holdings today you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe Lumentum Holdings should be trading in this range then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Lumentum Holdings’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Lumentum Holdings?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Lumentum Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 78% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? LITE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around industry price multiples. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at LITE? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LITE now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around industry price multiples. However the optimistic forecast is encouraging for LITE which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

But it has been a reliable one not missing a dividend since the mid-1980s and delivering profits in 19 of the last 20 years.

Now as investors are making a broad shift into companies perceived as delivering value the Roseville-based producer of chemicals and specialty ingredients is one of the hottest investments in the country.

Shares in Hawkins have risen 44% this year well above the 6% climb of the S&P 500 index. They closed Friday at $38.91 just shy of a record high set a week earlier.

In January the company reported strong quarterly results with earnings per share that rose 74% for the period ended Dec. 31. Hawkins also announced a 2-for-1 stock split at the end of January. And last month it announced an acquisition that expanded its water-treatment business which operates in 20 states and provides about 30% of revenue.

Often a string of news draws the attention of investors. The company was also recognized by Newsweek magazine in its list of 400 most responsible companies for 2021. But broadly the stocks of chemical companies have fared well in the last six months. And several market analysts have stated that small-cap stocks should outperform the larger stock indexes in 2021.

Patrick Hawkins the company's chief executive said it's hard to explain all the pieces that might contribute to a rising stock price. ""We are a small-cap stock"" he said last week. ""It doesn't take a lot to get that demand up there if people think its undervalued.""

John Parker prepared products for shipping. Hawkins’ health and nutrition business where it provides ingredients for supplements saw a 75% increase in revenue during the latest quarter.

As it did for a lot of industrial firms the coronavirus pandemic created opportunities for the company. For instance its health and nutrition business where it provides ingredients for supplements saw a 75% increase in revenue during the latest quarter.

""When the pandemic hit everybody got back into health wellness and immunity"" Hawkins said. ""We clearly saw an uptick in demand for those products starting last year and we saw that carry through the third quarter of this year.""

He said the beauty of its distribution businesses is that they can adjust the amount of product they move through their system without having to adjust the staffing too much or make capital intensive investments.

""The focus for us is to try and sustain what we've built on. So if we've gotten new customers throughout this process we want them to remain customers long-term"" Hawkins said. ""I think we are well-suited whether it continues to keep on growing or it declines somewhat. We are well-suited to be there one way or the other.""

His grandfather Howard ""Curly"" Hawkins started the company in 1938. The company went public in 1972 when it had annual revenue of $7.2 million and net income of $216000. John Hawkins a son of Curly and uncle of Patrick took it through a second generation of family leadership. After John Hawkins died in 2011 Patrick who started work at the firm's loading dock in 1992 became chief executive.

The firm has done more deals under his leadership including a key acquisition of Stauber Chemical in 2015 that essentially created its food and nutrition group.

""Patrick has an enormous amount of credibility within his organization and within the boardroom"" said James Thompson a former Cargill Inc. and Mosaic Co. executive who is the chairman of Hawkins.

""He has matured into a wonderful leader of this company and a wonderful leader of people. He cares he's responsive and he's respected by employees"" Thompson said.

For much of its history the company was a good but slow-growing commodities company that built its revenue by finding new customers securing reliable suppliers and expanding its distribution network. It has paid a dividend since 1985.

In its last fiscal year industrial customers accounted for more than half of the company's $540 million in revenue. It provides nearly 100 chemical compounds from aluminum chloride to zinc chloride to industrial firms of all sizes.

Water-treatment products accounted for 30% of revenue and health and nutrition products the rest.

For investors and corporate governance analysts Hawkins stands out for its relatively low ratio of CEO-to-employee pay. According to the company's latest proxy Patrick Hawkins' total pay for the most recent year was $1.87 million while the median employee among its 640 employees at the time earned $91452.

That's a ratio of 20-1. At many publicly traded companies the CEO's pay is much higher relative to the average employee.

In part that's because a sizable group inside of Hawkins Inc. — the 175 or so truck drivers who make sales deliver chemicals pump chemicals and do limited service work — command a relatively high salary.

""They have to sell communicate be good at math competitive want to really win but know how to drive a really big truck"" Hawkins said. ""And is willing to deliver hazardous chemicals it's unique — you have to pay them well.""

Nobody in the company is paid less than $15 an hour and the hourly wage of most production workers is well into the $20 range with some nice benefits.

If you’ve been borrowing a Netflix password from a family member or friend you may now have to pay up.

Netflix has started testing a feature that could prod users who are borrowing a password from someone outside their household to buy a subscription.

The company said the feature was being tested with a limited number of users. It may signal a broader clampdown on the common practice of sharing passwords among relatives and friends to avoid paying for the popular streaming service.

The makers of the drama called “Tandav” apologized and deleted the contentious scenes. But India’s top court refused to dismiss the police cases.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbW9udGNsYXJpb24ub3JnL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZmx5LW92ZXItdG8tbmV0ZmxpeHMtZmlyZWZseS1sYW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fly Over to Netflix's 'Firefly Lane',"When I first read the name “Firefly Lane” as I scrolled through my Netflix account I thought it was bound to be some childish fantasy about fairies and unicorns but at the recommendation of a friend I decided to give it a shot.

Starring Katherine Heigl and Sarah Chalke “Firefly Lane” resulted in a full day of binge-watching all 10 episodes. Once I started I couldn’t stop. The show which premiered last month tells the story of two best friends Kate Mularkey (Chalke) and Tully Hart (Heigl) as they navigate their way through 30 years of friendship.

Perhaps it is the editing of the show that makes it so difficult to peel away from. Just about every other scene is either a flashback to when Kate and Tully were 14 years old in their early twenties or present-day of 2003 where they are in their early forties. Spanning from the early 1970s to the early 2000s the two friends deal with teenage family drama attend college work at a news station and ultimately stick with one another through thick and thin. This also entails fame loneliness and falling in and out of love.

Aside from the easily relatable storyline for anyone who has known their best friend for a long period of time the actresses are so believable as their respective characters that now I find it hard to imagine them any other way. I suppose it was Heigl’s experience with playing a successful journalist in films such as “Knocked Up” and “The Ugly Truth” that make her seem like such a natural. Either way she completely embodies her character as a famous lonely broken yet confident talk show host while Chalke expresses the hesitant nerdy hopeless romantic antithesis of her best friend.

The way in which the flashbacks were filmed is eye-catching. With Heigl and Chalke playing their characters in both their early twenties and their early forties it is not too often that actors and actresses can easily pull off playing the same character with a 20-year age difference. However they do it flawlessly.

During their younger years Ali Skovbye plays a teenage Tully while Roan Curtis plays a teenage Kate. The two young actresses fully mirror their older counterparts making exact facial expressions movements and not to mention they look a lot alike. It is remarkable how spot on the four women are in keeping the time jumps as authentic as possible.

The character development is also one to be noted. Tully an angry easily embarrassed and subtlety optimistic teenager turns into a confident go-getter where her teenage tendencies come out only in vulnerable moments.

On the other hand Kate has always been more on the meek side even through adulthood using pushes from her best friend to be bold and the best person she can be even if it results in humiliating herself from time to time.

Ben Lawson plays Johnny Ryan a secondary character who is the one external bit of consistency from the duo’s early twenties on. A war correspondent and coworker at the news station he ends up more involved in their lives than you may think upon his first appearance.

Johnny is the juxtaposition to the best friendship. He learns early on that if you marry the girl in a way you also marry her best friend. However it was a logical choice to include his character as a crutch to vouch for Kate and Tully’s friendship.

By the end of the season I was so emotionally invested that I felt like I was the third best friend. When they fought I was sad. When they showed up for one another I was happy and when the season ended on such a cliffhanger you better believe I was angry.

It has been so long since I’ve seen a cliffhanger ending that I was upset yet pleasantly surprised. It means there’s more of a chance for a second season and hopefully one that answers a lot of questions that remained unanswered.

“Firefly Lane” falls nothing short of relatable humorous heartbreaking and inspiring. Viewers can easily find a sense of comfort in watching the onscreen characters go through the motions of life and throughout all obstacles still remain true to their day-one friends. Of course with the exception of the cliffhanger.

So I say buy pints of ice cream get cozy and binge-watch this new Netflix drama with your best friend. You won’t regret it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1cmV3b3cuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbmV0ZmxpeC10aGUtb25lLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Review (Without Spoilers) of ‘The One’ on Netflix,"I've been anxiously awaiting the premiere of The One ever since I saw the trailer. The series based on a John Marrs novel of the same name feels like it belongs in the Black Mirror universe. It focuses on a woman named Rebecca Webb (Hannah Ware) the founder and CEO of a company that is capable of finding someone's perfect match...with only a strand of their DNA.

As someone who has grown tired of downloading dating apps the plot is highly intriguing. Instead of having to fruitlessly swipe through Tinder these characters are able to find their soulmate according to their genes (an idea that really puts eHarmony to shame). However the concept is even more interesting for how it plays into the ever-increasing trend of corporations acquiring our personal information (in a world where our living room speakers are already listening to our conversations).

Of course I had to watch when it premiered this week—already landing on Netflix's top ten list in the number two spot I might add. So does it stand up to all the hype?

But Rupert Murdoch’s 90th which he celebrated on March 11th should at least have been less stressful than his 80th. Back then British detectives were burrowing into a subsidiary of his firm News Corporation then the world’s fourth-largest media company for evidence that its journalists had hacked phones and bribed police. Several convictions later and after the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World Mr Murdoch was hauled before a British parliamentary inquiry on what he called “the most humble day of my life”.

A decade on from the near-collapse of his empire things are going rather better for the Australian-born tycoon. The phone-hacking scandal has receded. The choicest assets in his collection have been sold to Disney at the top of the market. Fox News is America’s most popular (if also its most despised) cable channel.

In order to snag the breaking and spicy stories the UK gossip rags subjected the 60-year-old actor to serious security breaches while he was still at the outset of his acting career.

“For years and years they were listening and my medical records [were stolen] and my car had bugs put in it so they knew where I was” the English actor said in the latest episode of WTF With Marc Maron.

“A lot of the guys who did this work—private investigators hired by tabloid newspapers—are now coming over to our side” he said.

The Golden Globe-winning actor joined Hacked Off a “campaign for a free and accountable press” that set a foothold following the News Corp. phone-hacking scandal in 2011.

Hugh Grant continued: “They’re now so pissed off that the editors senior executives and owners of these newspapers have got away scot-free while some of these ‘foot soldiers’ have gone to jail.”

He added “They’re now coming over to our side and spilling the beans.”

The Four Weddings and a Funeral star also said he annually holds a birthday where Hacked Off invites “people who’ve done terrible things to” him. One such man confessed he busted his door from the hinges in 1999 according to Hugh who would welcome him saying “Oh hi Knob welcome. I think you know where everything is.”

The clandestine activities by the tabloids have done a lot of harm. Celebrities also are like other people who need private space away from the prying eyes and deserve not to be stalked and harassed.

The now-retired Boyd a two-time Commonwealth champion had owned the national record of 4.81m for the past five years.

“I’m just happy that it’s done and I got it tonight” Kennedy said.

“I’ve attempted it about five or six times this season so to just nail it on my first attempt I’m so happy.

“I’ve had my last two comps where I’ve jumped on new poles and it hasn’t quite worked so I actually used … Alana Boyd’s poles.

Owned by vendors Vicki and Paul Alvaro since it was built 29 years ago the lakefront property has provided an ideal setting for family living with the absolute lot.

Mrs Alvaro says the 44 McDonald Grove home has been a perfect place to raise their two sons with the combination of location and luxury offering a resort-style feel.

“That’s what they say about living at West Lakes – that it’s like a year-round holiday” she says. “Especially when the boys were younger they loved the lakes – boating and fishing and playing in the rocks out the front.

“And just sitting there watching the dragon boats and other people out on the water in their boats is quite relaxing.”

Mrs Alvaro says the five-bedroom residence has proved to be an ideal family entertainer.

“We renovated about seven years ago and there’s now a pool and an outdoor kitchen and it’s just lovely” she says. “We’ve had lots of family gatherings here – birthdays Christmases and Easter and things like that.

“The boys went to school on the other side of the city and their friends would often come around and really enjoy it because for a lot of them it was different to where they lived. This house was like a holiday for them.”

Built to meet the demands of contemporary family life a flexible floorplan offers two levels of luxury. First impressions – from either the street or the lake – are of a grand home that wants for nothing.

Entry through the home’s foyer opens to a sweeping staircase leading to a four-bedroom upper level. All bedrooms have built-in robes and the sumptuous master suite also boasts one of the residence’s three marble bathrooms – and superb water views.

Downstairs the light-filled open-plan living and dining zone complements the contemporary kitchen which is complete with stone surfaces and integrated appliances. A sunlit breakfast bar offers pool and lake views. The lower level also incorporates a handy fifth bedroom/study a guest bathroom family-sized laundry and games room.

The alfresco entertaining area boasts an inbuilt barbecue kitchen stainless range stone tops and integrated appliances – a perfect place to relax after a dip in the sparkling pool.

Quality fixtures and fittings include a marble fireplace new drapes and a remote-controlled chandelier to allow easier cleaning.

The city is a short commute via bus or train while the seaside attractions of Tennyson and Semaphore are also nearby. With West Lakes’ mix of shopping – including Westfield – and eateries all within easy reach Mrs Alvaro says the property will “definitely” suit a young family who want to entertain and relax.

Mrs Alvaro says the home’s sense of space is a definite feature.

“You could easily have three generations in the home because there’s the three bathrooms and we’ve got a downstairs study but you could easily make that into another bedroom” she says adding the property had been a tremendous haven during last year’s COVID-19 lockdowns.

“I felt fortunate that we had the amount of room we did. It’s big – and there’s plenty of space for kids to run around in. The outside area’s good. We’ve got two dogs and they just sit out on the lake side and run around. They love it here.”

However with their sons having long left the couple are looking to downsize to a new build at Henley Beach. “It’s really just too big for the two of us – we live in about two rooms now basically” Mrs Alvaro laughs. “But we’ll really miss the home … we’ve been here for about 30 years we’ve got really nice neighbours and it’s a good community.

“We’ll be sad to see it go but we’re not getting any younger – so we’re really just at the next stage of our lives.”

But Rupert Murdoch’s 90th which he celebrated on March 11th should at least have been less stressful than his 80th. Back then British detectives were burrowing into a subsidiary of his firm News Corporation then the world’s fourth-largest media company for evidence that its journalists had hacked phones and bribed police. Several convictions later and after the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World Mr Murdoch was hauled before a British parliamentary inquiry on what he called “the most humble day of my life”.

A decade on from the near-collapse of his empire things are going rather better for the Australian-born tycoon. The phone-hacking scandal has receded. The choicest assets in his collection have been sold to Disney at the top of the market. Fox News is America’s most popular (if also its most despised) cable channel. And in a coup last month Mr Murdoch forced tech giants to pay for linking to his content. “He has the money. He has huge amounts of political power. He has it all” says Claire Enders a veteran media-watcher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MuY29tLnBrL2xhdGVzdC84MDMyNDAtaHVnaC1ncmFudC1yZXZlYWxzLWhpcy1waG9uZXMtY2Fy0gFHaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlbmV3cy5jb20ucGsvYW1wLzgwMzI0MC1odWdoLWdyYW50LXJldmVhbHMtaGlzLXBob25lcy1jYXI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hugh Grant reveals UK tabloids heard him for years and years by bugging his phones,"Hugh Grant has recently revealed that the UK tabloids heard him for many years by bugging not only his cellphone but his landline phone also to access his text messages.

In order to snag the breaking and spicy stories the UK gossip rags subjected the 60-year-old actor to serious security breaches while he was still at the outset of his acting career.

“For years and years they were listening and my medical records [were stolen] and my car had bugs put in it so they knew where I was” the English actor said in the latest episode of WTF With Marc Maron.

“A lot of the guys who did this work—private investigators hired by tabloid newspapers—are now coming over to our side” he said.

The Golden Globe-winning actor joined Hacked Off a “campaign for a free and accountable press” that set a foothold following the News Corp. phone-hacking scandal in 2011.

Hugh Grant continued: “They’re now so pissed off that the editors senior executives and owners of these newspapers have got away scot-free while some of these ‘foot soldiers’ have gone to jail.”

He added “They’re now coming over to our side and spilling the beans.”

The Four Weddings and a Funeral star also said he annually holds a birthday where Hacked Off invites “people who’ve done terrible things to” him. One such man confessed he busted his door from the hinges in 1999 according to Hugh who would welcome him saying “Oh hi Knob welcome. I think you know where everything is.”

The clandestine activities by the tabloids have done a lot of harm. Celebrities also are like other people who need private space away from the prying eyes and deserve not to be stalked and harassed.

Yes I said it — most comfortable. Comfiest if you may. This is a love letter to my Offline mules.

Nike made the opportunistic choice to introduce its slip-on backless Offline sneaker hybrid in August 2020 five months into a pandemic that’s kept us perpetually home and for many perpetually in loungewear. Suddenly the thought of lacing up sneakers just to make your biweekly trip to the grocery store or to pop outside and scream at the sky wasn’t so appealing. Then like a gift from above in walk Nike’s “Offline” mules — complete with two pairs of swappable insoles each of which boasts a distinct pattern of massage nubs.

Input may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article. We only include products that have been independently selected by Input's editorial team.

Though the idea of leaning into this new less socially-active lifestyle is Nike’s main selling point what forced my hand into actually signing up for the SNKRS app and pestering our in-house expert for tips on how to come out successful from a sneaker drop (shoutout to Input Style Editor Edgar Alvarez) was all a matter of practicality. As a person living with an autoimmune disease that can be at times completely debilitating finding a pair of day-to-day shoes that is both comfortable and easy to put on is something I almost have to jump on. Putting on shoes can be really fucking difficult.

So I tried them. And I am very glad I did.

Sturdy comfy and good for the long haul.

While backless shoes can be a bit of a red flag for anyone concerned about stability the thick wide soles of the Offlines paired with an upper that covers most of the foot and has an adjustable cushioned strap makes for a really sturdy piece of footwear. There’s no flip-flopping action no noticeable separation as you step. And with those aforementioned massage nubs it’s like walking on clouds. Keep the pink insoles for when you’re just relaxing and use the green which have more of the nubs and a more even dispersal when you’re headed out for the whole day.

Nike

My Offlines have now survived every reasonable test of regular use. I was skeptical about wearing them over great distances (my years as a long-haul commuter are showing) but they’ve handled a two-mile leisurely stroll no problem adding no additional pain or blisters to my already sky-high list of bodily complaints. Not too shabby. Another key point; that adjustable strap means they can accommodate for late-in-the-day swelling.

All the technical stuff aside they’re also cute as hell. I got them in Black Menta but there are several other colors now available including a really nice looking olive green a light pink a neon tangerine-ish hue and an all-black. Every color is fire.

Sneakerheads may scoff at this but for a person not particularly into fashion Nike’s Offline mules feel like a bit of a splurge price-wise coming in at $120 retail. Of course they sold out immediately but thankfully the resale price has hovered only slightly above that in the ballpark of $135-150. After months of consistent wear I feel confident in saying they’re worth it. Don’t let the haters convince you this is strictly a house shoe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC0yNzAtZG0zMDUzLTEwMC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 270 DM3053-100 Release Date,"Nike Sportswear is set to release a new Air Max 270 detailed with Pink tones similar to the previously seen Air Max Plus.

The Original Nike Moon Shoes are Up For $100000 By Mark Jessen - News Copy Link Share

You’ve no doubt heard the story behind the shoe giant Nike specifically the one about how legendary University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman poured rubber into his wife’s waffle iron to make a prototype sole for a new shoe. Bowerman went on to co-found the company that would one day become Nike with Phil Knight. Along the way the Nike Moon Shoe was created and now that piece of sneaker history is up for sale with Sotheby’s handling the auction.

The original Moon Shoe was hand-cobbled by one of Nike’s very first employees Geoff Hollister. Hollister hand sewed the white nylon upper adding the black Swooshes using fishing line. Aside from the Swoosh you won’t find any Nike branding on the shoe. The shoe’s waffle iron sole which was made in two parts because Nike didn’t have the technology to create a single piece yet provided a traction pattern that created better grip and cushion for runners especially compared to contemporary shoes. The design caught on quickly giving a foundation for Nike’s rise.

The Moon Shoe got its name for the resemblance to the pattern left in the tracks of the astronauts who walked on the moon in 1969. The Moon shoes debuted at the 1972 Olympic trials. The pair of Moon shoes that Sotheby’s is offering comes with a provenance provided by Tom McChesney a runner at South Eugene High School in Oregon. The shoes show wear that is consistent with their age and with their use.

The shoes are currently listed at $100000 but could easily go for more. With only about 12 pairs of shoes having been originally made this pair is extremely rare. A pair of unworn Moon Shoes sold for $437500 in 2019 so seeing this pair of shoes go for more than its initial price is well within reason.

The train ride was pleasant and uneventful. The start of the trip was not.

From Columbus Circle the road in front of D.C.’s Union Station that leads to the pick-up and drop-off lanes I looked south along Delaware Avenue. Instead of an unencumbered view of our U.S. Capitol I saw a tall steel black fence topped with razor wire. Behind the fence were National Guardsmen ready to discourage anyone who didn’t interpret the fence as a “do not enter” sign. Prior to Jan. 6 one could have enjoyed a half-mile walk from Union Station to the Capitol. But not now. The public isn’t allowed to make this journey to the center of democracy.

Following the insurrection on Jan. 6 law enforcement was so concerned that Trump supporters might make another attempt to storm the Capitol or commit violent acts against the people who work there that they encircled it with the razor-wire topped barrier. We learned on March 4th that the Capitol Police in response to continuing security threats requested that the National Guard currently numbering 5200 remain at the Capitol for another 60 days. Presumably the fence will remain for at least that long.

We can assign responsibility for this infringement on our democracy to two levels of government. The primary responsibility of course rests with Donald Trump who instigated the insurrection by several thousand of his most devoted disciples. We endured months of Trump repeating the Big Lie – that there was massive fraud behind President Biden’s popular vote and electoral college victories (or to use Trump’s words that the election had been stolen). We watched him raise the emotional pitch of his supporters to a level that peaked on January 6th when he directed an assembled crowd of “militia members white supremacists and other extremists” (the assessment of the Capitol Police) to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”

But responsibility also rests with members of Congress both in the House and in the Senate all of them Republican who made no attempt to counter Trump’s false and dangerous narrative by arguing the truth about the election. Some of these members chose to add their voices to Trump’s Big Lie by voting on January 6th after they had returned to from their insurrection-imposed lock-down to sustain objections to the slates of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania claiming without evidence that the election results from both of those states were fraudulent. Two of the Congressman who cast votes to disrupt our democratic process are close to home: the 6th District’s Ben Cline and the 9th District’s Morgan Griffith.

Congressmen: Why haven’t you addressed your constituents to explain that there was no fraud that the election was not stolen that your protest vote on Jan. 6 was a fool’s errand that what makes our democracy great and enduring—the public election of a president and the peaceful transfer of power – worked extraordinarily well in 2020? (Well the peaceful part maybe not so much.) And that protestors who remain enamored of Trump and his Big Lie need to be told the truth and to stay home?

I live in the 6th District and I read Mr. Cline’s weekly newsletter. I have also read Mr. Griffith’s newsletters. And what did the Congressmen have to say to their constituents about their January 6th vote or about Donald Trump’s claims of a fraudulent and stolen election? Not a word.

On March 4 I took this photo of the U.S. Capitol closed off to the public and fortified with razor wire and the National Guard in response to a seditious act by the former president.

According to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report the U.S. is committed to spending $494 billion on its nuclear forces over the next decade or about $50 billion per year. Over the next three decades nuclear weapons modernization plans could cost as much as $1.5-$2 trillion.

This total includes investment in a $100 billion Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) a land-based nuclear missile which is slated to replace the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).

Manufactured by Northrop Grumman under a $13 billion contract—with assistance from other major defense contractors like Bechtel Honeywell General Dynamics Lockheed Martin L3 Harris and Textron—the GBSD is supposed to be made operational by 2029

The U.S. Air Force plans to order more than 600 of them.

Elizabeth Eaves characterized the GBSD in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as a “new weapon of mass destruction the length of a bowling lane which will be able to travel some 6000 miles carrying a warhead more than 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.”

The human tragedy associated with the development of the GBSD is compounded by the fact that military experts believe it will not actually enhance U.S. national security.

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015 that getting rid of America’s land-based nuclear missiles would “reduce the false alarm danger.”

Like its predecessor the Minuteman III the GBSD is designed to be activated in the face of a Russian nuclear attack.

The computer systems that warn of such incoming fire may be vulnerable to hacking and false alarms.

During the Cold War military computer glitches caused numerous close calls.

President Biden has in the past supported arms control and nuclear weapons reduction treaties.

In 1988 he helped negotiate ratification of the Inter-Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed between Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan which required the U.S. and USSR to eliminate and permanently forswear all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5500 kilometers.

More recently though Biden has taken a hard line against both Russia and China whose supposed existential threats to U.S. interests has provided a basis for the massive government investment in nuclear weapons.

In an op-ed published during the presidential campaign Biden supported a no first-use policy for nuclear weapons  and wrote inthat the purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterrence—and if necessary retaliating against attack

The Democratic Party’s platform adopted at the July 2020 convention called Donald Trump’s proposal for new nuclear weapons “unnecessary wasteful and indefensible.”

So far however Biden’s top Pentagon nominees have publicly backed all three legs of the nuclear triad—including the land-based missiles.

A major factor inhibiting the prospects for disarmament is the clout of defense contractors like Northrop Grumman which spent more than $12 million in lobbying in 2020 and provided Biden with $403072 during the 2020 election campaign.

Last July when Ro Khanna (D-CA) proposed an amendment that would transfer $1 billion or one percent of the GBSD’s projected cost into a pandemic preparedness fund  the amendment was voted down and Khanna was accused by Liz Cheney (R-WY) of playing into the hands of China which according to Cheney had caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cheney represents the district encompassing Cheyenne Wyoming which is home to the F.E. Warren Air Force Base where the GBSD will be based.

The city and surrounding region anticipate a major economic windfall from the GBSD.

In 2018 Cheney received $12000 from Northrop Grumman-affiliated Political Action Committees (PACs) and $10000 in 2020.(1)

Northrop donated money to congressional candidates in all the six states— Utah Wyoming Colorado Nebraska Montana and North Dakota —which would be beneficiaries of the new missile.

Polling data indicates that public support for developing nuclear weapons is lukewarm at best.

The freeze movement was a large-scale grassroots movement that promoted a reduction and ultimately elimination of nuclear weapons.

Placing a strong emphasis on grass-roots education it helped lay the groundwork for the INF Treaty which the Trump administration repealed in 2019.

At a zoom conference on Wednesday February 24th sponsored by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Katrina Vanden Heuval publisher of The Nation Magazine suggested that disarmament advocates should link up with the climate change movement which has generated a lot of enthusiasm.

Those who attended Super Bowl LV in Tampa Florida last month were treated to a unique sight that included a flyover of a B-1B Lancer a B-52 Stratofortress and a B-2 Spirit. While seeing any of the three aircraft can be uncommon – unless you live near a few select Air Force bases – seeing all three in the sky together is a true ""unicorn"" event.

B-2 Bombers Flying in Utah: Why?

Even seeing a B-2 Spirit can be quite rare as the United States Air Force only operates twenty of the aircraft. But last month eagle-eyed residents of Utah may have spotted a trio of the bat-winged stealth bombers over Provo. Photojournalist Monico Garza was able to snap a few photos of the aircraft from his Nikon camera which was fitted with a 3000mm zoom lens.

Garza who was reported to be an avid aviation buff and has hoped to get a view of the bomber overhead didn't expect to see three – especially as none actually showed up on radar.

""I was blown away"" Garza said as reported by The Gephardt Daily his employer. ""These warplanes fly a lot of night missions. That makes daylight sighting all the rarer. I tried to track them with two different radar apps one for commercial and another one for military flights and they were nowhere to be seen. They were seemingly invisible.""

While there haven't been other reports of the bombers the fact that Garza was able to track them and then had a camera with such a powerful lens certainly gave him an advantage. The photographer added that he watched the 200-ton bombers for several minutes as each of the three aircraft gained altitude and then slowly turned to the south and west. Garza described the sighting of the three aircraft as ""awe-inspiring"" and added ""you don't want to be on the receiving end of these bad boys.""

The Air Force has made no comment regarding the flyover in the skies above the Beehive State so it is unknown where the B-2 Spirits took off from or where they headed.

Some users on social media suggested the B-2s may have been taking part in an exercise at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) near Las Vegas and flew out to Utah and were then on their way back home. A few users poked fun as well on social media with one user suggesting ""Just zipping over to bomb the crap out of Nevada then home for coffee and snacks.""

While the Air Force has just twenty of the aircraft in service since its introduction in 1997 the Northrop Grumman B-2 has often been the first to fight. Designed to penetrate anti-aircraft defenses the B-2 can deploy both conventional and thermonuclear weapons.

The B-2 is also the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration. The bombers can carry up to sixteen B-61 or megaton-yield B-83 nuclear gravity bombs on the rotary launchers inside its two bomb bays. The aircraft's avionics are also hardened versus the electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear blasts. The Air Force plans to operate its B-2 fleet until 2032 at least when the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider enters service.

Firms manufacturing them were popping up left and right they were all over the news and their promised capabilities looked just unimaginably exciting. Safe cheap sustainable fast convenient…

That happened twice actually. In the 1920s and 30s for the first time then once again between the 1990s and 2010s.

The story of the first golden age of airships is well known. They appeared at the very end of the 19th century were popular well liked and seemed to be the perfect transport offering flight distances and payload capacities not available to contemporary airplanes while soundly beating almost any land- and sea-based mode of transport with their speed.

But in the 1930s thanks in part to the wide media coverage of the Hindenburg disaster they quickly fell out of favor – just in time for the new generations or large airplanes to take the lead in air travel and air cargo.

Those early airships were bulky difficult to control and tremendously unsafe. But all of their limitations could be easily negated with new materials technologies and safety standards. Airships are perfect for many tasks contemporary aviation is not particularly good at: loitering for a long time at one place efficiently transporting heavy and oversized cargo and in general not consuming obscene amounts of fuel. On top of that airships are much quieter and much cleaner than airplanes something extremely important in our day and age. So isn’t it the perfect time to start building them?

That is the story told time and time again in thousands of sales pitches on the verge of the 21st century when numerous startups vowed to resurrect the airship and make it flyable profitable and safe again.

High hopes

Most people probably heard such a pitch with Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) Airlander 10 which held the title of world’s largest aircraft between 2012 and 2017 and was probably the most publicized of the lot. It was intended as a military surveillance platform before being rejected by the US Army and repurposed for civilian use.

Along with it many ventures were created in the hopes that airships with their long endurance are the future of surveillance. French A-NSE and British Airship Industries are amongst the most prominent of them. Blackwater the infamous private military company jumped on the trend with their Polar 400 Airship. It was followed by aeronautical giants – Lockheed Martin with the P-791 and Northrop Grumman with the LEMV. The last of them got awarded a $150 million contract by DARPA.

The P-791 project was later repurposed for civilian use just like Airlander 10. Boeing’s SkyHook was civilian from the start. German CargoLifter Italian Nimbus EosXi and several others looked into providing cargo or passenger services with unmatched efficiency; even the Zeppelin company barely active since the WWII has resurrected their aeronautical arm as Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and promised to resume manufacturing of airships.

Some of these projects planned to use non-flammable helium others – improve the reputation of hydrogen. Some tried to return to the rigid frame of pre-war airships while others constructed semi-rigid or fully collapsible airframes. Some used helicopter rotors for additional lift others made their airships with various kinds of additional lifting surfaces. The most ambitious ones – notably Walrus HULA project by DARPA and some others – proposed ships tens of times larger than Hindenburg that would lift hundreds of tons of cargo and carry it almost without consuming fuel drifting along in air currents using atmospheric ion propulsion or some other exotic technology.

All of these proposals were born between the mid-1990s and mid-2010s the time when the idea of the “renaissance of airships” floated in the air.

There were several proposals that predate that: companies like Piasecki AeroLift Aereon and Aeros were some of the forerunners offering to provide the US army with patrol cargo or other kind of airship already in the 80s and pitching the same story – that now is the perfect time to resurrect the undeservedly-forgotten concept update it with latest advances and fly straight into the lighter-than-air future. Some of them constructed a prototype or two before going bust.

What happened?

As of the early 2021 of the whole slew of airship startups only several remain. Large corporations – such as Boeing and Northrop Grumman – forgot their proposals completely. Lockheed Martin has been delaying the first flight of the commercial variant of the P-791 since 2017 and hasn’t spoken about it for the last year. The US Army’s plan to have a fleet of surveillance airships collapsed already in 2012 taking many projects with it and while some blimps saw action in Afghanistan – including Blackwater’s – they were completely superseded by new relatively cheap and available long-endurance heavier-than-air drones.

Dedicated cargo airships did not fare better. The Airlander 10 prototype crashed in 2017 HAV decided not to restore the aircraft and focus on the development of the version for mass production. It has been receiving significant backing both through crowdfunding and state grants ever since and issuing progress updates regularly. It promises entry into service in 2025.

Ironically Luftschiffbau Zeppelin – the company which pioneered the airship and was in the center of industry’s first collapse – may have been the biggest beneficiary of its rebirth. Only a fraction of its revenue is generated by manufacturing and sales of actual airships but since the resumption of this line of work in 2001 half a dozen of their N07-101s were sold mostly for advertising purposes and for performing joyrides. In fact company’s ships remain the only option for an enthusiast to experience a flight on an airship today.

That half a dozen is quite definitely not a success story though. And it along with all the other failures puts the new era of airships into a place which it could not avoid. The chasm.

What now?

Geoffrey A. Moore’s curve of new technology adoption rides somewhere between a cliché and a ubiquitously accepted fact. It proposes that every new technological achievement goes through several phases being adopted at first by risk-taking pioneers before finding its way into the mainstream audience. Between those states there is the chasm: the part where the wide public gets disillusioned with the technology its shortcomings become apparent and there is a risk that the development will stop.

New generation of airships quite clearly have entered the chasm now. Will they find a way out of it? On one hand the COVID-19 crisis and the near-collapse of the aviation industry as a whole may have been the final nail in their coffin which has already been sealed half-a-decade before.

On the other hand the same circumstances brought the rise of the cargo sector and an unparalleled appetite for efficiency. At the same time the maritime transport industry was in turmoil in 2020 showing the weakening already in 2019. Some experts are talking of the collapse of global supply chains and while the wholesale shipping apocalypse may seem far-fetched there is no denying that things are bound to change.

The resumption of airships’ renaissance rests on the question whether HAV and some other less dormant companies will be able to use this situation to their advantage. Airships sit in a gap between aircraft and ships and for the cargo industry offer some advantages of both. As both the air and maritime transport is posed to have the rise in demand a new niche may have opened providing at least a narrow possibility for us to see the giants floating in the skies once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvdWstZGVmZW5zZS1jb21taXR0ZWUtYmxhc3RzLWFybXlzLWFybW9yZWQtdmVoaWNsZS1jYXBhYmlsaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK defense committee blasts Army's armored vehicle capability,"The UK’s parliamentary Defence Committee has called the British Army’s armored fighting vehicle (AFV) capability “deplorable” in the opening lines of a report published on March 14.

The report was published ahead of the upcoming Integrated Security Defence and Foreign Policy Review which will according to information that is slowly trickling to the press introduce further cuts across all branches of UK armed forces.

The committee launched the review in July 2020 and included written submissions from the defense ministry expert commentators academic and the defense industry.

“This report reveals a woeful story of bureaucratic procrastination military indecision financial mismanagement and general ineptitude which have continually bedevilled attempts to properly re-equip the British Army over the last two decades” the opening words of the report say.

Since the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s the Army’s AFV fleets have been characterized by increasing obsolescence and decreasing numbers. In 1990 the UK had around 1200 main battle tanks in its inventory today has 227 and those that remain are in urgent need of modernization.

The report highlights that between 1997 and late 2020 (with the exception of a small number or armored engineering and Viking protected mobility vehicles) the defense ministry has not delivered a single new armored vehicle from the core procurement program into operational service with the army.

Partly as a consequence of this failure British Army personnel were inadequately protected on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and some of those currently on deployment in Estonia are equipped with lightly armored (for example the open-topped Jackal) or obsolescent (FV430 series) vehicles in the face of a significant potential peer threat from Russian forces the report says.

What is more the army’s Challenger 2 main battle tank and Warrior infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) have gone decades without upgrades. The 227 Challenger 2s currently in service did not receive significant upgrades since entering service in the 1990s. The report goes on to note that a planned but yet-to-be-approved life extension program for the tanks would deliver highly capable assets. However as such program take up to 10 years to complete the Challenger fleet would be approaching the end of its service life by the time the final tank completes LEP.

The report also touches upon the delay in fielding a “warfighting division” which is still some four years away.

As a result were the British Army to have to fight a peer adversary in Eastern Europe in the next few years the soldiers “would be forced to go into battle in a combination of obsolescent or even obsolete armored vehicles most of them at least 30 years old or more with poor mechanical reliability very heavily outgunned by more modern missile and artillery systems and chronically lacking in adequate air defense.”

“If the Integrated Review concludes that the defense ministry and army are to retain a heavy armored capability it is clear that they must learn the hard lessons from recent history” the committee said.

“Furthermore to support this capability the UK requires an industrial base. The current procurement and upgrade programs have led to new investment in skills and production facilities. To sustain this regrowth in what was a decaying sector the defense ministry (and wider government) must provide greater certainty about future requirements and possible contracts. The proposal to develop a Land Industrial Strategy is a welcome step in this direction the report which you can read in its entirety here said.",,,

NVIDIA (NVDA Financial) is well known for its Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) and Computing & Networking solutions.

The company's history is related to its strong presence in the Graphics solutions market. The recent surge in the computing power requirements for advanced Graphics applications (mainly related to the Gaming market) has been a huge tailwind for NVIDIA.

The other division Computing & Networking has a clear target: helping NVIDIA become the leading AI (Artificial Intelligence) solutions company on the market. AI can be used in a wide range of applications like service robots self-driving mobility and IoT (Internet-of-things) applications in general.

As an effective AI solution is strongly dependent on computing power in order to achieve that dominance they must be able to offer the best suitable computing platform that can be used to run this kind of applications. Providing the AI ""platform of choice"" will position them to be a fundamental part of the ecosystem and consequently allow them to reap big returns for decades.

Arm Holdings' Acquisition

NVIDIA's future direction became clear last September when they announced the intention to acquire private chip designer Arm Holdings from Japanese tech giant Softbank (SFTBY Financial) in a transaction valued at around $40 billion. Softbank had in turn previously acquired Arm Holdings in September 2016 for a total consideration of $31 billion.

Specifically the company agreed to pay Softbank $12 billion in cash and $21.5 billion in NVIDIA common stock (this will be achieved by issuing 44.3 million shares). They will also issue $1.5 billion in equity to Arm employees. Finally Softbank may receive up to $5 billion in cash or common stock subject to the realization of determined performance targets by Arm.

The deal looks like a win/win/win situation for NVIDIA shareholders who will potentially benefit from the acquisition (despite the announced 7% dilution) Softbank that will both get cash plus retain a stake in the larger company and Arm employees who will enjoy the unexpected bonus.

The acquisition makes total sense from the strategic point of view: NVIDIA will acquire a computing ecosystem leader with a solid moat a large market share and precious long-running customer relationships.

Actually I said ""strategic"" as this is not just a deal in which a company acquires another company to strengthen its presence in a specific market or acquire a new technology.

There's more than that: NVIDIA could in the future potentially make things much more difficult for its competitors and for other big tech companies (namely Arm Holdings's current customers) to continue using and leveraging Arm's platform.

As proof of this last February a consortium of big tech names composed by Alphabet's Google (GOOGL Financial) Microsoft (MSFT Financial) Qualcomm (QCOM Financial) and other players openly opposed the deal with some of them registering objections to the Federal Trade Commission the European Commission and other agencies and regulators claiming that NVIDIA could potentially limit other companies's access to Arm technology or alternatively increase prices.

This has never been a problem both before and after Sofbank's acquisition as Arm has always been recognized for its neutrality: the company offers its products to whoever is willing to pay for them and has never favored one customer or the other nor was it involved in competition matters.

On the other side NVIDIA is of course promising that nothing will change and that they plan to continue with Arm's open licensing model. They also not only pledged to keep Arm's headquarters in the U.K. but announced their will to expand the Cambridge campus in order to make it a world-class Research Center focused on AI.

Nobody knows if the regulators will give NVIDIA the green light needed to complete the deal but for sure the closure will be delayed as they now need to provide much more documentation and details about it.

But even in the case the deal goes through there's one more thing NVIDIA should be worried about and that is the rise of RISC-V processors.

RISC-V adoption is a threat for Arm dominance

Before delving into the implication of RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors adoption let's see how Arm Holdings's licensing model actually works.

While AMD Intel (INTC) and NVIDIA itself make money by selling chips Arm's business model is different as it is basically an IP (Intellectual Property) licensing business with a pay-for-play option.

This means that Arm does not sell chips it actually sells chip designs (while the customer is responsible for implementing and personalizing the chip) and collects:

An upfront licensing fee depending on the design complexity

Per-chip basis royalties

The royalty component can be way bigger than the licensing fee as it grows with the number of chips sold (it usually amounts to 1-2% of the selling price of the chip).

Source: NVIDIA to acquire Arm Presentation

For years Arm Holdings's customers have paid fees and royalties in order to continue selling their chips giving away a part of their margins but getting the benefit of having a strong design for their chips a great support and the possibility to easily customize them.

But what if after NVIDIA's acquisition they could not access Arm technology or are forced to pay higher prices which will further eat into their precious margins? With their profits put in jeopardy they should at least consider the possibility to have a B plan.

And here comes RISC-V which is not an Arm competitor and it's also not a product. RISC-V is an open-source microprocessor Instruction Set architecture (ISA) which lets chip companies design RISC-based chips without paying any licensing fees (or royalties).

Just to give an idea of how relevant RISC-V is going to be we can mention companies like Huawei and Google as first supporters of the project and even the same NVIDIA which before deciding to acquire Arm based their next-generation Falcon logic controller on RISC-V.

Back in 2010 computer science professors Krste Asanović and David Patterson (I remember studying on one of his outstanding textbooks at the university) along with a group of graduate volunteer students at the University of California Berkeley decided to develop and publish an open-source compute architecture. What triggered them was the lack of innovation in the RISC-based available architectures and the frustration of seeing CPU vendors charging very high royalties and fees for their use in end products.

In 2015 the non-profit RISC-V Foundation was established and their first official ISA was published so that everyone could download the chip design and freely use it. As already mentioned companies don't have to pay a fee to use the RISC-V architecture no matter how many times they download it and no matter how many devices they decide to put the design in.

Tech companies all over the world are rushing in order to have their first chip based on RISC-V which would save them tons of money and protect them from NVIDIA's dominance.

Of course the reality is not black and white. Arm's chips still have a big value and they have already been used in countless devices included the ones which are currently under development.

Moreover not all the tech companies (especially pure software ones) have the skills to pick a microprocessor design implement and integrate it into their chip designs. Arm's expertise still counts a lot for those companies.

So Arm's (or possibly in the future NVIDIA's) moat is still there but the moat is most probably going to be eroded by the rise of RISC-V based chips. Semico Research estimates that by 2025 there will be over 62 billion RISC-V-based devices shipped globally.

The advent of RISC-V is also shaping the way companies behave in the ecosystem with some of them like Western Digital releasing their RISC-V based SweRV CoreTM to the open-source community and others like Siemens offering RISC-V Toolchain services to other companies with less experience in the sector. In computer programming a Toolchain is a set of programming tools used in development activities (for example a code compiler) aimed at creating a software product on a specific platform.

Conclusions

NVIDIA's planned acquisition of Arm Holdings from Softbank is forming worrying waves in the tech ecosystem as it could result in diminished competition and margins reduction for Arm's customers with some of them openly opposing the deal.

On the other side whether the deal goes through or not Arm Holdings will have to face the increasing appeal and rising adoption of RISC-V based designs in their customers' end products. Arm Holdings is already reacting by lowering their licensing fees to fend off RISC-V competition.

I think in the next few years their currently solid moat will most probably be largely eroded by the adoption of RISC-V (either because of replacement or price pressure) with a consequent shrink in profit margins and market share.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is the top-of-the-line 60 Series card from the RTX 20 generation. It was a nice improvement over the RTX 2060 bringing in more memory — 8GB vs. the 6GB on the RTX 2060 — as well as a wider memory bus.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the new RTX kid on the block. It's an entry-level peek into the world of ray tracing and currently the most affordable of the RTX 30 GPUs. While it offers some performance boost over the RTX 2060 SUPER it's definitely not worthy of being an upgrade. The availability and pricing issues combined with the thin performance gap mean that you should just stick to your RTX 2060 SUPER. Let's take a deeper look at why.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: Specs

Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)

Being from a newer generation the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 does have some improvements in comparison to the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 2060 SUPER uses the same TU106 GPU as we saw in the RTX 2060 which was made with the 12nm TSMC process. In contrast the RTX 3060 houses the Ampere GA106 GPU which is made using Samsung's 8nm process. This gives it an edge with transistor count with 13.25 billion transistors against the RTX 2060 SUPER's 10.8 billion transistors. Let's look at the specifications of the two cards.

Note: Some specifications of the RTX 3060 and the RTX 2060 SUPER like the ports may vary as per AIB models.

Despite the transistor count difference the RTX 2060 SUPER has a few advantages. First off the RT core count on the RTX 2060 SUPER is higher than that on the RTX 3060. Additionally the total memory bandwidth on the RTX 2060 SUPER is also higher. This means the RTX 3060 is not as more powerful than the RTX 2060 SUPER as it could have been. Let's look at the performance of the two cards.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: Real-world performance

The real-world performance comparisons of the two cards will vary depending on how the AIB variants are configured. The RTX 2060 SUPER is a beefed-up version of 2060 to begin with but the overclock variants of the card will be able to shrink the performance gap even more especially in comparison to the normal RTX 3060. Let's take a look at the performance comparison between the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 12GB XC and GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER 8GB courtesy of the YouTube channel Benchmark.

As the numbers show the performance gap is very very thin. The RTX 3060 is a decent purchase on its own and it does manage to output some decent figures at 1440p close to the 60 FPS mark. While it doesn't quite hit the 1440p 144 FPS figure it's still a decent performer for the price given you can find a decently-priced AIB card.

However the RTX 2060 SUPER isn't too far behind. While the benchmark shows 1440p Ultra figures the 1080p performance will show margins that are very similar. The RTX 3060 is only a small step up from the RTX 2060 SUPER and it gives a single-digit FPS gain. There's very little intensive to sell your RTX 2060 SUPER and pick up an RTX 3060.

The RTX 2060 SUPER is still a solid 1080p GPU and as far as ray tracing performance goes it will take you nearly as far as the RTX 3060 does. The card isn't due for an upgrade yet and an upgrade to the new base 60 series card is probably the smallest GPU upgrade you can get right now.

So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 from RTX 2060 SUPER?

No. The RTX 3060 is a decent entry-level RTX card no doubt but it's the farthest thing from being a logical upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 3060 is also plagued by the same stock and pricing issues as any new piece of silicon right now which means you'll have a tough time getting your hands on one anyway.

Even if you manage to find one in stock the AIB model prices are expected to cost you way too much to justify such a small upgrade. The logical upgrade would be something like the RTX 3070 which is a great 1440p card that hits higher frame rates at that resolution as we noted in our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review.

The RTX 2060 series cards are also in heavy demand right now like all the best graphics cards. The card is a sweet spot for RTX GPUs so much so that NVIDIA itself is bringing them back to fill out the gaps in its RTX lineup that have been widened due to the GPU shortage. If you're still pressed for an upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER and can grab an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU at a reasonable price you can look at the higher tier cards in the RTX 30 series. If you're not planning a major upgrade however then it makes sense to keep that RTX 2060 SUPER which is a solid graphics card to own right now.

4 Reviews

There have been several rumors about NVIDIA planning to launch an RTX 3080 Ti for quite some time now. Initially we expected the card to launch in January but then we learnt that the GA102 card would be pushed to February. Now we are getting to know that the RTX 3080 Ti would have a mid-April release but with some reduction in CUDA core counts.

MyDrivers reports (via ChannelGate) that the RTX 3080 Ti is ""almost certain"" to have a mid-April launch date. Initial rumors indicated that NVIDIA would be equipping the card with 20 GB of GDDR6X memory but the publication notes that it is still speculative. The more recent rumors suggest a 12 GB GDDR6X possibility though.

The exact specifications of the RTX 3080 Ti are still elusive but we hear that NVIDIA may offer just 10240 CUDA cores on the RTX 3080 Ti as opposed to the initial speculation of 10496 CUDA cores as found in the RTX 3090. That is still a decent 17.6% increase in CUDA core count compared to the RTX 3080 but how well that translates to real-world performance remains to be seen — we've only seen about 10 to 15% benefit in 4K gaming moving from an RTX 3080 to an RTX 3090.

Similar to the approach taken with the RTX 3060 the upcoming RTX 3080 Ti is also expected to implement a cryptocurrency hash rate limiter though whether that approach actually makes sense or not is debatable. With the RTX 3080 Ti expected to arrive approximately eight months after the original RTX 3080 launch we hope that supply constraints would largely ease by then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWQtcmFkZW9uLXJ4LTY3MDAteHQtdnMtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT vs Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 was awarded five stars in our hands-on review cementing its place on our list of the best graphics cards and ensuring that AMDs latest release the Radeon RX 6700 XT is going to have some hard competition to beat.



The GPU market is understandably volatile right now with gamers scrambling to buy the limited stock before bots and cryptominers sweep them off the shelves (digitally speaking) so getting your hands on either of these products is going to be difficult. But when the dust settles and we eventually see some normality being restored what GPU is best for you?



As the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT has yet to be released we won't know its real-world performance until we can get our hands on one to put it through its paces. Regardless we can still get a good insight into where the strength of each card will be on paper until our review for the latest Radeon family member is published.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT : Price

It should be straightforward to compare the RTX 3070 and RX 6700 XT on their cost with the recommended retail price for the RTX 3070 set at $499 (£469 about AU$700) and the RX 6700 XT sneaking in a little cheaper at $479 (about £340 AU$610).



Given the current market for GPU's however you might as well throw those prices out of the window – we're seeing cards listed for alarmingly inflated prices right now so getting your hands on one at the actual GPU market value will be nothing short of a miracle. We can't tell you what to do but we heavily advise not buying either of these cards for the crazy inflated prices we've been seeing other GPUs listed for online.



We do expect prices to stabilize if stock numbers are replenished and the current cryptocurrency boom ends though so given patience you might be seeing these list prices next to available inventory eventually.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Specs

The RTX 3070 is already proving itself as a capable card for gamers. Here are the specifications its packing:

CUDA Cores: 5888

5888 Boost Clock: 1.73GHz

1.73GHz Base Clock: 1.5GHz

1.5GHz VRAM: 8GB GDDR6

8GB GDDR6 Memory Interface: 256-bit

256-bit TDP: 220W

So how will this compare to the Radeon RX 6700 XT? Here are the specs:

CUDA Cores: 2560

2560 Boost Clock: 2.58GHz

2.58GHz Base Clock: 2.3GHz

2.3GHz VRAM: 12GB GDDR6

12GB GDDR6 Memory Interface: 192-bit

192-bit TDP: 230W

The RX 6700 XT is wielding 12GB of VRAM to market itself at gamers looking to play at 1440p with AMD claiming this will future-proof the card as it's starting to see more AAA games exceeding 9GB of VRAM usage. The RTX 3070 on the other hand has 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM which still gives it ample memory to run 4K games.



There's very much a mirror effect happening with these two GPUs. The RX 6700 XT has fast clock speeds but it completely falls flat on CUDA cores with the RTX 3070 have over twice that of its rival.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Performance

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Pitting these cards against each other in terms of performance will be tricky given the RX 6700 XT hasn't even hit the shelves yet but watch this space for updates after we've managed to officially run some benchmarks.



On paper though this is looking to be a close call. We saw during AMD's official benchmark presentations that 1440p max settings show very comparable numbers to the RTX 3070 with both cards seemingly on a level playing field. Suspiciously though these benchmarks didn't appear to include ray tracing performance and early leaks suggest that this is where the Nvidia RTX 3070 will start pulling some serious punches.



This isn't surprising given we've forced hard-to-run titles onto the RTX 3070 and it's taken everything we threw at it like a champ. Both Horizon Zero Dawn and Red Dead Redemption 2 managed to run at a consistent 75fps at 1080p with all settings but the MSAA maxed out so Nvidia's contender has already proven itself more than capable even at 4K in some games.



You shouldn't judge the currently unreleased GPU too harshly yet though as several of these leaks also show the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT could be faster than the RTX 3070 in several titles especially game benchmarks that are optimized for the RDNA 2 architecture.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Which should you buy?

This should probably read 'Which can you buy' given the current shortage of GPUs on the market but if you're lucky enough to find yourself in a situation where both are available then we'd suggest the GeForce RTX 3070...for now.



In (albeit unconfirmed) leaked benchmarks for the RX 6700 XT we saw it might be slower than the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti which wouldn't make it worth the $20 saved against the beefier RTX 3070. We won't know for sure of course until we actually get our hands on one but this on top of the current lack of DLSS rival in AMD's offerings means that the Nvidia graphics card is likely to be a better investment for the future when more games utilize the AI framerate booster.



We're keeping our fingers crossed that the Radeon RX 6700 XT can prove itself a worthy investment over the GeForce RTX 3070 but no matter which option you go for you'll be getting some solid performance in the latest AAA titles especially if you're upgrading from older cards like the 1070 Ti or the RX Vega 56."

NXPI,NXP Semiconductors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVldGltZXMuZXUvbnhwLWJsdWVib3gtMy0wLWxldHMtY2FybWFrZXJzLWJ1aWxkLXNhZmV0eS1wb3J0Zm9saW8tb2YtYXBwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NXP BlueBox 3.0 Lets Carmakers Build Safety Portfolio of Apps,"At January’s virtual CES NXP Semiconductors launched BlueBox 3.0 an automotive development platform that doubles the embedded computing power of BlueBox 2.0 and boosts I/O and PCIe connectivity eightfold.

The announcement underscores NXP’s platform approach. While rivals are still engaged in the competition to offer more trillions of operations per second (TOPS) NXP is pushing to alter the focus promoting a scalable development platform with which carmakers can “experiment develop test out and validate software and advanced features that clearly enhance safety” according to Ali Osman Örs NXP’s director of artificial-intelligence strategy and strategic partnerships for automotive processing.

By moving to BlueBox 3.0 “we’re also recognizing that there’s a lot more variety in the type of compute and expansion needed” Örs said in an interview with EE Times.

Three basic building blocks of the BlueBox 3.0 platform are an LX2160A multicore processor which is the highest-performance member of NXP’s Layerscape family; NXP’s latest gateway processor (S32G274); and Kalray’s massively parallel processor array (MPPA) processor. The first two sit on the development platform’s motherboard. Kalray’s MPPA which addresses heterogeneous AI acceleration plugs into the motherboard via PCIe expansion cards.

The advantages of the BlueBox 3.0 platform center on its flexibility and expandability. Increased PCIe slots let users plug in “elements like artificial-intelligence/machine-learning accelerator cards; additional vision-perception device cards bringing in all the camera connectivity; and radar and LiDAR whose connectivity is traditionally based on a CAN or Ethernet” said Örs. “Those can still come in through the regular CAN Ethernet connectivity ports but if there are added expansions needed for traditional sensors or sensors that we’re not covering yet they can all come in through the richer PCI Express slots.”

Mark Fitzgerald director of the autonomous vehicle practice at Strategy Analytics said that BlueBox 3.0 enables “fast prototyping of L2+ systems as developers can focus on their specific solution while using NXP and its partners’ development software. It saves time and money.

“The same can be said for the development of domain or zonal controllers within the vehicle — a definite trend for automakers” he added. “VW is going this route. All eyes are on them to see if a mass-market OEM can be successful” in keeping up with rapid changes in underlying vehicle architecture.

From AVs to ‘differentiated vehicles’

Carmakers have begun scaling back their initial all-out pursuit of full autonomy. Instead they are investing more energy and resources to enhance advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and other features.

NXP said that it seeks to provide carmakers with “immediate practical opportunity to harness compute power for differentiated vehicles.” The operative word is “differentiated.” Different OEMs plan to bring different features to next-generation vehicles. These include advanced networking solutions intelligent recorders for sensor data active safety parking assistance and driver assistance. OEMs are also looking to include elements that require more autonomy such as traffic jam pilot valet parking and highway pilot.

With BlueBox 3.0 NXP is offering “a much wider portfolio of applications” beyond ADAS and AVs said Örs. “We want them to use the BlueBox platform to experiment and build their own solutions.”

The issue for OEMs isn’t just slapping new hardware onto their vehicle architecture. Their concern is whether they have the right software and underlying architecture to support such new features. More importantly beyond playing with the new capabilities they must be able to test software by simulating and validating the safety of new functions.

Safety validation

For example highway pilot enables on-ramp off-ramp autonomous highway driving. But for safety’s sake carmakers must consider numerous potential scenarios and build a safety case proving their vehicles can handle each task.

When highway pilot is on the vehicle is essentially driving autonomously. What if the vehicle encounters a new construction zone not marked on the map? What if the vehicle has a catastrophic mechanical failure? What if sensors become so degraded that the vehicle is driving autonomously blind? Those scenarios are not rare enough to be categorized as corner cases. The vehicle should recognize such common crises swiftly and ask the driver to take over.

But what if the driver doesn’t respond or is suffering a medical emergency? The vehicle must be programmed first to reduce its speed and then to spot an emergency lane and pull over — provided there’s room to do so. If not the vehicle must be programmed to pursue what seems like the worst possible option: making an emergency stop in the middle of the road.

Hashing out the various scenarios is a necessary exercise and reminds carmakers that developing a highway pilot feature requires more than a processor with a lot of TOPS or AI/ML capabilities. Automakers need a development platform that allows them “to test out safety and build end solutions that are safe” said Örs.

BlueBox 3.0 versus rivals

“NXP along with competitors is transitioning from silicon suppliers to platform suppliers in order to move up the value chain” said Strategy Analytics’ Fitzgerald. “The BlueBox solution gives developers access to NXP and partners’ hardware and software and it is a gateway into development of ADAS/AV solutions that will include [existing] NXP chips already in production.” In his view that would lead to “more sales for NXP.”

Of course Nvidia already offers similar products such as the Nvidia DRIVE AGX Developer Kit which Fitzgerald described as “likely the closest competitor.

Then there is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride Platform. Also Intel and Mobileye are working on a full solution with silicon and software as well as internally developed radar and LiDAR Fitzgerald said.

It remains unclear what specific power consumption advantages BlueBox 3.0 brings. NXP’s presentation does not mention this issue. “Though not critical in a development platform production versions must be quite power-efficient to meet OEMs’/Tier Ones’ power budgets” said Fitzgerald. “The partnership with Kalray should help. Kalray claims their power consumption is one-tenth of existing solutions with limited to no cooling needs.”

From development platform to SoCs

Citing a key aspect of BlueBox 3.0 Örs said “We’re leveraging existing silicon already available in our portfolio. But [we’re] putting it together at a system level with multiple devices to give a scalable and flexible development platform to our partners and customers such that eventually some of these functionalities that are distributed in multiple devices could come into a single silicon device as well.”

Örs acknowledged that there’s “a lot more horsepower in the BlueBox than likely needed. Our expectation would be that customers are able to build their deployment software [and] improve the efficiency of their end system on the BlueBox. Maybe they would come up with their own more optimized version by using the same pieces of silicon or maybe different versions within the same family and deploy that into [their vehicles] in volume.

In other words NXP’s development platform becomes a testing ground from which both NXP and its customers can learn. If a leading OEM identifies its preferred direction on chips “their needs are typically reflected in our future-generation silicon” said Örs.

Path to autonomy

Egil Juliussen a veteran auto-industry analyst wondered whether BlueBox 3.0 is robust enough to address the inevitable evolution from ADAS to fully autonomous vehicles. Even if OEMs aren’t rolling out AVs right away “they are looking for a path to the future — L3 and L4 vehicles” he said.

BlueBox 3.0

NXP however believes the new BlueBox has the computing horsepower to serve the needs of future vehicles. Örs noted that “the LX2168A has 16 high-performance ARM Cortex-A72 cores. We have S32G274 for the current-generation gateway. It is somewhat flexible since we can upgrade on that slot in the future without changing the BlueBox itself.” He added that S32G allows for ASIL-D compliance which can act as both a safety co-processor and a gateway device for automotive.

NXP is launching BlueBox 3.0 with Kalray as the accelerator partner. “Kalray can have up to 160 CPU accelerator cores for neural net and math acceleration as needed” said Örs.

But what makes BlueBox 3.0 stand out is its doubling of PCIe slots to six from the three offered with the BlueBox 2.0.

Leveraging the terminology “high-performance compute” (HPC) often used in the server domain Örs explained that NXP is “trying to make the ‘server on the wheels’ concept more of a reality by deploying [BlueBox 3.0] in the automotive realm where safety and security are fundamental pillars of NXP’s portfolio.”

Software orchestration

All of the hardware building blocks for BlueBox 3.0 are ready according to NXP but it will take until the end of the first quarter for the company to finalize all the software elements that sit above the basic SDK layer. Those software elements are essential for BlueBox 3.0 to orchestrate data movement among multiple devices on the platform said Örs.

For example the data stream input for the cameras goes to the Kalray accelerator for object identification and classification. That data must then be fed into a planner compute module running on a large CPU device (i.e. LX2160A).

“That data path orchestration though the data is moving on a PCIe must be carried out efficiently” said Örs. “You need to make sure that the timing of each data packet coming in makes sense. Then it’s S32G that validates that those actuation commands are sane.”

Ecosystem

NXP takes pride in creating a “close knit” partner ecosystem to provide “a quick ramp-up” and “an example that system designers can work from” said Örs. In addition to Kalray partners backing BlueBox 3.0 include dSPACE Embotech Edge Case Research (ECR) eProsima Green Hills Software (GHS) Intempora Micron Technology MicroSys Real-Time Innovations (RTI) and Teraki.

Pumpjacks operate in the snow in the Permian Basin in Midland Texas U.S on Saturday Feb. 13 2021. Matthew Busch | Bloomberg | Getty Images

When a raging snowstorm and frigid temperatures hit Texas last month oil and gas behemoths responsible for producing and processing the lion share of the nation's reserves including Exxon  Occidental and Marathon Petroleum  shut down production at oil wells and refineries across the state. For many oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico the shutdown put upstream and downstream operations in a squeeze. Downstream multiple refining operations flared during shutdowns releasing air pollutants from processing units. Upstream as oil drilling came back online there was risk of needing to flare or halt oil production in the field until the broader energy market including refining and utility generation stabilized. Indeed satellite imagery showed increased flaring at oil and gas production sites in the Permian Basin did take place according to the Environmental Defense Fund. But at Occidental a choice was made to shut down some operations. ""There were a couple of plants that had difficulty coming back online"" Occidental's CEO Vicki Hollub said during a recent CNBC Evolve event focused on energy innovation. ""We could have put our production back online and just flared the gas. We chose not to do that. We left the production shut down because we didn't want to flare."" The decisions made during the Texas power crisis are part of a broader debate with the oil and gas industry over flaring the process of releasing greenhouse gas emissions through burning which has long been a controversial topic for environmental advocates and climate policy experts. The practice which is commonly used by oil and gas companies to relieve the pressure that builds up during oil production is responsible for releasing CO2 and methane into the atmosphere.

A more ambitious Big Oil goal

The flaring issue is a global one. According to the World Bank Group global gas flares burn approximately 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas every year emitting more than 400 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. Seventy-seven endorsers encompassing governments and oil companies around the world have signed onto the organization's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative which aims to eliminate all routine flaring within the next decade. While flaring is often used in cases where there's safety concerns or maintenance issues routine flaring means the flaring of gas associated with oil production. Several big oil and gas companies including Occidental Chevron and Shell have signed onto the pact. Zubin Bamji program manager of the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership said reducing gas flaring is attainable for many of these companies and is a ""low-hanging fruit"" among other methods to reduce emissions. Some experts say U.S. companies specifically need a more ambitious goal toward stopping routine flaring. The World Bank agreement focuses predominantly on reducing emissions in countries lacking the regulatory capacity and the infrastructure but some experts say U.S. companies can accomplish the feat by 2025. ""Here in Texas we're talking about a 100-year-old basin"" said Colin Leyden the director of regulatory and legislative affairs the Environmental Defense Fund. ""2030 works on the global framework but it lacks ambition domestically here in the U.S."" But flaring often remains a cheaper alternative to pushing the gas to market and flaring often comes down to the fundamentals of supply and demand.

Alternatives to flaring

The process of halting routine flaring by methods such as rewiring gas for electricity or internal uses isn't difficult in and of itself says Gunnar Schade an atmospheric scientist and associate professor at Texas A&M University who has written extensively on the topic. The technology is there it's a question of whether the companies want to make the investment and put in the money. Occidental's New Mexico operations now use a gas gathering system linked to third-party capacity and pipeline supply arrangements which it says reduced 2019 annual carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) flaring emissions by more than 60% versus what would have been emitted otherwise and that can be used in other upstream oil and gas projects to reduce flaring the company said in an annual climate report. As one recent report on flaring stated ""If most associated gas goes to sales the dilemma about how to manage it becomes largely moot."" Getting natural gas out of the Permian Basin to market is the preferred solution of the industry but the natural gas market has been marked by oversupply and low prices for years and for many companies the economic analysis does not favor a major change in current operations. There are onsite solutions that could become scalable. Some alternatives include building pipelines to pump gas back into businesses for heat and electricity or the implementation of vapor recovery units which can collect vapors and reduce emissions. ""The important thing to realize here is that stopping entails investments because flaring is free you don't have to pay anything for it the atmosphere is a free sewer"" Schade said.

Renewed focus on climate change

If natural gas prices were higher on a consistent basis the flaring issue would not be as significant Leyden says but with a long-term low-price outlook for natural gas a new regulatory framework to realign incentives is needed. Flaring is currently legal meaning regulatory policies that encourage using gas for other purposes are required. Some states are making progress. New Mexico recently began debating a bill to manage flaring and venting while advocacy groups and legislatures in Texas are slated to debate two bills which target the practice one of which would put a 25% tax on gas vented or flared while extracting oil. Typically flaring involves burning off the gas atop a large tower or stack. It's often used when oil companies lack facilities or markets available for the leftover gas. While the practice may be more environmentally friendly than venting a process which releases natural gas straight into the atmosphere it's still a key source of methane CO2 and emissions of other problematic compounds which can have drastic effects on human health. Technological advancements over the years have streamlined the process of flaring and its efficiency but organizations still say the practice is responsible for a large portion of emissions. According to data from The World Bank between 2014 and 2018 the United States ranked among the top five flaring countries globally behind Russia Iraq and Iran. In recent years oil giants have increased focus on emissions reduction including Exxon which plans to cut methane emissions by 40% to 50% and flaring by 35% to 45% by 2025. British oil giant BP and Royal Dutch Shell outlined plans toward net zero emissions by 2050. An end to routine flaring is part of these commitments but the companies need to take the expensive steps now to reengineer their operations. ""There are a lot of different options out there but the problem is they all come with a cost"" Leyden said. ""As long as flaring is an option because of a loose regulatory framework it's going to be difficult for these options to catch on."" Occidental was the first U.S. oil company to sign onto the World Bank no flaring policy by 2030.

Texas energy crisis and new policy

Amid the Texas crisis companies struggled to procure sources of power generations like natural gas yet at the same time companies continued to burn it off as natural gas and electricity prices rose an issue that left some consumers and industry critics dumbfounded. ""I can tell you we have flared in the past we also have to flare sometimes when third party plants go down but what we're trying best to do is minimize that"" Hollub said at the recent CNBC Evolve event. Many oil and gas companies like Occidental are more sensitive to the environmental issues at the forefront of investor efforts. The world's largest money manager BlackRock  will require companies it invests in to disclose direct emissions. Earlier this year President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement calling on agencies to review and reinstate regulations dismissed under the Trump administration. ""I would much rather have us business do it ourselves and that's one of my big cries out in this letter: we need to do it ourselves before the government does it for us"" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in a CNBC interview earlier this year after releasing the company's 2021 letter to CEOs which called for more climate change disclosure from companies. ""We've had a lack of oversight on oil and gas"" Leyden said. The Railroad Commission of Texas which has jurisdiction over the industry's operations but has not in the past cracked down on it has recently moved to take a closer look as investors and legislators place more attention on the issue. The recent energy crisis could be a turning point for the self-regulation approach in the state. ""The large amounts of flaring are a microcosm of what can result from self regulation"" Leyden said. ""The investment community is lining up around 2025. It has to happen rapidly. 2030 that's a decade out and this is one of the easier things they can do from a policy standpoint."" The scale of flaring in the Permian is significant. New markets — and costs such as taxes on flaring or strict permitting requirements for new wells — could incentivize companies to see the economics of flaring differently combined with the investor focus on ESG. ""If you have a policy that says we won't tolerate routine flaring that you can't bring an oil well online can't start pumping until you have destination for the gas that will change the economics around midstream as well and increase the need to invest in the infrastructure"" Leyden said. A 2019 analysis from the Baker Institute at Rice University noted that if all flared or vented gas in the Permian was captured and liquefied it could fill a Q-Max LNG carrier (the world's largest carrier size) every 10 days. The report added ""If that vessel went to China and discharged its cargo into a power plant it could likely displace approximately 440 thousand tonnes of coal burned to generate electricity."" ""Every company that has operations with flaring is now under pressure ... not just pressure from shareholders and employees but the entire world to reduce flaring and I don't see that focus and pressure letting off"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's U.S. oil gas and chemicals sector.

@stacey_writes

It’s not every day you earn the No. 1 spot on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” Top 10 plays. But for Sudbury-raised Scott Holzwasser that day was March 3.

The redshirt senior on Northeastern University’s baseball team garnered the top play for his high-flying double in a game against UMass. With NU hosting UMass in its home-opener Holzwasser hit an RBI double to left center in the bottom of the fifth inning. He rounded first base and trying to avoid the second-baseman’s tag leapt over him and outstretched his right arm to safety.

“It almost looked like … he was on strings and someone was pulling him up like ‘The Matrix’” Northeastern head baseball coach Mike Glavine said.

“I had been struggling early on” Holzwasser said. “So I was really just trying to get a good hit. I luckily got that.”

Holzwasser could tell while running past first base that the throw to second was going to beat him to the base. Quickly thinking of ways to evade the out he planted his foot into the ground before reaching second and jumping over the UMass second baseman.

“Me and that second baseman have played against each other a whole lot. He messaged me after the game saying that was a great slide” Holzwasser said. “So I have a lot of respect for him.”

The Huskies beat the Minutemen 11-2 in their fourth game of the season. Holzwasser said the team had to be up at 3:30 the next morning to ride down to Virginia for a three-game series at Old Dominion University. That’s when he found out about his play being aired on ESPN.

“I wouldn’t say I expected it but it’s definitely been a dream. I’ve seen some of my friends on ‘SportsCenter’ with top plays (and) been a little jealous of them and some teammates” he said with a laugh. “It’s great to finally get up there and have a little bragging rights against them.”

“He’s always been an ESPN-type guy” said Kirk Fredericks his former coach at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School and with the New England Ruffnecks a summer baseball travel league. “Any moment when he’s in the batter’s box the ball just jumps off his bat.”

After Holzwasser’s teammates coaches and family celebrated his spot-worthy play one of his roommate’s had some fun and edited the video comparing his jump to the way a cat moves when it’s alarmed. “My friend made an edit to that (video) of a cat making a startled noise when I jumped up.”

While Holzwasser is happy and humbled to be recognized by ESPN he’s ultimately excited to be on a baseball field again with his teammates.

“This is my last college season and I’m really just trying to make the most of it. Individual achievements are cool but obviously winning the conference championship for the first time at Northeastern is everything that we’re looking for” he said. “That’s what I’m really concentrated on.”

In 2020 the Huskies stood at 10-5 overall when their season was cut short last March because of the coronavirus pandemic. So far this season has been altered with COVID-19 protocols. Glavine said the team hadn’t been together fully prior to its season-opener on Feb. 19 at Wake Forest. The team rides separate buses to practice every day takes two buses when it travels and practices in small groups among other coronavirus-induced changes.

“We’ve really had to split up our team and some of that team defense and stuff like that has been challenging to get our work in” Holzwasser said. “So that’ll come with time and just more experience playing this spring.”

After winning one of three at Old Dominion from March 5 to 7 the Huskies dominated the University of Albany 10-1 on March 9 in their second home game at Friedman Diamond. The Huskies were 5-5 heading into Saturday’s game with UMass Lowell. The rest of March they’ll face Bryant University Villanova Boston College and UMass.

“Our coach always says we’re lucky to be out there and get to be together” Holzwasser said of competing this season. “We’re obviously trying to win a conference championship so … every day is just working toward that.”

Glavine said the coaches talk to the players about gratitude appreciation having that opportunity to play together and making the most of it. “It’s been a blast being back out on the field. I know for everybody mentally physically it’s been a huge energy boost.”

Holzwasser’s Matrix-looking cat-jumping RBI double gave the Huskies an extra jolt of excitement after their win. Both Glavine and Fredericks enjoy watching Holzwasser’s growth as a baseball player.

“He’s a special kid a talented player and he’s got some incredible athletic skills and jumping ability” Glavine said. “If anyone were to do something like that on our team it would be him.”

“Whether it’s him facing the Red Sox in spring training as they’ve done in the past or making a play like that – it’s things that (we were) seeing every day when he was 15 years old and now it just brings a smile to your face.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpZGVvcGVuY291bnRyeS5jb20vMjAyMS1ncmFtbXktYXdhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Grammy Awards: See the Full List of Country Winners,"The 2021 Grammy Awards hosted by Trevor Noah aired on CBS at 7 p.m. CT.

This means that the increase in Chinese exports will account for nearly 50 per cent of the total export growth of all RCEP members. Although these benefits may not offset the total losses of a persisting US–China trade war they help soften the blow to China and reduce export reliance on the United States.

RCEP also strengthens the division of labour across regional supply chains and help upgrade China’s industrial structure. Low labour costs in ASEAN countries have seen Chinese trade surpluses with ASEAN shrink since 2015 indicating an emerging supply chain relocation from China to Southeast Asia. China’s tariff-elimination commitments under RCEP further accelerates this process. China’s imports of labour-intensive goods from ASEAN countries are set to grow significantly. The inflows of these goods might increase competition with Chinese firms and generate adjustment costs that could drive them towards capital and technology-intensive manufacturing and production.

RCEP will help bring inflows of foreign investment into China. Liberalisation under RCEP includes reductions in behind-the-border barriers such as discriminatory treatment against foreign investment. The Chinese government has also promised to reduce limitations on market access and further open up a number of service and non-service sectors to multinational corporations (MNC).

Many MNCs have been wary of China’s intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements. RCEP is expected to have positive effects on IPR protection in China. RCEP’s IP chapter does have its limitations and the majority of the provisions have already been implemented in China but articles 11.15 11.17 and 11.62 help the Chinese government take stricter measures. There will be stronger measures to protect digital rights management information increase the use of non-infringing computer software and destroy pirated goods and counterfeit materials. Foreign MNCs may be more attracted to committing resources to the country including bringing international financing and technologies. They will enhance local Chinese production engineering and design capabilities.

China will benefit tremendously from RCEP geopolitically. First China’s involvement in RCEP reassures neighbouring countries. Engaging actively in Asian multilateralism signals its commitment to preserving peace and promoting regional growth. Participation in RCEP demonstrates that China is willing to further open its market and be bound by common regional rules. This helps allay geopolitical suspicion among neighbours.

Second China’s political power in the region will strengthen. RCEP reinforces economic interdependence between China and other participating countries. This will further push the region into China’s economic and political orbit and enable Beijing to exert influence on regulations and standards within the bloc.

China seeks to conclude a trilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea and Japan to strengthen economic connectedness and build political trust. RCEP could play a catalytic role in the negotiation process boosting the determination of China Japan and South Korea to make a political decision. Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to speed up negotiations for the trilateral FTA in November 2020. It is expected that leaders will meet to discuss later this year.

Following the signing of RCEP competition between the United States and China could intensify. China’s participation in RCEP further leverages its economic and political clout and impel the United States to respond in the effort to vie for geopolitical primacy in the region. The United States may be expected to maintain its trade tariffs on Chinese goods accelerate technological decoupling with China and adopt additional strategies to advance its own industries and technologies. No matter what path the United States ultimately takes China will continue to ramp up cooperation with countries across Asia and Europe and seek to advance its indigenous technologies.

The Biden administration has emphasised multilateralism and mending the liberal international order built by the United States. Biden has indicated some interest in re-joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but domestic pressures may make this unlikely even under new terms that favour the United States. Biden has also reached out to political leaders in Australia Japan India and South Korea expressing his desire to deepen security alliances.

If the United States pushed the importance of trade accords like the TPP and strengthened the ‘hub-and-spokes’ network of FTAs centred around the country Washington could better underscore its commitment to the Asia Pacific region and provide its allies and partners with economic alternatives. There could also be room for cooperation between the United States and China but more overt and intense competition between China and the United States is looking increasingly likely.

In another “rabbit hole moment” I lost myself in a bout of reminiscence on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. A prehistoric SemiSerious blog post from 2009 attempted to provide updates from ISSCC 2009. TechInsights engineers Aaron Murray James Bull and Mohammad Ahmad provided the boots on the ground reports to HQ. I believe these three fine gentlemen all continue their yeoman’s work at the Ottawa company.

At ISSCC 2009 Intel was presenting a number of papers related to its Nehalem processor. Mark Bohr’s plenary indicated that Intel was putting a lot of effort into system-on-chip (SoC) development. The Core i7 Nehalem design pulled the memory controllers and DDR3 I/O’s onto a common substrate with the CPU cores. At the time Intel suggested that they were looking beyond the traditional PC market and into hotter ones like mobile. In Bohr’s words “Intel is no longer a one-size-fits-all company.”

From this there was a recollection of a “great debate” between SoC and system-in-package (SiP) advocates. Intel had been focused on package integration while Texas Instruments pounded the SoC drum. Now it would be reasonable to ask what relevance these two companies might have on the 2021 landscape considering that other players are trending higher in the conversation than these two old stalwarts. Gordon Moore’s company and the birthplace of his law was already thinking about More than Moore (MTM) back then.

The idea of the disagreggation of integrated circuit design into smaller physical pieces of silicon chiplets that can be mixed and matched Lego-style at the package level has been generating buzz for some time. For Intel’s part they have not abandoned the SoC mentality but continue to dispel the one-size-fits-all label. From Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to their central role in the State-of-the-art Heterogeneous Integration Prototype (SHIP) program it appears Intel will not be left behind. Integration of diverse designs using more specialized chiplets fit Intel as much as any other company whether direct competitors like AMD with their EPYC implementations or vendors with completely different market aspirations.

In the 2009 ISSCC coverage I predicted that Intel would be ready for mobile based on this renewed focus on the SoC. Looking back it’s easy to see how wrong I was. Fast forward and the big data age and AI accelerators are much more interesting to a company like Intel. Acquiring an FPGA company (Altera) in 2015 helped maintain Intel’s territory in the data center as cloud computing drove a more rapid advance in technology as well as market importance.

Volatile vernacular

There have been a few incarnations of terms along the way. Anyone who has posted on topics like heterogeneous integration can relate a story or two of commenters reminding them that only the term not the technology is new. But cut some slack here. We are all just trying to fill column space.

In general heterogeneous integration was a term adopted to sell MTM as an approach to keep innovation moving and industry economics headed in the right direction. A seminar or conference or at least a conference call between marketing departments would have helped. The original vernacular was heterogeneous integration technology (HIT). ASE Group truncated this to HI. Hello right back at you.

IEEE went so far as to create a new pronoun with its heterogeneous integration roadmap (HIR).

In a land before time inhabited by engineers who may tell you fond stories of rubylith days there were hybrid integrated circuits. Hybrids were collections of different component types to create a functional module. The hybrids were definitely heterogeneous. In that sense today’s lingo is just re-branding with the help of a thesaurus.

Moving on there was the multi-chip module or MCM. These were perhaps less heterogeneous than the hybrids since multiple die were assembled onto a common package substrate. But several functions and even multiple material system ICs for example silicon along with GaAs were collected into these platforms. Adding a discrete or two maybe some decoupling capacitors would definitely make this another hybrid or heterogeneous application.

Someone who was more intimately involved at the time could help shed light on this but it would seem to me that MCM was meant to denote a change where multiple individual integrated circuit die appeared on a common substrate. That was the milestone that spawned the new term.

The MCM is still important today decades after the technology was introduced. With the advent of newer enabling technologies like through-silicon vias (TSVs) and 2.5D integration with silicon interposers a More than Moore strategy moves the industry toward the 3DIC. The most influential products in this field are the so-called high bandwidth memory (HBM) products. One of these seemed to acknowledge history rather than inventing a new term. The Hybrid Memory Cube (HBC) product co-developed by Micron and Samsung used the latest TSV approach to stacking multiple DRAM die with their controller.

One term has more or less persisted. System-in-package (SiP) has been around for a couple of decades. That’s an eternity considering the pace of change in terminology at least.

The ASE Group introduction to HI illustrates and explains collecting a set of dissimilar die into a single SiP. This is an obvious representation of the chiplet concept but the term does not appear on the page.

Chiplets rising

One should never discount the importance of terminology and marketing to technology. There is spin re-spin regurgitation and recycling.

Enter chiplets.

Why not? It’s easy to say and easy to digest the concept. It’s much better than the nerdier multi-chip module (easy to interpret) or heterogeneous integration (open to interpretation).

To get an idea of when the term became popular Google Trends provides a history of chiplet as a search term going back to 2004. There was an early dalliance with the chiplet but that died down quickly. The real uptick has been since 2019.

Google Trends is useful but it will not reveal the context in which chiplet was searched. Rather than stand by the assumption that the chiplet we are considering took off only two years ago a look at patent activity will be more revealing. This information trove gives us a much longer timeline as well.

A search of the patent databases reveals use of the chiplet term as early as 1969. However in the integrated circuit field it is only in IBM applications published in late 2000 that our current understanding of the term and technology align.

Although this early use of chiplet is not in the heterogeneous sense we understand to mean a SiP of heterogeneous die. The early days of chiplets were related to driver chips for LCDs. And that makes sense if you have looked closely at any display panel larger than a cell phone. Whether on flex substrates attached to the panel glass or directly on the panel there are many tall and skinny LCD column driver chiplets attached to each large LCD panel.

Looking at this from a trending term perspective it is fair to say that use in a reasonable volume of patent applications would provide an indication of the adoption of the term. In that sense chiplets really pick up the pace in 2010. It is worth noting that several entities and inventors involved in display technology continue to represent a a large proportion of the activity related to chiplets. However for system-in-package heterogeneous integration IBM GlobalFoundries and Intel are the most active companies.

Like it or not “chiplet” is here to stay. “Googling” it and patenting it make it so.

It seems like going down a rabbit hole loves company. It’s time we all came up for air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2luZGlhLmNvbS9ibG9nL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbm90LWp1c3QtY292aWQtMTktYXV0b21vYmlsZS1zZWN0b3JzLW90aGVyLXByb2JsZW0tbWljcm9jb250cm9sbGVyLXNob3J0YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not Just Covid-19 Automobile Sector's Other Problem: Microcontroller Shortage,"Ashim Sharma is Partner & Group Head at NRI Consulting & Solutions and can be reached at ashim.sharma@nri.com.

As the global automotive sector is gearing up to recover from a slump in sales caused by Covid-19 there is yet another crisis dampening its revival. A global semiconductor shortage is disrupting global automotive production and may cause a delay in the sales of new vehicles. Microcontrollers (MCUs) a crucial component of electronic control units used in modern infotainment systems advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and other electronic stability systems are in short supply forcing carmakers to reduce output and they are therefore selectively idling plants until the shortage eases.

Semiconductor shortage has impacted all major OEMs or original equipment manufacturing units with some more severely affected than others. Globally Volkswagen AG Ford Motor GM Nissan Motors Honda Fiat Chrysler have either slashed production or paused production in some plants in order to keep making higher-demand models in factories. Toyota Hyundai/Kia and BMW are relatively better placed in tackling the current crisis. In India it is Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors' commercial vehicles that have been impacted by the current shortage of semiconductors.

Global light vehicle production is estimated to be reduced by one million vehicles in the first quarter of 2021 due to supply constraints. As the crisis is still unfolding the overall magnitude of the problem is still unknown. Disruptions are expected to spread to the second half of 2021 severely affecting the global automotive revenue this year. Shortages are estimated to cause $70-$80 billion in lost revenue for the current year.

Capacity constraints in the semiconductor supply As automotive demand fell for the most part of 2020 due to the pandemic OEMs and suppliers reduced inventories automotive suppliers canceled orders to external foundries for chip manufacturing while at the same time internal capacity of foundries was reduced or hampered due to pandemic-induced shortage of labour. A quicker-than-expected recovery in the automotive industry due to a reduced preference for public transport the in aftermath of the pandemic has ramped up the demand for chips from automotive industry at a time when supply is constrained due to demand spur in consumer electronics industry.

OEMs source MCUs from tier-I suppliers like Bosch Denso Continental and more which further outsource the design and manufacture to tier-II suppliers. OEMs use multiple MCU suppliers to diversify risk often using the direct-buy arrangement with a tier-I supplier where OEMs indicate the choice of tier-II suppliers.

However there is limited diversification at the tier-III level as all major MCU suppliers outsource a majority of chip manufacturing to foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) that alone accounts for 70 percent of all automotive MCU manufacturing. Hence at the tier-III level there is a limited choice and has led to the bottleneck for the industry. With the sudden rise in demand for chips for the consumer electronics industry automotive manufacturers find themselves on the back foot.

This comes nearly after a decade when the automotive industry was reeling under another similar crisis due to shortage of specialty pigments used to paint cars in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. Most of the industry relied on a single factory in Japan to supply this pigment which forced OEMs to restrict production. Another similar crisis hit the automotive industry when a crucial plastic resin supplier in Germany suffered a production loss after an explosion. However not much has changed over the decade for the automotive industry which has failed to protect itself from such risks associated with the occurrence of once-in-a-while events like pandemics earthquakes and other calamities.

Way Forward for OEMs

The current crisis has once again highlighted the need for OEMs to reassess their supply chain risk mitigation strategies. Most of these crises in the past and the current chip shortage can be attributed limited diversification in supply chain for crucial components or materials at the tier-II or tier-III level which pose an enormous risk in the event of an unlikely disruption. Assessment of the financial impact due to disruption at different nodes of the supply chain can help OEMs quantify the risks caused by such disruption in the supply chain.

A stepwise approach that begins with understanding and mapping the supply chain network scenarios planning and leading to risk mitigation strategies need to be drawn out to minimise the effect of disruption on the supply chain and in turn vehicle production.

Homegrown auto major Tata Motors is optimistic that the supply constraint of semiconductors that has impacted its commercial vehicles production will be back to normal by the second half of the next fiscal according to a senior company official.The company which had hiked prices in October and January to offset the impact of rising commodity rates is looking at taking a similar step in April in the wake of continued increase in steel and other raw material prices.""In H2 (second half of the ongoing fiscal) we have also seen the semiconductors becoming a major constraint. This is something which has actually affected us in the commercial vehicles (CVs) also"" Tata Motors President Commercial Vehicle Business Unit Girish Wagh told PTI.Stating that the semiconductor supply constraints started from November he said ""We have seen some impact. Initially it was on the small commercial vehicles (SCV) and later we have also seen some impact happening in medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV).""In terms of actual impact on production he said it varies from segment to segment with the ""highest in SCVs and the least in I&LCV (intermediate and light commercial vehicles) and M&HCV is somewhere in between"".In order to overcome the challenge the company has taken several steps including engaging with suppliers talking to semiconductor manufacturers to get some of the consignments faster or making some changes in the product configuration so that the requirement is reduced he added.When asked how long the issue is likely to continue Wagh said ""As suppliers have indicated to us the impact should go on gradually reducing. Therefore from that perspective I am looking at next (fiscal) year from an optimistic mindset...towards the end of Q2 and beginning of H2 we should be seeing the supply side completely on track but the situation is indeed very very dynamic...""On commodity price increase Wagh said it has been ""quite significant this year especially steel"".However the company has worked on additional cost reduction as it had done during the pandemic besides passing on some of the burden to customers.""There was a price hike in October and there was a price hike in January also. We are now monitoring the situation to see what happens going ahead for the next year...and looking at the current situation we will also be looking at doing the same in the month of April when we get in the next year"" he added.Tata Motors will overcome the challenge of commodity price increase through a balance of pricing action and accelerating cost reduction he added.When asked about the growth prospects for the upcoming fiscal Wagh said the CV industry is expected to grow over 30 per cent with favourable conditions outweighing negatives such as high fuel prices and uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and Tata Motors will look to grow faster than the industry.""We aim to grow our market share as part of strengthening our leadership position. Therefore we aim to grow at a rate which is higher than the industry rate next year"" he said.",,,

For people who enjoy reading stories about extreme wealth March 13 should be a holiday. If it was a holiday today we would be celebrating the 35th anniversary of the launch of one of the greatest wealth-creating machines in human history. What happened 35 years ago today? That's the day a little software company in Seattle called Microsoft went public.

The events of March 13 1986 would eventually mint thousands of millionaires a handful of billionaires and three of the largest personal fortunes in human history. Within a decade of its IPO company co-founder Bill Gates would be the richest person in the world a title he held for the better part of 20 years.

How much wealth did Microsoft generate for its founders and where is that wealth today? How rich would you be today if you had been lucky enough to buy $10000 worth of MSFT on March 13 1986 and held for the next 35 years collecting dividends and new shares from stock splits? Let's find out!

Early History of Microsoft

Microsoft was founded by childhood friends Bill Gates (aged 20) and Paul Allen (aged 22) in Albuquerque New Mexico on April 4 1975. Yes that's right Albuquerque. Not Seattle. The reason the company was founded in Albuquerque is because it happened to be the hometown of a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).

Allen and Gates met while they were both attending Seattle's Lakeside School. They bonded over their love of computers and programming. Allen was two years older than Gates. After getting a perfect score on the SAT Allen enrolled at Washington State University. He dropped out after two years and took a job at Honeywell in Boston whose offices happened to be a few minutes from Harvard where Bill had recently enrolled.

[Fun fact – earlier this week MacKenzie Scott (ex-wife of current richest person in the world Jeff Bezos) announced she married a science teacher named Dan Jewett. Dan is a science teacher at… Lakeside School!]

In January 1972 Popular Electronics Magazine did a feature on MITS' latest invention the Altair 8800 microcomputer. According to legend Paul saw the cover of the magazine while walking through Harvard Square. He bought the magazine tracked down Bill and frantically convinced him that they both needed to leave Boston (Bill was in the middle of his junior year) and move to Albuquerque where they would build an operating system for the Altair.

That's exactly what happened.

Executives at MITS were impressed with their OS and hired the young duo to create software for the company. But Allen and Gates had bigger ideas and soon struck out on their own.

On April 4 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded ""Micro-Soft"" in Albuquerque.

In 1976 ""Micro-Soft"" generated $16005 in revenue selling software to some of the world's first personal computers.

In January 1979 after dropping the hyphen Microsoft relocated to Seattle. In addition to being closer to their childhood homes Gates and Allen found it difficult to recruit top quality programmers to move to New Mexico.

Steve Ballmer one of Bill's friends from Harvard became Microsoft employee #30 on June 11 1980. He was hired to run business development.

One Brilliant Decision Launches A Fountain Of Wealth

That same year (1980) IBM announced its intention to hire a software company to develop an operating system that would become standard for all IBM personal computers. IBM initially approached Microsoft. Incredibly Gates suggested they get in touch with his friend Gary Kildall down in the Bay Area the founder of a company called Digital Research Inc. which had already developed an OS that could be adaptable to IBM machines. Gates even went so far as to call Gary while the IBM people were still in his office so they could set up a time to meet the following day.

Depending on who you talk to Gary's IBM meeting was bungled for a couple different reasons. Here's what is known: When the IBM executives arrived for their meeting they were greeted by Gary's wife Dorothy. Gary for reasons that have been debated for decades missed the meeting because he was out flying his plane. The stuffy IBM executives were incensed. They flew back to Seattle and asked Bill if he would reconsider building their operating system.

Bill said yes.

There was just one problem. Microsoft wasn't anywhere close to developing what could be used as an OS for IBM. Soooo Bill called up a Seattle-based developer named Tim Paterson who had developed a clone of Gary's software which he called ""86-DOS"". Bill negotiated a deal to buy 86-DOS for $100000.

Bill and his team made a couple nominal changes. They also changed the OS name from ""86-DOS"" to MS-DOS.

The IBM team was extremely happy with what they saw in MS-DOS and wanted to strike a formal partnership for that to be the standard operating system for all of their machines.

In what is arguably the most brilliant move in business history instead of selling the rights to MS-DOS directly to IBM Gates opted to license the software. As a result Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS and could therefore license it new customers.

Step back for a moment and digest the significance of that decision.

Imagine if Henry Ford hired you to invent an engine for his automobile. And imagine if instead of selling your creation to him outright you licensed it so you earned a fee every time a Ford car was sold. Then as new car companies like Dodge Buick Chevrolet Ferrari… etc… pop up you licensed your engine to them as well. So you earned a royalty every time a car was sold for the 100+ years.

That's exactly what happened with Microsoft. As the PC revolution exploded around the world MS-DOS became the standard for pretty much every computer that was built. And every time someone bought a PC they were also forced to buy a MS-DOS license from Microsoft.

When Microsoft officially incorporated in 1981 Steve Ballmer owned 8% of the company Paul Allen owned 25% and Bill Gates owned 45%. The remaining 22% was split up among some of the luckiest people ever to join a risky young startup.

""The Graphical User Interface""

In 1983 Xerox developed a revolutionary operating system that connected the PC's mouse to the computer screen. For the first time ever a human could move his or her hand and the mouse would follow. Point click. Drag drop. It was originally called the ""graphical point and click interface"". More commonly known today as the ""graphical user interface"" (GUI pronounced ""Gooey""). This little innovation is still the standard in every computer to this day.

For some insane reason Xerox invited executives from both Apple and Microsoft to check out what they had created. Literally they invited Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to come view a demonstration. This would be like inventing a new type of alcohol that didn't cause hangovers then inviting executives from all the major alcohol companies to come by and check out the ingredients.

Within a matter of months both Apple and Microsoft were working on their own operating systems that had graphical point and click mouse interfaces.

When Steve Jobs learned that Microsoft was also working on an operating system based on Xerox's innovations he was furious. He demanded Bill Gates come to Apple's headquarters and account for his actions. Here's how that legendary interaction went down in an Apple conference room:

Jobs screamed:

""You're ripping us off! I trusted you and now you're stealing from us!""

Gates sat coolly on the other side of the conference room while Steve unloaded his fury. When the Apple founder was done Gates replied:

""Well Steve I think there's more than one way of looking at it. I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.""

Microsoft Windows was released on November 20 1985. Within a matter of months the PC became the global computing standard and subsequently pushed Apple to the wayside for more than a decade. And every time a PC was sold Microsoft earned a fat royalty check for its software.

Over the next several months Microsoft would slowly gain a number of new private investors. According to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations once a company has more than 500 private shareholders it must go public. Therefore an IPO was inevitable even though Bill Gates would have preferred to stay private.

March 13 1986 – IPO DAY

Microsoft wasn't the first software company to IPO in the mid-1980s. It wasn't the only software company to go public in March of 1986! Literally one day before Microsoft's IPO Larry Ellison's Oracle Corp went public. Oracle planned to offer 2.1 million shares at $15 per share. By the end of its first trading day Oracle shares sat at $19.25. This was seen as a very positive sign by the bankers guiding Microsoft's debut so MSFT's opening price was raised from $16 to $21.

At 9:35 am on March 13 1986 MSFT opened at $25.75 per share. Goldman Sach's CEO could be heard on the trading floor shouting:

""It's wild! I've never seen anything like it — every last person here is trading Microsoft and nothing else!""

By the end of trading 3.6 million MSFT shares had been exchanged and the stock price (having peaked at $29.25) ended the day at $27.75.

So how much were Gates Allen and Ballmer worth after their smash hit IPO? $10 billion? $20 billion? $50 billion? $100 billion???? Nope nope nope and nope. Microsoft ended the day with a total market cap of $780 million.

Gates' 45% stake was worth $350 million.

Allen's 25% stake was worth $195 million.

Ballmer's 8% stake was worth $51.5 million.

That's right Bill Gates was worth ""just"" $350 million after the Microsoft IPO. What's even crazier is the fact that he personally only sold $1.6 million worth of shares on opening day. He wasn't even in Seattle when the company went public. Bill was in Australia on vacation on IPO day. He would eventually use $150000 of his IPO earnings to pay off the mortgage on his Seattle house.

Paul Allen who was at least actually in Seattle on IPO day told a local paper that he was ""very happy"" and ""might go out for some champagne later to celebrate"". What a couple of maniacs!

Fortunes Made

Here's what happened to Microsoft in the 30 years since it has been a public company.

Microsoft (both the company and the stock price) grew at an unbelievable pace after going public. By 1990 annual revenue topped $1 billion. By 1997 the company was generating $10 billion in revenue. In 2020 Microsoft generated $143 billion in revenue $53 billion in operating income while returning $35 billion to shareholders in dividends.

As of this writing the company has a market cap of $1.7 trillion.

Bill Gates officially became a billionaire for the first time about a year after the IPO in 1987. By the mid 1990s as his net worth topped $10 billion Bill was anointed the richest person in the world a title he held without contention for the next twenty years. His net worth crossed $40 billion for the first time in 1997. In 1999 at the height of dotcom fever his net worth broke $100 billion for the first time.

As of this writing Bill Gates is the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $137 billion. Interestingly he actually does not own that much Microsoft anymore. Today Bill owns less than 1.3% of the company he founded. He has donated tens of billions of dollars to charity and intends to give the majority of his fortune away before he dies.

Paul Allen actually left Microsoft in the mid-1980s but stayed on the company's board of directors until 2000. Paul used his fortune to invest in companies like Dreamworks and an impressive portfolio of real estate. He owned three sports teams the Seattle Seahawks Seattle Sounders FC and the Portland Trailblazers. He had a net worth of $20 billion at the time of his death in October 2018. His wealth will eventually be donated to charity. The estate is currently managed by his sister Jody Allen.

Steve Ballmer took over as Microsoft CEO in 2000 when Bill Gates stepped back from the company. He served as CEO until 2014. He still owns around 333 million shares of Microsoft and has a personal net worth of $87 billion. That makes him the 10th-richest person in the world. Ballmer owns the Los Angeles Clippers. As of this writing it's unclear what Ballmer plans to do with his wealth. Interestingly he is NOT joined Bill Gates' Giving Pledge.

$10000 Invested In 1986

So how much would you be worth today if you bought a bunch of MSFT shares and held on to them for 35 years?

If you had bought $10000 worth of Microsoft on the IPO day you would have been able to acquire 476 shares. After various stock splits and dividend reinvestments today you would own 137088 shares.

At today's closing price your stake would be worth $32215680.

When Microsoft pays its quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share you would receive $76769. That's $307076 per year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CEO Gregory Hayes was paid a $1.4 million salary $2.5 million bonus more than $14.5 million in stock and option awards the value of personal use of corporate aircraft pension contributions and other compensation according to a regulatory filing Friday.

Due to COVID-19 which sharply reduced air travel and revenue at Raytheon’s airline customers the company canceled merit increases for employees and executives of United Technologies Corp. which merged with defense giant Raytheon last year. It also cut salaries between June and December by 10% at Collins Aerospace Pratt & Whitney and corporate employees.

At Hayes’ request Raytheon said it cut his base salary for the six months by 20%.

Raytheon’s compensation committee cited Hayes’ work spinning off heating and cooling equipment manufacturer Carrier and Otis Elevator into publicly traded companies completing the UTC-Raytheon deal and navigating the “unprecedented industry and business challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Hayes’s total annual compensation last year was 193 times the median pay of about $109000 for Raytheon employees the company said.

United Technologies and Raytheon closed on the merger in April 2020 10 months after the deal was announced and coinciding with the onset of COVID-19. Within days of the closing Hayes told employees that air travel was down 96% forcing Raytheon to cut pay and impose furloughs.

By the fall he told investor analysts that Raytheon cut 16500 jobs worldwide.

Raytheon’s defense business is strong but its two commercial aviation businesses took a financial hit. Adjusted revenue at Pratt & Whitney last year was $17.2 billion down nearly $3.7 billion from 2019 a drop of 18%.

At Collins adjusted sales were $19.4 billion down $6.6 billion a drop of one-fourth from 2019. Profit dropped by 70%.

Raytheon has said it does not expect airline travel to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023.

Marketed nationwide by Cashmere Wash.-based Crunch Pak the package sells for about $2.98 and has a refrigerated shelf life of 25 days. The flexible film lidding was developed by American Packaging Corp. (APC) and the thermoformed tray by Indepak.

“This was a good way to get into that medium snack/small meal category” says Drew Dalgetty Vice President of Production and Operations at Crunch Pak. “And with our core business being apples naturally we wanted apples to be part of the mix.” He adds that for now at least the modified-atmosphere packaging is done by an outside party.

Putting a fresh fruit as well as fresh meat into the same package required what Dalgetty calls “specific characteristics” where the packaging materials are concerned. APC in partnership with Crunch Pak developed a special clear lidding structure that maintains freshness and nutritional value for the wide variety of food items in the convenient tray pack. APC arrived at a lidding structure that would heat seal to and then easily peel from the tray. Normally foods like this especially fresh fruits require different types of packaging and barrier materials so the challenge was to develop a single lidding structure that would accommodate those various foods all within one tray design.

The key to this single lidding structure is independently managing the gas levels in each compartment to maximize the shelf life. That is the piece of film covering the apples is perforated or microperforated in such a way that the fresh apples can receive as much oxygen as they need and give off as much CO 2 as they need to continue the natural process of respiration that keeps them fresh and tasty for 25 days. But at the same time the film covering the other components provides the necessary barrier to gas transmission that keeps them equally fresh and tasty.

The sheet from which the trays are thermoformed is a multilayer coextrusion that includes PET as well as EVOH for barrier. Also critical in the composition of the tray is that the layer that meets the lidding material provides both a secure and hermetic seal while still allowing convenient peelability in the hands of the consumer.

APC’s lidding material is a multilayer construction of reverse-printed polyester adhesive laminated to a seven-layer blown coextrusion that includes EVOH at the center for barrier. The printing is done flexographically in up to 10 colors. APC takes care of the printing and laminating after which in this particular flexible film structure comes the patterned perforation.

Since Microsoft disclosed actively exploited Microsoft Exchange security vulnerabilities known collectively as ProxyLogon administrators and security researchers have been scrambling to protect vulnerable servers exposed on the Internet.

These attacks are being used to drop web shells cryptominers and more recently the DearCry ransomware on exploited servers.

Earlier this week a security researcher named Nguyen Jang published a blog post detailing a proof of concept (POC) exploit for the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerability. Jang also shared a purposely broken exploit on GitHub that needs some fixes to work properly.

""Firstly the PoC I gave can not run correctly. It will be crashed with many of errors. Just for trolling the reader"" Jang told BleepingComputer.

The PoC though provided enough information that security researchers and threat actors could use it to develop a functional remote code execution exploit for Microsoft Exchange servers.

Soon after the PoC was published Jang received an email from Microsoft-owned GitHub stating that the PoC was being taken down as it violated Acceptable Use Policies.

In a statement to BleepingComputer GitHub said they took down the PoC to protect devices that are being actively exploited.

""We understand that the publication and distribution of proof of concept exploit code has educational and research value to the security community and our goal is to balance that benefit with keeping the broader ecosystem safe. In accordance with our Acceptable Use Policies GitHub disabled the gist following reports that it contains proof of concept code for a recently disclosed vulnerability that is being actively exploited."" - GitHub.

New exploit puts it in reach of script kiddies

This weekend a different security researcher published a new ProxyLogon PoC that requires very little modification to exploit a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server and drop a web shell on it.

Will Dormann a Vulnerability Analyst at the CERT/CC tested the vulnerability on a Microsoft exchange server and told BleepingComputer that it worked with very little modification.

""It's within the reach of ""script kiddie"" now"" warned Dormann in our discussion about the PoC.

As you can see from the image below Dormann used the exploit against a Microsoft Exchange server and remotely installed a web shell and executed the 'whoami' command.

Exploiting a Microsoft Exchange server

Another image shared by Dormann shows that the exploit dropped the test11.aspx web shell in the specified location on the server.

Web shell dropped on exploited Microsoft Exchange server

Didier Stevens a senior analyst at NVISO and SANS ISC senior handler also tested the exploit against a Microsoft Exchange virtual machine but did not have as much luck with the PoC.

In a conversation with BleepingComputer Stevens said that he tested the new PoC against an unpatched Exchange 2016 with no cumulative updates. Still the PoC would not work without tweaking some Active Directory settings.

However Stevens said that new information in the PoC released this weekend enabled him to get Jang's PoC working to achieve successful remote code execution against his Microsoft Exchange server.

Stevens also agreed with Dormann's assessment that the information disclosed in the new PoC would make it easier for less-skilled threat actors known as 'Script Kiddies' to create a working ProxyLogon exploit.

Due to the large number of vulnerable servers still exposed on the Internet BleepingComputer will not be sharing links to the PoC released this weekend.

80000 Exchange servers still vulnerable

With exploits for the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities becoming publicly available it is more important than ever that administrators patch their servers.

According to Palo Alto Networks' research there are approximately 80000 vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers exposed on the Internet.

""The number of vulnerable servers running old versions of Exchange that cannot directly apply the recently released security patches dropped over 30% from an estimated 125000 to 80000 according to Expanse internet scans conducted March 8 and 11"" Palo Alto Networks told BleepingComputer.

Microsoft also warned that even though there has been a significant drop of vulnerable servers there are still many that need to be patched.

""Based on telemetry from RiskIQ we saw a total universe of nearly 400000 Exchange servers on March 1. By March 9 there were a bit more than 100000 servers still vulnerable. That number has been dropping steadily with only about 82000 left to be updated"" Microsoft stated in a blog post.

Many of these servers are for older versions that did not have available security updates.

On Thursday Microsoft released additional security updates for older versions of Microsoft Exchange which now cover 95% of the servers exposed on the Internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1pbnRydXNpb24tZGV0ZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLXN5c3RlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 9 Best Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems to Boost Your Cyber Security,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1pbnRydXNpb24tZGV0ZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLXN5c3RlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90aGUtZ29vZC1iYWQtYW5kLXRoZS11Z2x5LW9mLW91ci1oeXBlcmNvbm5lY3RlZC13b3JsZC0yMDIxMDMxMS1wNTc5djIuaHRtbNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90aGUtZ29vZC1iYWQtYW5kLXRoZS11Z2x5LW9mLW91ci1oeXBlcmNvbm5lY3RlZC13b3JsZC0yMDIxMDMxMS1wNTc5djIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The good bad and the ugly of our hyperconnected world,"While Read was already relatively confident using online tools to work and communicate his wife Sarah Eckstein a speech pathologist says she had to learn on the go.

But the main issue was again social rather than technological. “I have some neurotypical and high-functioning kids [as clients] but then quite a lot of lower-functioning kids who really need hands-on guidance as well” Eckstein says. “Obviously they’ve already got communication disabilities so when you remove the person-to- person contact it makes it a whole lot more wooden and some of them had to drop off entirely for that time.”

While 15 years ago there simply would not have been a safe way to gather for school or work or therapy during a pandemic having to do it via the internet shone a light on some vital elements of the physical workplace we may have overlooked. Simple extemporaneous conversation fell by the wayside as talking was routed through themed chat channels or focused conference calls and technology designed to supplement in-person work was exposed as not being particularly healthy for people to use all day every day. If Eckstein noticed her clients trying to meet an extra “metalinguistic challenge” in addition to the tasks they were already working to accomplish it was similarly true that a lot of us felt beaten down and exhausted by screen-based communication. And so-called Zoom fatigue didn’t just affect our work. Virtual social gatherings - miraculous though it was to see and speak to our loved ones from respective homes - were marked by the lack of tactile and interpersonal interactions we may have previously taken for granted. Information overload The free flow of information over the internet was not only important for work and socialising but also instrumental in keeping us informed of the state of the crisis and the latest restrictions in real time via news outlets and social media. But the combination of physical isolation and exposure to the incessant barrage of information from sources credible and otherwise has also accelerated and amplified fear panic and misinformation. Facebook and Twitter primary sources of information for many have become engines of radicalisation amplifying conspiracy theories on a massive scale. Ideas that would ordinarily be tagged implausible have now been afforded legitimacy and a gravity that health experts and policy makers are finding difficult to contend with.

“With a lot of the other sorts of events that we’ve had where social media played a role they’re often quite localised and quite limited in their time frame” says Professor Axel Bruns of the Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre. “But this has been the biggest and most sustained ongoing [health] crisis since the Spanish flu. And it’s unique because it’s a genuinely global crisis.” Professor Axel Bruns of QUT said the length of the crisis made for a unique social media and news environment with some ugly consequences. Credit: Attlia Csaszar Bruns said that when a crisis like the 2011 tsunami in Japan occurs social media is excellent at getting the word out immediately even to people who don’t follow the news. But there’s also a phase of rumours and misinformation that can easily mislead people. With the pandemic being the most widely discussed topic on the planet for a whole year and also changing to introduce new aspects and sub-stories daily we never really left that rumour phase. “There has always been something new some new theory or idea that people weren’t sure if there was any kind of fully verified information about. And that’s left the door open for poor information for rumours gossip and then misinformation and disinformation as well” he says.

“It’s a generational challenge where we need to train people better in media literacy. It probably starts in schools and moves all the way up.” Even some of the processes of traditional media which is often viewed in opposition to social media “fake news” were exposed as antithetical to a healthy pandemic response over the past year. Whereas many authorities were urging the issue to be viewed as a health crisis 24/7 online coverage increasingly tended to frame it as a business or political crisis and even to indulge in conspiracies. “Often when you have a major crisis event political battles tend to be paused for a bit. The problem here is that really only lasts so long. Eventually there is that almost natural tendency to politicise and read things through party lines again and that goes for political journalism as much as for the politicians themselves” Bruns says. Loading “And in our research when we looked at conspiracy theories around COVID and 5G we found that entertainment news celebrity news tabloid news had a really important role to play. It massively amplified the circulation of that kind of conspiracy content without any real attempts journalistically to check it or balance it.”

A magnet for malcontents And while our efforts to keep a viral threat at bay fostered many lesser viral threats of a techno-social nature it also attracted parasites that were harder to see. In every area where a technological solution was applied or pushed beyond its limits cracks appeared at the systems’ weak points ready to be exploited by opportunistic criminals. As soon as the pandemic hit millions of new COVID-related web domains were created and filled with malicious traps to ensnare those on the hunt for new information. Scam links have been made to look like everything from video conference invites and government benefit notices to ads for cheap puppies to gladden the lonely. And as contact-tracing efforts were extended to embrace technological means they were immediately scuttled by disagreements between governments of all levels - who all built solutions that best suited their own purposes - and also with tech giants who have incredible access to everyone’s personal data via smartphones but were unwilling to hand it over categorically. Perhaps most of all the pandemic highlighted the need for holistic cybersecurity solutions in areas we hadn’t thought of. Hospitals riddled with legacy IT systems and a hodge-podge of connected devices have been hit persistently by attackers threatening to delete or expose vital data if monetary ransoms are not met.

Sean Duca of Palo Alto said cybercriminals will always find a way to turn a vulnerability into value. Sean Duca vice-president of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks said that as soon as QR codes began to be used by businesses for contact-tracing purposes criminals were detected exchanging methods to hijack them for nefarious purposes. “We’ve found everything from open-source tools to video tutorials that pretty much offer training on how to conduct attacks by using QR codes” he says. As with misinformation and fake Zoom invites the main danger here is that many people found themselves relying on technology overnight that was quite new to them without a decent degree of literacy. Similar attacks are beginning to roll out in the US as various vaccine programs expose people to online forms and booking systems for the first time. Duca says the best way to deal with the QR code issue is the same as the ideal situation for something like vaccine rollouts.",,,,,,

The gig was a new series titled ""The Real World"" which first premiered in 1992. The groundbreaking show which told ""the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a loft and have their lives taped"" helped pave the way for a new genre known as reality TV.

Blasband told Fox News she first learned about the casting from an acquaintance - and it would forever change her life.

""She was working as a casting director on the show and she thought I would be perfect for it"" the 53-year-old explained. ""I think I must have gone in maybe seven times. I just kept saying to myself ‘What is this thing? I’m not even going to get it.’ I just thought this was a little documentary on MTV that’s going to run in the summer. And I really needed it.""

'BACHELORETTE' RACHEL LINDSAY ACCEPTS CHRIS HARRISON'S APOLOGY: 'WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD'

""I was a struggling singer/songwriter and I could have used the publicity"" Blasband continued. ""So when I got it I was both excited and frightened. Because they kept saying ‘Are you sure you don’t mind that we’re really going to focus on you and it’s going to be very intimate? Everything is going to be exposed - all of it.’ I thought ‘Yeah yeah yeah.’ You’ll say anything for a gig. And then it happened.""

Blasband said she had no idea how revolutionary the show would be until a few days before it aired.

""When the show wrapped we were told ‘Could you guys come in for a couple of days and talk to the press?’'"" she recalled. ""I just thought it would be some downtown magazines in New York. Maybe a local channel. But everybody showed up. It was nuts. It was NBC Nightly News Wall Street Journal The New York Times - everyone kept showing up for two days. I started thinking ‘What did I do? Is this actually going to be seen?’ It was completely mind-blowing. I kept thinking back on the days we filmed and wondering ‘Was I a complete moron?’""

""The Real World"" went on to launch many elements still used in reality TV shows today such as ""confessional"" interviews. It also highlighted a diverse cast which would eventually launch conservations about race still explored today. It also detailed how the loft mates in their 20s were attempting to pursue their dreams in New York City.

And Blasband insisted it was all ""real.""

""There were as [late creator] Mary-Ellis Bunim called ‘pebbles in the pond’ meaning they would drop little things to create reactions"" Blasband explained. ""But it was as real as you can get. I think it was the only truly authentic reality show because everything else kind of became formulaic. People started coming in with agendas. Certain people would say ‘I’m going to be this character.’ But our show was just loose and wild. We were all trying to figure out what it was as cameras captured everything.""

""There were some conversations and some arguments and debates that were much longer and more involved and had different points"" she shared. ""But there was some creative editing involve to keep it short and concise for TV. But you were still able to see the depths of everyone involved. These were seven pretty deep interesting people. I wish they would have spent more time with that in keeping those conversations longer but that would have been a documentary and that wasn’t the point.""

Nearly 30 years later Blasband is going back to where it all began. The original seven ""strangers"" are reuniting for ""The Real World Homecoming: New York"" a limited series on the new streaming platform Paramount+. The roommates got together again in the same New York City loft where they lived in 1992.

""I showed up with a ton of love in my heart"" said Blasband. ""I was very excited actually. I had that feeling of nostalgia. And I was so surprised when I saw the loft because I had no idea it would be the same loft. But it felt just like the old days. It was emotional and wonderful. And then when I saw everyone it was just super exciting.""

According to Blasband the cast had a text thread leading up to the reunion.

""We had been talking about it and decided to be a united front work together have conversations and take things to a more elevated level than a lot of the reality television shows out there today"" she explained. ""We just wanted to be ourselves. And we were ourselves. And it was just as intense as it was the first time around. I thought it was going to be this warm cozy - everybody hanging out drinking tea and telling stories. But wait until you see.""

But Blasband is grateful for the chance to revisit her whirlwind past. And she hopes the reunion will influence the future of reality TV just as ""The Real World"" did so many years ago.

""We all decided to do this very quickly and all of a sudden it was 1992 again"" she said. ""It influences your life. The show has been life-changing in so many ways. But we were all up for it.""

Without the fanfare that we normally expect from a Honeywell refrigerant introduction the announcement of the addition of R454B to the Honeywell portfolio was included as a secondary item in a newsletter sent to customers this week. It will market the refrigerant as Solstice 454B.

Meanwhile the industry still awaits Honeywell’s much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

Wide acceptability

An A2L refrigerant R454B has previously always been associated with Chemours from its time as DR-5 a DuPont development refrigerant and its subsequent passage through the ASHRAE classification process in 2015.

Despite this Honeywell lays claim to a patent on this refrigerant. When asked Honeywell told the Cooling Post: “Honeywell identified the usefulness of R-454B as a R-410A replacement for air conditioning in 2009 and has patented this discovery.”

What is clear is that R454B has been accepted by an increasing number of chiller heat pump and rooftop equipment manufacturers. These include Carrier Trane York Mitsubishi Electric Rhoss MTA Swegon Flakt Engie and GI.

A blend of R32 and R1234yf with a GWP of 466 R454B appears to be the best current option for new equipment in applications where a lower-flammability refrigerant is an option.

Honeywell notes that the discharge temperature of R454B is much lower than R32 and thanks to its higher critical temperature (77°C) and broader operating envelope in low evaporating temperatures it outperforms other alternatives such as R32 in heating applications.

Where’s R466A?

The news of Honeywell’s new addition comes while the market still awaits news of its much-lauded non-flammable R410A alternative R466A.

First announced by Honeywell in 2018 as Solstice N41 R466A was described as “a breakthrough” with its A1 non-flammable classification addressing “one of the most vexing regulatory and safety challenges facing the HVAC industry”.

An eagerly-awaited potential option for use in VRF systems it was originally going to be available in commercial quantities in the fall of 2019 then early 2020. Since then there has been little news of this refrigerant although it is accepted that OEM testing can be a protracted process a process which may have been further delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.

A number of OEMs were initially reported to be working with R466A including Chinese manufacturer Midea and Toshiba Carrier – a company which described the new refrigerant as “promising” after initial performance testing in a VRF air conditioning system. Component manufacturers Sanhua and Parker Hannifin were also known to be carrying out compatibility testing.

There have however been rumours of stability and compatibility concerns related to the refrigerants blend’s key CF3I (R13I1) component. Honeywell has previously denied any problems telling the Cooling Post last year that R466A was stable: “As seen with past introduction of new refrigerants the stability and shelf life can be addressed with standard measures practiced in the industry” it said.

As we approach the third anniversary of the initial announcement of the refrigerant Honeywell maintains that R466A is now in the “advanced stages” of commercialisation with samples having been provided to OEMs for evaluation to ensure compatibility with their equipment.

“To date Solstice N41 has undergone extensive testing by over 15 OEMs and leading compressor manufacturers and accumulated more than 100000+ hours in different applications like commercial AC (VRF rooftops) and residential AC (unitary)” the company said but would not be drawn on a new release timetable.

You also need to know how to sell it. Unless you’re a true evangelist waiting for it to displace fiat currencies then knowing when to take your profits is important and being able to do so even more so.

Digital Trends isn’t about giving out investment advice — that’s not our forte — but we can break down the technical fundamentals for you like how to sell Bitcoin.

There are different ways to go about it depending on whether you want to sell on an exchange or directly but here are some steps to take to sell your Bitcoin fast and easily.

Step 1: Set up an exchange account

The simplest and most “automated” way to turn your Bitcoin into hard cash is through an exchange platform. They act as a middleman for the famously decentralized cryptocurrency by selling your Bitcoin for you. Since it’s one of the most popular and well-established exchanges we recommend Coinbase. If you would rather choose your own there are many others to pick from including popular international options like Bitstamp and Bitfinex.

Signing up for an account at Coinbase is easy but there are some hoops you’ll have to jump through. Depending on which country you’re in you will have to comply with different forms of “know your customer” rules meaning sending the site certain ID forms. That can take a few days to process. Signing up for Coinbase Pro is also recommended though not strictly necessary to give you greater control over your sale.

Once your account is created link your bank account so that when you have made your trade you can get cash out with as little hassle as possible.

Step 2: Transfer your Bitcoin to your exchange wallet

If you followed our guide on buying Bitcoin you’d have stored your Bitcoin in a secure — maybe even cold — wallet. To trade on Coinbase you’ll want to send your Bitcoin to an exchange wallet and keep it there ready for sale.

Beginners can always use the Coinbase Wallet app which connects the wallet in a super simple way as it automatically works with Coinbase trades. Just open the app and wait for the notification to “Connect Now” then enter your Coinbase login information. If you don’t see the notification you can always go to Settings and choose Connect To Coinbase to get started. The Coinbase Wallet also has a few other handy features including paying merchants directly from the wallet if they are part of the Coinbase Commerce program.

Coinbase’s security is excellent providing support for biometrics and advanced authentication technology. However if you prefer to use another digital wallet head to its settings and look for ways to connect to a currency exchange. You should be able to input your Coinbase login on the most popular digital wallets and start an authentication process to connect it. However this may take several days to complete so it’s definitely not a last-minute step.

Step 3: Place a sell order

With your exchange account set up your bank account linked and your Bitcoin deposited on the exchange it’s time actually to make a sale. The latest version of Coinbase makes this very easy. Select Buy/Sell from the top menu and move to the Sell section. Choose Bitcoin as your currency of choice and make sure the right destination is selected for your funds in the Deposit To section. If you have a bank account connected to your account you will be able to select it here for a direct transfer.

Check your connected wallet to see how much Bitcoin you have and choose the amount you want to sell. In 2018 Coinbase raised its default limits for trading and started allowing people to trade their cryptocurrency immediately after buying it which is one reason we are fans of the service. You can see your weekly bank limit in the same section. Finally choose if you want to repeat this sale and if so at what frequency. Then select Sell Bitcoin. That’s it!

There will be a short holding period before the sale is complete. You can make as many sales during this time as you want but the transfers won’t finish until their holding period is over.

As for deciding when to sell well that’s getting into the genre of investment advice and there are many strategies based on your long-term plans and how much Bitcoin you want to move. Bitcoin has been going through a long period of devaluation and corrections lately intermixed with slight recoveries though the current boom has further shaken things up. Some serious research may be required to decide when the best time to sell is for you.

Alternative methods

If you’d rather have more of a hand in the actual sale process direct trades (or peer-to-peer trades) are possible alternatives. You will need to register which in some cases will mean confirming your identity so as with all selling methods we’d recommend getting your account set up well in advance of when you actually want to sell. Once you’re set-up however you can sell your Bitcoins in a much more direct manner.

When it comes to exchanges Bitcoin automates trades between two parties. However the selling process is a little different. The transaction occurs directly between seller and buyer when you sell. You set up a sell order for a specific value and the site alerts you when someone shows interest in buying at the agreed-upon price. Then you can proceed with the transaction – both parties agree on the terms the seller receives payment from the buyer then the seller releases the cryptocurrency to the buyer.

Each platform you trade through will let you handle the payment a little differently. Sites like BitQuick use bank account transfers to keep things exclusively online. But other sites like LocalBitcoin and Paxful offer all sorts of options like Moneygram gift cards cash in the mail and even cash in person.

Some methods can be tediously complex but they allow anonymous transactions that ensure privacy and safety so they’re worth the extra effort. If you decide to make trades in person make sure to do so in a public setting.

REUTERS-Yonhap



Bitcoin passed the $60000 mark for the first time on Saturday with analysts saying the giant US stimulus package helped boost the world's most popular virtual currency on its record-breaking run.



The cryptocurrency hit $60197 at 1234 GMT and continued to hover around $60000 according to the website CoinMarketCap.



Bitcoin has tripled in value over the last three months ― it was worth $20000 in December ― bolstered by increasing backing from corporate heavyweights.



Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said that in recent days ""Bitcoin went up as investors looked to the imminent arrival of stimulus cheques"".



Individuals in the US earning up to $75000 will receive a cheque for $1400 from this weekend after President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan into law this week.



Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise since March last year when it stood at $5000 spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would allow account holders to use cryptocurrency.



Last month Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the virtual unit while Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and rap mogul Jay-Z said they are creating a fund aimed at making Bitcoin ""the internet's currency"".



Others jumping on the bandwagon include Wall Street player BNY Mellon investment fund giant BlackRock and credit card titan Mastercard.



Bitcoin which was launched back in 2009 hit the headlines in 2017 after soaring from less than $1000 in January to almost $20000 in December of the same year.



The virtual bubble then burst in subsequent days with bitcoin's value fluctuating wildly before sinking below $5000 by October 2018.



However the last year's rise has been more steady with investors and Wall Street finance giants wooed by dizzying growth the opportunity for profit and asset diversification and a safe store of value to guard against inflation.



Bitcoins are traded via a decentralised registry system known as a blockchain.

Now Rajkot-based Balaji Wafers wants to grab a slice of the instant noodles and peanut bars market.

Riding on an impressive growth rate of over 20 per cent in the last few years Balaji which clocked a turnover of almost ₹2400 crore in fiscal 2020 is now loading its plate with diverse new offerings.

The company set up by the Virani brothers who literally started off by frying chips in their backyard and say they think with their gut and heart is betting that the new segments will unlock future growth.

Instant noodles brand Gippi has already been launched. The R&D for wafer biscuit and rolls is underway while jaggery-mixed peanut bars will be launched within two months.

“The Covid-19 period gave impressive growth for packaged food players like us as people were stocking up packaged snacks and namkeen . But this surge is now tapering off as consumption is returning to normal. So for us the next growth drivers will be new categories in noodles peanut bars and wafer biscuits” says Keyur Virani Director Balaji Wafers. the next gen member of the family.

Munching more

Is Balaji biting more than it can chew? After all instant noodles is a very crowded place. But Virani says they have a strategy in place. “We plan to differentiate ourselves by offering local tastes to the consumers. It is still a learning curve for us and will take some time for us to expand our reach” Virani says.

Currently Balaji sells about 500 tonnes of instant noodles (wheat flour) per month against the installed capacity of over 1000 tonnes. “We are planning to expand our SKUs (stock-keeping unit) with wider product range. But in the next 1-1.5 years we are planning to reach our full capacity” he adds.

For the chips major India’s nearly ₹9500-crore instant noodles segment could be a decisive strategic move by taking it head-on with established multinationals including Nestle India (Maggi) Indo Nissin (Top Ramen) CG Foods India (Wai Wai) ITC (Yippee) HUL (Knorr) and Patanjali among others.

Similarly foraying into the wafer biscuit space where Dukes and Pickwick dominate would mean a taste of new things for the company. Protein bars are another new turf for it.

On Balaji’s ambitions to bat on the big boys’ pitch Anuj Kapoor Assistant Professor — Marketing at Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM-A) comments that being regional is actually a strength for the company.

“They are selling globally known food items with Indian tastes. They know the local taste and that’s how they have an advantage of staying a local player. Externally they are local but internally their plants are run like an MNC” says Kapoor.

He feels that though noodles wafer biscuits and rolls may not be local items they have become part of the Indian palate.

From farm to factory

Started in 1974 by Chandubhai Virani who became the Chairman and his two brothers Bhikhubhai and Kanubhai Balaji Wafers has become a storied legend in India’s entrepreneurial landscape given the chutzpah displayed by the homegrown enterprise against the MNCs.

The Viranis sons of a farmer actually first forayed into the farm equipment business. When that failed they began working in a cinema hall canteen in Rajkot. But their ambition could not be held back. From frying chips manually and selling it fresh to foraying into packaged snacks was a natural next step. The label ‘Balaji’ Wafers soon became ubiquitous on the shelves of highway food joints and snacks parlours across Saurashtra.

The first automated chips manufacturing facility — all of 1000 sq m — was set up in the Aji-GIDC industrial estate in 1990. Today Balaji Wafers has over 51 varieties of chips and namkeen products. It is present across Gujarat Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Goa parts of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.

Balaji is eyeing 22 per cent growth this year to touch ₹3000 crore by March 2021. “We are growing at a faster pace than the industry average. We had expected 25 per cent growth over last year but supply disruptions during Covid-19 lockdown somewhat hampered the growth” says Keyur Virani.

Margins have also taken a hit due to escalating raw material prices and logistics cost including freight. “We have been a highly profitable company with EBITDA margins of 12-13 per cent. But due to cost escalations margins may be hit by 7-8 per cent this year” he says.

However Virani says that while in some categories they might see no-profit-no-loss the overall margins for this fiscal will still be 5-6 per cent. “This isn’t bad either as we don’t have any financial stress” he adds.

The company has no long-term debt on its books. It plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh to expand in North India for which it is seeking investments of ₹300-400 crore in a mix of internal accruals and external debt.

“Our UP plant is expected to be ready within 3-4 years and once it starts generating revenues we may think of setting up a plant in Karnataka. Till then we are catering to all markets through our existing plants in Rajkot Valsad and Indore” he says.

But isn’t the national foray a bit late?

IIM-A’s Kapoor begs to differ. “It doesn’t matter. They have a good regional equity and figuring out the core of a market is not a big barrier for them.”

Kapoor however cautions that Balaji may need to segregate its product offerings based on the age group it is targeting. “In order to chart a new growth path with new product offerings and segments Balaji will have to be patient. They have exhibited patience during their early years. Now it will help them again to make inroads into the MNC-dominated space” Kapoor says.",,,,,,

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla canceled a scheduled trip to Israel following accusations by a watchdog group and the country's top lawyer that his visit could illegally sway the upcoming election to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Bourla was expected to arrive in Tel Aviv on March 8 less than three weeks away from the March 23 election.

Parliamentary watchdog group Achrayut Leumit wrote to Bourla Netanyahu and the state comptroller arguing that a visit would violate election propaganda laws The Jerusalem Post said.

""Mr. Bourla's participation in photo-op events with the prime minister may constitute aiding and abetting a prohibited election campaign and is a criminal offense"" the group said in a letter seen by the newspaper.

Achrayut Leumit's CEO Oshi Elmaliach threatened to open a case with the Central Elections Committee and the Israeli police if the trip were to go ahead The Jerusalem Post reported.

Elmaliach also wrote to Israel's attorney general citing concerns that a visit could benefit Netanyahu The Times of Israel reported.

It was initially reported that the trip was delayed because Bourla and his delegation members weren't fully vaccinated.

However in an interview with Channel 12 news Bourla confirmed that he had received letters telling him to cancel the trip. ""My job is not to do politics"" he told the broadcaster.

The trip has now been rearranged for late spring Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported.

Pfizer did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

The trip's timing struck some Israelis as a clear sign that Netanyahu is willing to do anything to win the election.

""I've been told that Bourla's cancelation was directly because of the letters he received"" Amos Harel a political analyst at Israeli newspaper Haaretz told Insider. ""Netanyahu was quite cynically putting Bourla in the Israeli political campaign to celebrate the success of his vaccination campaign.""

""There was a red line that shouldn't be crossed in the midst of a political campaign"" Harel added. ""It's very clear to everyone that the Pfizer visit was about the election.""

Ronny Linder a health correspondent at Haaretz said: ""Netanyahu treating the vaccine like his own personal achievement isn't right"" she said.

""If Bourla had come here"" she added ""I suspect that many people would have seen this as a political circus a one-man show an act of election propaganda that Bourla would have unwittingly participated in.""

Israel's COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been world-leading.

The success can in part be attributed to Netanyahu's efforts to procure vaccines so early on. Bourla said that Netanyahu was ""obsessive"" and called him ""30 times"" to secure a deal The Times of Israel reported.

Experts however primarily attribute the success of the rollout to big data Israel's centralized and socialized healthcare system and impactful public information campaigns touting the vaccine's safety.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2VyaWUuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9lcmllLXJlZ2lvbi10ZWFjaGVycy1yZWNlaXZlLWpvaG5zb24tam9obnNvbi1wZml6ZXItY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS80NjU1NDQwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erie-region teachers receive Johnson & Johnson Pfizer COVID vaccine at multiple county clinics,"EDINBORO — Teachers and school support staff from Erie Crawford and Warren counties rolled up their sleeves Saturday and became Northwestern Pennsylvania's first recipients of Johnson & Johnson's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine.

Approximately 500 vaccine doses were administered to pre-K-12 teachers administrators and school support staff during a daylong clinic at the Northwest Tri-County Intermediate Unit 5 in Edinboro.

Richelle Ransom 46 a Summit Township resident who teaches science at Fort LeBoeuf High School didn't want to miss out on an opportunity to receive her dose.

""I had the opportunity and I know it's been difficult for some people to get vaccinations so if you don't take the chance when you have it who knows when the next chance will come around"" Ransom said.

Teachers and staff registered for the clinic through their school districts and intermediate units.

""Other than a couple of remote weeks we've been pretty much in session the entire year"" Ransom said. ""I think the kids have been good about wearing their masks and we've been following all the protocols at the school.""

Ransom teaches science to students in ninth and 10th grades.

""I think for the most part I've felt pretty safe even without the vaccination"" she said. ""All the safety precautions have been taken so this is just one more layer of defense.""

The J&J vaccine clinic continues daily through Thursday at IU5 offices 252 Waterford St. in Edinboro. Organizers have been allotted about 3000 doses for the six-day clinic which is not open to the public.

The clinic is scheduled from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday and continues Monday through Thursday from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. each day.

This is the first round of the vaccination program for teachers and school staff.

Shots are being administered by AMI Expeditionary Healthcare and the Pennsylvania National Guard. They are receiving assistance from the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and the state departments of health and education.

""The staff we have working with us have been phenomenal and obviously have done this before"" IU5 Executive Director Brad Whitman said Saturday morning a few hours after the clinic opened. ""A lot of them are traveling nurses so they know how to run an efficient ship. We have been rolling a little bit ahead of schedule so they're very happy where we are and where we're headed.""

Gov. Tom Wolf and his COVID-19 vaccine task force are prioritizing the J&J single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for teachers and school staff.

Whitman said his staff worked with Erie Crawford and Warren County's 17 school districts five charter schools five career and technology centers and 39 nonpublic schools to coordinate and schedule the vaccinations.

""We are very excited to be able to offer this opportunity to educators in our region"" Whitman said. ""This effort will help to get students back in classrooms parents back to work and to help protect our community. We are confident this effort will bring us closer to a return to normal.""

Cherie Kopac 39 a fifth-grade math teacher at Northwestern Elementary School received her vaccination Saturday morning.

""We've been teaching on a hybrid model with all of our students for half a day so an a.m. session and a p.m. session each day in-person"" Kopac said. ""Now I think this vaccination will provide an extra layer of safety. We're always wearing our masks and washing our hands and hand sanitizing and doing all the social distancing. We were waiting anxiously for our emails to sign up for this clinic.""

Kopac said she is not concerned about the vaccine's potential side effects.

""I think the reward outweighs the risks"" Kopac said. ""We're just willing to give it a shot and do what we feel is going to be in the long run best for everybody.""

The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and the departments of education and health are partnering with the state's 28 intermediate units to establish vaccine sites across the state. Their goal is to get the vaccine distributed quickly and efficiently.

When more vaccine supply becomes available additional opportunities for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine program will be offered to school employees and contractors who are still interested in receiving the vaccination Whitman said.

""I was quick to jump on this to get that level of protection"" said Brad Beiter 27 an English language arts teacher at East Middle School in Erie. ""A single dose is a lot more convenient.""

Beiter said he has done all remote teaching but believes the vaccination will provide extra protection for when he returns to in-person instruction.

Other vaccination clinics

The Edinboro clinic was one of at least three large-scale vaccination clinics in the Erie region Saturday.

Another vaccination clinic for teachers and school staff was held at the Bayfront Convention Center in Erie where about 750 qualifying teachers who are in Phase 1A of the state's vaccination plan received the Pfizer vaccine. Second doses will be scheduled for 21 days later.

IU5 LECOM Health and the Erie County Department of Health organized the Bayfront Convention Center clinic.

""We have enough doses between the 1A initiative and the J&J vaccinations to vaccinate all of our staff that would like to be vaccinated"" Erie School District Superintendent Brian Polito told the Erie School Board Wednesday during a meeting.

Erie School District staff members eligible for 1A were scheduled to receive their first shots at the Bayfront Convention Center event Saturday Polito said. He said all other staff members will be scheduled to get shots on Monday and Thursday at the IU5 clinic in Edinboro.

The company was moving forward with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine. Calitri a chemical engineer by training was in charge of Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Kalamazoo Michigan where the constituent parts of the vaccine would eventually be assembled before being shipped across the country. “At first I was really excited” he told me. “And then after I sat down on the couch and started thinking about it I was horrified because I knew that it was going to take the full force of everything we could throw at it.”

Typically vaccine manufacturing doesn’t begin until a candidate has proved to be both safe and effective in animal and human testing. In the past that process could take ten years; Pfizer’s vaccine which was developed in collaboration with BioNTech a German biotechnology company took a record ten months. The vaccine received emergency-use authorization from the F.D.A. on December 11th; two days later the company began shipping tens of thousands of doses all of which had been made while clinical trials were still under way.

In Kalamazoo on a campus larger than Central Park Calitri’s team worked around the clock. Pfizer hired roughly seven hundred workers reassigned experienced engineers to the vaccine effort and increased the number of vials that it could produce by installing additional “fill and finish” machines. Even so by the end of 2020 the company had delivered only half of its initial production goal of a hundred million doses. A Pfizer spokesperson told me that among other things “securing enough raw materials took longer than we expected.”

Five days after his Inauguration Joe Biden set a goal that a hundred and fifty million vaccinations would be administered in the first hundred days of his Presidency. At the time about eight hundred thousand Americans were receiving a vaccine each day most of them health-care and other front-line workers. The Trump Administration had left distribution planning up to the states; as vaccine appointments were made available to older Americans in many states in mid-January some vaccination sites were flooded with requests but others sat relatively empty. “It was like running out on the field during the Super Bowl and telling the players to just do whatever they want” Bruce Y. Lee a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy told me. “So it’s actually not a big surprise given the apparent lack of planning that we’ve run into a lot of problems with the vaccine distribution.”

Even as more vaccines became available—by early February roughly a million and a half shots were being administered a day—the quest for a vaccination appointment was being compared to winning the “Hunger Games” or beating the house at a Las Vegas casino. So far just over ten per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated. The reason for the slow pace as Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado said at a recent congressional hearing is that “we still face a lack of vaccine supply to meet current demand.”

On February 11th Biden announced that the government had signed a deal with Pfizer and Moderna—the latter’s vaccine had been authorized for emergency use by the F.D.A. on December 18th—for an additional hundred million doses each. Both vaccines are based on a messenger-RNA platform or mRNA for short that has previously never been produced commercially. At the end of February Johnson & Johnson received an emergency-use authorization for its one-shot vaccine which is based on a DNA platform similar to the company’s Ebola vaccine. A few days later Biden announced that Merck whose own COVID-vaccine efforts had failed was going to help Johnson & Johnson to boost production.

The White House has sounded particularly optimistic this week. On Wednesday the President announced a plan to secure an additional hundred million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. On Thursday during his first prime-time Presidential address he directed states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by the beginning of May. The catch: none of the increased supply that has been established since Biden’s Inauguration will be available until late spring at the earliest and most of it will not arrive until the end of the year. All adults may be eligible to receive a vaccine in a couple of months. But whether doses actually will be available will depend on a lot of things going right.

When the President of the United States places an order for millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine they do not simply appear like Amazon packages two days later. For much of the past year it has taken Pfizer a hundred and ten days to produce each vial of vaccine. The time line starts at the company’s plant in Chesterfield Missouri outside St. Louis which houses a cell bank of frozen E. coli bacteria. Scientists extract DNA from the E. coli cells to grow the template called a plasmid on which the vaccine’s mRNA will be built. Once the plasmid is made purified and tested the double-helix structure of the DNA has to be linearized—literally made linear. The process takes about ten days after which it goes through additional testing. “We’re going twenty-four hours a day with three manufacturing shifts” Christine Smith the Chesterfield-site leader told me. “And then there’s another shift making all the buffers and media to grow the cells in and getting ready for the next day. It’s a very regimented process. It’s not like we can just open up a door to the room next door and start making it.”

From Missouri the plasmid is flown to Pfizer’s campus in Andover Massachusetts where it is incubated in a bath of enzymes and nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA—for several hours. The process called in-vitro transcription synthesizes the genetic material the RNA which carries the instructions to make a modified form of the spike protein that causes COVID-19. (These reëngineered spikes are what trick the immune system into creating antibodies to defend against the coronavirus.) A few days later the RNA is placed in specially designed bags frozen and flown overnight to Kalamazoo where Calitri’s team puts the final drug product into vials and inspects and labels them before freezing them at ultra-low temperatures. When it’s time to ship them out the vials are packed with dry ice—Pfizer has its own dry-ice-manufacturing facility on site—in thermal containers created specifically for this vaccine each with its own G.P.S. unit and temperature alarm. (When the initial vaccine drive is over one of Pfizer’s shipping containers will be sent to the Smithsonian Tanya Alcorn the company’s head of biopharma supply chain told me.)

Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine candidates require rare ingredients that are in short supply such as the lipids used to encase the mRNA and the enzymes used to transcribe it. Calitri meanwhile had been grappling with a series of engineering puzzles. “There’s a step in which the mRNA is coated with these lipids and it’s done in a specialized mixer” he told me. “The mixers we were using to develop the process are very small”—about the size of a silver dollar. His team didn’t have time to design a larger mixer so they tied together a hundred of the silver dollars. When the filters on some of the filling equipment needed to be replaced switching to a different filter was not an option because any adjustment to the process would have to be approved by the F.D.A. Instead the team had to learn how to “regenerate” the ones they had. It took six months and numerous prototypes to figure out how to store and ship a frozen product that needed to be kept at subzero temperatures. There were some misses too. They thought the vaccine would need to be frozen as soon as it came off the filling line so they installed blast freezers; the data have since shown such precautions to be unnecessary. “We needed to have options” Calitri explained.

Even before the clinical trials were completed it was obvious that Pfizer’s domestic operation would not have enough capacity to meet the U.S. demand. In July Pfizer ordered two prefabricated modular manufacturing suites but they took eight months to build and finally arrived in Kalamazoo in mid-February. “This is not like a production line for making cars or trucks” Tim Manning the supply coördinator for the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 response team told me. “This is extraordinarily complex biochemistry. And it happens at the molecular level. . . . It’s really complicated and made on extremely rare and difficult-to-make machinery.”

Most years the health-care supply chain is fairly stable. Hospitals anticipate how many N95 masks nitrile gloves and various medications and vaccines they will need based on what they’ve needed in the past. The pandemic year exposed the fragility of that system. In early 2020 with a COVID-19 vaccine still on the distant horizon Rick Bright the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority warned the Trump Administration that once there was a vaccine there would likely be a shortage of syringes needles and glass vials. At the time manufacturers were producing around fifteen to twenty billion glass vials for all of the world’s medications in a typical year. Bright was fired in April; in a searing whistle-blower complaint filed in May he predicted that it could take up to two years to produce enough vials just for the U.S. vaccination effort. “They can’t just crank out more vials” Kelvin Lee the director of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) told me. “That glass gets manufactured through very specialized processes. And ultimately glass comes from sand. Their raw-material suppliers have to think about where they are going to get the right kind of sand to make sure the vial is of appropriate quality.”

The government has been able to use the Defense Protection Act to secure a sufficient number of vials so far. Some recent advancements in glass technology will likely help too. The same month as Bright’s whistle-blower complaint was filed Pfizer signed a multiyear contract with Corning which is based in New York and manufactures a super-strong pharmaceutical-grade glass called Valor. In June of last year the Trump Administration awarded Corning more than two hundred million dollars to scale up production. But that deal will address only a fraction of the need. Chandra Brown who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing in the Obama Administration recently wrote in an online editorial “By this time next year I predict Americans will covet borosilicate glass”—the material used in traditional vials—“the same way they do N95 masks.”

The vials also need rubber stoppers. Last fall tropical storms in rubber-producing regions of Thailand Vietnam and India led to shortages that could have jeopardized the vaccination effort. The government used the Defense Protection Act to round up sufficient supplies but it was clear that a tremendous strain had been placed on the world’s rubber supply. “The D.P.A. is allowing the U.S. to hoard some of these materials for production of U.S. vaccines but is causing other shortages globally” Robert Handfield the executive director of the Supply Chain Resource Cooperative and a professor of supply-chain management at North Carolina State University told me. He also said that there is “very little visibility into the manufacturing bottlenecks that are occurring.” On March 5th the Times reported that officials in the United States and Europe say that they may not have enough syringes to administer the vaccine.

The supply of lipids used in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines continues to be precarious too. Vox recently reported that even among the few companies whose facilities can be repurposed to make lipids “not nearly enough of them are ready to make the kind of lipid nanoparticles we’d need to distribute billions of mRNA vaccine doses quickly.” As Stéphane Bancel Moderna’s C.E.O. told investors in January if “there’s one raw material missing we cannot start making products and that capacity will be lost forever because we cannot make it up.”

Recently the Biden Administration has used the Defense Protection Act to acquire enough low-dead-space syringes to be sent out with every Pfizer-vaccine shipment. (Such syringes enable a sixth dose to be extracted from Pfizer’s vials automatically increasing the company’s vaccine doses by twenty per cent.) With government support a company called ApiJect is building a “Gigafactory” in North Carolina to manufacture single-dose injectables to reduce waste and simplify the distribution of vaccines. (It is expected to come online in 2022.) The White House is also investing in the construction of factories that would be able to make more than a billion surgical gloves a month. The goal is to move enough production Stateside so that the domestic health-care supply chain is not dependent on other countries which in a crisis will likely choose to prioritize their own citizens.

Perhaps most crucially the government brokered a deal between Johnson & Johnson and Merck paying Merck up to $268.8 million to upgrade two of its manufacturing facilities. But it will take months for Merck to retrofit its facilities; the vaccines it will be making for Johnson & Johnson are not expected to be ready until the second half of the year. Meanwhile the company that Johnson & Johnson currently contracts with to produce its vaccines domestically has yet to receive F.D.A. approval. (The four million or so Johnson & Johnson vaccines that are now being distributed were made abroad.)

The most hopeful news is that Pfizer has cut the time it takes to make a batch of its vaccine to sixty days. As of mid-March the company expects to deliver more than thirteen million doses a week up from around five million last month. At a congressional hearing in February John Young Pfizer’s chief business officer explained that the company has begun making its own lipids and has increased capacity at its facilities in Kansas and Wisconsin (in addition to the new production suites in Michigan). It has also doubled batch sizes increased yields per batch and developed faster laboratory tests.

“We’re getting better at it” Calitri said of the manufacturing process. “I think people don’t know how challenging it is to make billions of doses of a product that you did not have a process for nine months ago. And then to scale that up even further. There’s so much involved from an engineering perspective from a quality perspective from a compliance perspective and from a safety perspective. We’re not making widgets. We’re making a product that people inject into their bodies—into healthy humans—and it has to be perfect. We need to make sure of that for every single dose. That takes engineering it takes science it takes time.”

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGYxLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlcnJhcmktc3BvbnNvci1leHBsYWlucy1ncmVlbi1sb2dv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ferrari sponsor explains reason for green logo,"There was plenty of talk about the new Mission Winnow green logo on the Ferrari SF21 – and according to the sponsor that was the point.

The Scuderia’s title sponsor which has featured on the livery since 2018 is an initiative driven by cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris International.

Ever since their arrival on the Ferrari car their logo has always previously been black and white on the engine cover – so when they unveiled their 2021 challenger which sports a green logo fans were taken aback.

Plenty of opinions were shared with many feeling there is no place for the colour on a typically red Ferrari car. But the reaction it has stimulated was partly why the change was made.

As quoted by RaceFans Philip Morris International spokesperson Tommaso Di Giovanni said: “From the start Mission Winnow has always experimented with its visual identity.

“Much like a green screen does for film the green arrow represents possibility and opens the opportunity to imagine new horizons.

“Regardless of opinions about the colour sparking debate and creating dialogue is exactly what Mission Winnow is meant to do. We have consistently encouraged people to place their preconceptions about our company aside and to open their mind to the transformation we are going through.

“More broadly Mission Winnow focus on promoting [and] driving positive change fostering engagement and opening conversations around the role that science technology and innovation can play in helping to address a range of societal challenges – now and into the future.”

Due to their links with tobacco the inclusion of the sponsorship has been a controversial one but the company have reiterated the initiative “is not meant to ‘promote’ any product or brand” but is more about promoting positive change.

Nevertheless criticisms of Ferrari have continued with Codacons who last year threatened Ferrari with legal action again showing they are against the sponsorship involvement of Mission Winnow.

A statement from them read: “We strongly contest Ferrari’s choice to resort once again to a sponsor directly linked to tobacco despite the legal prohibitions and the serious health effects of smoking on human health.”

Mission Winnow did not actually feature on a Ferrari car last season during a grand prix – only in testing – and it is yet unclear whether that will be the same in 2021.

Ferrari’s livery this season looks good but over-critical fans couldn’t help but notice the green Mission Winnow logo on it. Previously the logo was seen in black-and-white so it came as quite a shocker for the tifosi. Now Philip Morris International has spoken out on the choice of the colour via spokesperson Tommaso Di Giovanni.

“From the start Mission Winnow has always experimented with its visual identity. Much like a green screen does for film the green arrow represents possibility and opens the opportunity to imagine new horizons.

Mission Winnow smokescreen for surrogate tobacco advertising?

Formula 1 is a global brand and naturally tobacco companies are attracted to it as well. Apart from Philip Morris McLaren has British American Tobacco as one of their key sponsors since 2019. Ferrari’s choice hasn’t gone well with Italian consumer rights group Codacons though. They have threatened them with legal action in the past and have now come up with a fresh statement.

“We strongly contest Ferrari’s choice to resort once again to a sponsor directly linked to tobacco despite the legal prohibitions and the serious health effects of smoking on human health.”

KANSAS CITY Mo. — Senior guard Matt Coleman III registered a career-high 30 points and senior forward Jericho Sims added a career-best 21 points and 14 rebounds to pace No. 13/16 Texas (19-7) to an exciting 91-86 victory against No. 12/14 Oklahoma State (20-8) on Saturday night at the T-Mobile Center in the title game of the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship. With the victory UT captured the Big 12 postseason tournament crown for the first time in school history and secured the league's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.

Coleman converted 10-of-14 field goals including 4-of-5 from three-point range and 6-of-6 free throws in 37 minutes while becoming the first Longhorn to reach the 30-point mark in a Big 12 tourney contest since Kevin Durant in 2007. Sims dominated in the paint hitting 8-of-11 field goals and grabbing six of his 14 boards on the offensive glass while adding three steals and two blocks in a season-high 35 minutes.

Junior guard Andrew Jones posted 13 points while converting a perfect 10-of-10 from the free throw line tying a school Big 12 tourney single-game mark for most free throws made without a miss. Sophomore forward Kai Jones added 13 points and five rebounds in 18 minutes and sophomore forward Brock Cunningham provided a spark with seven points eight rebounds three steals and two blocks in 26 minutes off the bench.

The Cowboys took an early 8-4 lead after a Bryce Williams transition layup at the 16:32 mark. Oklahoma State went ahead 13-11 following an Isaac Likekele layup with 14:22 left but that would mark the final lead of the night for the Cowboys. The Longhorns responded with a 7-0 spurt over the next two minutes to grab an 18-13 advantage after a Coleman layup at the 12:34 mark.

Leading 29-25 with 5:44 remaining Texas used a 14-4 run over a four-minute span to build a 43-29 cushion following a Cunningham three-pointer at the 1:28 mark. The Longhorns converted 55.2-percent (16-29) from the floor including a 4-of-8 mark from three-point range en route to a 43-33 halftime lead. UT held the Cowboys to an 0-of-9 mark from beyond the arc in the opening 20 minutes.

Trailing 52-43 after a Sims free throw at the 15:24 mark Oklahoma State scored seven straight points to pull within 52-50 following a Rondel Walker layup with 13:30 left. Texas again answered with a 14-5 run to increase its margin to 66-55 after a Coleman three at the 9:06 mark.

The Longhorns did not allow the margin to dip below six points until the final minute of the game. Cade Cunningham knocked down a pair of deep three-pointers to trim the deficit to 89-86 with six seconds remaining but Andrew Jones calmly sank a pair of free throws to seal the win.

Texas will learn its NCAA Tournament placement during the NCAA Selection Show set for Sunday March 14 at 5 p.m. CT.

Last weekend several the club's standouts traveled to Myrtle Beach S.C. to participate in the 2021 Coastal Classic sponsored by Oceana Resorts.

The competition lasted four days.

As expected Bartlesville had a smashing good performance.

The BGC seized the team championship for Level 9 and finished fourth in both Level 7 and Level 8.

""This was an amazing competition and an amazing opportunity for our athletes to compete against gymnasts from states that are outside our Region"" said BGC Head Coach/Director Lorrie Bertolet. ""I am so proud of how our athletes competed and presented themselves so far from home. It is important that our athletes learn to compete under any circumstances. We want them to be ready for Regional and National competitions.""

Meanwhile AAU Level 3 BGC warriors participated in McAlester at the 2021 MEGA Gymnastics Spring Training Invitational.

Following are summaries of BGC accomplishments from both events:

Bellevue West outlasts Creighton Prep in Class A semifinal classic,"Creighton Prep’s AJ Rollins gasped for breath as sweat dripped from his face and Bellevue West’s Josiah Dotzler put his hands on his knees and did the same.

Each Junior Jay and Thunderbird alike gave everything they had during an up-and-down high-scoring Class A semifinal that left them straining for air. And they hadn’t even gotten into overtime yet.

No. 1 Bellevue West and No. 2 Creighton Prep shared two epic battles this season and the third round didn’t disappoint in an all-time classic state tournament battle. Despite trailing by eight points in the fourth quarter Bellevue West leaned on its stars to complete a 95-94 victory over Creighton Prep in triple overtime during the Class A semifinals in front of 6000 spectators Friday at Pinnacle Bank Arena.

""The fourth quarter seems like a day ago. It was unbelievable"" Bellevue West coach Doug Woodard said.

The scoring came quick and it came often in a game in which Bellevue West (24-2) and Creighton Prep (23-3) combined to score a state-tournament record 189 points. Bellevue West senior Frankie Fidler scored a game-high 32 points and did over half his damage in the first half. Fidler’s contributions were even more important considering Super-State guard Chucky Hepburn scored zero first-half points.

Hepburn finally got on the board with a lone three-pointer in the third quarter but the Wisconsin commit got stronger as the game went on. Two Thunderbird turnovers to open the fourth quarter gave Creighton Prep a 51-43 lead that Hepburn had to work hard to overturn.

He made four three-pointers in the fourth quarter alone but his biggest play came with 20 seconds left when Hepburn grabbed a steal and flipped the ball to Greg Brown for a game-tying layup.

“I didn’t even pay attention to the score I just knew we were down and we had to make some plays” Hepburn said.

The first four quarters were intense but as Prep and Bellevue West headed into overtime tied 68-68 the level of play only increased. The Junior Jays were not only playing for a trip into the Class A title game but they were also playing for their head coach and his family.

On Thursday night Creighton Prep head coach Josh Luedtke’s father passed away from complications from surgery. Jerry Luedtke was a longtime Prep supporter and youth football coach in north Omaha and the Junior Jays played with him in mind.

“I feel bad for my kids because they were under tremendous pressure today just knowing what has happened in my family in the last 24 hours” Luedtke said. ""… I think they’re disappointed because they really wanted to win today for me but I told them it wasn’t about me it was about them.""

Multiple Creighton Prep starters turned in stellar performances. Brendan Buckley paced the Junior Jays with 26 points Rollins added a 22-point 12-rebound double-double and Sitti finished with 19 points. Despite a 36-for-58 (62%) shooting night Prep fell just short at the final hurdle.

The pivotal shot in the third overtime was Fidler’s NBA-range three-pointer while Hepburn tacked on a pair of late free throws to finish with 23 points.

""I’m so proud of these guys they’re champions"" Luedtke said. ""They’ve given me everything for 26 games and they’re a championship team.""

After their exhausting late-night win Bellevue West will return home to try to get some sleep before returning to Lincoln on Saturday. Just like last year Millard North awaits in the Class A final.

If the Thunderbirds are running on fumes Saturday it’ll be because of all the effort they spent to get past Prep. Undoubtedly it was worth it.

""We’re going to try and get them iced and get them to bed and try to get them to sleep but how are you going to sleep after that? It’s a state championship so we have to figure out a way to get ready for it"" Woodard said.

Local high school basketball fans have wondered for awhile if the Class A finals would feature Millard North and Bellevue West two schools who squared off last March in one of the last sporting events played as COVID-19 wreaked worldwide havoc.

Now on Saturday night at 7 PM at Pinnacle Bank Arena Bellevue West looks to defend last year’s title against Millard North in the third meeting between these very evenly matched teams that feature a superb collection of top flight talent.

The teams split matchups earlier this year with Millard North taking the first in the Metro Holiday Tournament Finals winning 94-91 in overtime. Later in the year Bellevue West traveled to Millard North and avenged the loss in an 81-69 win.

Since those two games and coming off the thrilling Thunderbirds win last year fans have been holding out hope these two would meet again with the title on the line.

It almost didn’t happen.

Bellevue West pulled through on Tuesday despite an ugly game in a win over Lincoln East but then the No. 2 seed fought back and stunned Creighton Prep with a triple overtime win that featured a furious rally late in regulation to even tie the game.

Millard North took on a pair of familiar foes as it vanquished Millard South fairly easily on Tuesday but Millard West hung around and made the Mustangs work on Friday for its spot in the finals.

Here’s a few notables playing in Saturday’s Class A finals:

Bellevue West

Chucky Hepburn — This senior point guard has Nebraska fans sad everywhere as they realize he’s going to be a major thorn in their future by playing for Greg Gard and Wisconsin. While Hepburn isn’t a pure scorer he can absolutely fill it up when it calls for it and with the game on the line Friday night he made some of the biggest shots and biggest plays to pull his team through. Throw in his passing ability — top assist man in the state — and he’s a dangerous opponent for anyone.

Frankie Fidler — Hepburn draws a lot of attention and rightly so but Bellevue West isn’t in this position without Fidler. The senior forward is crafty at times slashing through lanes finishing at the rim but he’s also got range and can knock down big 3-point baskets too. He’s signed with Nebraska-Omaha and might be the guy to watch tomorrow with so much focus on Hepburn and Millard North’s Hunter Sallis.

Josiah Dotzler — The freshman hero from last year is now a sophomore. The brother of Josh Dotzler is no stranger to big shots and big moments. He’s another future college prospect and he’s been a weapon for Bellevue West at times this season.

Millard North

Hunter Sallis — The biggest basketball prospect in the Internet age Sallis’ career lacks only one thing and that’s a state title. The combo guard is looking to finish off his career with a win and avenge last year’s collapse down the stretch. Regardless of result Sallis’ next move will have no less intrigue as he looks to make a decision about his future. The five-star is choosing between a number of heralded teams with Gonzaga looking like the favorite per the 247Sports Crystal Ball.

Saint Thomas — If Sallis is what people know about Millard North basketball Thomas is usually the one making casual onlookers ask “who’s that?” as the guard has grown in his game considerably. Thomas unfortunately knows the pain of last year all to well as he and his team didn’t finish off the game at the free throw line and it caught him. Like Sallis Thomas has a decision to make after the Class A final but it’s not yet clear who he’s really considering.

Jasen Green — There’s not a lot of room for others to make a run with how much space stars like Sallis and Thomas make up but this 2022 forward is a good player for the Mustangs in the low post and certainly someone Nebraska fans should know.

“This is my last report as Principal and I am truly humbled to have had the opportunity to serve the Cave Hill Campus the country Barbados and the Caribbean Community as an officer of the University of the West Indies” said Grenada-born Professor Barriteau as she presented her report to review some of the achievements and experiences of the Cave Hill Campus over the past year highlight some ongoing initiatives and outline future plans.

She declared: “First and foremost I am a very proud UWI woman a scholar academic and administrator and I make no apologies. I am very proud of what the UWI has contributed to Caribbean development in its 73-year history and all that it will accomplish in the next 73 years. I am extremely proud that within our university indigenous sons and daughters from across the Caribbean can attain the pinnacle of leadership – A little country girl from a fishing village in Sauteurs Grenada.”

An authority on gender and public policy Professor Barriteau took over as Principal and Pro Vice-Chancellor from the Barbadian Professor Sir Hilary Beckles in 2015 after serving in several roles at the university over the years.

In addition to being Campus Coordinator at the School of Graduate Studies and Research for about four years Professor Barriteau also served as Deputy Principal at the Cave Hill Campus for some six years and then as Principal of The UWI Open Campus for about nine months.

It was last year at its annual business meeting in May that the university council had approved a recommendation to extend Professor Barriteau’s appointment as Campus principal to the end of the 2020/2021 academic year. This was widely supported.

Chairman of the Cave Hill Campus Council Sir Paul Altman said Barriteau’s retirement was to be discussed during the closed-door segment of the Council Meeting on Friday.

The university is hoping to have an official celebration and toast of her service later this year.

It is not yet clear who will be replacing Barriteau as Principal and Pro Vice-chancellor of the UWI Cave Hill Campus or if she will continue to serve the institution in a different capacity.

Barbados TODAY understands that Professor Justin Robinson is one of the leading candidates for the position.

After joining the university in 1997 as a lecturer in the Department of Management Studies Professor Robinson was later promoted to Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences in 2003 where he served until 2007.

He returned to teaching in Management as a Senior Lecturer and then as Head of the Department of Management until he was elevated to Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences in 2012 while still lecturing.

Commenting on Barriteau’s pending retirement her predecessor Professor Sir Hilary Beckles who is currently the Vice-Chancellor of the UWI said the university celebrates her contribution to its development over the years.

“I can speak to this with absolute conviction because I was there at the beginning of her role as a senior administrator deputy principal and principal and I am here at the helm. So I know a great deal of her leadership and contribution” said Sir Hilary who is now based in Jamaica.

“Indeed she was recommended for the principalship and celebrated precisely because of a record of distinguished leadership and she has done an excellent job. I wish to thank Professor Barriteau for her role and contribution within the university as a scholar as a thought leader as a public advocate and as the principal of this very loved and distinguished campus the Cave Hill Campus of the University of the West Indies” he said.

Thanking her for her years of service Sir Hilary added “we do not take any of your skills for granted. We have never taken the skills and the contributions and commitment of our leaders for granted. So thank you”. (MM)",,,

Disturbed's ""The Sickness 20th Anniversary Tour"" with Staind and Bad Wolves is back on and set for summer of 2021.

The run which aims to celebrate the two-decade milestone of the band's debut album was postponed this year due to the coronavirus pandemic which put the touring industry in an ongoing standstill.

The Sickness was released on March 7 2000 and launched Disturbed's career on the back of the mega hits ""Down With the Sickness"" and ""Stupify."" Both tracks have been set list staples over the last 20 years and on the tour the group intend to dust off some rarities from that landmark release.

The initiative will create additional manufacturing capacities in India the world’s largest producer of vaccines to make doses developed in the US including the Johnson & Johnson candidate. This will be done with financing from the US and Japan.

Australia will help overcome last mile and logistical delivery issues and assist in delivering the vaccines to countries in Southeast Asia the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Islands.

The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has announced it will “finance increased capacity to support Biological E’s effort to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022”.

This will be done with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Emergency Use Listing. The move is part of DFC’s Global Health and Prosperity Initiative under which it is increasing manufacturing production and distribution capacity for vaccines.

The Quad Vaccine Partnership was seen as the most significant deliverable of the first summit of the leaders of India Australia Japan and the US. Observers believe the move will help counter China’s influence across the Indo-Pacific while at the same time signalling that the Quad is evolving from a group that only discusses strategic approaches to cooperating in definite areas.

DFC chief operating officer David Marchick said: “It is hard to conceive of an investment with a greater developmental impact than using our financial tools to increase the capacity of vaccine manufacturing to help developing countries in Asia and around the world respond to Covid-19 and other diseases.”

He added “Expanding vaccine manufacturing especially the Covid-19 vaccine and boosters will help increase vaccination rates and protect communities around the world.”

“The vaccines Biological E plans to produce with the assistance of DFC’s financing complement existing efforts to vaccinate as many people in the world as possible in the shortest amount of time” DFC’s released said.

Partnering with Biological E which is a woman-run business will also advance DFC’s “2X Women’s Initiative” to promote global gender equity.

Mahima Datla is currently the managing director of Biological E which was founded in 1953 and became the first Indian private sector company to enter the vaccines business in 1962. The firm launched commercial operations in the US in 2019.

DFC is also working to strengthen the vaccine supply chain and last mile logistics for distribution. Under its Global Health and Prosperity Initiative DFC will invest between $5 million and $500 million on eligible projects including equity and debt financing political risk insurance and technical development.

The announcement came on a day Union health minister Harsh Vardhan announced that more than six coronavirus vaccines will come up in India.

“India has developed two vaccines which have been given to 71 countries. Many more nations are seeking the vaccines and these are not little-known nations...Canada Brazil and other developed countries are using Indian vaccines with a great zeal” he said. “More than half a dozen vaccines are going to come up” he said.

“Till Saturday morning 1.84 crore vaccine shots have been given in the country and 20 lakh people were inoculated yesterday (Friday)” the minister added.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

The answer might surprise you - San José Spotlight,"Among the seemingly solid-blue picture of the Bay Area pockets of a more conservative population are growing.

When former President Donald Trump first ran for office in 2016 roughly 20% of Santa Clara County residents or 144514 people voted for him. As hundreds of thousands turned out to vote again last year amidst the rampant COVID-19 pandemic and a crippling economy support for Trump only grew — to 214612 voters.

This streak of conservatism seems to run through San Jose the Bay Area’s largest city and the heart of Silicon Valley. The city of more than a million people was once praised as a leader on many left-leaning issues including raising the minimum wage and legalizing cannabis. But longtime political observers say the city now drags behind others.

San Jose might not be as progressive as people think.

In responding to COVID-19 and the challenges it poses the City Council last month fumbled on adopting a higher hazard pay for grocery workers — opting to give them $3 extra per hour instead of $5. City leaders failed to ban police tactics that injured peaceful protestors and still shuns the cannabis industry despite voters legalizing weed five years ago. Now City Hall is facing a bitter fight over allowing density in single-family neighborhoods to help alleviate the housing crisis.

“If you look at the voting numbers they are generally more progressive” said Sean Kali-rai a longtime political analyst and a cannabis lobbyist. “But NIMBY (not in my backyard) is stronger. NIMBY trumps progressives every day of the week.”

Santa Clara County Democratic Party Chair Bill James said San Jose’s quest to be a liberal city is dwarfed by its tug of war between business and labor interests.

“San Jose has tried to be more democratic…over time” James told San José Spotlight. “But sometimes things end up being viewed in a very binary way.”

So how progressive is San Jose exactly? Political observers say the truth lies in the details.

Housing policy

Among a number of urgent issues in San Jose housing — or the lack thereof — has been at the top of residents’ minds. Opportunity Housing which would allow up to four homes on a piece of land zoned for a single home is one solution being considered by city officials.

But the progressive housing policy is facing a robust opposition campaign. A former San Jose councilmember and now planning commissioner is penning op-eds and warning residents that it would “eliminate single-family zoning” — which is not true.

A poll sponsored by a neighborhood group found nearly half the residents surveyed opposed the measure but backers say the survey was flawed and critics lobbied respondents to voice opposition. Then the county’s Republican Party said the measure would “nuke” single-family neighborhoods.

Last year real estate and business groups — often a powerful lobby in San Jose — released mailers attacking a San Jose City Council candidate for supporting Opportunity Housing. The mailer which showed tall dark grey high-rise towers next to cheeky colorful single-family homes was largely viewed as a dog whistle against poor people.

The debate over the policy — which has not even been crafted yet — puts San Jose the heart of Silicon Valley behind other cities such as Sacramento which approved it in January.

“You have companies like Apple that are now valued at $2 trillion after breaking the $1 trillion barrier just in 2018” said San Jose State sociology professor William Armaline. “And in the shadow of that you have one of the largest homeless encampments in the country. You have the most inaccessible unaffordable housing market in the country.

“So I don’t think you can claim that we are progressive” he added. “I think what you can claim is that we reflect some of the most horrific aspects of our political-economic system and implications.”

In 2020 76% of participating San Jose residents rated the city’s availability of affordable housing as “poor” in an annual survey. The cost of living in San Jose among the highest in the nation was rated “poor” by roughly 70% percent of residents

San Jose also waffled on other liberal housing policies including expanding rent control to 11000 duplexes and tying rent increases in those units to inflation in 2017.

Protesters clashed with San Jose police during the third day of protests Sunday over the death of George Floyd. File photo.

Police reform

Amid a national reckoning following the murder of George Floyd police across the country fired tear gas and rubber bullets at Black Lives Matter protesters.

San Jose was no exception.

The city’s police officers used such tactics against nonviolent protesters in downtown San Jose injuring many including a local musician who was shot in the eye while strumming his guitar.

Mayor Sam Liccardo pushed to permanently ban the use of rubber bullets for crowd control but the City Council did not agree. Local lawmakers ultimately voted to allow their usage if an individual posed a threat to officers.

Liccardo rejected calls from the left to defund the police saying San Jose’s thinly-staffed department needs more resources. Other cities such as Minnesota and Portland have voted to cut funding from their police departments and redirect it to other services like mental health teams and violence prevention programs.

James said San Jose is not doing enough on police accountability which is a token issue for progressive Democrats. He wants to see officers make an attempt to deescalate conflicts rather than using weapons or force.

Rev. Jeff Moore who leads the local NAACP agreed.

“Our police department just got a new BOLA gun instead of going in and defunding the police to get another type of response unit” he said. “We didn’t go there.”

But Shane Patrick Connolly chair of the local Republican Party said San Jose has taken a sensible “centrist” approach to police reform.

“Rightfully we’re looking at ways to improve public safety when it comes to unruly crowd control” he said. “(The council) very sensitively limited (rubber bullets) without banning them because they also need to consider alternatives.”

Some school districts in San Jose still have not cut ties with police officers on campus Moore added while schools across the country have banned officers in schools.

“San Jose Unified refuses to do it. Why?” Moore said.

Higher wages

In 2012 San Jose voters approved raising the city’s minimum wage to $10 per hour with annual increases.

But San Jose once a leader in raising wages has now fallen behind its neighboring cities. The minimum wage here in January went up to $15.45 an hour putting the city behind Sunnyvale and Mountain View where the rate is $16.30. It’s $15.65 an hour in Santa Clara Cupertino Palo Alto and Los Altos.

The fight for higher wages in Silicon Valley is not new — especially for the city’s most vulnerable.

In 2017 Liccardo suggested studying exempting certain “hard-to-employ” people from a higher minimum wage such as parolees homeless and foster youth — but those carve-outs weren’t ultimately approved.

“Given the reality of the cost of living in the San Jose area the minimum wage should be more here” James said. “I’ve heard people advocating for $17 or $18.”

More recently San Jose failed to give essential workers such as grocery store clerks a full $5 pay bump for working during the COVID-19 pandemic and risking their lives. Instead local lawmakers narrowly approved a more modest $3 pay bump for 120 days after opposition from the grocery industry. Other cities such as San Leandro Oakland and San Francisco opted for a $5 boost.

Santa Clara County approved a $5 pay bump for 180 days but scaled back the plan to exclude restaurant workers.

“We had to struggle to get hazard pay for our people” Moore said. “That should not have been a struggle.”

San Jose Councilmember Sergio Jimenez fought for a $5 per hour pay boost for grocery store workers for risking their health.

“I felt we lost traction in helping our local workers but realized (lowering the dollar amount) was necessary to get something over the finish line” Jimenez said.

Cannabis

Five years after voters in Santa Clara County overwhelmingly approved legalizing marijuana the Bay Area’s largest city still shuns cannabis.

City Hall allowed only 16 dispensaries to open — for a city of more than a million residents — and they’re restricted to industrial sites about 1% of the city. Most of those sites are hidden from view or in areas with limited parking.

San Jose administrators were expected to discuss expanding cannabis to retail storefronts — a plan in the works since 2019 — but leaders recently said COVID-19 recovery must come first. The plan would also allow existing dispensary owners open more than one location.

Other Bay Area cities including Union City Redwood City and Oakland have allowed dispensaries in more accessible retail areas.

In comparison to San Jose’s 16 dispensaries Sacramento has 29 dispensaries citywide while San Francisco has more than 200 cannabis businesses.

“This was the number one council priority in 2019 and we got more votes than anything else on the council priority list that year” Kali-rai said. “And we still haven’t gotten it done.”

The city’s leaders also struggled to approve cannabis delivery services in 2016 while innovative delivery apps such as Eaze were being invented in neighboring cities such as San Francisco.

Over the last five years the cannabis market has at least doubled. The marijuana businesses brought in more than $13 million in tax revenue to the city in 2018 a city report says.

“And the dispensaries have not increased in size and there are no new dispensaries” Kali-rai said. “They have not moved to retail locations.”

Texter-Bauman goes back-to-back; Cory Texter brings Yamaha back to the front.

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. – After something of a quiet opener by their standards Progressive American Flat Track’s Grand National Champion favorites got their revenge in Saturday night’s Volusia Half-Mile II presented by Daytona Dodge in Barberville Florida.

While defending Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle champ Briar Bauman (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) upped his speed at Volusia Speedway Park significantly overnight even he had nothing for a confident and on-form Jared Mees (No. 9 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) on this evening.

Bauman took the holeshot and immediately transformed the premier class Main Event into a two-man affair with archrival Mees just as they’ve done so many times in the past. But almost as soon as Mees worked his way into the lead with more than seven minutes remaining on the clock it was readily apparent that he was in a class of his own; Mees quickly shook free and piled up a substantial advantage on runner-up Bauman cruising to the checkered flag with more than two seconds in hand.

Mees who also won the Mission #2Fast2Tasty Challenge earlier in the program said “I grew up racing here on 60s and 80s with my dad coming here for the Southeastern Nationals back in the day. I’ve always come here as a pro and raced the Steve Nace All-Star warm-up race as well. Never would I have thought last year this place would be a National and man I think it was a really big hit. It was awesome to see fans in the stands again.”

Third-place finisher Sammy Halbert (No. 69 Coolbeth-Nila Racing Indian FTR750) was the only other rider in the field who managed to stay within ten seconds of the victory.

Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) seemed to have fourth-place all but sewn up. However intermittent mechanical issues dropped him several positions down the order elevating what had been a three-way dogfight for fifth featuring Brandon Price (No. 92 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Indian Motorcycle of Oklahoma City FTR750) and Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750).

Vanderkooi was able to return to full song and subsequently tracked that crew back down as all four were in with a shot at fourth over the race’s final two laps. Price ultimately held on for the position while Friday winner Robinson dropped the younger Bauman to sixth who in turn finished fractionally ahead of an unlucky Vanderkooi.

Davis Fisher (No. 67 BMC Racing/Dick Wall 60 Indian FTR750) ended up eighth while Friday heroes JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) and Kolby Carlile (No. 36 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) completed the top ten.

AFT Singles

Shayna Texter-Bauman (No. 52 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) remains undefeated since adding the hyphen to her name following Saturday’s jaw-dropping AFT Singles Main Event.

Texter-Bauman kept a close pack of six and seven riders corralled behind her for the bulk of the race. But that neat and tidy order was thrown out the window when all of her contenders seemingly went for broke at once with three minutes remaining on the clock.

Trent Lowe (No. 48 WBR/Suzuki Motor of America RM-Z450) ran second early but was shuffled back once the pressure intensified. Mikey Rush (No. 15 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) and Morgen Mischler (No. 13 Mission Roof Systems KTM 450 SX-F) then threw several haymakers from second and third with Rush eventually taking over the lead.

Defending class champ Dallas Daniels (No. 1 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) made his presence felt as well executing moves on both Mischler and Texter-Bauman before getting passed back to fourth.

After Texter-Bauman appeared vulnerable to outside passes she turned the tables by alternating a more defensive higher line with an ultra-low line that allowed her to reclaim those lost positions. Once back in front she held Rush at bay over the race’s final two laps to secure her second checkered flag in as many nights.

“It’s just unreal” Texter-Bauman said. “What a race that was with Mikey Morgen and Dallas… When those guys started passing me on the outside I kind of moved my line up a little bit and went back to work. It’s so nice racing with these guys — we can race clean and hard. What a weekend this was! It’s insane.”

Mischler rounded out the podium followed by AFT Singles title fighters Daniels Henry Wiles (No. 17 American Honda/United Rentals CRF450R) and Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE).

AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

2019 AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines champion Cory Texter (No. 65 G&G Racing/Roof Systems Yamaha MT-07) managed to repeat his feat of a year ago once again upgrading an opening-night third into a victory the following evening at Volusia Speedway Park.

The opening lap teased a rematch of Friday’s last-lap epic featuring Texter Chad Cose (No. 49 Voodoo Ranger/Roof Systems Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Dan Bromley (No. 62 Memphis Shades/Vinson Construction Yamaha MT-07).

However Texter was in no mood to leave the result to the chance of a final strike this time around immediately gapping his rivals and never looking back. That relentless pace was no doubt aided by the fact that he wasn’t forced to fight his way from behind this time around which allowed him to stamp his authority from the start rather than slash up through the field from Row 3.

“That was awesome” Texter said. “I was so determined after kinda giving it away yesterday. I got to the track two hours earlier today I was so fired up. I felt great all day… I had so many texts and calls yesterday for getting third. Everyone loved the race so I’m glad we could put on a show today.”

The AFT Production Twins Main Event was relatively processional behind Texter as well; Friday winner Cose ended the race clear in second followed by an equally lonely Bromley.

Title hopefuls Ryan Varnes (No. 68 RVR/RoyBuilt Don’s Kawasaki Ninja 650) and Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 D&D Cycles/Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) rounded out the top five.

The Volusia Half-Mile presented by Daytona Dodge Doubleheader will air back-to-back on NBCSN on Saturday March 20 starting at 12:00 p.m. ET/9:00 a.m. PT. The broadcasts will include exclusive features cutting-edge aerial drone and onboard footage and expert commentary.

Mikey Rush returned to the AFT Singles podium with a second-place finish while his teammate Dallas Daniels ended the night fourth. The squad’s Mission SuperTwins riders JD Beach and Kolby Carlile finished ninth and tenth respectively.

AFT Singles championship contenders Rush and Daniels once again factored heavily in the battle for the win aboard their Yamaha YZ450Fs. The two pulled off a number of daring and skillful maneuvers at the front as a six-rider pack waged an intense fight for victory.

Rush who started from the front row after winning his Semi earlier diced his way forward from fifth to ultimately take over the lead with just over three minutes remaining on the clock. He was momentarily dropped back to second two laps later but immediately launched a counter-attack to reclaim the position. The heated contest saw Rush finally relinquish control of the lead with just over a minute to go ultimately accepting the checkered flag as the runner-up just 0.078 seconds off the win. Daniels claimed a hard-earned fourth a few bike lengths back coming up just 0.277 seconds short of the podium himself.

Saturday’s slick track conditions presented challenges for the Mission SuperTwins duo and the team continued to work on making improvements. In the Main Event Beach managed to get one of his trademark blistering starts slashing several positions up the order in the race’s opening stages. A minor incident saw him give back a couple of those places and he ultimately finished a close ninth. Carlile was another spot back as he rounded out the premier class top 10.

Estenson Racing will now have several weeks to take what they learned this weekend and prepare for Yamaha’s home race the Atlanta Super TT on May 1 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

Tommy Hayden – Estenson Racing Team Manager

“We did not make the gains today that we thought we could make in either class. In the Singles race both riders were right there fighting for the win but were not able to make it happen. Mikey and Dallas both rode well and left the weekend in a good position in the championship.

“On the SuperTwins side we really thought we could make some small improvements today and be as competitive as we were last night but the track seemed to change a little all day and we did not adapt as well as we needed to. Overall it was not a bad start to the season and we are looking forward to the next one.”

Mikey Rush – Estenson Racing AFT Singles

“I’m happy to be on the podium two nights in a row at Volusia. The team worked excellent all day and really all weekend. My bike was awesome. The track was pretty challenging. The groove was glazed over and really slippery compared to last night. I’m really happy with how we started the season. I’m looking forward to having a good year and having a lot of fun with the team.”

Dallas Daniels – Estenson Racing AFT Singles

“It was a little bit of a rough night. The day started better than yesterday qualifying fifth and I was able to start the Semi from the front row. I worked my way up to second and tried to pass for the lead and ran wide and finished third. So I had the first pick on the second row for the Main. I didn’t get off the line very well and I was struggling to make some passes. I finally worked my way up to fourth and made the pass for third. I got passed back and was in a real heated battle with Morgen Mischler Mikey and Shayna (Texter-Bauman). About six laps to go I tried to make a pass on Mischler but it didn’t stick and I lost a bit of ground. I started overriding it and ended up P4. I’m a little upset with myself but we’re coming out of here with more points than we did last year. So we’re sitting pretty good in the championship and it was encouraging to be up front all weekend long. I’m really looking forward to the Atlanta Super TT to show these guys what we’ve got.”

JD Beach – Estenson Racing Mission SuperTwins

“Today’s race was tough. We really chased the track and the bike setup all day long. We just seemed to be on our back foot all day. Going into the main we put the setup back to what we knew worked last night. When I had a clear track we could click off some good lap times but for some reason the setup we had made it hard to make passes. We learned a lot tonight and still have positives to take away from it so we’ll move forward.”

Kolby Carlile – Estenson Racing Mission SuperTwins

“Tonight definitely wasn’t all smiles like last night. The track was very different for us from round one to round two. We got a good setup for me to come into the corners and steer the bike off but I didn’t have any of the rear grip I had on night one. We learned some stuff this weekend and showed that we are on the right path to success.”

RED BULL KTM’S SHAYNA TEXTER-BAUMAN SWEEPS VOLUSIA HALF-MILE DOUBLE HEADER

TEAMMATE MAX WHALE HAS A SUCCESSFUL DEBUT WITH THE TEAM

Rounds 1 & 2 – American Flat Track Championship – March 14 2021

BARBERVILLE Fla. – Red Bull KTM Factory Racing’s Shayna Texter-Bauman had an incredible start to the 2021 American Flat Track Championship sweeping both rounds of the Volusia Half-Mile double header to put herself at the top of the AFT Singles class heading into a new season of racing. Her teammate Max Whale debuted his new ride with the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing Team where he finished 4-6 at the opening rounds with a positive performance throughout the weekend.

Texter-Bauman was strong from the start earning a third-place qualifying position on Friday to kick off the winning weekend. She lined up in AFT Singles Semi 1 where she got off to a top-five start aboard her KTM 450 SX-F FACTORY EDITION. She steadily worked her way through the pack and with two laps to go she moved into second finishing just behind her teammate Whale. In the Main Event Texter-Bauman managed to ace two consecutive holeshots with a red-flag restart and she assumed control of the race right away on the opening lap. Leading all 27 laps from start to finish the Pennsylvania native rolled her way to a season-opening victory in Florida.

On day two Texter-Bauman picked up right where she left off on Friday as she qualified third overall to enjoy a front row start in AFT Singles Semi 1. With a fourth-place start she charged her way into the lead halfway through the race and held strong to secure her first semi win of the season. In the Main Event Texter-Bauman shot off the line to capture the holeshot and once again established herself out front on the opening lap. She maintained control for the first 12 laps before engaging in a heated battle for the lead spot. She dropped back a few positions halfway through the race but she bounced back with an impressive charge through the latter part of the race. Reclaiming the lead with eight laps to go the all-time winningest AFT Singles rider finished strong to add a 21st career victory to her long list of accomplishments.

Texter-Bauman: “It was two great nights of racing and to go back-to-back is a great way to end a double header at Volusia I’m speechless. All week I’ve been struggling on the starting line so to get the holeshot as many times as I did this weekend was unbelievable. The team has worked so hard in the last year and half to get us back up front and to leave here with the points lead is an incredible feeling it’s motivating for the whole team to head into Atlanta for Round 3.”

Australian rider Max Whale delivered great results in his first race weekend aboard the KTM 450 SX-F FACTORY EDITION. On Friday Whale earned pole position after an impressive qualifying time on opening day. In AFT Singles Semi 1 he got off to a third-place start and he quickly worked his way up to second on lap two. He kept the momentum rolling as he passed into the lead on lap three putting in a solid ride to claim the first semi win of the season. In the Main Event Whale shot off the line and into second on the opening lap where he raced behind his teammate for the first 11 laps before getting passed for second. He put up a hard fight for the final podium position but he finished just off the box in fourth.

On day two Whale showcased his speed once again by claiming second overall in the day’s qualifying which set him up for a favorable start to the race day. In AFT Singles Semi 2 Whale was involved in an unfortunate situation that ultimately sent him to the back of the grid in a red-flagged restart and he fought his way through the chaos to put himself into 12th on the opening lap. He put his head down and quickly climbed through the field to reach seventh with two laps to go locking in a transfer to the Main Event. Starting on back row once again for the main Whale did his best to battle through the opening lap and put himself into the top-10 by lap two. From there he continued to charge his way forward to ultimately secure an impressive sixth-place finish by the end of the 26-lap race.

Whale: “Overall it was a strong weekend for the team and a good first outing for me on the KTM. I had a tough semi but I came from the back row in the main and ended up sixth. We never gave up in the main and moved forward a lot so I’m happy about this weekend but onto the next. I’m confident I feel good and I’m ready to go.”

(March 13 2021) – After something of a quiet opener by their standards Progressive American Flat Track’s Grand National Champion favorites got their revenge in Saturday night’s Volusia Half-Mile II presented by Daytona Dodge in Barberville Florida.

While defending Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle champ Briar Bauman (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) upped his speed at Volusia Speedway Park significantly overnight even he had nothing for a confident and on-form Jared Mees (No. 9 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) on this evening.

Bauman took the holeshot and immediately transformed the premier class Main Event into a two-man affair with archrival Mees just as they’ve done so many times in the past. But almost as soon as Mees worked his way into the lead with more than seven minutes remaining on the clock it was readily apparent that he was in a class of his own; Mees quickly shook free and piled up a substantial advantage on runner-up Bauman cruising to the checkered flag with more than two seconds in hand.

Mees who also won the Mission #2Fast2Tasty Challenge earlier in the program said “I grew up racing here on 60s and 80s with my dad coming here for the Southeastern Nationals back in the day. I’ve always come here as a pro and raced the Steve Nace All-Star warm-up race as well. Never would I have thought last year this place would be a National and man I think it was a really big hit. It was awesome to see fans in the stands again.”

Third-place finisher Sammy Halbert (No. 69 Coolbeth-Nila Racing Indian FTR750) was the only other rider in the field who managed to stay within ten seconds of the victory.

Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) seemed to have fourth-place all but sewn up. However intermittent mechanical issues dropped him several positions down the order elevating what had been a three-way dogfight for fifth featuring Brandon Price (No. 92 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Indian Motorcycle of Oklahoma City FTR750) and Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750).

Vanderkooi was able to return to full song and subsequently tracked that crew back down as all four were in with a shot at fourth over the race’s final two laps. Price ultimately held on for the position while Friday winner Robinson dropped the younger Bauman to sixth who in turn finished fractionally ahead of an unlucky Vanderkooi.

Davis Fisher (No. 67 BMC Racing/Dick Wall 60 Indian FTR750) ended up eighth while Friday heroes JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) and Kolby Carlile (No. 36 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) completed the top ten.

AFT Singles

Shayna Texter-Bauman (No. 52 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) remains undefeated since adding the hyphen to her name following Saturday’s jaw-dropping AFT Singles Main Event.

Texter-Bauman kept a close pack of six and seven riders corralled behind her for the bulk of the race. But that neat and tidy order was thrown out the window when all of her contenders seemingly went for broke at once with three minutes remaining on the clock.

Trent Lowe (No. 48 WBR/Suzuki Motor of America RM-Z450) ran second early but was shuffled back once the pressure intensified. Mikey Rush (No. 15 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) and Morgen Mischler (No. 13 Mission Roof Systems KTM 450 SX-F) then threw several haymakers from second and third with Rush eventually taking over the lead.

Defending class champ Dallas Daniels (No. 1 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) made his presence felt as well executing moves on both Mischler and Texter-Bauman before getting passed back to fourth.

After Texter-Bauman appeared vulnerable to outside passes she turned the tables by alternating a more defensive higher line with an ultra-low line that allowed her to reclaim those lost positions. Once back in front she held Rush at bay over the race’s final two laps to secure her second checkered flag in as many nights.

“It’s just unreal” Texter-Bauman said. “What a race that was with Mikey Morgen and Dallas… When those guys started passing me on the outside I kind of moved my line up a little bit and went back to work. It’s so nice racing with these guys — we can race clean and hard. What a weekend this was! It’s insane.”

Mischler rounded out the podium followed by AFT Singles title fighters Daniels Henry Wiles (No. 17 American Honda/United Rentals CRF450R) and Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE).

AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

2019 AFT Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines champion Cory Texter (No. 65 G&G Racing/Roof Systems Yamaha MT-07) managed to repeat his feat of a year ago once again upgrading an opening-night third into a victory the following evening at Volusia Speedway Park.

The opening lap teased a rematch of Friday’s last-lap epic featuring Texter Chad Cose (No. 49 Voodoo Ranger/Roof Systems Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Dan Bromley (No. 62 Memphis Shades/Vinson Construction Yamaha MT-07).

However Texter was in no mood to leave the result to the chance of a final strike this time around immediately gapping his rivals and never looking back. That relentless pace was no doubt aided by the fact that he wasn’t forced to fight his way from behind this time around which allowed him to stamp his authority from the start rather than slash up through the field from Row 3.

“That was awesome” Texter said. “I was so determined after kinda giving it away yesterday. I got to the track two hours earlier today I was so fired up. I felt great all day… I had so many texts and calls yesterday for getting third. Everyone loved the race so I’m glad we could put on a show today.”

The AFT Production Twins Main Event was relatively processional behind Texter as well; Friday winner Cose ended the race clear in second followed by an equally lonely Bromley.

Title hopefuls Ryan Varnes (No. 68 RVR/RoyBuilt Don’s Kawasaki Ninja 650) and Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 D&D Cycles/Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) rounded out the top five.

Even now 290 million or one in five Indians are insured by the government-owned Life Insurance Corporation. It still controls 66 per cent of the country’s life insurance market even though private insurers allowed into the fray in 1999 have now been around for over two decades. LIC is a financial behemoth like no other in the country overshadowing even the State Bank of India (SBI). It has 4955 offices across the country many of them occupying prime real estate. It directly employs 108000 people besides 1.3 million agents across the country and has assets under management ofRs 36 lakh crore making it a megacorp three times the size of Reliance Industries India’s largest private sector company.

For years successive Indian governments have treated LIC as family silver a prized possession they considered sinful to part with. The corporation has also shored up government finances on countless occasions being the biggest buyer and investor of government securities totalling Rs 17 lakh crore as on March 31 2020 way higher than SBI’s Rs 10.47 lakh crore. LIC investments also gave the corporation a seat on the boards of many private companies which in turn allowed the government to exercise indirect influence on them. For the past two decades the government and LIC had resisted disinvestment demands. But desperate times call for desperate measures. Even before the pandemic the BJP-led Narendra Modi government faced with a growing fiscal deficit and a flailing economy had in Budget 2020 announced its plans to divest a part of its share in LIC through an initial public offering (IPO) of anything between 5 and 10 per cent. Facing resistance from certain sections of the Sangh Parivar and within the LIC there was little forward movement. But with the pandemic choking government revenue and driving the fiscal deficit (shortfall between government’s total revenue and total expenditure) to an all-time high of 9.5 per cent of the GDP in 2020-21 the Modi government is frantically exploring all financial options to scale down the deficit to the 6.8 per cent it has committed itself to achieving for the next financial year. The impending LIC IPO has now become critical to rescue the government from the financial pickle it finds itself in besides saving the economy from spinning out of control if fiscal targets are breached.

How LIC can save the economy

Wide angle: The LIC headquarters at Nariman Point in Mumbai

With the economy showing signs of recovery only now after two quarters of negative GDP growth a 6.8 per cent fiscal deficit target is a tough ask. Going by the budget the revenue receipts must increase by Rs 2.33 lakh crore says a Mumbai-based economist. Finance ministry officials hope to meet the target through increased revenue from taxes dividends from public sector enterprises and most importantly realising its disinvestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore. Likely to get only Rs 32000 crore of the Rs 2.10 lakh crore disinvestment it had committed to in FY21 the government does not inspire much hope in its ability to realise its divestment ambitions. It reiterated its commitment to float the IPO in the budget document. Though no formal market valuation has been undertaken LIC’s IPO has the potential to raise Rs 1 lakh crore nearly six times the Rs 15200 crore state-owned giant Coal India raised through its IPO in 2010 the largest till date in the country.

This mammoth fund-raising exercise would help the government meet a substantial part of its disinvestment target and thereby its fiscal one. The move could also potentially transform the opaque and slothful public sector monolith into a nimble-footed world-class insurance company with a much sought-for transparency in its operations and a market capitalisation (the measure of a company’s worth as determined by the stock market) akin to firms such as Reliance Industries Tata Consultancy Services and HDFC Bank. “The disinvestment in LIC is likely to create one of the most valued listed entities in India and attract large foreign capital investment” says Motilal Oswal CMD Motilal Oswal Financial Services. LIC’s IPO expected to hit the market in the next financial year would also help bring in an estimated 10 million individual investors into the Indian stock markets broadening its retail base. The government will keep up to 10 per cent of the issue size in LIC’s IPO reserved for the company’s policyholders minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur told the Rajya Sabha in February.

In another important announcement the government simultaneously declared that it would raise the FDI (foreign direct investment) limit in private insurance companies from the current 49 per cent to 74 per cent. Experts view it as a major economic reform that would not only usher in much-needed private competition for government-owned insurance companies especially LIC but also unlock the huge potential the Indian insurance sector offers including for employment. However the move is easier said than done and fraught with challenges.

Advantage LIC

To understand the challenges one must first understand how and why the LIC was bestowed with such hallowed status since its inception. It was founded on September 1 1956 via the Life Insurance Corporation Act which nationalised the insurance sector. Over 245 insurance companies and provident societies were merged to create the behemoth. With its liberalisation in 2001 the life insurance sector has seen a more than 16-fold growth in premium. From a base figure of Rs 36071 crore in 2000-01 life insurance industry premiums have grown at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 15.6 per cent per annum to touchRs 572910 crore in 2019-20. LIC has also taken advantage of liberalisation to grow at a CAGR of 13.2 per cent every year.

Currently the Rs 7.63 lakh crore (according to IRDAI or the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) Indian insurance sector comprises 67 companies including 24 life insurance companies and 10 global reinsurance companies. LIC is the only public sector company dealing with life insurance. It had a total income of Rs 615883 crore in 2019-20 with a net profit of Rs 2713 crore. Market shares of individual private life insurance firms look measly compared to the 66 per cent that LIC controls. Among the top five life insurers (in terms of new business premiums) in the private sector SBI Life a subsidiary of SBI has a market share of 7.68 per cent; HDFC Life an arm of HDFC 7.23 per cent; Max Life where Axis Bank has 12 per cent stake 2.3 per cent; Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance a joint venture between Bajaj Finserv and German major Allianz 2.04 per cent; and Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance a joint venture between the Aditya Birla Group and Canadian major Sun Life Financial 1.64 per cent.

Globally the share of life insurance business in total premiums was 46.34 per cent in 2019. In comparison the share of life insurance business in total premiums in India was a high 74.94 per cent. According to data published by the Zurich-based reinsurers Swiss Re India ranks 10th among 88 countries in terms of premium income from life insurance. India’s share in the global life insurance market was 2.73 per cent in 2019. Life insurance premium in India rose 9.63 per cent in 2019 while global life insurance premium rose just 1.18 per cent.

LIC has certain inbuilt advantages that account for its continuing dominance. Unlike private insurance companies LIC policies have a sovereign guarantee as envisaged under Section 37 of the LIC Act 1956 according to it a higher level of trust. The Income Tax Act 1961 as amended gives a deduction up to Rs 150000 for those investing in life insurance policies under Section 80C. A lot of savings therefore get diverted to life insurance in India. Unlike the newer players a great majority of the policies LIC sells are as a savings-cum-life cover. These products are ‘participating’ in nature. A ‘participating’ policy enables a policyholder to share the profits of the insurance company in the form of bonuses or dividends. LIC thus concentrates on mass volumes as a unique selling proposition.

Unlike private players the company claims it has fewer delinquencies lapsed policies and discontinuance of high premium policies a claim that many contest. LIC has been settling approximately 94 per cent of the individual death claims within 30 days of lodging the claim. The comparative figure for the private sector is 85 per cent for the same class. The faster settlement of death claims vis- -vis the private sector has created a highly positive image of LIC in the minds of the public. On a conservative basis LIC is likely to get Rs 75000 crore over the next 20 years as renewal premium.

The politics of disinvestment

The plan for raising funds through an LIC IPO isn’t new. Soon after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government under Narendra Modi assumed power in June 2014 then finance minister Arun Jaitley met captains of trade and industry including a few chiefs of PSU banks and insurance companies for a pre-budget consultation. While Jaitley was focused on the ways and means to bring down the fiscal deficit (4 per cent in 2014-15) Uday Kotak MD & CEO Kotak Mahindra Bank suggested that the government disinvest in the LIC by way of an IPO to pare the government’s fiscal deficit. But nothing came of those discussions. Disinvesting in the LIC widely seen as an institution for fulfilling the government’s social objectives it was surmised could invite stiff political resistance.

Further back in history Jaitley’s counterpart in the NDA-1 government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee Yashwant Sinha while piloting the IRDAI Act in December 1999 that paved the way for the opening up of the Indian insurance sector to the private sector and foreign players had asserted that the government was not in favour of state monopolies anymore. However Sinha had also set at rest doubts about dilution of equity in LIC and state general insurance companies by saying that the government had no intention to privatise these corporations.

Jaitley reversed part of Sinha’s assurance to Parliament in 2015 when the Modi government amended the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act 1972 to allow disinvestment in five state-owned general insurance companies: General Insurance Corporation (GIC Re) New India Assurance United India Insurance Oriental Insurance Company and National Insurance Company.

The government also added a new section10B to the Act according to which GIC Re and insurance companies could raise their capital for increasing their business in rural and social sectors to meet solvency margins and such other purposes as the central government deemed fit. Here again Jaitley while piloting the amendments had assured the House that LIC would continue as a fully-owned government entity.

Unshackling the behemoth

While the burgeoning fiscal deficit compelled the Modi government to change its mind on LIC it still has many hurdles to overcome. First and foremost it has to amend the LIC Act 1956 to facilitate the IPO which the government has already embarked on according to Tarun Bajaj the economic affairs secretary. As many as 27 amendments are being pushed through the Finance Bill 2021 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman along with Budget 2021 so that both houses can pass it swiftly and smoothly. A separate bill on these amendments would possibly have invited greater scrutiny of the amendments and possible opposition too.

A second hurdle is the technical exercise of finding the right valuation before hitting the capital markets. For life insurance firms like LIC whose premium income is staggered over a long tenure valuation involves the discovery of an ‘embedded value’ (EV) (see The Valuation Puzzle); EV is a version of ‘enterprise value’ calculated for IPO-bound non-insurance firms. DIPAM or the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management which manages the government’s equity in state-owned companies has selected US-based actuarial firm Milliman Advisors to ascertain the embedded value of LIC while Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors. “We currently have only three listed life insurance players in India so the government’s decision of going ahead with the listing of LIC is a welcome move as it will aid further transparency and add more depth to the insurance sector in the equity markets” says Mahesh Sharma MD & CEO  SBI Life .

However while DIPAM will provide administrative support the Department of Financial Services (DFS) will drive LIC’s disinvestment. While the government has appointed a team of evaluators there are varying assessments on the likely valuation ranging from between Rs 2-3 lakh crore and Rs 20 lakh crore say sources. Already there is a tussle within the government on this front with two camps at work. One camp wants to push through the disinvestment even at a lower valuation while the other wants to first ensure the right valuation for the insurance giant.

An industry source who advises the prime minister’s office says that while the PMO is very keen on the LIC stake sale it also has concerns about arriving at the right valuation. This is because of the unique nature of LIC’s present profit-sharing mechanism. Section 28 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act stipulates that 95 per cent of the profits on valuation surplus be transferred to policyholders (after taxation) and the balance 5 per cent to the government as dividend.

Though subsequent IRDAI regulations have reduced the stipulation to 90 per cent to policyholders and 10 per cent to the shareholder (the government) LIC sticks to the old 95:5 formula to distribute the said surplus between policyholders and the government. In other words under the Act policyholders not shareholder/s have the first right to LIC’s profits. What is given to the government is described as net profit which also explains why LIC’s retained profits (Rs 2713 crore last year) and reserves are very low.

With more shareholders becoming LIC stakeholders in LIC in the post-IPO scenario this structure will have to change. If it doesn’t the LIC stock will not be so attractive to potential shareholders and will compare unfavourably with other listed insurance companies that promise shareholders a larger share of their profits. This implies that the proposed amendments to the LIC Act tackle the current skew towards policyholders in profit-sharing. Retail participation will depend on the government’s pricing strategy says Rajeev R. Shah managing director of transaction advisory firm RBSA Advisors. “If they leave something on the table for the common investors people will subscribe [to the LIC IPO].” The government has had both experiences in the past: of failing to enthuse retail investors in some cases and getting an overwhelming response in others. “It depends on how the issue is structured’’ says Shah. The process however is not easy and could delay the IPO.

LIC’s total investment portfolio as on March 31 2020 stood at Rs 33.7 lakh crore nearly four times the combined figure for private insurance companies. Despite its low capital base and a steady increase in the volume of business which also increases solvency requirements LIC has so far met solvency criteria prescribed by the IRDAI. However analysts point out that LIC’s non-performing assets (NPAs) are around 6 per cent compared to the (insurance) industry norm of 1.5-2 per cent. On listing shareholders will have an eye on that number and will expect it to come down.

Investors look for higher profitability and expect the organisation to reorient business strategies towards this objective” says G. Srinivasan former chairman and managing director of public sector general insurer New India Assurance (NIA) the first-ever general insurer to get listed in 2017. “Any listed entity will have to significantly increase its focus on profitability.’’ LIC he says will have to get used to higher levels of transparency disclosures and compliance and will need to understand the expectations of investors analysts and the market. Talking about the challenges of piloting NIA’s IPO Srinivasan said understanding the insurance sector was a challenge as there were no benchmarks at the time.

Timing it right

The Indian market has never seen such a mammoth float (as proposed by LIC) says Shah of RBSA Advisors. A recent decision by market regulator Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) to ease listing norms for large companies will help LIC’s mega float large companies can now divest a minimum 5 per cent in an IPO instead of the earlier norm of 10 per cent. Further they now have five years instead of three to raise the public float to 25 per cent. This effectively means LIC can make a smaller issue to begin with say Rs 50000 crore and make a smarter price discovery through market trades before deciding on a further stake dilution.

Resisting change: LIC agents protest the government’s move to sell stake in the insurer outside the LIC building in Kolkata

An upbeat stock market is good for any potential public issue of shares and with the real economy also making a faster-than-expected recovery experts say the time is good for an IPO. In the third quarter of this fiscal the economy came out of the recession to post a positive growth figure of 0.4 per cent. In 2021-22 GDP is expected to rebound by 10.5-11 per cent albeit on a lower base. The equity market has been witnessing historic highs for the past couple of months with the Sensex crossing the psychological 50000-point mark on January 21. LIC can attract great valuations at this juncture according to Keki Mistry vice chairman and CEO HDFC. Third confidence in the Indian equity market is growing among retail investors. From December 2019 to December 2020 investors opened an additional 10.5 million demat accounts. Higher returns and greater liquidity coupled with a low interest rate environment have made equity markets attractive for the common investor.

Mistry says retail and institutional investors will not want to miss an opportunity to invest in India’s largest insurer. A large IPO as proposed by the government for LIC is likely to generate a lot of public interest. A large listed insurance company from the country will enhance India’s prestige in the international market and showcase its value-creation possibilities says Joydeep Roy partner and global health insurance leader PwC. The LIC IPO’s benefits will be three-fold. The government will gain capital by selling some stake the capital markets will get a blue-chip stock (having a national reputation and reliability in times of volatility) and LIC’s customers will see true transparency in its financial numbers which would rub off on the sector as a whole.

Over the long term LIC will be able to attract additional capital to deepen its business across India. Policyholders will get a better understanding of the company’s financial strategy. Media and analyst reports will also help assess the company’s performance helping customers take more informed decisions. “The expectation is that LIC’s listing will reduce though not eliminate government control and that the markets will force greater disclosure leading to questions and scrutiny and therefore greater accountability which will drive performance” says Sakate Khaitan partner Khaitan Legal Associates.

From the market’s point of view given its sheer size the IPO could make stock exchanges quite broad-based and change India’s weightage and rating across various global indices including MSCI which measures the performance of large and mid-cap companies. Oswal says that with a valuation of around Rs 10 lakh crore the government can expect to garner more than Rs 1 lakh crore through a 10 per cent stake sale. In the Coal India IPO the retail offering was oversubscribed 2.1 times and more than 170000 retail investors applied for its shares.

“LIC can easily add Rs 5-5.5 lakh crore of market capitalisation to the country’s equity market” says Deven Choksey of KR Choksey Investment Managers. “I expect institutional buyers including foreign institutional investors to subscribe to the LIC shares.” According to him LIC has a well-defined investment strategy and has been paying good dividends to the government and its customers. The listing will get global recognition for its sheer size he adds. However even after being listed LIC may still be lower than Chinese financial conglomerate Ping An Insurance in terms of market capitalisation but possibly bigger than some of its other global peers. Ping An Insurance had a market capitalisation of Rs 17.13 lakh crore as on December 2020 while Prudential Financial Inc. and Metlife of the US had m-caps of Rs 2.25 lakh crore and Rs 3.08 lakh crore respectively as on December 2020. If LIC is allowed to include its real estate assets it will have a huge valuation. Vipin Anand MD LIC said the participation of even a fraction of LIC’s customers employees and agents in the IPO would be enough to see it sail through comfortably.

After years of dithering the government has finally decided to unlock the value in India’s insurance sector. The process may not be easy and has already run into resistance from trade unions but it will serve as the first step to unshackle India’s largest insurance company. In the process it also gets to gain by garnering sizeable revenues. The LIC IPO will be a template for the government’s disinvestment programme. It will also be an acid test of its perseverance and dexterity to surmount challenges along the way.

IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company Ltd (IndiaFirst Life) has sought approval from the regulator for an increase in policy premium for term plans for the next year due to a higher claims ratio according to a top company official.

“That’s right” IndiaFirst Life Managing Director & CEO R M Vishakha told PTI when asked about any such proposal and having written to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) for approval. However the official said it was not possible to share the quantum of premium price hike sought as it depends on the regulator adding approvals generally come within a month.

“We will be able to share it (quantum of price hike) after we get the confirmation from the regulator” she added. She said premiums normally change if there is an adverse claims ratio and there are accumulated losses that are not getting recovered.

“Nobody really looks at it from a short duration perspective. The pandemic has increased the claims ratio (of the company) by almost 30 per cent. And 30 per cent ratio kind of tends to wipe out a lot of earlier profits also because typically the assumptions and the pricing are very finely priced.

“We always want to charge the best price to the customer. So most of us (industry players) price it very finely” Vishakha said. She said a 30 per cent rise in claims ratio can have a sizeable impact on the portfolio. IndiaFirst Life has one of the most competitive term insurance plans in the market in the last few years Vishakha claimed.

“We have not increased our term plan rates since December 2018 while other life companies have had multiple revisions and upward variations in price points over past few years. IndiaFirst Life stands by its ‘CustomerFirst’ ideology. The existing COVID situation however requires us to consider marginally increasing rates while remaining competitive” she added.

HDFC Life which already hiked prices during the current year due to emerging trends and re-insurance price revisions said the company may look to price revisions depending on the evolving situation. “Based on emerging experience and reinsurance price revisions we have re-priced our protection products during the year. Our flagship term product Click 2 Protect Life was launched in January 2021 as per the new pricing.

“This product offers multiple innovative features thereby providing all-round protection coverage to our customers” Vibha Padalkar- MD & CEO HDFC Life said. She said the company has always maintained a risk calibrated approach when it comes to product re-pricing.

“We take into consideration our target segments claims experience cost of reinsurance and competitive dynamics and the price increases have varied for each segment. If there is a need for further repricing depending on the situation that emerges in the future we will take a call” Padalkar said.

However ICICI Prudential Life said the company is not looking at any immediate price revision as it already did so last year.

“As a risk management mechanism life insurance companies enter into re-insurance agreements. A few re-insurers who may not have previously revised rates seem to be doing so now. We don’t see any change in our product pricing for now as the new product we launched in July 2020 reflects the new rates” Satyan Jambunathan Chief Financial Officer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited said.

A Bajaj Allianz Life spokesperson said the company is not contemplating price revisions. Likewise Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co. Ltd is also not understood to be doing anything on the pricing front as of now. Queries sent to Aegon Life Insurance did not elicit any response while a few others declined to comment on the issue. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) in its annual report 2019-20 released last month said the Covid-19 crisis will hit the insurance industry forecasting a near 3 per cent point slowdown in annual average global premium growth in 2020 and 2021 from the pre-crisis growth trajectory.

The life sector will be more affected than the non-life. There is a possibility of contraction in premium levels in 2020 followed by a bounce-back Irdai said. Global reinsurer Swiss Re expects total global direct premiums written will reach pre-crisis levels in 2021 a strong outcome considering recession in 2020 will be the deepest since the 1930s.

“There will be challenges to industry profitability. Investment returns will remain subdued as interest rates stay low for longer impacting life and long-tail lines in non-life and rising corporate defaults could lead to losses on invested assets. “In life falling sales and fee income due to restricted in-person interactions on account of the lockdown measures imposed to contain virus spread will likely also weigh on profits this year” the Irdai report said.

During 2019 life insurance premiums in India increased by 9.63 per cent (7.30 per cent inflation-adjusted real growth) and the non-life insurance sector witnessed a growth of 7.98 per cent (5.70 per cent inflation-adjusted).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5dGltZXMubGsvMjEwMzE0L2J1c2luZXNzLXRpbWVzL21vYmlsaXR5LWluLXNyaS1sYW5rYS1iZXlvbmQtdGhlLWltcG9ydC1iYW4tNDM1OTE2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mobility in Sri Lanka: Beyond the import ban,"Mobility in Sri Lanka: Beyond the import ban By Sheran Fernando Feature View(s): View(s):

Prior to the import ban Sri Lanka was importing around US$ 1.5 billion worth of motor vehicles annually. The expenditure on petroleum imports (for motor vehicles) was $2.9 billion in 2018. Our travel speed within the city of Colombo was estimated by the University of Moratuwa as 8 kmh. Our air quality was classified as ‘hazardous’.

Everyone living in Colombo will recall how much cleaner and greener Colombo was during the lockdown. Even now the impact of the pandemic the closure of schools and less people travelling to work has resulted in much lower levels of congestion. Pre-pandemic it was estimated that 1 million people travelled daily into the city of Colombo.

Import ban

There has been a lot of negative publicity against the vehicle import ban. Sri Lanka’s trading partners are objecting against it. Vehicle importers are crying for the recommencement of imports. They argue that the vehicle import ban is creating a devastating impact on the automotive industry and not having a significant impact on the fast depreciating Sri Lankan exchange rate.

Segments of the industry are arguing for the commencement of locally assembled motor vehicles. On this topic I am presenting three areas for the readers’ consideration:

1. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles are “old technology”. Many leading nations in the world have announced that they will be banning ICE from 2025. In this context should Sri Lanka be encouraging the assembly of ICE vehicles or should we be considering the assembly of Electric Vehicles (EV’s)?

2. If we are considering the assembly of ICE vehicles do we have a large enough domestic market for this exercise to be efficient and viable? Consider that Malaysia with a population of 29 million and a per capita GDP of $29000 struggles to produce and sell 100000 cars per year. Malaysian manufacturer Proton has been making losses for the past decade. Sri Lanka has a population of 22 million and a per capita income of under $4000.

3. What is the nature of the local value addition that can be added? Apart from tyres and batteries are there any significant components that could be manufactured locally?

The assembly of EV’s can be viable at smaller annual production volumes as an EV has less than 20 moving parts. Over 60 per cent of the cost of an EV is its battery. The Lithium Ion battery of an EV can be assembled locally. Inputs such as graphene are locally available. We also have abundant solar resources to charge these batteries. Hence the assembly of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) is an area that Sri Lanka could explore and this would then make EV assembly in Sri Lanka viable.

Shared mobility in Sri Lanka

A case study by the Harvard Business School entitled ‘The Future of Mobility – Economic Environmental and Social Implications’ by George Serafeim and David Freiberg (Case Study 9-118-008) states that a shared mobility vehicle replaces between 9 – 32 privately-owned vehicles. Shared mobility had already taken off in Colombo prior to the pandemic. We experienced the efficiency of shared mobility with the reduction in travel prices through ride hailing apps and ride sharing platforms. Over time assuming the progressive decline of the pandemic shared mobility is expected to grow rapidly. The rate of growth can be increased by discouraging commuters driving into the city through the provision of parking at the city entry points and the levying of a city entry tariff. Limiting parking within the city is another lever that can be used to move mobility from privately-owned to shared.

Lifting the ban

Sri Lanka is facing global pressure to lift the vehicle import ban. The three strategies below could help the Government lift the import ban and still influence the expenditure of vehicle imports target pollution congestion and the high expenditure on fuel (for transport).

The first strategy is the implementation of the Singapore Certificate of Entitlement (COE) model in Sri Lanka. “The Certificate of Entitlement” or COE is the quota licence received from a successful winning bid in an open bid uniform price auction which grants the legal right of the holder to register own and use a vehicle in Singapore for a period of 10 years. When demand is high the cost of a COE can exceed the value of the car itself.

The tried tested and proven COE model will give the Government the ability to influence the total number of vehicle imports in each vehicle category. This will allow the Government to limit the expenditure of foreign exchange on vehicle imports. Market demand will determine the monetary value of the COE. The system of COE can be a strong yet transparent revenue earner for the Government.

The second strategy would be for the Government to only permit the import of EV’s as vehicles for personal mobility under HS Code 8703. Given the size of Sri Lanka an EV has adequate range to cover the distances required by most commuters. Given the abundance of solar resource charging can be powered by the sun. A charging network will be inexpensive to compile. Thus converting our vehicle park to EV’s will bring a reduction in our fuel import bill over time. This strategy can be phased in by initially allowing ICE’s at a high duty point so the duty is both a deterrent and also a source of income for the Government. The phased strategy will also give time for the charging infrastructure to evolve.

For larger commercial vehicles such as lorries and buses (imported under HS Codes 8702 and 8704) the compliance to EU6 emission standard should be made mandatory. This will have a significant impact on reducing the level of environmental pollution through exhaust gas pollution.

The third strategy has already been mentioned and that is the assembly of EV’s and BESS’s in Sri Lanka.

Conclusion

The mobility eco system is facing disruption. The vehicle import ban has given the Sri Lankan Government an opportunity to pause and evaluate a future strategy that can be of long term economic benefit to the country. A strategy that promotes shared mobility the use of EV’s and EU6 compliant vehicles will significantly reduce pollution congestion and the import cost of fuel in Sri Lanka. These strategies will also position Sri Lanka so that they can adopt Autonomous Connected Electric and Shared (ACES) mobility solutions in a timely manner. This will leap-frog Sri Lankan mobility from outdated to current or even futuristic.

Many automotive manufacturers are converting their fleets to Electric. Jaguar Land Rover has just announced that Jaguar will be all electric by 2025. The players in the automotive industry need not lament at their economic fate due to the ban on motor vehicle imports. Instead they could actively explore the blue ocean of ACES and make Sri Lanka a global leader in this sphere.

Sri Lanka’s gem and jewellery sector is now poised for a glittering future with new efforts of the government to strengthen its position as an industry hub achieving a US$1 billion export target this year.

As per Department of Customs’ statistics earnings from gem and jewellery exports recorded a growth of 2.59 per cent to $29.93 million in January 2021 compared to $ 28.20 million in January 2020.

A new strategy will be implemented by the State Ministry of Gem and Jewellery in collaboration with the Finance Ministry amidst gem traders facing a difficult operating environment from the economic slowdown.

The Presidential Task Force on Gems and Jewellery exports has met for the first time in Colombo recently under Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to fine tune this strategy aimed at achieving a target of $5 billion by 2025.

The urgent need of streamlining gem mining tackling land issues and gem cutting as well as gem actions certification conducting auctions and creating international acceptance for local industry has been identified at the meeting.

The upgrading of the Gem Laboratory of the National Gems and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) to international standards and the setting up of three international quality laboratories in Ratnapura Galle and Colombo along with mobile labs were also discussed.

Measures will be taken to conduct a special study on the industry in Thailand and Hong Kong and use it as role model for Sri Lanka soon while implementing a training programme for youth with private sector assistance.

Online gem and jewellery trading will also be promoted providing necessary assistance for local traders.

Arrangements are being made to set up Sri Lanka gem trading centres in Beijing and Shanghai in China.

The construction of the Gem Trading Complex and Training Centre in Demuwawatha Ratnapura is to be launched soon following budgetary allocations made by the Treasury a senior Finance Ministry official who attended the meeting told the Business Times.

The government is currently building a Gem and Jewellery Trade Centre in Ratnapura to attract sales which now take place in Bangkok.

In addition a proposal has also been made to consider the possibility of direct air connectivity between Sri Lanka and Madagascar.

Currently most of Madagascar’s gems are imported to Sri Lanka for value additions by way of cutting and polishing before being re-exported to gem trading hubs such as Bangkok and Hong Kong.

Representatives of gem traders and exporters associations have proposed to conduct an international level gem auction with the participation of foreign buyers at the Mahinda Rajapaksa international Conference Hall in Hambantota.

Action will be taken to remove the barriers that obstruct the release of uncultivated lands with gem deposits belonging to plantation companies and to take over control of these lands for the benefit of the mining industry.

Sri Lanka is the ninth largest exporter of precious stones to the global market and one of the five most important gem bearing nations of the world at present.

The entire industry employs approximately 600000 people including miners cutters and polishers dealers jewellery designers manufacturers and craftsmen and marketing resources."

But hope is on the way in the form of a long-awaited project to give Rte. 126 — Pond Street if you will — a major overhaul. Work is set to begin in spring.

Plans call for a general sprucing up of the street including adding sidewalks resurfacing the road building retaining walls installing granite curbs and outlining bike lanes. Work also calls for a roundabout at Spyglass Hill Drive.

Enhancements will also be made to the intersections of Eliot Street Algonquin Trail and the Market Basket driveway with traffic signal upgrades according to state and town officials.

Here are some details about the project.

Why do it?

In Ashland Rte. 126 runs from the Framingham to Holliston lines and is among the town’s most commercially viable areas home to a number of condominiums stores and restaurants. But the 1.7-mile stretch of road is in need of a face-lift both in terms of appearance and safety according to town officials.

For at least 15 years town officials and residents in the area have been trying to get the Department of Transportation to upgrade the state road through its Transportation Improvement Program (a list of projects prepared yearly by the Office of Transportation Planning) according to Director of Public Works Doug Small.

Nearly a decade ago the town and the state came to an agreement — if the town found the cash to pay for the 25% design portion of the project the state would include the project in the TIP and pay for the rest of the project Herbert said.

The town found the cash by instituting a local meals tax Herbert said.

The town used the meal tax money to fund two projects. One was a planning process project to understand the scope of the work. That was roughly $200000. The other was to fund the 25% design project which was also about $200000.

Select Board Chairwoman Yolanda Greaves said the project is important because it will make it easier for people and vehicles to get around and open the area to more commerce.

She laid out one scenario that will be possible once the project is complete.

“I know people are really looking forward to sidewalks down that whole thing so you could walk out of Spyglass Hill all the way down to Market Basket” she said.

Herbert said getting the project approved has already paid off because the developer of a mixed-use building planned for 12 Pond St. and the owner of the Mazi restaurant each said they decided to go through with their projects in part due to the planned road changes.

How much will it cost?

The state is paying for the lion's share of the project's approximate $20 million cost through the TIP. The town will pay about $1255000 to add additional enhancements including decorative street lights and other features.

For the past few weeks construction crews have been at the scene from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Crews have been clearing trees beginning at the Algonquin Trail all the way to the Holliston and Framingham lines according to Kristen Pennucci communications director at Massachusetts Department of Public Transportation. Drainage work is expected to begin next Monday.

Small said he expects most of the construction work to start this spring which is when residents will mostly like to see it impact traffic.

He said Ashland officials are working to keep the public up to speed on the work's progress both by updating the town website sending out mailers and putting up message boards on the street.

Traffic impact

Some parts of the road will be closed at different times during construction according to the state. During peak hours the state will maintain two lanes of traffic. When traffic is less congested crews will alternate to one lane Pennucci said.

Officials worry that traffic could be worsened because Eversource Energy plans to replace a gas line on Rte. 126 this spring. Small said he hopes that the company and the state come to an agreement to prevent major traffic backups.

If they don’t traffic could be a major problem Small said. He said he's confident the state will fix any problems.

Pennucci said the two projects will overlap for about three months. She said the state and Eversource “are working together to ensure proper coordination is in place for both projects.”

Herbert said he expects there to be a bit of a traffic rough patch while the project is completed but said it is worth it.

“Anything that is worthwhile you have to go through a little bit of a rough period a little bit of pain and inconvenience in order to get to the other side with a product you’re really proud of” he said.

What do neighbors think?

Paula Parker at one time chaired a working group championing redevelopment along Rte. 126.

She said the corridor has regional economic impact and is in need of a safety economic and aesthetic upgrade. It has major potential given its location and the hundreds of residents who live in that area she said.

She is philosophical about the construction and accompanying traffic.

""I look at it like birthing a baby"" she said. ""It might be a little bit of a inconvenience but this is well worth it. This project has been decades in the making.""

Mike Kane who owns 126 Self Storage on Rte. 126 welcomes the project.

He said he is looking forward to the new additions to the road and understands traffic will be a temporary inconvenience.

He grew up in Ashland in the Eliot Street area. In the 69 years he has lived there the road hasn't gotten the necessary improvements it needs.

“It’s very much our time so to speak” he said.

He said the project will help make the area safer particularly the street lights at Algonquin Circle.

Cliff Wilson who lives near the corridor on Eliot Street said he has some concerns about the project.

For one he doesn't support the town spending the $1.2 million required to add additional items to the road like decorative lighting and other elements to beautify the streets.

He said he remembered when residents were shown the renderings of the proposed revitalized streets. It wasn’t made clear that the town was going to have to pay for some of the elements that make streets look ”pretty"" he argued.

“People looked at these beautiful drawings and said ‘Wow that looks nice'"" he said. “What they didn’t mention initially eventually it came out was that the state was going to pay for the road but all of these beautiful things such as trees and lamps and the lighting was going to cost the town money.""

Wilson said he thought the way the project had been presented was “disingenuous.’

He said he suspects the town is going to have to pay more than a million dollars plus as things progress.

He also doesn't like the rotary planned for Spyglass Hill Drive. He foresees it being a safety hazard.

“Had I believed they were actually going to do this I might have bought the (the building that Mazi just went in) and put an ambulance service and wreckage service in that building.”

One aspect he does like is a planned left turn signal at Eliot Street.

“Not only is it extremely dangerous” he said of the current state of the street. “It holds up all the traffic behind you if you are trying to turn left onto Eliot Street from Rte. 126 because you have to wait for the oncoming traffic to be gone before you can turn.”

Kate Jurczyk of Rodman Road said she is glad that work is underway to repair the streets and bring sidewalks but she has concerns that the new development in the area may overshadow the wants of the residents who live in that part of town. She pointed to the construction of a mixed-used building being built on the former Fusion restaurant site at 12 Pond St . Some neighbors have complained that the development is too big has too much residential space and is out of character with that part of town.

The state expects the Rte. 126 project to be completed by April 2024.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

DOWAGIAC — Thanks to a recently awarded grant one local Native American tribe is taking steps to help grow and maintain its housing and community development programs.

The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians will be receiving $2.1 million from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development for affordable housing activities in their tribal communities.

The funds are administered through HUD’s Indian Housing Block Grant Program a formula grant that provides a range of affordable housing activities on Indian reservations and Indian areas. The program also looks at factors including the size of the service area Native American populations within the service area and Pokagon Band citizen numbers in the service area. Funds can only be used in the Band’s 10-county service area.

“Each year all tribes in the US are eligible for HUD funds for the grant” Coleman said. “Each year we receive roughly 2 million from the program which will help us cover the cost of our housing operation as well as the costs of our assistance programs.”

The funding will be put to good use by Jim Coleman the Pokagon Band’s director of housing & community development.

Coleman is responsible for overseeing the tribe’s housing operation which consists of more than 80 rental units and 48 self-storage units. He also manages several programs for the tribe including rental assistance down payment assistance rehab assistance and more.

On the community development side Coleman’s staff promotes tribal development while expanding the tribe’s ability to exercise its sovereign rights through planning analysis recording and implementation of different projects. He oversees the travel planner Geographic Information Service specialists building inspections and property management.

Overseeing the department is a lot of work but Coleman lives to help others. Lending a hand to those in need makes his job

fulfilling.

“It’s very rewarding to be able to help people especially in their time of need” he said. “I get calls from people who are homeless and a lot of times there’s anxiety with being homeless. We’re able to help a lot of citizens which is rewarding to myself and my team.”

Coleman also handles four COVID-related programs this year assisting with job loss infections and more.

“We manage three housing villages” Coleman said. “Our goal is to keep those 80 families safe.”

When the rental units require maintenance Coleman and his team take every precaution in order to keep tenants safe.

“We screen everyone daily for COVID” he said. “Tenants are screened before maintenance responds and contractors are screened before coming onto Pokagon land. We’re maintaining social distance. The process makes it a little more complicated but we haven’t had any employee cases in our housing team and minimal cases in our housing villages.”

The housing and community development departments have been working mostly remote since the onset of the pandemic but have continued to provide every service they offered prior to COVID. Coleman said the Band has transitioned from face-to-face to digital assistance. While that transition has been a stark change from the norm Coleman said the change to remote work has helped in some cases.

“We’ve been able to go paperless and maximize our time” he said. “Employees are more efficient. It’s been working for us.”

The Pokagon Band has taken additional steps to ensure the safety of its citizens including the approval of its COVID-19 Video Doorbell Program which provides reimbursement for the purchase of video doorbells by Pokagon Band citizens whose households include at least one person who is potentially at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

“It allows citizens to have a two-way conversation without opening the door” Coleman said. “We have it professionally installed within a one to two-week period of ordering. It has been great for our elders who are able to see who’s at the door from the comfort of their living rooms.”

Coleman is thankful for the work of his teams many of which have been working with him for more than 10 years. He continues to look for ways to help as many citizens as he can.

“Managing 80 rental units is challenging at times” he said. “Even so we want to grow even further. We’re still in growth mode; it all boils down to funding. If we want to help every citizen we must continue to grow and improve.”",,,,,,

We've been hearing it for years but the recent Texas blackouts have made it glaringly apparent: The energy grid needs our urgent attention.

And it's not only the grid in Texas. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the U.S. energy infrastructure a C-minus grade saying that in the near term ""additional transmission and distribution infrastructure smart planning and improved reliability are needed to accommodate the changing energy landscape as delivery becomes distributed and renewables grow.""

Clearly updating our energy infrastructure is a pressing need and many investors are charged up about the companies helping to bring our grid into the 21st century: Companies like Itron (ITRI 0.82%) NV5 Global (NVEE -1.10%) and Quanta Services (PWR -0.97%).

Itron: A global powerhouse

Serving more than 8000 customers (utilities and cities) in over 100 countries Itron is playing a crucial role in bringing electric grids -- at home and abroad -- into the 21st century by offering a variety of products and services including smart meters and analytics software.

The company's grid management helps utilities integrate smart devices and software to achieve greater efficiency and improve resilience. ComEd the largest electric utility in Illinois achieved a 46% reduction in the frequency of customer interruptions and a 32% reduction in customers impacted by storms with the help of Itron.

In Maine electric utility Versant Power recently chose Itron's advanced metering infrastructure including 160000 smart meters to update its grid. Versant President John Flynn said ""With Itron's solution we will be able to continue to ensure that electricity is more acceptable available and affordable to more people than before.""

During its fourth-quarter 2020 earnings presentation Itron reported that it achieved a record $973 million in bookings resulting in a record backlog of $3.3 billion. The insight into the backlog and future potential revenue is valuable for investors mitigating concern that the company won't be able to achieve growth -- especially in the context of constrained budgets due to the pandemic.

NV5 Global: A diverse range of services

Engineering consultant NV5 Global provides expertise to a wide range of customers in the public and private sector. On the company's third-quarter 2020 conference call Alex Hockman the chief operating officer talked about NV5's opportunity to update the grid in California saying ""We have secured several large design and survey contracts in Q3 and wildfires this year in California are expected to continue driving utility efforts to modernize the electrical grid for the years to come.""

In January NV5 announced a contract award from an unnamed national utility ""to provide engineering and design services for power distribution transmission and substation infrastructure."" According to NV5 the three-year contract is expected to contribute over $100 million to its top line. While the deal isn't necessarily transformative for the company's finances it is noteworthy considering the company reported $660 million in sales for 2020. The deal furthermore highlights NV5's ability to provide a diverse range of offerings to utilities including engineering surveying and geospatial mapping project management construction administration and testing and inspection services.

Addressing the contribution to the top line of the deal management hasn't commented on how it will affect profitability; however investors can infer that the company's grid modernization business plays an important factor in growing the bottom line. Unlike the building technologies and sciences segment which saw revenue and gross profit decline from 2019 to 2020 the infrastructure segment (which accounts for grid modernizations services) has recognized both growing revenue and gross profit over the past three years helping the company overall along both respective metrics.

Quanta Services: Keeping current with its capabilities

Like NV5 Quanta Services helps utilities update their electrical grids in a variety of ways. It's an efficient builder of electricity transmission towers to replace old towers with related engineering services like line design and foundation design. Quanta also helps utilities with substation design and construction distribution engineering and program management.

Engineering News-Record a trade publication for the construction industry rated Quanta No. 1 on three separate top 600 lists: specialty contractors electrical contractors and utility contractors. And Fortune recently ranked the company No. 3 in the engineering and construction category of its listing of the world's most admired companies.

Like Itron which has seen an increase in its backlog Quanta also has seen growing demand ending 2020 with a record $15.1 billion in backlog.

And last summer Quanta entered into a joint venture LUMA Energy that represents a 15-year operations and maintenance agreement with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to help modernize the island's energy grid. Quanta management noted on the fourth-quarter 2020 conference call that LUMA's contribution over the 15-year agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for the company.

The power-packed recap

Itron NV5 and Quanta are all viable investments. Of the three though NV5 may be better suited to investors in search of a significant growth stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not clear if this has impacted the manufacturing of the S21 phones which would be unfortunate to say the least as the handsets are reportedly performing better than their predecessors





Qualcomm is said to be prioritizing its flagship chip at the expense of lower-end SoCs.



Although Qualcomm is still confident that it will be able to meet its sales target for the second quarter a contract manufacturer for several major smartphone companies told Reuters it would cut smartphone shipments because it was experiencing a 'shortage of a range of components' from the chipmaker.



Xiaomi's vice president Lu Weibing had previously cautioned that the chip shortage was extreme.



Qualcomm's incoming Chief Executive Cristiano Amon had recently said that demand was higher than supply. This might partially be because of restrictions placed on Huawei by the US which have caused consumers to turn to other Android companies which typically use Qualcomm's chips. Huawei's phones are mostly powered by its own Kirin silicon. Qualcomm's incoming Chief Executive Cristiano Amon had recently said that demand was higher than supply.

Amon Amon said last month that U.S. sanctions against the Chinese company may help free up capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co but added that freed up supply 'won’t translate into an immediate up-tick in output for other providers.'

The upcoming smartphone will come with a new Qualcomm chipset and improved camera specifications.

According to a Nokipoweruser report the Nokia 8.3 5G will run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 775 processor. It is worth noting that Qualcomm has not officially launched the chipset yet. The processor is said to be based 5nm process and will offer features such as dual 5G Spectra 570 and LPDDR5 3200Mhz and LPDDR4X 2400MHz. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 775G chip is also going to accompany the new processor.

Apart from a new chipset the Nokia 8.3 5G successor will reportedly feature a Penta-camera setup. The array will also house a 108-megapixel primary sensor along with ultra-wide macro and telephoto sensors. As expected it will also have Zeiss optics and Ozo Audio technology.

The phone is said to come with a 6.5-inch display with QHD+ resolution and PureView technology. The screen may offer a 120Hz refresh rate. A bigger 5000mAh battery will power the phone.

HMD Global had launched the Nokia 8.3 5G in September last year. It features a 6.81-inch full HD+ PureDisplay with a 20:9 aspect ratio. For performance the phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor. It comes with 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of built-in storage. A 4500mAh battery powers the phone. There is also a microSD card slot for expandable storage.

In the camera department Nokia 8.3 5G features a quad-rear camera setup featuring a 64 MP sensor 12 MP sensor with an ultra-wide lens 2 MP depth sensor and 2 MP sensor with a macro lens. Other key features of the camera include dual high CRI rear flesh. The phone has a 24-megapixel front-facing camera. The camera setup also comes with Zeiss Optics.

It’s a good look though: smooth to the touch and stylishly understated in black with a faint diamond pattern that becomes more visible when light reflects on it. A white version is also available but it looks slightly more odd for my money thanks to the rectangular camera housing being black on both. The camera bump protrudes a tiny bit but we’re talking a fraction of a millimetre and the phone certainly doesn’t wobble when placed on its back.

It’s a strong look and once again Samsung is up there with the best of them in consumer-friendly design choices. There’s both a 3.5mm headphone jack and support for microSD cards of up to 1TB in capacity. Not only does it also support two SIM cards at once but you don’t have to choose between expanding your internal storage and using a second microSD.

In short it would be top marks here if it weren’t for the lack of fingerprint reader – c’mon Samsung even the Motorola E6 Plus managed that and it cost £100 in 2019.

Samsung Galaxy A02s review: Screen

Another area where Samsung tends to flourish is on screen quality and this is another decent budget effort. The 6.5in IPS display has a resolution of 1600 x 720 which means you’re getting around 270 pixels per inch. That’s low as far as big-screen phones go but still what you’d expect from your average laptop so nothing to get too worked up about.

Display and Design

All three smartphones boast the same 6.78-inch (2448 x 1080) Samsung AMOLED display with 144Hz refresh rate and 300Hz touch sampling rate. The three also come HDR10+ certified and geared with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.

Both ROG Phone 5 Pro and 5 Ultimate are equipped with ROG Vision a new rear matrix display that shows customizable animations for system alerts and status. The ROG Phone 5 Pro features a color ROG Vision display while the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a monochrome version. The standard ROG Phone 5 doesn’t have this feature but has a dot-matrix style RGB instead.

Additionally the ROG Phone 5 Pro and ROG Phone 5 Ultimate feature hidden rear touch sensors on the back cover which provide L2/R2 trigger functions similar to a game console controller. Both also work together with the ultrasonic sensors the AeroActive Cooler 5 buttons and the motion controls.

In terms of color options the ROG Phone 5 comes in either Phantom Black or Storm White. However you can only have the Storm White if you’ll go for the ROG Phone 5 Pro and the Phantom Black for the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.

Chipset

The three are powered by the latest flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor and Adreno 660 graphics which has enough power to run the ROG Phone 5’s features and the latest graphics-intensive games smoothly.

RAM and Storage

What also makes the smartphones different from each other are their RAM and storage configurations. The ASUS ROG Phone 5 is available in three RAM options: 8GB 12GB and 16GB and it has two storage options of either 128GB and 256GB. On the other hand the ROG Phone 5 Pro comes with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage while the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate boasts a higher 18GB RAM paired with 512GB storage.

Cameras

There’s no difference between the three smartphones in terms of cameras. The ROG Phone 5 series sport triple rear cameras consisting of 64MP Sony IMX686 (main) 13MP (ultra-wide) and 5MP (macro) sensors. Plus all of them have the same 24MP front camera. For a gaming smartphone this is a versatile set of cameras but we’ll know more about its performance once we have reviewed it.

Connectivity and Features

The ASUS ROG Phone 5 series also sport the same connectivity features such as Dual-SIM WiFi 6E Bluetooth 5.2 SatNav systems (GPS Glonass Galileo BeiDou QZSS NavlC) NFC USB-C in-display fingerprint scanners face recognition and a 3.5mm audio jack.

For software the three runs under the new ROG UI based on Android 11.

Additionally the three are also equipped with dual front-facing speakers by Dirac technologies and a 7-magnet stereo speaker with a Cirrus Logic amplifier for good audio quality whether you’re playing games watching videos or listening to music.

Battery

Looking at their capacities all pack the same 6000mAh battery with 65W HyperCharge support. It’s a massive battery capacity which is just right considering the numerous features that will suck up power.

Price

There’s no word yet about the series’ pricing and availability in the Philippines so stay tuned!

Based on the specs the standard ROG Phone 5 should be more than enough for any mobile gamer. But those with bigger budgets need the large RAM and storage capacities and a cooler design could go for the ROG Phone 5 Pro or ROG Phone Ultimate.

How much and where you can buy the Redmi Note 10 in the Philippines

The Redmi Note 10 is the first smartphone released in the Philippines to use one of Qualcomm’s newest chipsets the Snapdragon 678 after all. So naturally a lot of people are going to be curious about its performance and whether it can take on modern smartphone titles that require more powerful specs to run smoothly. Does the Redmi Note 10 pass the grade? Read on to find out.

What is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 678?

The Snapdragon 678 is a midrange octa-core chipset and the direct successor to the wildly popular Snapdragon 675 that was introduced in 2018 and used in devices like the Vivo V15 Pro and V17 Pro. Qualcomm says the new chip aims to bring better camera performance and connectivity features to mid-tier devices without compromising battery life.

Like the previous generation it’s fabricated on an 11nm LPP [Low Power Plus] process technology. Its cornerstone specs include two Cortex-A76 (Kryo 460 Gold) performance cores six Cortex-A55 cores (Kryo 460 Silver) and Adreno 612 graphics. The eight-core design boasts a TDP or thermal design point of just 6 watts.



Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 chip

Its Cortex-A76 cores are clocked higher at 2.2GHz compared to the Snapdragon 675’s 2.0GHz A76 cores though and Qualcomm notes the GPU has been improved to offer faster speeds with greater efficiency. Additionally the Hexagon 685 DSP [Digital Signal Processor] of the Snapdragon 678 adds smarter and more robust computing while the newly added Spectra 250L image processor allows the chipset to take advantage of enhanced camera features when shooting portraits and recording video.

SEE ALSO: This is Xiaomi Philippines’ March-April 2021 product brochure

The Snapdragon 678 also includes an X12 LTE modem with advanced carrier aggregation to deliver download speeds up to 600Mbps and upload speeds up to 150Mbps. Dual SIM dual VoLTE or DSDV is onboard as well. This technology allows you to keep HD or Ultra HD calls active on both SIM cards.

The Snapdragon 678 doesn’t support 5G unlike some other chips on the market like the MediaTek Dimensity 700 in the 5G variant of the Redmi Note 10 and Dimensity 800U inside the Redmi Note 9T 5G (click on this for our review). If you need something future-proof with 5G data consider the phones we just mentioned because they’re two of the cheapest 5G options currently on the market.

Synthetic benchmarks and real-world use

To really put the Redmi Note 10 through its paces we downloaded some benchmark apps online and tested our review unit in room conditions at around 25 degrees Celsius.

Antutu Benchmark

Overall score: 241 698

Based on its Antutu score the Redmi Note 10 performs on a par with our expectations of a mid-tier product. It won’t smash records but it’s also no slouch and keeps up with the competition well enough. As expected our unit scored lower than devices powered by Snapdragon 700 series chipsets like the Snapdragon 720G. It fell behind the Dimensity 800U-based Redmi Note 9T 5G. But to be fair MediaTek’s affordable 5G SoC ranks among the fastest in its price range.

Geekbench 5

Single-core test: 529

Multi-core test: 1614

The Geekbench score of the Redmi Note 10 is average nothing special. Its octa-core CPU and Adreno 612 GPU only begin to show their age when matched up with SoCs that are positioned higher on the market.



Benchmark scores in Antutu and Geekbench 5

3DMark

Wild Life: 483

Sling Shot: 2227

We put the Redmi Note 10 through Wild Life and Sling Shot runs in 3DMark a popular cross-platform benchmarking tool used to determine a phone’s graphics rendering potential and workload processing capabilities. As usual running the app produces a score with higher results indicating better performance. In our case the numbers were passable for the handset’s price point.

CPU Throttling Test

The CPU Throttling Test app can be downloaded for free on the Google Play Store. It gives you an idea how your device handles performance throttling over a specific period. At the 5- and 15-minute marks the Redmi Note 10 showed minimal signs of slowing down. The 30-minute mark is where things start to go downhill but not by much.

Even after an hour of torture our unit retained 80% of its max ouput throughout our run gradually dropping its performance over time without showing jarring stutters. Seeing performance drops over time is inevitable; what’s quite impressive about the Redmi Note 10 is that it managed to avoid massive dips in this synthetic scenario suggesting it won’t suddenly throttle down during heavy workloads.

5-minute mark: 83% of max performance

15-minute mark: 76%

30-minute mark: 88%

60-minute mark: 80%



Redmi Note 10 CPU Throttling Test results: 5 15. 30 and 60 minutes

Gaming test

We used Xiaomi’s built-in screen recorder to record all our gameplay footage on the Redmi Note 10. The native FPS counter on MIUI 12 was also used to measure frame rates in-game.

Gameplay: Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Genshin Impact (3:01 mark) and PUBG Mobile (6:01 mark)

PUBG Mobile

For PUBG Mobile the highest graphics option available on the Redmi Note 10 is HD which is fine since it doesn’t support HDR playback anyway. The frame-rate settings go all the way up to High. We got an average of 30 fps using the HD preset. That’s okay if you’re not into competitive gaming. What is more important to note is that the Note 10 can maintain stable frame rates so random slowdowns and stuttering shouldn’t be an issue.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang

Mobile Legends is arguably one of the most popular mobile games in the region and the Philippines is no exception to an active community of Mobile Legends players and fans. Like most midrange devices on the market the Redmi Note 10 can maintain 45 fps to 50 fps with the graphics set to High. Playing at Ultra detail drops the frame rate to about 40. Mobile Legends currently doesn’t support gameplay higher than 60 fps so the 60Hz AMOLED screen here is a good fit for the game.

Genshin Impact

Similar to PUBG Mobile Genshin Impact is a visually striking game with the gameplay to match. Many reviewers — us included — recognize it as the most demanding Android game ever made.

We were able to average 30 fps using the game’s lowest preset. Switching to Medium produced slightly better graphics at the expense of frame rate. At Medium detail our fps hovered in the mid-to-high 20s during gameplay. While obviously not ideal we’re happy with the results we got considering how much the Redmi Note 10 costs plus the fact that Genshin Impact looks stunning for a mobile title even when the visuals are reduced to their worst-looking.

Final thoughts

Powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 the Redmi Note 10 has proven to be a decent performer. It delivers a solid experience at low to medium graphics when playing demanding games that require more graphics power such as PUBG Mobile and Genshin Impact and CPU throttling isn’t a concern even after an hour of stressful testing. So from a performance standpoint the smartphone fares as well as you’d expect given the hardware.

The Redmi Note 10 delivers a solid experience at low to medium graphics when playing demanding games that require more graphics power such as PUBG Mobile and Genshin Impact. And CPU throttling isn’t a concern

Xiaomi has nailed the pricing of the Note 10 series in the Philippines with the vanilla model officially going for P8490 ($175) at local retail. This gives the brand yet another contender in the sub-P10000 ($207) market that will appeal to its intended audience of budget-minded users who want the most value for money.

The lawsuit said SolarWinds used an easily guessable password “solarwinds123” on an update server which was subsequently breached by hackers “likely Russian in origin.” SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna speaking at a congressional hearing in March blamed the weak password on an intern.

There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.

Experts are still trying to understand just how the hackers broke into SolarWinds servers. But the weak password does reveal wider issues about the company’s security practices — including how the easily guessable password was allowed to be set to begin with.

Even if the intern is held culpable SolarWinds still faces what’s known as vicarious liability — and that can lead to hefty penalties.

What is vicarious liability and why should startups care?

Vicarious liability is “the principle that an employer can be liable for the acts of an employee if the act was something done by the employee acting in the ordinary course of their employment” said Martin Sloan a partner at U.K. law firm Brodies.

Whether a company is liable for cyber incidents based on the actions of employees or contractors will depend on the circumstances of what happened.

“In many cases the company will be directly liable for the acts of its employees” said Sloan. “Was the employee or contractor acting on the company’s instructions or in the course of their duties? If not is the company nevertheless vicariously liable for the acts of the employee?”

Data breaches are more a “when” not an “if” and businesses can still be held liable for damage caused by their employees or contractors.

“A breach that occurred does not require data to be released to people outside a company; a breach can have data released internally often to contractors who do not have need or rights to the data” said Niamh Muldoon who serves as the global data protection officer at identity giant OneLogin.

“These are quite common in GDPR breaches where fines have occurred” she said.

How big can the liability be?

Last year Capital One was fined $80 million and told to tighten its security after a 2019 cloud data breach that exposed the personal data of over 100 million customers. The alleged hacker is a former engineer at Amazon Web Services which Capital One used to store customer data.

Meanwhile the U.K. Supreme Court said supermarket chain Morrisons was “not vicariously liable” for a 2014 data breach caused by an employee who acted for personal gain.

Sloan explained that Capital One was directly liable for the issues that led to the breach. “The fine was for a failure by Capital One to have in place effective information security procedures to protect against third-party attacks” he said. “In the Morrisons case the court said that there was nothing more Morrisons could have done to prevent the breach.”

There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.

Perhaps the most well-known case of a breach caused by a third-party is Target in 2013 when attackers compromised millions of customers’ data using stolen credentials from a third-party HVAC contractor. Target eventually paid an $18.5 million settlement and reportedly spent over $200 million in legal fees stemming from the breach.

Demi Ben-Ari chief technology officer at third-party security management company Panorays said that even though the breach was caused by a third-party “Target was still considered responsible because of a lack of adequate security.”

More recently laboratory giants Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp had millions of customers’ data stolen in 2019 because of a breach at its third-party billing provider AMCA. Facing enormous HIPAA penalties AMCA subsequently filed for bankruptcy.

“While we have yet to see what the financial fallout will be for Quest and LabCorp there’s no question that they will face hefty fines as well” said Ben-Ari.

How can startups avoid vicarious liabilities of cybersecurity incidents?

Humans make mistakes but vicarious liability can be avoided if the company can show that the incident happened despite its best efforts to avoid it. Having strong cybersecurity policies in place can help prevent the most egregious issues.

“It’s essential that businesses regularly review their information security measures and those of their partners to ensure that they remain appropriate and reflect best practice” said Sloan. “As part of this they should use third-party vulnerability and penetration testing. Businesses should also ensure that they consistently apply security patches and address vulnerabilities when they’re identified and provide staff with appropriate training on cyber risk and the business’ internal policies.”

“Taking these steps will help to prevent breaches from occurring in the first place and if they do help the business to demonstrate that it did everything that could reasonably have been done to prevent the breach” he added.

The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre has a helpful guide on 10 steps to take to improve your company’s cybersecurity posture and the U.S. National Industrial Security Program which governs federal contractor facility clearance and insider threat programs also has more.

Keeping the access limited strictly on a need-to-know basis with proper and verified audit trails serves as a deterrent said Tom Van de Wiele principal security consultant at F-Secure.

It also ensures a timely and cost-efficient way of responding to a situation where an insider incident might be suspected he said.",,,,,,,,,

The seating map for WrestleMania 37 at the Raymond James Stadium has been released showing a slightly different change from previous years when it comes to the floor layout.

The side where the entrance way and stage will be set will have no seats on the floor except for the ringside area. This might suggest an elaborate set or maybe the addition of something different such as video walls occupying that space.

The other three sides will have triangular-shaped seating sections and will leave a lot of empty space on the floor.

WrestleMania will have seating in pods of one to six people per pod and pods must be purchased in their entirety and may not be divided. Tickets in a pod may not be sold or transferred to anyone other than family or trusted acquaintances who have chosen to attend the event together unless all such tickets in the full pod are being sold or transferred to one party.

A face covering will be required for every fan who will be attending the event.

WWE will be selling two different kind of tickets for WrestleMania – single-day and combo. Fans can opt to purchase a two-day ticket that will guarantee entry on April 10 and April 11 or else can buy single tickets for April 10 or April 11. While this is the second time that WrestleMania will be a two-day event it’s the first time that fans will be able to participate in a two-day WrestleMania.

Tickets for WrestleMania go on sale this Tuesday March 16 on Ticketmaster.com.

WWE has already confirmed that live fans will be in attendance for both nights of WrestleMania 37 next month as tickets for the event will go on sale this coming Tuesday. However the maximum attendance for both nights at Raymond James Stadium still has yet to be confirmed. Initial reports had the expected crowds at around 25000 slightly larger than than the 22000 that filled the stadium for Super Bowl LV back at the start of February. in the same stadium. New reports have since come out stating WWE wants the crowds to be even larger with Spectrum Sports 360 reporter Jon Alba stating on Sunday that WWE now wants the crowds to be as large as 45000 fans for each night. If it goes on as planned that would give WrestleMania the largest crowd of any sporting or entertainment event since the COVID-19 pandemic began and crowd restrictions were put in place.

""I can independently confirm reports #WWE is aiming for about 45000 people per night at Raymond James Stadium for #WrestleMania which would be by far the largest crowd at a sports or entertainment event in America since the pandemic began"" Alba wrote in a series of tweets. ""I have reached out to the Tampa Bay Sports Authority which manages Raymond James Stadium but have yet to hear back. Tickets are on-sale 3/16 though it hasn't publicly been said how many will be available. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order last fall that allows for stadiums to run full capacity should they choose to but no one has run a show to that magnitude so far. The Texas Rangers have clearance to fill their stadium with about 40k to start the season (right around the same time as WrestleMania). Daytona International Speedway officials estimated to me Daytona 500 attendance was in the 25k-30k range. So this would be biggest.""

Alba also pointed out that just because that's the crowd size WWE wants doesn't mean they'll get it. The pandemic is still ongoing and restrictions on international travel will prevent many fans from flying to Tampa for the event.

Remember: just because #WWE WANTS 45000 each night doesn’t mean it will get it. No international travel makes it hard. I suspect it will sell out but will 45000-80000 people travel to Florida?

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the latest RTX GPU from NVIDIA. It's the cheapest RTX 30 GPU you can get right now and offers some great value for money. While the RTX 3060 Ti is a good card in itself it doesn't quite offer the same value proposition as the RTX 3060 which means you're not getting as much performance gain as the difference in price that you'll pay. The RTX 3060 is a better GPU purchase choice between the two. Let's take a look at why that is the case.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 3060 Ti specs

Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 and 3060 Ti both belong to the same series but the cards are actually not too alike. The RTX 3060 is based on the Ampere GA 106 GPU while the RTX 3060 Ti gets the GA 104 GPU which is also used in the RTX 3070. Both are made with Samsung's 8nm process with the RTX 3060 getting 13.25 billion transistors and the RTX 3060 Ti getting 17.4 billion transistors. Let's take a better look at the specifications of the two cards.

Note: Some specifications of the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3060 Ti like the ports may vary as per AIB models.

The RTX 3060 Ti has the better hardware with a higher number of transistors and a higher core count across the board. While the 3060 Ti is arguably the better card the performance differences seem to be rather thin for the extra asking price. Let's take a better look at how the two cards perform against each other.

Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)

The real-world performance differences between the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3060 Ti will vary as per the specific AIB models' configuration. The RTX 3060 Ti is supposed to be more powerful version of the 3060 so as such the performance is indeed better. However the price difference doesn't quite align with the performance difference. Let's take a look at the performance comparison between the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 VENTUS 2X 12G OC and the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Ventus 3X OC courtesy of the YouTube channel Testing Games.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Game RTX 3060 (avg. FPS 1440p) RTX 3060 Ti (avg. FPS 1440p) Cyberpunk 2077 (RTX On) 37 44 Shadow of the Tomb Raider 47 57 Microsoft Flight Simulator 37 44 Control (RTX On) 56 67 Red Dead Redemption 2 60 72 Assassin's Creed: Valhalla 60 72 Horizon Zero Dawn 65 78

The performance difference between the two GPUs seems to be quite thin barely breaching the double digits with FPS. The RTX 3060 will do great at 1080p and when it comes to 1440p you can see that it hits the 60 FPS figure with less intensive games. However it can fall back to the 30-40 FPS range with the more intensive titles.

The RTX 3060 Ti isn't much better delivering marginally better performance. Had the 1440p performance demonstrated that the card could hit at least 60 FPS with the more intensive titles then it could find itself clearly slotted between the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070. No doubt the RTX 3060 Ti is a pretty good GPU but it's the awkward middle child slotted between two very talented siblings.

Even with ray tracing the performance gains stay within the same proportions making the RTX 3060 Ti a tough card to recommend for the extra premium it demands. If you absolutely had to pick one of the two you would get a better performance per dollar with the RTX 3060.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or RTX 3060 Ti: Which one should you buy?

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the better GPU to buy right now. While the RTX 3060 Ti is a better performer it doesn't quite offer the same value for money. The RTX 3060 sits at the bottom of the RTX 30 range of GPUs but it offers a great price-to-performance ratio. There's very little motivation to spend the extra dollars to get the RTX 3060 Ti.

Regardless if you feel the RTX 3060 is not good enough for your needs making the jump to RTX 3070 seems like the better way to go. It does come with a heftier price tag but as we said in our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review the RTX 3070 is a proper 1440p card which means you will see a sizable performance gain from RTX 3060.

The issue here is that regardless of the model if you want to buy an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU it's not going to be an easy process. The stocks of both the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3060 Ti are very limited right now just like any of the best graphics cards out there. As such finding these two cards at prices close to their starting price tags is going to be very difficult. So if you're going to get one soon make sure you play the waiting game and get one at a price that's close to the retail pricing. Happy next-gen gaming!

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the least money you can spend to get aboard the RTX train right now. It's a solid 1080p GPU that can do some 1440p gaming and you also get a nice peek into ray tracing. It also offers a great value for money and is certainly the 60 series RTX 30 GPU to get right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC1ncHUtbGlxdWlkLW1pbmVyYWwtb2lsLWNvb2xlZC1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1taW5pbmctcmlncy1zcG90dGVkL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC1ncHUtbGlxdWlkLW1pbmVyYWwtb2lsLWNvb2xlZC1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1taW5pbmctcmlncy1zcG90dGVkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU Liquid & Mineral-Oil Cooled Cryptocurrency Mining Rigs Spotted,"We have all seen some crazy cryptocurrency mining rigs but the latest ones take it one step ahead by putting several NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs under premium cooling. Setups have been spotted by I_Leak_VN which shows mining rigs using premium custom-loop kits and even mineral oil to cool off GeForce RTX GPUs.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs Equipped Cryptocurrency Mining Rigs With Premium Custom-Loop & Mineral-Oil Cooling Setups Spotted

The first system that has been pictured includes a total of 10 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. The GeForce RTX 3090 is currently the fastest graphics card for mining cryptocurrency especially ETH (Ethereum). The GPU also requires a lot of cooling to keep it running at a steady phase especially when you're really pushing those 19.5 GDDR6X memory modules 12 on each side of the PCB. The rig is massive and is custom-built to house all graphics cards.

You can see each of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 making use of what seems to be a Bitspower water block based on the backplate and logo. Each card is equipped with a 280mm radiator & has three Super Flower Leadex Titanium 1600W PSUs attached to it. The all aluminum-frame has the GPUs running off riser cables which are attached to the MSI B360-F PRO mining motherboard that allows for up to 18 GPUs at once. All GPUs when loaded up in mining deliver temperatures under 50C which are impressive but also expected given the use of enthusiast-grade cooling.

The second PC is from a cryptocurrency mining setup in Vietnam and the user here is running a total of 8 ASUS GeForce RTX GPUs which are cooled by mineral oil. Mineral-oil cooling has its own advantages over standard liquid cooling and makes sure that all components are cooled at the same rate rather than variable temperatures across GPU VRAM and VRMs. The whole PC is submerged within the cooling liquid and we can also expect lower temperatures when the cards are being run under the cryptocurrency mining operations.

We can also not forget the insane RGB-Lit cryptocurrency mining rig which features 78 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card. You can check out more about that here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vd2h5LXJ4LTY3MDAteHQtYmV0dGVyLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtcnR4LTMwNzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is AMD's RX 6700 XT A Better Card Than Nvidia's RTX 3070,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vd2h5LXJ4LTY3MDAteHQtYmV0dGVyLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtcnR4LTMwNzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWQtcmFkZW9uLXJ4LTY3MDAteHQtdnMtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT vs Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 was awarded five stars in our hands-on review cementing its place on our list of the best graphics cards and ensuring that AMDs latest release the Radeon RX 6700 XT is going to have some hard competition to beat.



The GPU market is understandably volatile right now with gamers scrambling to buy the limited stock before bots and cryptominers sweep them off the shelves (digitally speaking) so getting your hands on either of these products is going to be difficult. But when the dust settles and we eventually see some normality being restored what GPU is best for you?



As the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT has yet to be released we won't know its real-world performance until we can get our hands on one to put it through its paces. Regardless we can still get a good insight into where the strength of each card will be on paper until our review for the latest Radeon family member is published.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT : Price

It should be straightforward to compare the RTX 3070 and RX 6700 XT on their cost with the recommended retail price for the RTX 3070 set at $499 (£469 about AU$700) and the RX 6700 XT sneaking in a little cheaper at $479 (about £340 AU$610).



Given the current market for GPU's however you might as well throw those prices out of the window – we're seeing cards listed for alarmingly inflated prices right now so getting your hands on one at the actual GPU market value will be nothing short of a miracle. We can't tell you what to do but we heavily advise not buying either of these cards for the crazy inflated prices we've been seeing other GPUs listed for online.



We do expect prices to stabilize if stock numbers are replenished and the current cryptocurrency boom ends though so given patience you might be seeing these list prices next to available inventory eventually.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Specs

(Image credit: AMD)

The RTX 3070 is already proving itself as a capable card for gamers. Here are the specifications its packing:

CUDA Cores: 5888

5888 Boost Clock: 1.73GHz

1.73GHz Base Clock: 1.5GHz

1.5GHz VRAM: 8GB GDDR6

8GB GDDR6 Memory Interface: 256-bit

256-bit TDP: 220W

So how will this compare to the Radeon RX 6700 XT? Here are the specs:

CUDA Cores: 2560

2560 Boost Clock: 2.58GHz

2.58GHz Base Clock: 2.3GHz

2.3GHz VRAM: 12GB GDDR6

12GB GDDR6 Memory Interface: 192-bit

192-bit TDP: 230W

The RX 6700 XT is wielding 12GB of VRAM to market itself at gamers looking to play at 1440p with AMD claiming this will future-proof the card as it's starting to see more AAA games exceeding 9GB of VRAM usage. The RTX 3070 on the other hand has 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM which still gives it ample memory to run 4K games.



There's very much a mirror effect happening with these two GPUs. The RX 6700 XT has fast clock speeds but it completely falls flat on CUDA cores with the RTX 3070 have over twice that of its rival.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Performance

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Pitting these cards against each other in terms of performance will be tricky given the RX 6700 XT hasn't even hit the shelves yet but watch this space for updates after we've managed to officially run some benchmarks.



On paper though this is looking to be a close call. We saw during AMD's official benchmark presentations that 1440p max settings show very comparable numbers to the RTX 3070 with both cards seemingly on a level playing field. Suspiciously though these benchmarks didn't appear to include ray tracing performance and early leaks suggest that this is where the Nvidia RTX 3070 will start pulling some serious punches.



This isn't surprising given we've forced hard-to-run titles onto the RTX 3070 and it's taken everything we threw at it like a champ. Both Horizon Zero Dawn and Red Dead Redemption 2 managed to run at a consistent 75fps at 1080p with all settings but the MSAA maxed out so Nvidia's contender has already proven itself more than capable even at 4K in some games.



You shouldn't judge the currently unreleased GPU too harshly yet though as several of these leaks also show the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT could be faster than the RTX 3070 in several titles especially game benchmarks that are optimized for the RDNA 2 architecture.

GeForce RTX 3070 vs Radeon RX 6700 XT: Which should you buy?

This should probably read 'Which can you buy' given the current shortage of GPUs on the market but if you're lucky enough to find yourself in a situation where both are available then we'd suggest the GeForce RTX 3070...for now.



In (albeit unconfirmed) leaked benchmarks for the RX 6700 XT we saw it might be slower than the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti which wouldn't make it worth the $20 saved against the beefier RTX 3070. We won't know for sure of course until we actually get our hands on one but this on top of the current lack of DLSS rival in AMD's offerings means that the Nvidia graphics card is likely to be a better investment for the future when more games utilize the AI framerate booster.



We're keeping our fingers crossed that the Radeon RX 6700 XT can prove itself a worthy investment over the GeForce RTX 3070 but no matter which option you go for you'll be getting some solid performance in the latest AAA titles especially if you're upgrading from older cards like the 1070 Ti or the RX Vega 56.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9NaWNyb3NvZnQtZXllaW5nLXVwLUtvbmFtaS1hbmQtU2VnYS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbnMtdG8tcG9zc2libHktaW52aWdvcmF0ZS13YW5pbmctWGJveC1jb25zb2xlLXNhbGVzLWluLUphcGFuLjUyNzcyNi4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft eyeing up Konami and Sega acquisitions to possibly invigorate waning Xbox console sales in Japan,"Microsoft snapping up Sega is the rumor that will never go away but it now seems that Konami could also be in the sights of the parent company of the Xbox Game Studios. Microsoft could do with a boost in Japan as recent sales figures reported 10 Xbox One consoles sold compared to 78134 Nintendo Switch units.

There’s no denying when it comes to making acquisitions Microsoft and its Xbox Game Studios are not shy about aiming high. The recent purchase of ZeniMax Media the company that owns id Software and Bethesda Softworks for a whopping US$7.5 billion proves that Microsoft is actively and aggressively seeking to enhance its company portfolio and its vital Xbox brand. A popular tech commenter has indicated that the next companies that are being lined up for potential takeovers are the Japanese gaming stalwarts Sega and Konami.

Microsoft and Sega have been linked for decades and the acquisition of the latter by the former has been rumored for many a year. It would make sense for Xbox Game Studios to obtain Sega’s specialist knowledge and experience in the console area and the Tokyo-based firm has certainly struggled over the last years in comparison to its Sega Genesis/Mega Drive heyday. Konami has also been thrown into the mix again and the company would bring along valuable gaming IPs like Silent Hill and Metal Gear with any acquisition.

As usual the believability of the rumors settles on just how important or not the Japanese market is for Microsoft/Xbox. Recent sales figures for the country are pretty dire for the Redmond company: 1508 units of the Xbox Series X and S and just 10 Xbox One consoles sold for the week ending February 27. In comparison for that same week 3249 PS4 consoles were snapped up Japanese gamers bought 33792 PS5 machines and 78134 Nintendo Switch devices were purchased.

Acquiring Konami and Sega would not only make Xbox a stronger brand in Japan but it would also appeal to the millions of fans of the two companies in other areas of the world who happen to own an Xbox console. Both Microsoft head Satya Nadella and Xbox chief Phil Spencer have made it clear that the acquisition of established game developers is the right direction to take so maybe there will be some further studio expansion coming in 2021.

Hair Republic is one of Wilmington's first gender-neutral hair salons. That means customers are charged based on the time and skill a haircut requires regardless of their gender.

A woman who gets a buzz cut for example will pay the same price as a man who gets a buzz cut and a man with shoulder-length hair would pay the same price as a woman with the same style to get his hair trimmed.

At other salons men and women are often charged a different flat rate because of their gender.

Client Hanna Miller 23 of Wilmington said she's noticed getting her long hair cut often costs the same price as friends who have shorter hairstyles. That seems unfair she said.

“If you look at the prices between men’s and women’s haircuts just because it has the women’s label on it it’s already more expensive” she said.

Lundy has been cutting Miller's hair for about a year and a half. She followed Lundy to Hair Republic when the salon opened last year.

The salon worked with Dresscode Project to establish gender-neutral prices Lundy said. Dresscode Project is a global alliance of salons committed to providing positive and gender-affirming services for people who are part of the LGBTQ community according to their website.

Lundy who has worked as a hair stylist in Wilmington for 10 years has clients who identify as transgender and wanted to create a space where they could feel comfortable getting their hair done.

“Getting your hair done is supposed to be a confidence booster"" she said. ""It’s a huge part of how you express yourself so I think it’s a great thing that you can help people do that in a comfortable non-judgemental way.”

Mercedes Meza one of the salon's four stylists said a traditional salon experience can be uncomfortable for some clients.

“We each have clients that identify in different ways and have had to come in the salon and they’re asked ‘Okay are you a man or a woman?’"" she said. ""I feel like that’s just a really intrusive way to start out an appointment.”

Beyond pricing Hair Republic has signs posted throughout the salon emphasizing inclusion and established a gender-neutral bathroom.

“It was just creating a non-judgemental safer place for people to come to” Lundy said.

Gender-neutral pricing is becoming more common as salons and barbershops increasingly recognize the issue Meza said.

New York became the first state to prohibit salons and barbershops from basing the prices of their haircuts on gender when it passed legislation in September.

Miller said she thinks gender-neutral pricing is ""incredibly important"" and hopes the salon will set an example for other Wilmington-area stylists to follow.

Meza agreed saying she hopes gender-neutral salons will become the norm in the future.

“I hope very soon that there is no reason to be making a fuss about it” she said. “I hope that we are one of many that are doing this because it just makes sense.”

Hair Republic is located at 3820 Wrightsville Ave. in Wilmington. For more information on services visit facebook.come.HairRepublicWilmington or call 910-899-4035.

But new evidence reveals that their intelligence services shared a mutual distrust and dislike.

Many Polish journalists describe the relationship between the People's Republic of Poland and the German Democratic Republic until the fall of the Berlin Wall as a ""forced friendship."" Even if the rulers of both countries celebrated their harmonious alliance in public behind the scenes there was a profound distrust between Warsaw and East Berlin.

Many Poles considered their neighbors on the Western side of the Oder River as potentially dangerous ""red Prussians"" while East Germans considered their Polish comrades as unreliable allies whose liberal reforms put the whole Communist bloc at risk.

For a long time it was believed that the relationship between the countries' secret services was an exception to this rule: The fact that both agencies shared a common enemy in the West meant they were supposed to cooperate closely.

According to new archive evidence this was not the case: While the rivalry between the two countries was palpable on a political and social level it was considerably more apparent in intelligence.

In his book entitled ""Von einer Freundschaft die es nicht gab. Das Ministerium für Staatssicherheit der DDR und das polnische Innenministerium 1974-1990"" in German (""About a friendship that didn't exist: The State Security Ministry in the GDR and the Polish Interiror Ministry from 1974-1990"") the Polish political scientist Tytus Jaskulowski from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) dispels some of the myths that continued to exist long after the collapse of communism.

""The GDR's Stasiwas considered to be a powerful institution with tremendous intelligence and operative capacities capable of infiltrating and influencing Polish life. The Polish Interior Ministry for its part was considered to be weak and no match for the Stasi [short for the East German state security ministry]. Despite this the cooperation between the two institutions was thought to be comparably harmonious"" Jaskulowski told DW. ""But new archive findings have dispelled the myth.""

Solidarnosc scared the Stasi

The series of strikes that took place on Poland's Baltic coast in the summer of 1980 and led to the emergence of the Solidarnosc (Solidarity) trade union marked a turning point in the relationship. The East Berlin leadership thought that the developments in Poland represented an existential threat to its existence and that of the whole Eastern Bloc.

Stasi head Erich Mielke and his entourage were stricken with panic by the attempts of Poland's communist leadership to find a compromise with Solidarnosc. GDR politicians accused their Polish comrades of being weak and yielding to ""anti-socialist enemies.""

Polish workers went on strike in 1980 which led to the formation of an independent union Image: picture-alliance/dpa/L. Oy

Therefore there was a great deal of relief in East Berlin when the Polish government introduced martial law on December 13 1981. But the Stasi doubted that this would resolve the crisis. On December 14 Mielke issued a series of orders outlining steps to be taken against Poland. One order was given the codename ""Besinnung"" (""reflection”) and put Poland in the same category as West Germany and other Western countries: Poland was declared an ""Operational Area"" and thus an enemy.

The Stasi had already set up the Warsaw Operations Group (OGW) within the GDR's embassy in the Polish capital. Its staff members were tasked not only with preventing GDR citizens from escaping to the West but also with spying on Poland.

Fewer spies in Poland than estimated

After the strikes of 1981 East Germany tried to recruit more spies who could report on what was going on east of the Oder River the border with Poland. After the fall of communism it was estimated that the Stasi had at least 1500 IMs (""Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter"" or unofficial informers) in Poland. Later this number was revised to 200. Jaskulowski guesses there were about 100 sources but only a dozen GDR IMs were able to carry out complicated operations such as infiltrating Solidarnosc circles.

Jaskulowski pointed out that Mielke and his colleagues became increasingly arrogant with regard to building up contacts in Poland. They strengthened conservative forces in the apparatus of Poland's ruling Communist Party and were very open about their misgivings about more liberal comrades.

Erich Mielke (center right congratulating football champions in 1987) headed the Stasi for more than 30 years Image: Imago/Camera 4

The Polish side could do little to resist considering they were often in a position of having to ask favors as a result of the deep economic crisis Poland found itself in. The Polish Interior Ministry asked its East German counterpart for support to develop its stock of batons rubber truncheons and shields as well as shoes socks and warm underwear. There was nothing in the shops at the time.

Poland takes revenge

The Poles took their revenge for the humiliation that the Stasi had subjected them to after the transition to democracy in Poland. In the summer of 1989 East Germans crossing the border into Poland in order to reach the West German Embassy in Warsaw were allowed in by Polish border guards despite binding agreements with East Germany.

These East German refugees arrived in West German Helmstedt via Warsaw in October 1989 Image: Bernd Von Jutrczenka/dpa/picture alliance

Warsaw did not react to the protests from East Berlin. In early 1990 when Mielke was behind bars awaiting trial General Czeslaw Kiszczak who was still interior minister wrote a telegram congratulating his new GDR counterpart Peter-Michael Diestel the head of the Stasi's successor the ""Office for National Security.""

The Stasi which had always been better equipped in terms of staff logistics and funds than Poland's secret service had now lost ""everything that could be lost"" explained Jaskulowski. ""As opposed to their Polish colleagues the Stasi people were incapable of understanding the world as it was because of their ideological narrow-mindedness.""

Though German-Polish relations flourished after 1991 the secret services of both countries continued to distrust each other. In 1993 a Polish officer was convicted of spying for Germany. German diplomats were reportedly expelled after allegations of spying.

In 2013 at the height of the spy row with the US German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that ""spying on friends was not on at all."" Jaskulowski is more realistic: ""Spying on friends was and is tolerated in politics. However this tolerance has limits.""

Our muscles atrophy our eyes deteriorate we DVR every episode of “NCIS.”

But there’s another often overlooked price of getting older: We start to lose our sense of humor.

And this downside — known as “the humor cliff” — can have terrible consequences for our personal and professional lives.

We’re all going over it “together tumbling down into the abyss of solemnity below” write the authors of the new book “Humor Seriously” (Currency) out now.

Most of us go over that cliff at age 23. That’s when according to a 2013 Gallup survey of 1.4 million people in 166 countries the frequency in which we laugh or smile in a given day begins to plummet.

“It’s global and it’s disheartening” Jennifer Aaker one of the book’s authors told The Post.

“That was our main question: Why is this happening” added co-author Naomi Bagdonas.

Aaker is a behavioral-science professor at Stanford. Bagdonas is a leadership coach. Together they teach a class called Humor: Serious Business at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business that aims to instruct students “how to use humor and levity to transform their future organizations and lives.”

5 Jokes aren’t just for kids. Research shows humor can improve work relationships and a culture of openness. Alamy

In some ways the humor cliff makes sense. Childhood is often carefree. Adulthood often isn’t. The average 4-year-old the authors write laughs as many as 300 times a day. The average 40-year-old will take two and a half months to log that many chuckles.

The culprit just might be your job.

“We grow up enter the workforce and suddenly become ‘serious and important people’ trading laughter for ties and pantsuits” the authors write. “Before long we lose levity entirely in a sea of bottom lines slide decks and mind-numbing conference calls.”

After surveying more than 700 workers across various industries the authors found that in the pursuit of “professionalism” many people are afraid to show off their sense of humor as well as more of their true personality at work each day.

Aaker and Bagdonas have pinpointed four reasons why.

The first believed by a “large portion” of respondents is the feeling that humor “simply had no place amid serious work.”

“In fact we find this isn’t the case” Bagdonas says. “Humor is a really powerful way to come across as more authentic more human. It’s not in opposition to seriousness. It can reduce stress and foster collaboration.”

What’s more a survey of hundreds of executives conducted by Robert Half International and Hodge-Cronin & Associates found that a staggering 98 percent of them preferred employees who had a sense of humor and that 84 percent believed employees with a sense of humor did better work.

5 Studies show that we start laughing more frequently in our twilight years. One reason could be that we’re no longer working. Alamy

The second reason many are afraid to be funny at work is that they have a “deep paralyzing” fear that their joke will fall flat.

But in one study researchers found that deploying humor even if it doesn’t draw laughs will still signal confidence competence and status — as long as the joke is appropriate. (More on appropriateness in a second.)

The third fear holding us back is that “there’s this misperception that in order to leverage humor you have to be funny” Aaker says.

It’s not about being Will Ferrell in the conference room but “about creating a culture where people’s senses of humor are welcome and people are welcome to bring a broader sense of themselves to work” Aaker says.

One study by a researcher named Wayne Decker discovered that managers who had a sense of humor — never mind if they were funny themselves — were rated by their subordinates as 23 percent more respected 25 percent more pleasant to work with and 17 percent friendlier.

Lastly you can also shelve the misconception that a sense of humor is either something you’re born with or not.

“Each of us has a unique sense of humor and it’s a muscle we can develop” Bagdonas says.

5 NY Post/Mike Guillen

Start developing it if you haven’t already. Laughter is good for our mental health releasing a “cocktail of hormones that make us feel happier” the authors write.

“It’s like exercising meditating and having sex at the same time at least to our brains” Aaker says.

But most of all not falling off that humor cliff at age 23 could pay major dividends in your working life.

Research by Brad Bitterly Maurice Schweitzer and Alison Wood Brooks asked participants to rate a travel presentation. Half of the presentations were straight the other half contained a throwaway joke at the end. The jokey presenters were perceived as “5 percent more competent 11 percent more confident and 37 percent higher in status.”

Each of us has a unique sense of humor and it’s a muscle we can develop. co-author Naomi Bagdonas

In the same study when participants were asked to pick a team leader the person who’d made the joke was “significantly more likely to be chosen.”

When it comes to sales another experiment by researchers Karen O’Quin and Joel Aronoff asked participants to negotiate with a research assistant posing as an art dealer for a piece of art. The study found that participants were willing to pay a price that was 18 percent higher if the “dealer” added the dumb joke “My final offer is X … and I’ll throw in my pet frog.”

Humor is also good for office bonding. Laughter releases oxytocin the so-called trust hormone and helps solidify closeness.

To test this out researchers Alan Gray Brian Parkinson and Robin Dunbar had two strangers sit together and watch a 5-minute video clip. Half of the participants got a funny blooper reel from a popular TV show. The other half got boring footage fit for a nature channel documentary.

The researchers then asked each participant to write a message to the person they’d sat next to. Those who’d watched the laugh-inducing footage disclosed “significantly more personal information” than those who hadn’t.

Humor also enhances creativity by helping us see connections “we previously missed and making us feel psychologically safe enough to share our risky or unconventional ideas.”

What’s more it reduces stress in the moment fostering resilience.

Of course humor can also be a minefield. Just ask comedian Kevin Hart who lost a gig hosting the 2018 Oscars after jokey-but-homophobic tweets resurfaced.

The authors suggest you evaluate every joke for whether it’s telling too harsh a truth whether it touches on too painful a subject and whether there’s enough distance from the pain to laugh about.

Laughing now after what has been an especially hard year for many may seem “superficial or silly or not appropriate” Aaker says “but that’s actually when we need humor the most.”

“The place to go for humor right now is in areas for shared humanity and vulnerability” Bagdonas says. “It’s not about making fun of COVID it’s making fun of the reality that we’re all cooped up in our homes when the walls are crumbling in on us.”

So what should you do if you feel yourself slipping off that humor cliff?

The first step the authors suggest is to take a humor audit. During a week take note of when you laughed what made you laugh and also when you made someone else laugh.

The exercise could help train your mind to better recognize opportunities for humor. You can also learn to be “more generous with your laughter” Aaker said.

“It has this extraordinary impact on your physical health” she adds. “It also makes others feel good. At a moment in time when we need to cultivate a culture of inclusivity and make others feel valued in more thoughtful ways shared laughter is an incredible tool that we’re simply not using. And it’s free.”

While most people fall off the humor cliff at 23 — and keep falling and falling — research shows that changes as we become elderly and start laughing more frequently.

One reason could be that we’re no longer working. Surveys show that people laugh more on weekends than workdays to begin with and in retirement every day is a weekend. Another possibility is that humor in old age “is a way of building bonds and making memories” Aaker says.

The bottom line is don’t keep falling off the humor cliff in the name of imagined professionalism. Bring a sense of humor to work and sprinkle in more of your personality … before it’s too late.

“My mom worked at a hospice” Aaker says. “What people were often saying on the last days of their life was I wish I didn’t take myself so seriously.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9iZXJuYXJkc3ZpbGxlLWFuZC1iZWRtaW5zdGVyL3NlY3Rpb25zL2FydHMtYW5kLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmVybmFyZHN2aWxsZS1wb29sLXJhdGVzLXRvLXJpc2UtNC1zdW1tZXItY2FtcC1saWtlbHktdG8tYmUtaGFsZi1kYXktb25sedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernardsville Pool Rates to Rise 4%; Summer Camp Likely to be Half Day Only,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/bernardsville-and-bedminster/sections/arts-and-entertainment/articles/bernardsville-pool-rates-to-rise-4-summer-camp-likely-to-be-half-day-only on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9iZXJuYXJkc3ZpbGxlLWFuZC1iZWRtaW5zdGVyL3NlY3Rpb25zL2FydHMtYW5kLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmVybmFyZHN2aWxsZS1wb29sLXJhdGVzLXRvLXJpc2UtNC1zdW1tZXItY2FtcC1saWtlbHktdG8tYmUtaGFsZi1kYXktb25sedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldHJvd2VzdGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2ZyYW1pbmdoYW0tYnJvb2tsaW5lLWZvb3RiYWxsLzQ2ODA0NzUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Framingham Brookline football,"SPORTS

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaC5lZHUvdW5odG9kYXkvMjAyNC8wNS9lbGl6YWJldGgtcy1jaGlsdG9uLW5hbWVkLTIxc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50LXVuaXZlcnNpdHktbmV3LWhhbXBzaGlyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth S. Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs."

A Definition of Salesforce SDLC for Solution Architects

The #1 challenge to Salesforce architects developers and delivery managers today is to produce results faster.

As I write more about the Salesforce Software Developer Lifecycle (SDLC) in order to help advance this engineering practice I need to set some ground rules on how to classify the terms software vendors and actors that make up the Salesforce SDLC ecosystem. I will wrap up this nomenclature tutorial with some practical guidance on how to build an SDLC implementation.

Salesforce SDLC – What Is That?

The term Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC) represents the entire practice of software delivery management. If you are reading this then you are (or wish to be!) an architect for a major software project tasked with fulfilling the functional goals of an enterprise program. That program is likely to have many stakeholders including customers investors enterprise staff and project staff.

Based on those criteria an SDLC implementation must encompass the software tools systems people and best practices used by all the stakeholders of the program to achieve the delivery of the software’s functionality to the enterprise.

The Pipeline Model But Faster

But how do you build an SDLC implementation using devops engineering? The premise of SDLC as a software pipeline is simple. It starts when a developer commits new code to a source code repository. The invoked processes compile test secure and assemble deployment artifacts. Docker containers and Salesforce change set are deployment artifacts.

One cycle of the SDLC process completes when the artifact deploys to a production environment. When running at “devops speed” daily deployments to production should be possible.

Most discussions about SDLC involve a version of this flow diagram.

The flow diagram is deceptively simple because an SDLC implementation is usually extraordinarily complex. The flow diagram does not guide an architect towards a solution.

Time to Stack the Salesforce SDLC Solution

Another way to study SDLC is to group the tools and actors by ascending levels of functionality and descending levels of granularity like a TCP/IP or OSI networking architecture stack.

© 2021 by Vernon Keenan

Here are the explanations of these layers including examples of tools and actors starting from the bottom and going up the stack.

Repositories & Release Management – This stack component is usually a Git-compatible server that supports branching and pull requests for code review and release management. In the case of Salesforce the artifact repository is frequently a sandbox or developer org instead of a “real” repository. GitHub is the leading commercial platform for repository management.

Building a Salesforce SLDC Solution

Now for the interesting part. How does one construct an SDLC pipeline? That is a question with a thousand possible answers. Allow me to simplify it by taking a high-level look at how all the pieces could be networked together.

Here is a sample solution. Using maximum security precautions all the project development resources are hosted within the enterprise security perimeter. All public-facing production services are hosted by Salesforce or a public cloud.

An Internet Gateway governs traffic between the enterprise network the Internet Salesforce and the public clouds. Deployment artifacts will include Salesforce change sets and Docker containers.

Let us examine the remaining parts one-by-one:

Enterprise Data Center – The enterprise data center must offer ephemeral compute resources to devops engineering and host any access points into legacy systems.

– The enterprise data center must offer ephemeral compute resources to devops engineering and host any access points into legacy systems. Developer Work Environment – Modern developer workstations are built around Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Working on Salesforce or the public clouds also requires installing and configuring various command line interfaces (CLIs) leading to complicated workstation setups. One way to solve this problem to use VS Code Remote SSH or Containers. This enables developers to use a pre-configured and powerful backend service to augment their work.

Enterprise Devops Resources – Devops services may be purchased as SaaS services on the Internet or hosted internally using secure enterprise resources. Source Code & Release Management Repository – If you choose to not use public GitHub for your source code repository and code release management there are many choices for self-hosted options including GitHub Enterprise. Deployment Artifact Server – This is your private Docker repository. For Salesforce managing deployment artifacts is trickier and falls into the realm of metadata backup and management. Private Docker repository services are available on AWS GCP and Azure. Command Server – This is the server that hosts your CI/CD command and control processes. In the course of its duties the command server directs other devops servers Salesforce or the public clouds to initiate actions. For example the command server receives a message from the source code repository that a new commit has occurred. Next the CI/CD system allocates compute resources for a runner process which in turn runs scripts to test compile build and save a new deployment artifact. That artifact is ultimately deployed to Salesforce or the public clouds by the control server. A SaaS product that performs the control server function is TeamCity from JetBrains. Observability Server – Devops engineering depends on knowing what is going on in the networked systems and to have a good alerting system in place when things go wrong. Observability is well-developed skill in traditional devops using open-source tools like the ELK stack or Prometheus. AML Server – The resources used to implement project management and application lifecycle management software such as Jira/Confluent.

Drilling rig at Velizy-Villacoublay France (source: Engie Solutions)

Alexander Richter 13 Mar 2021

In a successful collaboration French Engie Solutions Schlumberger and SMP Drilling drilled the first multilateral well for a geothermal project in France.

Earlier this year we reported on the successful drilling campaign for the geothermal heating project by ENGIE Solutons in Vélizy-Villacoublay France.

In the collaboration for the project ENGIE Solutions Schlumberger and SMP Drilling completed drilling of a 1600-meter deep well to enable an innovative heating solution for the city. The multilateral well design which is the first of its kind for a geothermal application in France was drilled using the PowerDrive Archer* high build rate rotary steerable (RSS) system and AxeBlade (TM) ridged diamond element bit.

The geothermal well will enable the French city’s heating network Vélidis to provide heating and hot water supply to 16000 homes with more than 60% renewable energy. In the long term this heating solution is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 22801 tons each year.

“Schlumberger has the ambition to play a leading role in the energy transition by leveraging more than 90 years of expertise in advanced technologies associated with the exploration and production of energy” said Olivier Peyret Schlumberger Chairman France & New Energy Europe Director. “Geothermal energy is a resource that has extraordinary advantages both in terms of its efficiency and its ability to reduce our impact on the environment. We are particularly proud to have contributed to this project which demonstrates the importance of working within the framework of an ecosystem where everyone contributes their know-how for the benefit of a successful energy transition.”

“ENGIE Solutions has invested more than EUR 300 million in the sector in 10 years and carried out 20 low-energy geothermal drilling operations over the same period” underlines Aurélie Lehericy Deputy Managing Director of ENGIE Solutions Villes & Collectivités.

“It is a source of pride for us to support the City of Vélizy-Villacoublay in this particularly exemplary project; the drilling results speak for themselves. With Schlumberger our partner on this project we have mobilized all our know-how and our technological resources serving both the future comfort of the Véliziens and the region’s energy transition.”

The drilling project comprised a multilateral reservoir section with high dogleg severity (DLS) in the curves where the main wellbore branches off into three distinct boreholes. The individual borehole branches intersect the producing zones of the reservoir multiple times thus improving the well’s overall productivity. The well profile design enhances the potential of geothermal fabrics containing water (known as aquifers) promoting the recovery of water at 65 degrees Celsius and providing a heat output of more than 16 MW.

The PowerDrive system which is well-suited for high-DLS wells enabled this innovative geothermal well profile effectively doubling the original production capacity by reaching up to 400 m3/h. The fit-for-basin AxeBlade bit contributed to delivery of the reservoir section ahead of schedule.

The firm — which makes automation software — launched new AI updates and low-code capabilities on its platform earlier this week that greatly expand its range of services.

While ServiceNow initially focused on customer IT and employee processes with an organization these launches allow users to create custom workflows on the platform.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We can look at all the things that are common across every company and we can build workflows for those or we can ship those out as products"" said Dave Wright ServiceNow's chief innovation officer. ""But every company is going to have its own unique workflows that are very specific to their business.""

Hence the new customization features.

The updates are meant to help customers innovate faster and be more productive Wright said which is more crucial than ever because of the pandemic. With the new low code tools companies can essentially automate any workflow which is especially important when people are working in different locations or time zones.

The new low-code tools — called App Engine Studio and App Engine Templates — help users create a workflow without using any code. App Engine Studio uses a largely drag-and-drop interface to guide someone through building an app while the templates provide the basics for common use cases that customers can customize.

""This is really about putting innovation in the hands of every employee across the enterprise"" Wright said.

The use cases for customers are broad Wright said. For example the city of Los Angeles an existing customer used the low code tools to develop an app in 72 hours to track COVID testing.

ServiceNow which had a market cap of $96 billion as of Friday afternoon also released new AI capabilities powered by two companies it acquired in the last two years: Loom.ai in early 2020 and Attivio in late 2019. When ServiceNow acquires companies it ""replatforms"" the technology to fit into ServiceNow's existing system with the aim of giving customers a seamless experience.

New features include predictive event management which helps users anticipate potential problems and automate resolutions and a personalized search function that suggests most-likely results.

ServiceNow has been on a mission to ramp up its AI offerings: Last year it named its first chief artificial intelligence officer Vijay Narayanan a Microsoft and Pinterest veteran who is now leading about 300 technologists Insider previously reported.

It also acquired Passage AI a Silicon Valley conversational AI company; Sweagle a Belgium-based data management firm; and Element AI an AI company based in Montreal.

Technology from those AI acquisitions will be seen in the platform soon.

""As we do these acquisitions it takes us a while to replatform"" Wright said. ""But we never end up with things that are bolted on the side or are not swapping data between systems.""

The colors in your home can create a rejuvenating environment that improves your mood or outlook. Each year the leading paint manufacturers announce their most inspiring color and color palettes of the year. Not surprisingly each manufacturer this year selected hues for homes that evoke comfort and optimism.

Ultimate Gray and Illuminating. A solid dependable shade and a bright lemon yellow is the dynamic duo that serves as Pantone colors of the year. The classic color paired with the shining standout hue is sure to invite warmth and comfort into any space. Color trend analysts at Pantone say the two colors exude “A message of happiness supported by fortitude…we need to feel that everything is going to get brighter – this is essential to the human spirit.”

Urbane Bronze. Sherwin Williams also opted for a more resilient tone with its strong neutral Urbane Bronze. The inspiration for this year says Sherwin Williams was a focus on finding sanctuary within your home “As we’re looking to create the ultimate retreat for reflection and renewal we’re turning to a hue whose natural simplicity and nature-inspired energy cultivate a sense of calm from the ground up.” Rooted in nature the hue mixes well with other biophilic elements to help bring the outdoors in and create a sense of relaxation and serenity.

Aegean Teal. Reflection and renewal played a role in Benjamin Moore’s selection Aegean Teal. While the name may be a standout the calming blue-green provides a sense of stability and tranquility to combat the chaos of the past year. Benjamin Moore describes the choice which “Creates natural harmony and invites us to reflect and reset…rooted in the elegant handspun textures of the home… the palette comforts as it uplifts.”

Transcend Big Cypress and Misty Aqua. This trio of colors from PPG is a healthy blend of earth tones and tranquil blues as its signature “Be Well” color palette for 2021. PPG’s hues for your home evokes a similar theme to other paint manufacturers this year of embracing comfort and style. The colors “showcase natural hues that are comforting compassionate and optimistic… celebrates beauty of all kinds and relates to those who prioritize wellness in mind body and spirit” says PPG.

First Mennonite Church and Lighthouse Ministries at 1931 Third St. SE have entered into a partnership with Bethel University a private liberal arts university in Mishawaka Indiana near the University of Notre Dame.

The goal local organizers say is to make college more accessible more affordable and less overwhelming for first-generation college students people who live in the community and others who might prefer a smaller venue than a traditional campus.

Canton is part of a national initiative being launched by Bethel University said Darin Nissley longtime executive director of Lighthouse Ministries an after-school youth outreach.

""I think it's fully amazing"" he said. ""Their flexibility is really impressive.""

The Rev. Sean Swanson First Mennonite senior pastor said Bethel approached him last July about hosting a campus. He and his wife Ally are Bethel University alumni.

Swanson who has been at First Mennonite since 2016 completed a five-year bachelor's/master's program in Christian ministries at Bethel.

""They emphasized the role of the community through the college experience. I was really shaped by that"" he said.

Jamie Szittai White the new director of higher education said Canton is one of 15 remote campuses Bethel University is opening this fall. She said that five people have applied for admission so far with a goal of about 15 for the first year.

Student-centered

""They're really amping up the game with extension sites"" she said. ""An approachable viable option for Christian education is a great goal. It's not necessarily about numbers which is a relief. It's about caring about the student. It's very relationship-based which has been amazing.""

Nissley said the initiative ensures that college doesn't have to be intimidating.

""A good number of students who choose this program may not be sure they're ready for a bigger school"" he said. ""This program offers an incredibly supportive environment for that student who wants to step into a higher degree.""

Through the initiative Bethel University is offering associate degrees in general studies ministry leadership and pre-education studies and bachelor's degrees in business administration business marketing cybersecurity multidisciplinary studies ministry leadership and behavioral and social sciences.

Szittai White said the university will offer a combination of e-learning and live-streamed classes from the main campus which she said should help students feel like a part of the main campus.

""It's very cohort-based"" she said. ""It's also structured to make sure the work gets done.""

Nissley said students will have a required set of hours to attend classes in person.

The curriculum also will include internships.

""For me running Lighthouse it's just very evident that unfortunately a lot of students from this neighborhood enter the job market and it's really hard for them to get their foot in the door for interviews"" he said. ""Bethel is expanding its vision so that when students graduate they have that slip of paper and experience.""

The organizers say there are hopes that as the student body grows local adjunct professors can be hired to teach classes. Once the campus reaches 50 students Bethel will hire a full-time staff director to assist Szittai White.

There also are plans to add a degree program each year Nissley said.

Nissley and Szittai White said they've been reaching out to churches and other community organizations. At least four companies have expressed interest in providing internships.

Nissley said there have been two offers to provide scholarships for books and Szittai White said the J.M. Smucker Co. has donated some laptops.

Szittai White said college can be intimidating and that the extended campus enables students to have a ready source of support. The DeHoff Library which is next door to the church also is partnering with the ministries to help Bethel students with workforce development.

Supportive environment

""A lot of students don't even know how to apply for student aid"" she said. ""Here you have me you have Darin and you have Sean.""

Szittai White said that when it comes to Christian-education costs Bethel University is competitive with a yearly tuition of $10000 a year.

""That's not including Pell Grants which are $6500"" she said. ""It makes it very affordable to get a credentialed degree.""

Nissley said it's time for Christian education to reinvent itself.

""The cost gets in the way"" he said. ""Christian colleges can get stuck in the idea that things can only be done in a certain way. Bethel is giving us the freedom to create a campus in our own way.""

Szittai White said the university's flexibility is a big asset.

""They're great in that we're able to cater to our culture"" she said.

Swanson said Bethel University recognizes that some potential students have formidable barriers to college.

""What they're able to do is bring the campus to the neighborhood so they can have the college experience"" he said. ""If you're a first-generation college student just being on campus is a crazy world; add to that the Christian subculture. It can be really crazy.""

The three are optimistic that the campus will become a viable option for local students.

""College doesn't have to be intimidating"" Nissley said. ""A good number of students who choose this program may not be sure they're ready for a bigger school. This program offers an incredibly supportive environment for that student who wants to step into a higher degree.""

Jennifer Lopez has shared a snap of her daughter Emme crying while on a video call with ex-husband Marc Anthony.

The singer took to Instagram Stories to share the emotional screengrab taken from her FaceTime conversation which saw Emme 13 cuddling up to her father Marc 52.

‘When they are sad but momma and daddy are there #Coconuts’ she wrote. ‘I Love You!! So Proud of You… (sic)’

Jennifer 51 split from Marc in 2011 after seven years of marriage with the pair filing for divorce in April 2012. Alongside Emme they also share her twin brother Max.

It comes after it was reported that Jennifer and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez are still very much together despite speculation they had ended their engagement.

The couple who first got together in 2017 were thought to have called time on their relationship with intense speculation surrounding the reason why.

However according to TMZ JLo and A-Rod are still together and are said to be ‘working through things’.

‘All the reports are inaccurate’ the publication states they said. ‘We are working through some things.’

TMZ has also been told the ‘things’ they’re working on ‘have nothing to do with a third party’.

The showbiz world was rocked on Friday when reports of their split emerged.

According to sources from Page Six the couple had recently broken up as they claimed: ‘He’s [Alex] now in Miami getting ready for baseball season and she’s filming her movie in the Dominican Republic.

The two who got engaged in 2019 had been photographed hugging in the Dominican Republic just last month where the Jenny On The Block singer had been shooting for Shotgun Wedding.

Jennifer and Alex have already had to postpone their wedding twice due to the pandemic (Picture: Getty Images)

The couple have been planning to tie the knot but had to push their wedding back twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Jennifer revealed in December: ‘We had to cancel the wedding… because of Covid because of the quarantine. And we actually did it twice which people don’t know.’

She added to Andy Cohen on Sirius XM that they’d even discussed not getting married at all: ‘We’ve both been married before it’s like do we get married? Do we not? What does it mean for us?

‘It comes down to like personal what do you want to do? There’s definitely no rush though.’

It comes after John and Ella's TikTok 'Scott's Slide' video went viral in recent weeks as they recreated his iconic dance scene from Grease which aired originally as a Super Bowl ad for Scott's Miracle-Gro.

Ella also shared the video as she wrote 'Some dads know how to dance and some dads are @johntravolta.'

Kelly 57 kept her two-year battle with breast cancer private as her rep said in a statement: 'She had been undergoing medical treatment for some time supported by her closest family and friends.'

James Quinn suffered serious injuries to his face and hands when he was repeatedly hacked at by the blade fiend son of a former footie ace in Rutherglen Lanarkshire around 9pm on Tuesday night.

5 James Quinn shared a gory hospital pic after being attacked by the sword-wielding son of an ex-Scotland star

The 30-year-old previously jailed for eight years for his part in a gang knife attack posted a selfie from Glasgow Royal Infirmary following the street brawl.

Quinn wearing a hospital gown with his arm in a sling showed off the huge scar running from the top of his head to his nose.

It is understood he posted the gory pic on social media to let his pals know he was fine. It has since been shared widely on WhatsApp.

5 Quin is believed to be dating his attacker's ex

Locals claimed the furious sword rammy erupted as part of an ongoing feud over a girl.

The knifeman was filmed challenging and goading his rival to fight outside a block of flats while waving a huge blade around as the love triangle burst into violence.

The ned whose dad was capped by Scotland and starred for two top flight clubs boasted he was from Castlemilk Glasgow pitched up at the tenement in nearby Rutherglen shouting: ""Come out to play chicken.""

After shouting ""I'm not having this anymore"" Quinn runs out the close before they violently brawl in the street.

It's thought the aggressor was stabbed twice while Quinn suffered a fractured skull.

It's believed the attacker's ex is now dating Quinn - but the aggressor also claimed his gran's address had been shared by his love rival.

The assailant also survived a vicious knife attack when he was a teenager.

A local said: ""Nobody was surprised to hear who the cause of all this trouble was he's a well known menace.

""The local chat is that it's over a girl but bizarrely it may have been fuelled by the man in the flat telling folk the attacker's gran's address.

""The gran gets a mention during the video. But these aren't wee neds the assailant is in his late 20s.

""It's pathetic but it could have easily ended up in two men dying in the street after a sword fight.""

Speaking about the hospital pic a source told the Daily Record: “Quinn sent the picture out on his social media to tell people he was not badly hurt in the fight. It was circulated around loads of people in Rutherglen.

“There will be repercussions to this. It’s a feud that has been going on and on and there will be more violence.”

Quinn was sentenced to eight years at Glasgow's High Court in 2009 for trying to kill Gary Walker 33.

After the attack Detective Constable Jennifer Thirtle of Cambuslang Police Station said: “Our enquiries into this incident are ongoing and we would urge anyone who may have seen or heard a disturbance around 9pm on Tuesday evening to get in touch.

“In addition we would be keen to speak to anyone who may have seen anybody acting suspiciously or loitering in the area around Greenhill Road before the incident took place.”

""Any information can be passed on by calling 101 quoting 3123 of March 9 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.""

Civil rights and activist groups are turning up the pressure on large Georgia companies like Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines to oppose sweeping voting restrictions proposed by Republican state legislators.

""We've got the power of organized people. They've got the power of organized money. And between us and them we could put pressure on these legislators or worst case scenario the governor to kill these bills"" Cliff Albright co-founder of Black Voters Matter told CNBC.

Groups including Black Voters Matter the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP on Friday launched the next phase of their campaign in local press and on social media asking supporters to directly contact CEOs presidents and headquarters of major Georgia-based corporations. They're urging them to speak out publicly against the proposed voting restrictions and to stop donating money to the Republican legislators sponsoring the bills.

The voter restriction bills come after historic turnout from Georgia voters — particularly from Black voters and voters of color — during the November general and January runoff elections where Republicans lost the presidential and U.S. Senate races for the first time in decades.

""It's very very disappointing after the outpouring of civic engagement all across the state that the legislature would then seek to make it more difficult for Georgia citizens to participate in choosing their elected officials"" Andrea Young executive director of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said in an interview.

Republican lawmakers in March passed a bill in the state Senate that would eliminate no-excuse absentee voting and in the House that would limit weekend early voting increase ID requirements for absentee voting and restrict ballot drop boxes: SB 241 and HB 531. These proposed restrictions would disproportionately harm Black voters an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found.

Advocacy groups are turning to Georgia's powerful business community because they say trying to sway GOP lawmakers alone has little effect.

""These companies employ hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters who are going to directly be impacted by these laws"" Nse Ufot CEO of the New Georgia Project told CNBC. ""Voter suppression is not good for business.""

The coalition is focusing on six of the biggest companies in Georgia — Aflac  Coca-Cola  Delta Airlines  Home Depot  Southern Company and UPS — with full-page ads demonstrations and text banks. A March 3 investigation by Popular Information found the six corporations gave a combined $190800 to co-sponsors of HB 531 and SB 241 since 2018.

The activists' work seems to be seeing some results. Business boosters have come out against certain provisions in the proposed voter restrictions since advocates started their pressure campaign.

The Georgia Chamber of Commerce previously reiterated the importance of voting rights without voicing opposition against any specific legislation. In a new statement to CNBC the Georgia Chamber said it has ""expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access"" and ""continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state.""

Dave Williams SVP of public policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce said in a statement Monday: ""Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.""

The Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce told CNBC in a statement: ""As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the 'Urgency' to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is 'RIGHT'; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are 'OPPOSED'. And GGBCC represents them.""

Most of the corporations have not taken a stance in the voting rights debate instead offering broad stances on voting and elections. All six companies belong to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and all but Aflac belong to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.

Aflac  Coca-Cola Delta  Home Depot and UPS reiterated their support for fair and secure elections and equal voter participation in statements to CNBC. Southern Company did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Georgia corporations have come out strongly against legislation in the past like a ""religious liberty"" bill in 2016 that would have allowed discrimination against same-sex couples. They've also mostly stood silent in other debates like a ""heartbeat"" anti-abortion bill in 2019 that was ruled unconstitutional in 2020.

Conservative Georgia lawmakers in the past have punished Georgia corporations for certain political moves. Republican legislators killed a major airline tax break after Delta pulled discounts for a National Rifle Association members.

CNBC has reached out to the Georgia Senate and House Republican Caucuses for comment on the corporate accountability campaigns.

Voting rights activists are not impressed with the statements companies have offered so far on the voting rights debate.

""We need a full throated repudiation of these bills"" New Georgia Project's Ufot said. ""What is your affirmation of how important democracy is when you are witnessing democracy being attacked and you're silent about it?""

Jerry Gonzalez chief executive of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials compared the bills to the notorious voting restrictions that kept people of color from casting ballots in the South before the civil rights movement ushered in the Voting Rights Act in the 1960s.

""We have been talking to business partners and chambers of commerce to get them to step up"" Gonzalez told CNBC. ""Many of them have taken a strong stand on racial justice issues. Well this is a Jim Crow voting rights attack that is happening right now.""

Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said business leaders should take an unequivocal stance against the proposed voting restrictions in Georgia and other states on a Tuesday call with voting rights organizations Fair Fight Action which she founded and More Than A Vote founded by NBA superstar LeBron James The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

""There should be no silence from the business community when anyone in power is trying to strip away the right to vote from the people"" Abrams said on the call. ""There should be a hue and cry.""

Bernice King the daughter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said Wednesday she wrote a letter urging CEOs of Georgia-based corporations to oppose the bills and to use their influence with Georgia state legislators to block restrictive legislation.

""It's not going to be business as usual"" Black Voters Matter's Albright said. ""If you can't get involved in the business of fighting for democracy then we're going to have to get involved in your business.""

Read the statements from companies and business groups below:

Aflac

The right to vote in national state and local elections is the cornerstone of democracy. We need to join together to ensure accessible and secure voting while preserving election integrity and transparency. As this important issue is debated in Georgia and statehouses across the nation we expect that fairness and integrity will be the ongoing basis for discussion.

Coca-Cola

Voting is a foundational right in America and we will continue to work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country. We support efforts by the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced in the Georgia Legislature this session. The ultimate goal should be fair secure elections where access to voting is broad-based and inclusive.

Delta

Delta is more than 75000 strong - and our shared values call on us to make our voices heard and be engaged members of our communities of which voting is a vital part of that responsibility. Ensuring an election system that promotes broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and creates an environment that ensures everyone's vote is counted.

Home Depot

We believe that all elections should be accessible fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We'll continue to work to ensure our associates both in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote.

UPS

UPS believes in the importance of the democratic process and supports facilitating the ability of all eligible voters to exercise their civic duty. We are committed to voter awareness and engagement. In the last election UPS ran an education campaign for our employees called ""Drive the Vote"" to encourage employees to vote. The Drive the Vote campaign was nonpartisan and endorsed no specific candidate or party. Like other businesses in the community we are working with the Metro Atlanta Chamber and the Georgia Chamber to ensure equitable access to the polls and the integrity of the election process across the state.

Dave Williams SVP Public Policy of the Metro Atlanta Chamber:

Broad voter participation equal access to the polls and fair secure elections processes are critical to voter confidence and contribute to a business environment that fosters growth and vitality. We continue to work closely with members of the Georgia General Assembly to help facilitate a balanced approach to the elections bills that have been introduced this session. We are carefully evaluating the impact the bills would have on equitable access to the polls and elections integrity in our state.

As we assess specific elections legislation we will continue to rely on our core values related to elections:

We believe Georgia's elections process should be fair secure accurate and equally accessible to all eligible Georgia voters.

We believe our state and local governments should do everything possible to maximize voter participation and minimize unnecessary obstacles in our elections while working to ensure election integrity.

We are committed to voter education and broad engagement in the electoral process. Our past actions have demonstrated this commitment; our future actions will do the same.

We continue to advocate for balanced legislation that makes voting more accessible and more secure. Repealing no-excuse absentee voting does little to make the process more secure and does so at great risk to participation.

Georgia Chamber of Commerce

The Georgia Chamber continues to engage in a bipartisan manner with leaders of the General Assembly on bills that would impact voting rights in our state. We have expressed concern and opposition to provisions found in both HB 531 and SB 241 that restrict or diminish voter access. As these two omnibus bills move through the legislative process we will continue to work on ensuring both accessibility and security within our voting system.

Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce

GGBCC affirms ""All Eligible voters should be able to vote in Georgia."" As for HB 531 and SB 241 Legislators should not rely on the ""Urgency"" to get these bills signed take a step back be open to views that are different and do what is ""RIGHT""; the Black Business and Community Leaders have expressed they are ""OPPOSED"". And GGBCC represents them.

""Our organization plays a very vital role in contributing to the economic growth in Georgia"" states GGBCC's CEO Melinda Sylvester. ""Accordingly we believe it is our civic duty to stand with all voters in our great state. In so doing we are exhibiting our collective strength to assure that the efforts of our Bridge Builder Initiative can continue to be building blocks for continued and future success for all Georgians."" The organization is further encouraging all GGBCC business owners and aspiring business owners to get engaged and stay in contact with their respective legislators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWxsaWNvdGhlZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L3Jvc3MtY291bnR5LXNlcnZpY2UtcHJvdmlkZXItb3BlbnMtbmV3LW9mZmljZS13YXRlci1zdHJlZXQvNDY0NjA4ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ross County service provider opens new office on Water Street,"CHILLICOTHE- A multi-county service provider that works with adults and children with disabilities both mental and physical has opened up a new office in Chillicothe.

Southern Ohio Adventures and Recreation (SOAR) started in Vinton County around 2012 said Tami Bay CEO of SOAR and has since expanded to Athens Washington Meigs Galia Jackson and Ross counties.

To qualify for services clients must be registered for services through the Ross County Board of Developmental Disabilities.

The organization has serviced Ross County for the past three years but a new office at 203 W Water Street has been open for less than a week said Jennifer Matheny SOAR County Manager.

""The office benefits us in hiring in town and providing training in Chillicothe versus having new employees travel all the way to Hamden for training"" she said. ""One day we hope to open a habilitation building for the individuals to attend but at this time it basically serves employees.""

While they are always hiring the company is currently looking to hire 15-20 people in as Direct Service Professionals who work directly with the consumer in providing for every day needs to live a quality life.

A total of 22 people in Ross County are currently in the SOAR program said Bay.

Along with doing home care SOAR hosts a day habilitation facility in Vinton County from which staff will help clients with community engagement and activities.

""We get them out into the community take them to the movies we also provide jobs currently we clean ODOT"" said Bay.

Bay said that most importantly they provide a voice for their clients. ""My heart is in it"" she said. ""So I'm going to hire and keep people whose hearts are in it. Your heart has to be in it you have to care about these clients we're family-oriented we treat our employees like family we treat our clients like family and we'll go to bat for them- be their voice"" she said.

A hotel that bills itself as the world’s first “polar bear hotel” has opened in China’s far northeastern Heilongjiang province drawing both guests and criticism for its central feature: live polar bears.

The Polar Bear Hotel part of the Harbin Polarland theme park in Heilongjiang’s capital and largest city Harbin opened its doors on Friday with the promise of round-the-clock polar bear viewing from all 21 guest rooms.

“Whether you’re eating playing or sleeping polar bears will keep you company” Harbin Polarland’s official WeChat account said in a post dated Thursday.

Photos and videos from Chinese state media showed people watching two polar bears in an indoor enclosure featuring artificial ice and small pools of water.

Yang Liu a spokeswoman for Harbin Polarland told Reuters news agency that the indoor area is only part of the bears’ total enclosure and that they are let outdoors when temperature and air quality permit.

She said interest in staying at the hotel where rooms range from 1888 to 2288 yuan ($290.10 to $351.56) per night was “very high” adding that it is fully booked through a trial period.

Conservationists criticised the hotel.

“Polar bears belong in the Arctic not in zoos or glass boxes in aquariums – and certainly not in hotels” Jason Baker senior vice president at animal rights group PETA told Reuters on Saturday.

“Polar bears are active for up to 18 hours a day in nature roaming home ranges that can span thousands of miles where they enjoy a real life.”

In 2016 a shopping mall in the southern city of Guangzhou attracted global condemnation after videos emerged of a polar bear Pizza lying on her side in a glass-walled enclosure.

Harbin Polarland established in late 2005 calls itself the world’s first polar performing arts amusement park.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWlnaHR5LWJ1aWxkaW5ncy0zZC1wcmludGluZy1jb21tdW5pdHktaG9tZXMtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS0yMDIxLTPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21pZ2h0eS1idWlsZGluZ3MtM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctY29tbXVuaXR5LWhvbWVzLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtMjAyMS0zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mighty Buildings is 3D printing a community of homes in California,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Forget concrete and steel — Mighty Buildings is using robots and 3D printers to build a $15 million community of homes in California.

Mighty Buildings a construction tech company specializes in 3D printed homes of varying sizes presenting a technology-forward solution that could address issues like the housing crisis and sustainability. And so far this formula has found the company success: last month Mighty Buildings raised $40 million in a Series B round.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The California-based business isn't the first or only company taking advantage of this growing 3D printing tech. But unlike other companies Mighty Building's upcoming project in Rancho Mirage California will have the title of ""world's first planned community of 3D printed homes"" according to its maker.

""This will be the first on-the-ground actualization of our vision for the future of housing - able to be deployed rapidly affordably sustainably and able to augment surrounding communities with a positive dynamic"" Alexey Dubov cofounder and COO of Mighty Buildings said in a press release.

Mighty Buildings' Cinco Model. Mighty Buildings

To create this first-of-its-kind community Mighty Buildings partnered with development-focused Palari Group a working relationship that first started from other property designs in September 2020.

In December of last year Palari Group officially ordered Mighty's ""Cinco"" models for the Rancho Mirage California housing development.

Rancho Mirage may not be Los Angeles or San Francisco but this southern California location has its benefits. The city — known as ""the playground of the presidents"" according to Mighty Buildings — is located in the Coachella Valley which Sam Ruben the company's chief sustainability officer calls ""one of the epicenters of modern design.""

The tech-forward housing development will consist of 15 homes across five-acres. This $15 million project will be built using the Mighty Kit system which utilizes prefabbed panels to create custom homes.

Through this system gone are the days of concrete. Instead the homes will be based on Mighty Building's 3D printed proprietary Light Stone Material which sets its shape upon UV light exposure according to the company. The printers also rely on ""robotic automation"" and robotic arms the latter for functions like quality control scans Ruben told Insider in an email interview.

Using this construction method has several sustainability speed and cost advantages. Similar to the general prefabricated home industry Mighty Building's 3D printing process allows the homebuilders to create units in a quicker and 40% less expensive manner all while reducing construction waste by 99% according to Ruben.

What will the homes include?

The 3D-printed homes won't look any different than a traditionally constructed mid-century modern home.

The 1450 square-foot homes — which will be placed atop 10000-square-foot plots of land — will come with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. If that's not enough space the homes will also have a separate 700-square-foot two-bed one-bath unit.

Looking to take advantage of the California sunshine? The backyard will feature a swimming pool and deck but this outdoor space can be upgraded with hot tubs firepits or open-air showers.

The homes will also come with a ""wellness intelligence solution"" that can control living aspects like air and water quality and circadian lights. According to Ruben this integration of smart tech creates both a comfortable and sustainable living experience by only using energy when needed.

Along with this eco-friendly trend the homes will be ""zero-net-energy"" relying on solar and optional Tesla Powerwall batteries for power. Electric vehicle chargers also come optional.

""The project aims to minimize its environmental impact and offer smart and healthy homes to sustainability-minded buyers"" Mighty Buildings wrote in a press release.

The development will be completed next spring and Mighty Buildings is already in talks with a ""number of developers"" for potential future communities."

Southwest Airlines staff went above and beyond to return a 2-year-old’s California tot’s Buzz Lightyear action figure — after they found it on a plane in Little Rock Arkansas according to reports.

Hagen Davis’s mom Ashley Davis said she realized the toy was MIA when the family got to the rental car after landing in Dallas. By then their plane had already decamped for Little Rock she told CBS Sacramento.

“That’s when the realization hit me that he’s still in the airport with the plane that’s probably not there anymore because it was continuing on to Arkansas” the 31-year-old mom recalled.

“I was like ‘Well Buzz had to go on a space mission he’s still on the airplane.'”

Fortunately a ramp agent in Little Rock noticed the toy — and that “Hagen” was written on its boot. Staff were able to track down the only person by that name who had traveled that day according to a Facebook post.

Southwest staff played along with the bit mailing Hagen his toy in a decorated box with a handwritten dispatch along with photos of the action figure “posing” in front of the airline’s planes.

“To Commander Hagen” the note said in all-caps. “I am very excited to return to you upon completing my mission. I was able to explore the airport and spaceport in Little Rock Arkansas while I was away and I have included photos of my adventure.”

“My journey has taught me a lot but I am so thankful to return to my buddy.”

The family from Elk Grove California had been in Texas for a funeral. Southwest

Video posted on Southwest’s Facebook page showed Hagen’s thrilled reaction when he saw his name written on the toy’s bottom.

“There’s definitely not enough good in this world and for someone to take the time out of their day to do that for strangers means the world to us” his grateful mom told ABC10 Sacramento.

The family from Elk Grove California had been in Texas for a funeral.

“To have somebody almost across the country from us do all of that was absolutely amazing” she told the station.

When the family finally noticed Buzz was missing it was too late. The plane they were on was already on its way to its next destination: Little Rock Arkansas.

Days later Buzz was reunited with Hagen and his family with a few surprises added to the package.

According to Southwest Airlines Jason personally decorated Buzz’s box that he was returned home in with a letter detailing Buzz’s latest mission. Of course photos of Buzz’s journey were added to the package as well.

But you can connect onward to other Hawaiian islands using inter-island air transportation. Southwest even operates some inter-Hawaii flights. And you can rent a car to explore more remote parts of the four Hawaiian islands serviced by nonstop flights from the mainland. You may even be able to snag a reasonably priced rental car using AutoSlash or by redeeming your points and miles for a car rental.

Alternatively you could fly on an inter-Hawaii flight to Hilo.

Flying to Hawaii with points and miles

Flights to Hawaii can be expensive. Luckily you can get to Hawaii using points and miles. For example TPG's Summer Hull took her family on a three-week Hawaiian vacation using points and miles. And TPG contributor Ian Snyder leveraged a single card bonus for free flights to Hawaii for a whole family.

In short there are a lot of ways you can fly to Hawaii with points and miles. For example you could redeem points and miles to fly on Hawaiian Airlines. You could also redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards points to fly Southwest. But when flying with Alaska Delta United and American you may be better off booking with partners such as Turkish Miles & Smiles British Airways Avios Korean Air SkyPass or Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer.

You could even redeem miles to fly in a lie-flat seat to Hawaii. For example we've seen American Airlines Web Special awards that would allow you to fly to Hawaii in lie-flat first class for just 45000 miles. And you can book lie-flat first-class seats on new Hawaiian Airlines routes from 40000 miles.

Bottom line

Depending on what you plan to do on your Hawaiian vacation the best time to visit Hawaii will vary. As this guide shows there are many nonstop flights between the mainland U.S. and Hawaii. But if you don't live in a city with an airport that offers nonstop flights to Hawaii you may need to book a connecting flight. Some of the loyalty programs mentioned above only allow nonstop itineraries but it may be worth booking a separate positioning flight in order to redeem through select programs."

That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.

If you’re looking for an excuse to meet up with friends or simply need a pick-me-up before your 9:40 a.m. Starbucks is one of the first places on campus you think of. And as synonymous as Starbucks is with a few warm momentary reprieves from stress of our day-to-day grind so is its manager Romona Gray — or just Mona for short.

You’ve probably told her your order before or if you’re a regular she knew it as soon as she recognized your face. And when Mona’s not at the register taking drink orders or training new employees she’s chatting and sharing a laugh with students. A few Fridays ago Mona sat down with me to talk about being an integral part of a campus hub.

Mona’s been manager of Starbucks since 2000 when Java Coffee occupied what we now call Rocky’s Rocky’s was inside The Pit itself and the salad bar was stationed where the registers are now. I assumed Mona was a fan of being manager at Starbucks since she’s been working here for 20 years now. When I asked her why she’s stuck around so long she started to talk excitedly about the relationships she’s fostered with students over the years while simultaneously memorizing their orders over time.

“If I get regular people that come everyday I’ll know their drink and if you’re new I’ll write down your drink and then I’ll have it.” A few moments after this Mona scanned my face for a quick second and asked “What do you like a caramel macchiato?”

I shook my head yes and started to laugh that she’d guessed it correctly since I’m not a regular by any means and moments later she let out a laugh as well giving me a high five.

Even when she’s not at Starbucks Mona makes sure to keep in touch with some of her customers.

“There’s this one student that comes in […] We keep in contact all the time” Mona said. “When I’m not here she’s worried about me so she’ll call me or text me ‘Oh are you ok?’ cause I treat her like family. I know her food what she eats everyday her drink and stuff you know.”

If there’s one thing I took away from my conversation with Mona it’s that she’s dedicated to making students feel at home when they come to Starbucks — not for the sake of formality but for the sake of connecting with the students themselves.

“Someone will come in and they might have a bad day and I say ‘Get over here right now’ and then we just talk and laugh. […] I don’t care if you’re Black white Hispanic I’m like your mom from home.”

Mona mentioned how students will bring their parents in to meet her since so many of them call to talk about the conversations they have with her. She makes sure to jokingly warn these students “I got your parents phone numbers so if you act up I’m gonna call your mom or dad.”

Mona later told me her three children are out of college working full time jobs or getting graduate degrees. Building relationships with UR students who are far from home reminds her of when her kids were younger she said.

“Around Thanksgiving or the holidays when some students don’t go home I asked ‘Where are you gonna be at?’” she said. […] “So I cooked and I took everyone a container of food […] for Christmas or Thanksgiving. Because see my kids are old and I miss my kids being in school like this.”

I always was under the impression that Starbucks was a homey place. But after learning how Mona runs the joint and how close she gets to students I realized that Starbucks isn’t just homey but for many a legitimate home away from home. In these dark times when it can be hard to feel like anyone is looking out for you it’s reassuring to know that someone is close and invested in fostering comfort in their community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY2VsZWJzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1vcmRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Celebs' Go-To Starbucks Orders — Eat This Not That,"Everyone has their own go-to drink at Starbucks—even A-list celebrities. Whip or no whip? Hot or iced? Frappuccino or Refresher? Many celebrities have one or two favorite menu items at Starbucks many of which you can easily order yourself to get a taste of this opulent lifestyle.

Of course there are some celebrities notorious for complex complicated drink orders that you can also try if you don't mind irritating your barista.

Regardless of your taste preferences you are sure to find a celebrity Starbucks order that you should try during your next visit. Here are some of the most famous Starbucks drink orders preferred by celebs. And if you want to get crafty at home here are the 100 Easiest Recipes You Can Make.

Kim Kardashian: White Chocolate Mocha or Soy Chai Latte

Many of the Kardashian-Jenner family have go-to orders at Starbucks. Kim Kardashian has a few drinks she prefers: a soy chai latte or a white chocolate mocha with whipped cream.

On Twitter one fan asked the star's favorite drink to which she replied ""Small size soy chai latte or smallest size white chocolate mocha with whipped cream. They have to be the smallest size or they don't taste the same to me.""

Some of Starbucks' drinks can be high in sugar so ordering the smallest size called a ""short"" is actually a great idea if you are looking for a treat without the crash later in the day.

In a 2017 Ellen's Burning Questions video though Ellen DeGeneres asked the Skims founder for her go-to Starbucks order. Kim replied ""I don't really drink coffee but if I have to have one just to wake up I'll have the smallest size white chocolate mocha with whipped cream and take like three sips.""

Three sips?! The willpower!

Kylie Jenner: Caramel Frappuccino or Passion Tea Lemonade

Like her sister Kim K Kylie Jenner also has multiple favorites at Starbucks depending on her mood. On Twitter she said the ""caramel frap"" or Caramel Frappuccino is her favorite. On Instagram she has also posted a photo holding the Passion Tea Lemonade with raspberry sweetener—in a cup much larger than the short version big sister Kim swears by.

The Passion Tea Lemonade option sounds like a refreshing non-dairy option for warmer months a welcome switch from the typical hot lattes. Plus it is a lower calorie lower sugar drink.

Khloe Kardashian: Very Strong Chai Latte

Looking for Khloe Kardashian's exact order? In an online Q&A with her younger sister Kylie Jenner Khloe said her usual order is a ""venti seven pump no water chai latte"" and that the seven pumps give the drink ""just a little extra fabulousness.""

You're not alone in feeling confused about this order. First seven pumps?! That's a lot of sugar so this certainly seems like more of an occasional treat than a daily pick-me-up. According to Today a venti chai latte typically has five pumps of the chai tea concentrate so it doesn't seem too far off to add a few extra. Until you realize that the unaltered 20-ounce chai tea latte has 52 grams of sugar! Then nixing the water makes this drink extra-spicy and strong. What a drink truly.

If you're looking to try and cut back on your sugar consumption check out the science-backed way to curb your sweet tooth in 14 days.

Oprah Winfrey: Teavana Cinnamon Chai Latte

Oprah Winfrey's beloved Cinnamon Chai Latte is a far cry from the ultra-concentrated version Khloe Kardashian prefers but it certainly sounds delicious. This latte includes black tea and rooibos plus spices like cinnamon cloves cardamom and ginger all topped with steamed milk.

Starbucks worked with Winfrey in 2015 to donate funds from the Oprah Teavana Cinnamon Chai Latte purchases to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation. While the specific Oprah/Teavana version is no longer available but you can settle for the standard chai latte for a little taste of Oprah's favorite Starbucks drink.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Ariana Grande: Soy Cloud Macchiato

Before anything else first let's clear the air—no Ariana Grande does not always order the grande-sized drink at Starbucks.

""No sometimes I get that venti you know? Some days that's what you need in your life"" she said.

In 2019 the pop singer collaborated with Starbucks to launch the Soy Cloud Macchiato really the Cloud Macchiato but she recommends via hashtag to ""#trythesoyversion.""

But the collaboration was controversial. See the Cloud Macchiato cannot be made vegan as the foam can't be made without egg white powder. Grande is vegan causing a wave of confusion. It's been said that her actual preferred drink is a soy latte which she ordered during her Carpool Karaoke segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden.

Lady Gaga: Matcha Lemonade

Back in 2017 Starbucks launched a Cups of Kindness collection with the one and only Lady Gaga. This lineup included four colorful non-dairy drinks: matcha lemonade violet drink ombre pink drink and pink drink most of which have probably dominated your Instagram feed since they launched.

The Mother Monster as she is sometimes known said ""I adore the entire collection and I instantly fell in love with the Matcha Lemonade.""

No twists or special orders here Little Monsters. The drink is made with just matcha green tea shaken with lemonade and ice.

Britney Spears: Passion Tango Tea

Remember Britney Spears' iPhone app? The game involved a journey to becoming a superstar and it all starts in a ""Starbeans"" based on Spears' love of Starbucks.

Following the app's launch Cosmopolitan reached out to Spears and asked her favorite drink to which the star responded ""Passion Tango Herbal Tea is my drink of choice.""

This bright pink tea has flavor notes of hibiscus lemongrass and apple. It doesn't come with sweetener or milk either making it a zero-calorie zero-sugar drink that is seriously refreshing.

Katy Perry: Tall Soy Vanilla Latte

It's no surprise that celebrities want to keep a low profile when running their errands. One stellar Starbucks employee Jason King kept from blowing Katy Perry's cover while she ordered her favorite tall Soy Vanilla Latte from a store in Chicago.

As a gesture of her gratitude Perry tweeted ""Dear Jason @Starbucks on Ohio & N State in Chicago you make a mean soy latte.""

King's manager saw the tweet and showed the barista who kindly responded ""Every customer is special and deserves the best beverage I can make. I do have to say it's amazing to say I've made a latte for Katy Perry. I'm still smiling about it.""

Can we request King to make our Soy Vanilla Lattes too please?

And we have to wonder—are the baristas spelling names incorrectly just in case we are famous and trying to keep it on the down-low?

Taylor Swift: Iced Caramel Latte or Iced Americano with Sweet'n Low

According to an old tour rider Taylor Swift prefers a grande Iced Caramel Latte with two packets of Sweet'n Low or a grande Iced Americano with again two Sweet'n Lows.

While it might seem smart to swap sugar for an artificial sweetener like Sweet'n Low these sugar substitutes can be risky to health.

As always everything in moderation. So if you are a major Swiftie looking to try her favorite drinks enjoy these beverages on occasion!

Mary-Kate Olsen: Chai and Skim Lattes

The Olsen twins have been spotted time and time again with Starbucks in hand.

So what are they drinking?

In an interview with W Magazine reporter Marshall Heyman unveiled that Mary-Kate drinks up to four ventis a day two of which are either a chai latte—which seems to be very popular among the stars—or a skim latte.

And when she really wants a jolt of energy MK said she goes for a red eye which is a shot of espresso in a regular coffee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXBvb3ItYm95LWJ1aWx0LWNvbXBhbnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks: The Poor Boy Who Built An $80 Billion Company,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXBvb3ItYm95LWJ1aWx0LWNvbXBhbnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvcmV2aWV3LXVuaWNvcm4tY29sZC1icmV3LWF0LXVuaXZlcnNhbHMtZnJlc2gtZWF0cy1pcy1hLXRhc3R5LWNhZmZlaW5hdGVkLXRyZWF0LWF0LWNpdHl3YWxrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REVIEW: Unicorn Cold Brew at Universal's Fresh Eats is a Tasty Starbucks Caffeinated Treat at CityWalk,"Some new cold brew specialty drinks debuted at Universal’s Fresh Eats in the Universal Orlando security hub and we had to try one out!

The Specialty Cold Brew Menu

The new menu features three specialty cold brew drinks made with Starbucks coffee: Unicorn Cold Brew Chocolate PB Cold Brew and S’mores Cold Brew. They come in one size and each costs $6.49.

We decided to order the Unicorn Cold Brew.

Starbucks Unicorn Cold Brew – $6.49

Vanilla cupcake flavored cold brew topped with whipped cream white chocolate sprinkles and marshmallows.

Right off the bat: This drink is delicious. Served over ice the sweet vanilla cupcake taste hits first followed by the coffee flavor. It might look like a kid’s drink but it’s definitely for adults!

This is the ice-cold caffeine that is needed after a long hot day. Although it looks like the sprinkled sides are melting it’s surprisingly pretty solid. It’s white chocolate drip coated in sprinkles.

It’s not so easy to eat the white chocolate and sprinkles part as it just breaks off and falls everywhere when you try to take a bite — but that didn’t stop us.

Some sort of blue and pink sauce was drizzled over the whipped cream but you can’t see it too well in the photos.

The marshmallows are super fresh and soft. They remind us of Lucky Charms marshmallows but better.

If you have a sweet tooth and are in need of something refreshing and caffeinated we recommend this drink. We’d definitely get it again! Some people saw us walking with it and it was surely an attention-grabber as we were asked where we got it from.

On Saturday afternoon Aquinas won its fifth consecutive state championship in Class 5A knocking off Andover Central 52-44 at White Auditorium.

""It's pretty exciting"" said Aquinas coach Rick Hetzel whose Saints won their ninth state championship in program history and finishes the season with a 20-2 record. ""You feel great for the seniors and all the other kids that work so hard this year because it was a tough year and you're hoping you get to play. To finish it this way for our kids is really excited for them.""

Aquinas only had three girls have experience playing in a state championship game but that inexperience didn't bother them. The Saints also snapped Andover Central's 45-game winning streak dating back to Dec. 12 2019 when it defeated Wichita Northwest.

""It was just awesome to come in and play and step up"" said Aquinas senior Madison Skelton who will continue her basketball career at Emporia State. ""It was an amazing feeling to get another title.

""St. Thomas Aquinas is just a family. We just came out there and just pummeled them. I thought we played with heart and I thought we played good. We're a young team.""

The Saints went to work in the post with Beatrice Culliton who led Aquinas with a double-double of 16 points and 14 rebounds. Culliton scored eight points in the first quarter that led to a 14-9 advantage and eventually turned into a 30-14 halftime advantage.

Within five years Young said at the time he wanted to see annual sales top $75 million.

In the time since then Federal Resources which provides information technology services for a list of major clients that include the federal government has navigated a pandemic that delivered a body blow to the nation's economy.

And the company never missed a beat.

""We tripled our business in 2020"" Young said adding that the company is ahead of schedule and expects to top $75 million in annual sales by the end of this year.

That sales growth caught the attention of Inc. 5000 which named Federal Resources to its list of the nation's fastest-growing private companies.

But growing sales wasn't the only move Federal Resources made in 2020.

The company which had been renting space from the Erie Downtown Development Corp. on State Street purchased and renovated a new headquarters building at 440 W. Eighth St.

Young acknowledged that the timing of the $450000 investment – coming when millions of Americans are working remotely – might seem unusual.

""I tend to go running into the fire as opposed to away from it"" said Young who opened his new 3700-square foot office in February.

The company which had three employees when Young purchased it has grown to around 80 many of whom are scattered throughout the country. Of that total about 30 are based in Erie.

Many of them continue to work from their homes but stop by the office occasionally.

""We are offering our folks the opportunity to get in here and socialize a little bit and also have the business tools around them"" Young said.

The new office located in Erie's Our West Bayfront neighborhood includes a large co-working space on the first floor as well as conference rooms and off-street parking.

“We are excited to welcome FRC to the West Bayfront as neighbors and community members” Anna Frantz executive director of Our West Bayfront said in a statement. ""The company’s decision to relocate to West Eighth Street is great news for the neighborhood and for nearby businesses.""

Young said he had looked at the long-vacant building several years ago before buying it two years ago.

""We did pretty much a complete overhaul"" he said.

With his company on track to meet its goal of $75 million in annual sales this year Young has turned the company's attention toward deciding what the next level of success will be for the technology-focused Erie company.

For now he's thinking that in another five years the company might be on track to top annual sales of $250 million more than triple the amount of the last goal.

But dollars won't likely be the only way he charts the company's success. Young said he's excited about the growing number of employees who take him up on a stipend Federal Resources offers to encourage downtown living.

He also measures success on the talent he's been able to attract to the company and in some cases to Erie.

One new addition is the company's chief financial officer an Erie native who left a top job in Cleveland with the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.

""I was able to coax him to join this little company in Erie"" Young said.

Michael Middleton has been appointed as the new site manager the company said in a statement Thursday.

He replaces Alicia Matus who recently was tapped as Lyondellbasell’s new director of Global Operational Excellence Process Safety and Quality. Matus will work both at the corporate headquarters in Houston and in Corpus Christi.

Middleton has nearly three decades of experience in petrochemical manufacturing and has worked for LyondellBasell and its predecessor Equistar for the past 27 years.

Before taking on the new role in Corpus Christi Middleton was the operations manager for LyondellBasell’s La Porte Complex near Houston.

LyondellBasell’s Corpus Christi Complex is located in northwest Corpus Christi between Interstate 37 and Highway 44 and has roughly 370 employees and contractors.

The 2500-acre plant is responsible for producing ethylene and propylene. Both materials that are key to making items such as food packaging automotive parts construction and roofing materials and large household appliances.

Middleton has worked in other roles within the company include operations engineering and maintenance management. Middleton who is originally from Tuscola Illinois earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1993.

If you’re in the market for a smallish tech company with lots of potential and a reasonable price check out Super Micro Computer Inc. which makes customized servers for large data center clients. Its business was disrupted by COVID-19 and last quarter’s revenue fell 5% year over year. The company is starting to recover from the slowdown though.

Super Micro is about to ramp up sales beyond its original customer base. It’s completing a build-out of its Taiwan campus which will allow it to produce high volumes of cloud servers at lower costs. In addition it’s beginning to make servers for the 5G telecom market.

Super Micro’s revenue growth stagnated over the past couple of years due to an accounting scandal but the company cleaned up its books and was relisted on the Nasdaq stock exchange one year ago. Now CEO Charles Liang is confident the company can grow again and it aims to triple revenue in the coming years returning to an annual growth rate near 20%.

Along with those rosy growth prospects Super Micro’s price-to-earnings ratio was recently a reasonable 21. The company also has $270 million in net cash and just authorized a $200 million share repurchase program — so management is taking advantage while the stock appears to be on sale.

Ask the Fool

From N.R. in Glens Falls N.Y.: What’s a dividend?

The Fool responds: When a company pays out part of its earnings to shareholders that’s a dividend.

Advertisement

Imagine that Monster Gene Inc. earns $4 per share and pays out $1 per share annually or 25 cents per quarter. So someone owning say 100 shares will get $25 each quarter and $100 over the year. Healthy and growing dividend-paying companies tend to increase their payouts over time too so in the future that shareholder could collect $150 and then $200 and more each year. The share price of the stock is likely to increase over time too.

Advertisement

A related term you’ll hear often is the “dividend yield.” This is a company’s annual dividend amount divided by its current share price. So if Monster Gene was priced at $20 per share divide $1 by $20 to get 0.05 or a 5% yield.

Companies can use their earnings in other ways than by paying dividends. They may for instance pay down debt or buy back shares of their stock. Companies trying to grow rapidly frequently won’t pay dividends as they prefer to spend all available funds to further their growth — perhaps by hiring more people or building more factories.

From P.T. in Bellevue Wash.: Is it better to sell a stock that has lost value or one that’s gained value?

The Fool responds: How a stock has done in the past doesn’t matter that much. You should care most about how it will perform in the future. It can be helpful to try to rank your holdings by how confident you are in their financial health and growth potential — and then if you need to sell shares start with the ones at the bottom.

The Fool’s School

Many companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection including Plano-based J.C. Penney Chesapeake Energy Hertz Dallas-based Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers (and much longer ago Polaroid and Texaco). These businesses often end up with super-depressed stock prices which can tempt some investors. Here’s why you should steer clear.

Companies filing for bankruptcy protection are generally in trouble — often deep trouble — and may have issues paying their bills. Chapter 11 allows them to keep operating while reorganizing. Some of them will turn their businesses around and end up stronger than before while others won’t. The latter may end up in Chapter 7 which means they’ll be liquidating assets in order to pay creditors.

Advertisement

Chapter 11 permits a company to hang on to its assets under the supervision of a court-appointed trustee. It must file a reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court. Any creditors in line to receive less than all they’re owed can vote on the matter. After the vote the court can accept or reject the plan. So companies do have some flexibility but if they offer creditors too little their plan may not be approved.

Companies typically raise money to pay creditors by selling off assets. But they’re unlikely to be able to pay all debts in full so creditors sometimes accept a partial repayment and/or some stock in the new reorganized company.

That reorganized company usually emerges from bankruptcy protection with new shares of stock leaving former holders of common stock with shares that are now worthless. Some or all holders of preferred stock may receive some payment but even they rank lower in repayment order than debt holders merchant creditors trustees employees and the IRS.

Avoid any companies in or near bankruptcy — and consider selling any shares you own as they’re likely to end up worthless. Even if a company emerges and succeeds — as many such as General Motors and Delta Air Lines have done — it will be as a new entity. Stick with healthy and growing companies.

My Dumbest Investment

From J.I. online: My dumbest investment move was selling my entire position in Amazon.com in 2015 because we had another kid and I needed to buy a family car. At the time it had already been such a great investment that it didn’t pain me too much to sell. But I wish I’d held onto it!

The Fool responds: Your actions — and your regret — are reasonable. We invest in stocks to build wealth to reach various financial goals such as college and retirement. Ideally we should find great companies and invest in them for the long run. (Alternatively we might just invest in a low-fee broad-market index fund such as one that tracks the S&P 500 or one that tracks the total world stock market.) As long as those companies are performing well and still have plenty of growth potential hang on — even if they double or triple — because over a decade or more some companies can rise in value tenfold or twentyfold.

Amazon.com stock has increased in value at least fivefold from mid-2015 so you did lose out on a lot of further growth. But you also cashed out with a solid gain and that money helped you afford a car you needed. What you might do next time is to buy a less costly car so that you can keep more money in your portfolio.

Who am I?

I trace my roots back to 2001 when my founder wished that potential audience members of a New Orleans jazz show could pledge to buy tickets and thereby make the show happen. He and his team launched me in 2009. Since then more than 19 million people have pledged more than $5.6 billion to more than 500000 projects — about 38% of which have been successful. More than a dozen films funded through me have been nominated for Academy Awards. Other funded projects won Grammy awards were exhibited at major museums and were even launched into space. Who am I?

Beginning April 26 T-Mobile says it will use its customers’ web browsing and app usage data to sell targeted ads unless those customers opt out.

It sounds very creepy. No one likes to think that someone is watching and cataloging all the websites they visit. But it’s also a good example of just how much of our data can be and is collected through our mobile devices and how few rules there are for the carriers we’re forced to trust with it.

It’s not really clear what T-Mobile’s new program is or how it differs from T-Mobile’s current personalized ads program. As a T-Mobile customer I was personally annoyed to discover that I was automatically opted in to this program which uses data including the apps on my phone and “broadband information” to target ads to me. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for clarification but said it would share more about its ad partnerships when the new privacy policy takes effect at the end of April.

What T-Mobile is doing isn’t unusual however and it’s not new. Verizon and AT&T have been doing this for years. Mobile carriers figured out a long time ago that they have two ways of making money off of their customers: what those customers pay to use their services and then what carriers earn by selling the data those paying customers provide as they use those services. The former is clear and obvious to the customer especially when the monthly bill comes due. The latter is buried under lengthy and confusing privacy policies and account settings and most customers don’t even know it’s happening.

Here’s how this works: When you use a carrier’s cellular network (LTE 4G 5G etc.) that carrier then knows what sites you visit mobile apps you use phone calls you make — basically anything you do over its network unless you’ve taken measures to obscure it like using an encrypted messaging service like Signal or a mobile VPN. There are privacy laws that limit some of what your carrier can disclose or use without your express permission (or a court order) but marketing off of data that isn’t attached to personally identifiable information is generally fine. So that’s what they do.

T-Mobile’s new program is notable because it’s more aggressive in the kinds of data it collects and the fact that customers are automatically enrolled in it. Verizon’s and AT&T’s personalized ad programs that use web browsing information — Verizon Selects and AT&T’s Enhanced Relevant Advertising program respectively — are opt-in.

“Our customers must make an affirmative choice to opt in to our plans that would allow the use of location information or where customers go on the web to serve third-party advertisement” a Verizon spokesperson told Recode.

But alongside the opt-in programs Verizon and AT&T also automatically enroll you in their other advertising programs that collect less detailed information.

AT&T has “Relevant Advertising” which uses your “non-sensitive information” (age range zip code gender) to target you with ads including those served up by its digital and TV ad network Xandr which is named after Alexander Graham Bell who invented phones and surely never saw something like this coming out of them. AT&T also sells your data to third parties to target you with ads.

Verizon has its Business and Marketing Insights and Relevant Mobile Advertising programs. Business and Marketing Insights sells aggregate information to other businesses that might want to know how many Verizon users in a certain demographic go to a website or walk into a store or use an app. Relevant Mobile Advertising uses your general information — pretty much the same stuff as AT&T’s Relevant Advertising program — and also shares that information with its own Verizon Media ad platform and network which sends targeted ads to websites apps even your TV.

In addition to those two programs Verizon also opts you into sharing your Customer Proprietary Network Information (for example the calls you make and receive) with its own companies and affiliates to market more Verizon products and services to you. Verizon says it has to obtain your consent to do this but it also considers you not opting out within a certain amount of time to be consent.

So all of these mobile carriers are still trying to make money off of your data just less intimate types of it.

As the Wall Street Journal pointed out Verizon’s and AT&T’s ad operations are far bigger than T-Mobile’s so maybe T-Mobile is just trying to play catch-up here and it’s being a little sneaky to get as many users as possible on board. It’s also trying to get its new post-merger Sprint customers who previously had to opt in to this kind of data collection and use on the same page as the existing T-Mobile users.

There is a little bright spot here: These companies claim that they don’t attach your personal information like your real name or address to this data. They either just lump you in with a large anonymous pool of customers to use as aggregate data or they assign a unique identifier to you attach a bunch of categories based on interests or demographic information inferred from your data to that identifier and then give that to third-party advertisers to target their ads to. That’s supposed to prevent advertisers from knowing your real identity but depending on what’s used as an identifier and how specific the data attached to that identifier is it could be easy enough to re-identify you through it. You just have to trust that T-Mobile (or Verizon or AT&T) and their advertising partners won’t do that.

Unless you live in Maine these companies don’t have to get your permission to collect a lot of this stuff. They’re not exactly careful with your data either as demonstrated by the many Federal Communication Commission (FCC) fines these companies have incurred over the years for violating the few privacy rules that do exist.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The Obama-era FCC tried to enact privacy rules that would have required broadband service providers to get users’ permission before sharing certain information including websites they visit and apps they use. But the Republican-led Congress overturned those rules a few months after Trump took office.

“The FCC needs to revisit this issue ASAP” Alan Butler executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) told Recode.

But the FCC has not revisited this issue yet so T-Mobile and the others can still collect use and profit off of your data for now while you actually pay them for the privilege. They also give you ways to opt out so why not use them?

T-Mobile:

On the web: Go to T-Mobile.com > Account > Profile settings > Privacy and Notifications > Advertising & Analytics > Turn off “Use my data to make ads more relevant to me” and “Use my data for analytics and reporting.”

On the T-Mobile app: Go to “More” on the menu bar > Advertising & Analytics > Turn off “Use my data to make ads more relevant to me” and “Use my data for analytics and reporting.”

Verizon

On the web: Go to www.VerizonWireless.com/myprivacy > Select “Don’t share” for Customer Proprietary Network Information Business & Marketing Insights and Relevant Mobile Advertising.

On the Verizon app: Go to “More” on the menu bar > Tap the gear icon for Account Settings > Manage Privacy Settings > Switch off Customer Proprietary Network Information Business & Marketing Insights and Relevant Mobile Advertising.

AT&T

On the web: Go to AT&T’s “Consent Dashboard” > Relevant Advertising > switch allow use to “No.”

On the AT&T app: Go to “More” on the menu bar > Profile > Data & Privacy > Privacy settings > Relevant Advertising > Switch allow use to “No.”

Also you might as well check out Verizon’s and AT&T’s “opt-in” personalized ads while you’re at it just to make sure you haven’t opted in without realizing it via a sneaky pop-up with a lot of fine print (the owners of the AT&T account I used to research this article for example had no idea when or how they opted into Enhanced Relevant Advertising). For AT&T just follow all the instructions above but click on “Enhanced Relevant Advertising.” For Verizon follow the instructions above but click on “Verizon Selects.”

Of course you can always opt into (or stay opted into) all of these ad programs if you’re happy enough trading some of your most sensitive data for a personalized ad experience which these companies insist is something customers want. According to a report from AT&T’s Xandr ad platform (consider the source) two-thirds of people surveyed “wish advertisements were more relevant to them and their lifestyle.”

I have never personally met one of those people despite their supposed majority in the population but apparently they do exist somewhere.

Excitement around 5G and its promise of lightning fast download speeds and huge data capacity has ratcheted up since the first 5G-enabled iPhone was released last fall. But the actual experience of 5G doesn’t always live up to the hype — not yet at least.

This is partly because there’s been a lack of available infrastructure (called “spectrum”) needed to build fifth generation wireless networks that are both noticeably faster than 4G and widely accessible across broad geographic areas. That changed with the completion of the Federal Communications Commission’s latest spectrum auction last month where carriers shelled out a collective $81 billion to get their hands on the crucial resource.

“Spectrum is the lifeblood of the network” said Craig Moffett founding partner and analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Part of the reason we don’t have the 5G network that everybody has been waiting for is we didn’t have the right spectrum for it.”

To accommodate the huge level of traffic high-speed 5G networks will transmit wireless companies need to build highways for that data to travel on. Spectrum is like the real estate the US government auctions off for carriers to build those highways — the better the property the more lanes they can build and the faster and more accessible their 5G networks.

Last week Verizon (VZ) T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T) held events to update investors and analysts on the auction results and laid out plans for expanding their networks. (CNN parent company WarnerMedia is owned by AT&T (T).)

“This is a great day for Verizon — I would go so far as to say it’s one of the most significant days in our 20-year history” CEO and Chairman Hans Vestberg said at the start of Verizon’s event.

There is “no question” the carriers’ new spectrum holdings will improve consumers’ experience of using 5G Moffett said. But the carriers largely expect it will take several years to put the new spectrum to use.

This spectrum auction was crucial

This spectrum auction helps the carriers especially AT&T and Verizon fill a key gap in their 5G networks.

Three categories of spectrum are used to build 5G networks. High-band or “millimeter wave” networks provide blindingly fast speeds but limited geographic coverage. For that reason it only makes sense for carriers to build high-band networks in densely populated areas like cities and airports where many cell sites can be installed close to each other.”

Low-band spectrum provides much broader coverage making it effective for use in nationwide 5G networks but data speeds are only marginally faster than on 4G LTE.

Mid-band is the “Goldilocks” spectrum that balances speed and coverage which has largely been lacking in US 5G networks until now. Carriers bid on mid-band spectrum in the latest auction and it didn’t come cheap.

Verizon spent $52.9 billion to more than double its mid-band spectrum holdings. The company plans to allocate $10 billion more in capital expenditures over the next three years on top of its existing spending plans to put the new spectrum to use.

AT&T bid $27.4 billion to bolster its mid-band holdings and expects to spend between $6 billion and $8 billion in additional capital from 2022 to 2024 on the mid-band network buildout.

T-Mobile had an advantage coming into the auction: a significant amount of mid-band spectrum already in its portfolio thanks to its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint last year. As a result T-Mobile spent just $9.3 billion to fill select gaps in its network.

Its existing mid-band spectrum puts T-Mobile ahead of rivals analysts say. While Verizon and AT&T can’t start building on their new spectrum holdings until later this year T-Mobile already has a mid-band network up and running.

“T-Mobile won” Moffett said of the FCC auction. “Their mid-band spectrum position was far better than either Verizon or AT&T’s going in … and they didn’t have to spend anything like the same kind of money in order to keep that position.”

T-Mobile expects to cover 200 million people with high-speed 5G by the end of this year. Verizon says it will cover more than 175 million people over 2022 and 2023 reaching a total of more than 250 million people by 2024. And AT&T expects to cover around 100 million people by mid-2023. (Each carrier reaches many more consumers via their broader though somewhat slower low-band 5G networks.)

“We wanted to go into and come out of the auction with everything we need to be the leader in the 5g era for the duration of the 5g era” T-Mobile President and CEO Mike Sievert told CNN Business. “That’s exactly what we accomplished.”

However unlike T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T have fiber infrastructure that could help them compete with T-Mobile’s strong spectrum portfolio.

AT&T’s strategy for example is to serve broadband needs “in a hybrid fashion with fiber being deployed to homes to houses to hospitals to small businesses” AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh said in an interview. “We are balanced in our investments in spectrum and in fiber.”

A return on the 5G investment

It’s one thing to build 5G networks. But generating additional revenue from them will probably take more work.

Stealing individual wireless customers from other carriers by offering a high-quality 5G network is one way to increase sales. But experts say creating additional services on top of the new technology especially for businesses will likely produce the greatest return carriers’ on 5G investments.

The mid-band auction accelerates the ability to develop some of those new services and business models Tami Erwin executive vice president and group CEO of Verizon Business told CNN Business calling the company’s new holdings “spectrum for the next generation.”

“It’s really powerful for us to be able to unlock some of these use cases — think about autonomous driving” Erwin said.

AT&T and Verizon have aggressively marketed their 5G enterprise offerings such as tech to create automated smart factories. And T-Mobile two weeks ago announced new products aimed at attracting more business customers.

“In the end it’s going to be who really executes on the network build and on making this a more compelling experience” Gartner analyst Bill Menezes said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvaG93LXRvLXN0b3AtdC1tb2JpbGUtYW5kLW1ldHJvLWZyb20tc2VsbGluZy15b3VyLWluZm8tdG8tYWR2ZXJ0aXNlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to stop T-Mobile and Metro from selling your info to advertisers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvaG93LXRvLXN0b3AtdC1tb2JpbGUtYW5kLW1ldHJvLWZyb20tc2VsbGluZy15b3VyLWluZm8tdG8tYWR2ZXJ0aXNlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvbWFyLzEzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWRyZWFtLWJyb2tlbi11cHdhcmQtbW9iaWxpdHktdXPSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIxL21hci8xMy9hbWVyaWNhbi1kcmVhbS1icm9rZW4tdXB3YXJkLW1vYmlsaXR5LXVz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 'American Dream' of upward mobility is broken. Look at the numbers,"The US has long prided itself as being an exceptionally fluid society with respect to social class and economic mobility. The American Dream holds that anyone who works hard can achieve economic success – perhaps even rise from rags to riches.

Underlying this belief is the assumption of abundant opportunity and meritocracy. Arriving immigrants often believe they have come to a land of opportunity with a level playing field allowing for advancement and success. Those who fail to do so tend to blame themselves.

Yet according to recent research the United States has far less mobility and equality of opportunity today than the European Union or other OECD countries.

First the amount of economic advantage passed down from one generation to the next is much higher in the US. Approximately 50% of a father’s income position is inherited by his son. In contrast the amount in Norway or Canada is less than 20%.

What about rising from rags to riches? In the US 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the income distribution are able to climb to the top 20% as adults while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%.

Equality of opportunity is also much less viable in the US than in other OECD countries. American life expectancy varies by up to 20 years depending on the zip code of residence. Quality of education also differs widely depending on the wealth of the neighborhood that families reside in. And the chances of being victimized by a crime exposed to environmental toxins or having unmet healthcare needs is far greater for America’s poor than those impoverished in all other OECD countries.

One of the reasons for lower US mobility is that the ladder of opportunity has become much harder to climb – because the rungs of the ladder have grown further apart. This is evidenced by the rising levels of income and wealth inequality. Currently those in the top 20% of the income distribution earn nearly nine times more than those in the bottom 20%. This difference is far greater than in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Wealth inequality is even more skewed. In the United States the top 5% of the population own three-quarters of the entire financial wealth of the country while the bottom 60% possess less than 1%.

Poverty is often seen as a 'black problem' rather than as an 'American problem'

We discuss one explanation for these trends in our book Poorly Understood: What America Gets Wrong about Poverty. The United States has traditionally viewed economic success and failure as the result of individual effort. Rugged individualism and self-reliance have been defining qualities of the American character. On the other hand our European neighbors are much more likely to attribute poverty to structural factors such as social class or the lack of jobs. As a result other OECD countries are much more willing to invest in a robust social welfare state designed to help ameliorate some of these structural inequities.

In addition the United States has frequently viewed poverty and inequities through the lens of race and ethnicity. Poverty is often seen as a “black problem” rather than as an “American problem”. Race has been used to divide poor blacks and whites from seeing their common economic interests. As President Lyndon Johnson once explained to an aide in 1960 “I’ll tell you what’s at the bottom of it. If you can convince the lowest white man that he’s better than the best colored man he won’t notice you picking his pocket. Hell give him somebody to look down on and he’ll empty his pockets for you.”

Research has shown that more racially heterogeneous societies tend to be less generous in their economic redistribution policies to address structural inequities. The reason for this may be that we tend to be less concerned about the needs of others when they look different from us. On the other hand countries that are racially homogeneous tend to have much more robust social safety nets.

With a new president in the White House let us hope that more progressive policies will begin to restore the viability of the American Dream and reverse the trends towards less mobility and opportunity. The American Dream should reflect a reality where every child has the opportunity to pursue their passion in order to reach their full potential. Such a dream is well worth investing in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhpc3Nvbmdpc3NpY2suY29tL3Bvc3QvM2xhdS1tdXNpYy1uZnQtd29uLWJ5LXQtbW9iaWxlLWZvdW5kZXItZm9yLTEtMy1taWxsaW9uL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhpc3Nvbmdpc3NpY2suY29tL3Bvc3QvM2xhdS1tdXNpYy1uZnQtd29uLWJ5LXQtbW9iaWxlLWZvdW5kZXItZm9yLTEtMy1taWxsaW9uLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3LAU’s Music NFT Won By T-Mobile CEO For 1.3 Million,"In the latest chapter of Justin Blau 3LAU paving the way for the musicians breaking into the limitless potential world of NFTs we have a lot to unpack.

Just 2 weeks ago Justin made history with the largest NFT auction to date bringing in over 11.6 million. Now he’s teamed up with long-time digital artist collaborator Slime Sunday for the latest release on their collaborative project SSX3LAU.

The auction component of this collection completed earlier today and broke a new record with a final bid of $1333333. It was the largest auction final amount in Nifty Gateway’s history. The interesting thing here is that and it wasn’t an anonymous crypto bidder which the stigma has been built around who’s spending big money. It was from the lovable and eccentric CEO of T-Mobile John Legere. I was able to be in a clubhouse room hearing John live bid in an adrenaline-packed final stretch. It was also revealed there that his daughter Christina Legere would be given the responsibility for naming it. It turns out they are huge fans of Justin his music and what he stands for.

No one saw that coming and is a massive step forward for further legitimizing the NFT space in the mainstream which is starting to get some mixed opinions and not understood by some.

The rest of the collection released on Nifty Gateway consisted of 4 different open edition pieces which were announced to be the last OE pieces they would ever be releasing. The price points were $333 $3333 $6666 and $9999. Those were available for 333 seconds and brought in over 4 million making the total come just over 5 million. It almost doesn’t seem real at this point. Enjoy.

Back in 2013 Deliveroo cofounder Will Shu was riding around on his bike delivering pizzas while attempting to win over restaurants and investors to his idea. He ended up doing a 'family and friends' round raising just over £115k at a £1.5m pre-money valuation according to people with knowledge of the deal.

For those who were wise enough to write a cheque it turned out to be a good deal. Deliveroo earlier this month announced its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange with reports that it will aim for a valuation of as much as £7bn. This price would mean that the value of the whole company will have risen by around 4666x from that first round.

Deliveroo has been the greatest investment of my life... by a hell of a long way.

That does not mean that early investors will get anywhere close to a 4666x multiple on their money as with every new funding round percentage ownership of the company would have reduced. But according to sources data provider MarktoMarket and Sifted estimates the investors who held onto their stake would be likely to get somewhere in the region of a 600x multiple on their initial investment at IPO assuming a £7bn valuation*.

Of course not all of these early investors will have all the shares they initially bought. Many will have sold some along the way. But it's still a remarkable investment made even more so by the fact that the original friends and family round was done under the UK’s SEIS rules meaning that roughly half the initial investment was a tax writeoff from day one.

One person speaking to Sifted on the condition of anonymity who was an investor in the early few years of the company said: ""Deliveroo has been the greatest investment of my life... by a hell of a long way.""

VCs made the biggest bets

While the biggest headline winners in terms of multiples will be those in the 'friends and family' round the most money in absolute terms will go to those VC funds who were both smart and lucky enough to have backed the company early.

London-based fund Index Ventures perhaps has the most bragging rights as it led the £2.75m Series A round at a £9m pre-money valuation with London-based Hoxton Ventures also being in the same round. That initial investment would be worth around 100x more than what they paid assuming a £7bn valuation at IPO according to Sifted calculations*.

Biggest investors in Deliveroo according to company filings.

Index and Hoxton put more money into the company in later rounds as well meaning the value of their final stakes will be even more. Index led the Series C round as well and its partner Martin Mignot sits on the board. Other big investors have been Amazon Accel General Catalyst Partners DST Global Fidelity T.Rowe Price and GR Capital.

Today the biggest Deliveroo shareholder according to company filings is the US ecommerce giant Amazon with 15.8% which at a £7bn valuation would be worth £1.1bn. The next largest is global investment firm DST with 10.5% followed by Index Ventures with 10.3%. Will Shu who owns a 6.2% stake in the business according to company filings could stand to gain a payout of £431m if it goes public at a £7bn valuation.

Back from the brink

Deliveroo which declined to comment for this piece is an incredible story of hypergrowth. Shu and his business partner Greg Orlowski signed up their first two restaurants back in 2013. Today it says it has 100k across the world. It is a market leader and a pioneer in areas such as dark kitchens which is changing the food delivery game.

Directors with holdings in Deliveroo according to company filings.

But the company has also been tested in the last year. The pandemic initially looked like it could be a deadly blow as many of its key restaurants shut up shop and the company did not have the same war chest as rival Uber Eats or the same scale as Just Eat Takeaway. Deliveroo needed to find capital which it found in the form of a £575m investment led by ecommerce giant Amazon but this was then blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) the UK’s competition watchdog for almost a year.

The investment was eventually cleared at least in part because the CMA worried that Deliveroo would have to stop trading without it. But after some dire moments the company has bounced back with more people using the service than ever. Deliveroo is now playing a leading role in not only the £9.8bn takeaway delivery market in the UK but the global market as well.

Investment into Deliveroo according to Dealroom data

Greatest ever venture deal?

The Deliveroo deal was a pretty good one for investors but it was not the best ever in Europe. That title at least as far as Sifted can work out goes to the seed investors in the Romanian software company UiPath.

Those investors are set to generate more than a 220000% return on their money when the company lists in New York in the coming months turning $1.6m into at least $3.5bn.

*A note on the calculations

The calculation for working out the returns for early investors in Deliveroo involves a little educated guesswork.

But essentially if you know that the £115k 'family and friends' round was done at a £1.5m pre-money valuation then you know what percentage of the company they owned at that time.

From that using largely public data and the share register via Companies House you can do the maths about the dilution of each investor at every point with just a little educated guesswork.

There is also the data provider MarktoMarket which gives the share price at the family and friends round at £1.50 a share and the valuation of the Series H round at £646.38 a share.

Assuming an IPO at £7bn which is 32% more than the £5.3bn Series H round that would mean a share price of around the £855 mark at IPO. The rise in share price from £1.50 to £855 is 570x which gets to a similar range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzlhNjNkYmU5LWE3OWEtNGNjNC1iZDM0LTViNDkyZTJkNTMwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insitro raises $400m for machine learning drug discovery push,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Here's Why It's No Surprise,"Target Corporation the eighth largest retailer in the United States announced in an email to employees on Thursday that it will be leaving the City Center one of its major downtown Minneapolis locations.

Company officials cited improved remote work opportunities and less need for space as the drivers for the decision.

“In just one year we’ve proven that we can drive incredible results together from our kitchens and basements and living rooms” said Melissa Kremer executive vice president and leader of Target’s human resources operations.

Target the largest employer in Minneapolis with some 8500 corporate workers says the 3500 employees who work at the City Center will still have a “home base” but it will be at another Minneapolis location or in the nearby suburb of Brooklyn Park.

A Story of Capital Flight?

On one hand there is little reason to doubt Target’s explanation for abandoning its headquarters. Many anticipated that the pandemic would lead to a normalization of remote work.

“The future of work will be distributed” Erica Brescia the chief operating officer of Github told the BBC last fall. “We’re going to see a big shift from office by default to remote by default.”

Part of that shift it’s reasonable to assume would be corporations moving away from high-end corporate real estate. Yet it also shouldn’t be forgotten (or ignored) that Target’s decision comes less than a year after Minneapolis suffered some of the worst riots in US history prompted by the May 25 death of George Floyd.

The riots—which broke out after a video went viral showing police pinning Floyd a 46-year-old black man to the ground for nearly nine minutes before he died—caused an estimated $2 billion in damage.

Though Target made no mention of the riots in its announcement last summer I noted that an abundance of evidence suggested that the economic damage of the riots would persist long after the wreckage had cleared.

“Economic research and basic economic theory indicate that local residents will suffer from myriad cascading consequences ranging from business flight reduced capital investment higher insurance costs and lower property values. All of these effects will be especially hard on underprivileged communities” I wrote.

That observation was prompted after a Minneapolis business owner announced he was leaving the city after he was forced to watch his business burn to the ground.

“The fire engine was just sitting there but they wouldn’t do anything” the business owner Kris Wyrobek told The Star Tribune.

Research Shows Riots Have Severe Economic Consequences

Perhaps the most compelling data we have regarding the economic impact of riots come from a 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research paper authored by economists William J. Collins and Robert A. Margo. Examining census data from 1950 to 1980 their research concluded that the 1960s riots had a profound and pervasive negative impact on property values particularly on black-owned properties.

“Using both city-level and household-level data we find negative persistent and economically significant correlations between riot severity and black-owned property values” wrote Collins and Margo. “[T]here was little or no rebound during the 1970s.”

Moreover a separate 2004 study on the 1992 LA riots found that the riots accounted for a loss of economic activity that cost the city $3.8 billion in taxable sales and some $125 million in direct sales tax revenue.

Economist Victor Matheson one of the authors of the study noted it took more than a decade for economic activity to return to previous levels in the affected areas.

The takeaway is clear. Riots have a severe impact on capital investment and commercial decisions and these impacts tend to hit the poor the hardest.

Violence as a Legitimate form of Political Change?

Despite the severe costs of riots surveys show that both Democrats and Republicans increasingly see violence as a legitimate tool to oppose injustice.

Few trends in the US are more troubling than this one.



We'd do well to remember the words of MLK.



“In spite of temporary victories violence never brings permanent peace” Dr. King said. “It solves no social problem; it merely creates new and more complicated ones.” pic.twitter.com/L3mTnKz1ex — Jon Miltimore (@miltimore79) January 7 2021

Throughout the violence of 2020 many struggled to condemn the riots that spread across the country following Floyd’s death. Alicia Garza a co-founder of Black Lives Matter expressed dismay that many were calling for peace amid the riots following Floyd’s death even though his accused assailants were behind bars.

“It’s a familiar pattern: to call for peace and calm but direct it in the wrong places” Garza told The New Yorker. “Why are we having this conversation about protest and property when a man’s life was extinguished before our eyes?”

“We don’t have time to finger-wag at protesters about property” she continued. “That can be rebuilt. Target will reopen. The stores will reopen. That’s assured.”

Some civil rights leaders saw the folly in such thinking including the late civil rights icon John Lewis.

“To the rioters here in Atlanta and across the country” Lewis said. “I see you and I hear you. I know your pain your rage your sense of despair and hopelessness. Justice has indeed been denied for far too long. Rioting looting and burning is not the way.”

Injustice is real. It should be opposed by all people acting in good faith. But Lewis like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. before him understood that violence only begets more violence.

Seen and Unseen Costs

Garza was correct that Target would reopen. But she’s unlikely to face the consequences of its downtown departure in contrast to the people in the city.

In his classic essay That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen the economist Frederic Bastiat observed that every action comes with costs that are both visible and invisible.

“In the department of economy an act a habit an institution a law gives birth not only to an effect but to a series of effects” Bastiat wrote. “Of these effects the first only is immediate; it manifests itself simultaneously with its cause – it is seen. The others unfold in succession – they are not seen.”

We don’t know for sure but it may be that Target’s departure from the City Center is just one of the untold number of unseen costs of a tragic riot that will have far reaching consequences for people struggling in Minneapolis.

And if you ask Minneapolis residents Target’s decision may be a harbinger of more to come.

“I think it’s horrible it’s an ominous sign of things that are going to happen downtown” Ted Farrell president of Haskell’s told a local news outlet. “It’s literally the death of a downtown metro area it’s actually sad to see.”

Horrible indeed. But also tragically predictable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb21hcmtldC5vcmcvMjAyMS8wMy8xNC9jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnMtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1hY2NvdW50YWJpbGl0eS13cm9uZ2RvaW5nLWxlZ2FsLXN5c3RlbS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm9tYXJrZXQub3JnLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvY29ycG9yYXRpb25zLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtYWNjb3VudGFiaWxpdHktd3Jvbmdkb2luZy1sZWdhbC1zeXN0ZW0vP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holding Corporations and Executives Accountable Depends on Our Legal System,"How can the law prevent and deter corporate wrongdoing? The answer might lie in identifying what factors are associated with greater wrongdoing and how to best target them.

Editor’s note: This piece is part of our series on Corporations and Democracy designed to continue the conversation initiated at a December 2020 conference by the same name sponsored by the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford GSB and eight other schools and centers including the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. See the conference’s website for a summary of the event the program full videos and other links.

The annual costs of corporate wrongdoing in the US are conservatively estimated to be over $300 billion per year with global estimates ranging even higher. There are so many examples of corporate wrongdoing from just the past few years that it is difficult to keep track—the Opioid crisis the Volkswagen scandal the GM faulty ignition switch scandal Wells Fargo’s fake bank accounts PG&E and the California fires numerous Ponzi schemes cybercrime corruption and more. These high profile examples and their staggering costs raise several important questions. What do legal systems do to prevent and deter corporate wrongdoing? Is it working well and if not why and what might be done?

The law generally aims to deter or prevent harmful activity by imposing liability on the persons causing harm such as corporate employees. However employees rarely have sufficient assets to pay for the harm caused and are often difficult to identify or sanction. This leads us to search for others who can monitor employee behavior and in this regard the corporation seems like a natural target. Imposing liability on corporations provides them with incentives to police wrongdoing within the firm effectively deputizing them to assist in law enforcement.

Corporate liability whether civil or criminal is typically vicarious in that the firm is sanctioned for the behavior of its employees. Countries differ on the conditions under which they hold firms vicariously liable. Under respondeat superior the most common standard in the US corporations are liable for the behavior of any agent acting within the scope of her employment with at least a partial intent to benefit the firm. The “alter ego” standard used in most countries outside the US and in some US states only imposes liability on the corporation for the behavior of a “high managerial agent” or its “controlling mind” when she acts within the course of her employment and with at least a partial intent to benefit the firm. Respondeat superior is an easier standard because it premises corporate liability on any agent’s behavior.

The difference matters most in cases like the Well Fargo fake account fiasco where lower level employees engaged in harmful activity ostensibly to meet cross-selling quotas established by the firm’s top brass but no high level employees were actively involved in creating fake accounts. There respondeat superior leads to corporate liability but the “alter ego” approach might not.

“Imposing liability on corporations provides them with incentives to police wrongdoing within the firm effectively deputizing them to assist in law enforcement.”

Although civil liability on corporations is fairly common the imposition of criminal liability on them seems quite odd: a corporation can’t go to jail and its “state of mind” is not that simple to capture. Historically corporate criminal liability provided a method of obtaining government enforcement and powerful information gathering powers but over time civil liability has developed similar or stronger information gathering powers and civil regulators provide government enforcement too. Thus for corporations civil liability offers many of the features of criminal liability without the costly and tougher procedures such as those associated with the higher standard of proof in criminal cases.

However corporations are not the only entities who might monitor corporate agents—perhaps auditors investment bankers lawyers and senior executives might be able to monitor corporate employees too and it may be that the risk of liability could increase their incentives to do so. Although the set of gatekeepers may be quite large in principle senior managers are likely to be in the best position to ensure compliance with the law and prevent employees from causing harm.

The notion that corporate leaders should be liable for corporate harms is often referred to as the Responsible Corporate Officer doctrine. The idea is that a senior executive who has a supervisory role might be held liable for the failings of subordinates when by reason of the supervisor’s actual authority she has the power to prevent a violation and fails to do so. This doctrine is interesting because it can impose both civil and criminal liability on the supervisor even when she was not negligent—an oddity in the criminal law—and because the only defenses would be the supervisor being powerless to prevent the harm. However the Responsible Corporate Officer doctrine has thus far been used sparingly in the US (primarily for public welfare offenses such as violations of environmental and food and drug law although sometimes for securities fraud consumer fraud and antitrust) and has led to at most moderate penalties. Other countries often have similar doctrines that impose penalties on supervisors but permit defenses (such as the exercise of due diligence) or allow supervisors to be at least partially insured or indemnified as I discuss elsewhere.

The key question is then whether the law with its wide range of available liability options optimally deters and prevents corporate wrongdoing. Answering this question with rigorous scholarly work is challenging because it is difficult to estimate how much wrongdoing would have occurred but for certain enforcement actions how much wrongdoing remains undetected and many other matters. More research such as the one Anat Admati is doing with Greg Buchak to explore how outcomes depend on such things as the type of harm and identity of the harmed party would help.

Even if we can’t easily answer the broader questions however we might make progress on identifying what factors are associated with greater wrongdoing and target them. Scholarly work in this area has been somewhat more successful in identifying executive pay general firm performance and the presence of powerful CEOs as influencing the risks of certain kinds of wrongdoing.

One area that merits greater study is the effectiveness of compliance programs which have grown substantially and become potentially critical factors in affecting the incidence of wrongdoing the likelihood of prosecution the magnitude of sanctions and potential director liability for wrongdoing. If corporate liability aims to enhance firm monitoring of employees then attention to compliance efforts seems a rather direct way to assess whether firms are doing that. Yet some worry that compliance is largely cosmetic; that we don’t know whether it is leading to sanctions on culpable individuals as indicated by enforcement policy statements and a host of other matters. Surely more research is warranted on these matters.

We might also approach the question of the law’s effectiveness by examining the patterns of enforcement. For example as mentioned supervisory liability in the US has remained in its narrow lanes for public welfare offenses and led to only modest penalties. Corporate liability by contrast is relatively easy to attach but the US Department of Justice has become more cautious about imposing criminal sanctions on larger firms after the implosion of Arthur Anderson following its Enron-related indictment for fear of large collateral consequences. Instead we see more deferred prosecution agreement (DPAs) which involve holding off prosecutions while the firm makes changes to its governance and compliance (often with an independent monitor overseeing it) provides information to law enforcement on culpable individuals and other matters and pays a fine. If these conditions are met then the prosecution dismisses the indictment. Thus criminal trials and convictions of large firms appear less frequent.

Potential Reforms

The scholarly evidence and enforcement patterns raise potentially worrying questions about whether our current approach to policing corporate wrongdoing is really working. Given the rising costs of corporate wrongdoing on society and the likely urgency with which we need to act in some spheres (e.g. climate change) it is important to examine potential reforms.

We could consider increasing corporate sanctions. Indeed corporate civil sanctions continue to rise and corporate criminal liability has grown substantially in many countries although the US has by far the broadest and most active enforcement in this area. Nevertheless federal prosecutors in the US appear cautious about seeking large criminal sanctions against firms where collateral consequences are potentially significant. Further one wonders whether civil liability on corporations might be more effective given that as noted earlier it replicates most of the features of corporate criminal liability without the costly and difficult to satisfy criminal process. In light of that it might be worth considering increasing corporate civil liability and imposing civil or criminal liability on additional players in the corporate governance ecosystem.

Indeed commentators judges prosecutors and scholars in both law and business have advocated for greater individual liability including of executives and others in a position to prevent wrongdoing. Since the primary difficulty in convicting individuals is usually too little evidence on their behavior and states of mind reforms to address these difficulties should be actively examined.

“Commentators judges prosecutors and scholars in both law and business have advocated for greater individual liability including of executives and others in a position to prevent wrongdoing.”

One potential route is to gather more evidence on individuals through technologically sophisticated compliance programs and to find ways to encourage whistleblowers to provide information. More generally more funding may be needed to conduct complex investigations and build cases against individuals. These appear promising given that there is already quite a lot of effort being put into compliance efforts. However we should be attentive to concerns that we are still learning what works in compliance and there may be fraught interactions with enhanced compliance monitoring relying on technology and employees’ data privacy concerns. Moreover we should explore how to make compliance impact the incentives of executives (e.g. through impacting pay or chances for promotion but at a minimum there should be some broad alignment in compensation schemes and compliance programs).

Another approach is to reduce the state of mind requirement by for example expanding some version of the Responsible Corporate Officer doctrine to other areas of law. The advantage of going in this direction is that the doctrine alleviates the need for as much evidence regarding intent and may thus result in more convictions but it also raises concerns about scaring away the more risk averse individuals from being executives or directors (or having to compensate them more for doing so). To partially address these concerns the law could provide a due diligence defense require multiple instances of poor supervision before imposing liability or provide other ways to reduce risk in a way that responsible officers would not face too much risk they cannot control.

We might go further and consider options for inducing other gatekeepers to get involved in monitoring corporate wrongdoing. For example we might increase liability for third parties such as auditors who are in positions to block or detect wrongdoing or examine how we might set up incentives for newer players to enter the fray as has been recently suggested.

Considering these options is critical because the large and growing harms from corporate wrongdoing have become one of the seminal issues of our time. The legal system can do better at deterring these harms and discussion and action on these issues are both timely and pressing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvb21haGEtd2lsbC1iZS1yZWNlaXZpbmctYS12YXJpZXR5LW9mLW5ldy10cmVlcy10by1yZXBsYWNlLWRlYWQtYXNoLXRyZWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omaha will be receiving a variety of new trees to replace dead ash trees,"OMAHA Neb. (KMTV) — The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) is a beetle that lives off of ash species. It has killed thousands of ash trees in Omaha so far.

""We want to make sure that we get something down so that the whole neighborhood is not tree barren"" said Diana Failla the Executive Director of the Urban Bird and Nature Alliance.

The Trendwood neighborhood in Omaha has about 600 ash trees and on Pine Street in particular. A resident told 3 News Now that the trees had been planted in the 60's to help sell the homes and make the neighborhood more inviting. Unfortunately due to a beetle that is killing ash trees soon all of them will need to be removed.

Unhealthy trees can become a hazard. Branches fall off or the tree themselves can fall and do a lot of damage with how massive most of them are. The city has already began removing ash trees that are infected.

""Just the trees that we manage ourselves through the Parks and Rec department upwards of 15000 across the city. That isn't counting private trees and so we are at the point now of approaching about half of those being removed and addressed"" said Matt Kalcevich Director of Parks and Recreation and Public Property.

With help from the Target Corporation through the Arbor Day Foundation about 120 trees will be donated and planted in the Trendwood neighborhood. Residents were able to help select the kind of trees that will be planted on May 8th.

""It raises pride of [the] place"" said Failla. ""So we show them what the red oaks look like in the fall we show them the catalpas in the spring and the flowers that bloom from them. Then we plant burr oaks and swamp white oaks and royal raindrop crabs the red sunset maples. It's a great diversity of trees that are still tall shade trees so that boulevard look by the time they grow.""

The city has also chosen to plant a variety of trees across the city.

""In case there is ever an issue like this again that attacks one species of tree it isn't the dominant or predominant species that is in our community where we have this sort of same outcome and we see a number in the thousands having to be removed at one time"" said Kalcevich.

Fall temperatures didn’t cool demand: The median home sale price in October reached $210000—an all-time high.

Extremely low interest rates certainly have been a factor in driving home sales. But an even bigger reason seems to be that people from the Twin Cities and elsewhere can now relocate to northern Minnesota without quitting their jobs.

That’s because some of their employers are making pandemic-driven work-from-home arrangements permanent. For companies work from home (WFH) has meant greater employee productivity and lower overhead costs. For employees it means that “home” can be just about anywhere they can access a strong broadband connection.

But there’s a risky downside to a remote workforce: Cybersecurity already a big worry for companies of all sizes has become even more of a headache.

“We’ve seen a real rash of security incidents as fallout from a migrating workforce” says John Marinac president and CTO of Compudyne a Duluth-based IT services company with other offices in northern Minnesota St. Paul Michigan and Colorado.

Because workspaces are dispersed he says “it’s easier for bad actors to get involved.” When employees use their own machines for work that opens up even more vulnerabilities. “A) now you’re accessing things remotely that aren’t as secure as they should be” Marinac says. “And B) you’re doing it from a device that is substantially less secure than [those in] the corporate environment.”

Remote employees shoulder a greater burden to keep company data safe than they would in an office. Company IT staff don’t only have to protect the network from cyberattacks they also have to worry about what cybersecurity experts call “securing the endpoint”—safeguarding the devices their workers are using.

But there are measures companies can take and one simple guideline employees at all levels should follow.

Blunting ransomware risk

“There are over 300 million digital messages sent daily and around 55 percent of those messages are malicious” says Michael Kennedy CTO and COO of Ostra a Minnetonka-based cybersecurity company he founded in 2018 after a decade and a half as an IT leader for UnitedHealth Group. “It’s an onslaught and the bad guys are getting more and more sophisticated.”

Too many people with computers and digital devices haven’t kept pace with that sophistication. “A lot of the attacks we’re seeing are simple things like this: An employee is using his or her corporate email address and password on an e-commerce site that site gets hacked and the hacker thinks ‘Lo and behold let’s try logging into the corporate environment with the same email address and password and wow look at that it works’ ” Marinac says.

Though they’ve gotten somewhat less media attention corporate network breaches that allow hackers to access data of customers and vendors remain a danger. During the pandemic a new threat has company IT people on edge. Here the direct target isn’t the company network. It’s the workforce.

Ransomware “is one of the biggest threats that’s out there” says Todd Carpenter co-owner of Adventium Labs a Minneapolis-based firm that develops cybersecurity technologies (he also serves as the firm’s chief engineer). “It’s a great way for organized crime to quickly monetize attacks.” Once a piece of malware finds its way onto a computer it encrypts everything effectively locking you out of your own device. Then the user gets a message: Send us money and we’ll give you the key to unlock your data. And if you refuse? “They can spray your information all over the internet” Carpenter says.

Even if you pay the attackers “can still leave their hooks in there” he adds. “If you get this on your home computer it might lie dormant waiting for a high-value target” he says. “And as soon as you connect to the office it will try to get into the corporate system. After all you can make more money from a corporation than from an individual.”

The number of ransomware attacks has exploded in recent months. In October researchers at American and Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point reported that the number of daily ransomware attacks in the U.S. nearly doubled in the third quarter of 2020 from the second quarter. Check Point cited WFH vulnerabilities as one of the chief reasons.

IBM’s cybersecurity response team reported that the ransomware attacks in the second quarter of this year tripled from the first quarter before WFH became established. The IBM team also noted that data-nappers or cyberthieves are increasing ransom demands from their victims’ companies with some demands as high as $40 million.

Don’t try to reason with these guys because most likely they’re not guys at all. One of the particularly unnerving aspects of today’s cybercrime is that the malware and emails are being created by highly programmed bots that can generate hundreds of attacks at once. “These are robots running on the computers” Carpenter says. “It’s not a person behind that attack.”

What’s just as remarkable and unnerving is that even with their digital sophistication these attackers are using strategies that have been around for years. They’re all too familiar to IT people. Phishing and spearphishing—emails from falsified “trusted” sources that contain links that unleash malware—are still the most common ways that ransomware infiltrates a computer.

“We’re not seeing anything new” Compudyne’s Marinac says. “But they’re getting better at their attacks. Back in the day you’d see [a phishing email] and say ‘This is clearly a scam. It’s in broken English. It looks like something a first-year graphic design student would put together.’ ”

These days scam artists “will go so far as to put the CEO’s photo on the email” he adds. “They’ll register a Gmail account that has the same first and last names. Then they’ll send an email to the CFO saying ‘Hey I’m tied up in an important meeting. You have to wire money right now I need it no questions asked get it done.’ ”

In September the FBI announced that it was investigating a global business email compromise campaign that has netted cybercriminals at least $15 million in illicit proceeds. The attacks which impersonate senior executives via Microsoft Office 365 email services have hit more than 150 companies in numerous sectors including law retail and construction.

“Those types of things—they work” Marinac says. “And they’re easy. A third party could send out a hundred of those a day just by farming LinkedIn.”

When it comes to spearphishing the bots are very good at it Carpenter says. Company IT departments can filter out “a good chunk of the bad stuff” that comes through the email system. “But if you’re at home and you’re reading email and corporate information on the same machine you’ve increased your vulnerability.”

Part of WFH vulnerability Carpenter maintains happens because “we’re getting tons of email because instead of talking office to office we’re now communicating online. We want to get the work done and we’re overloaded. So it’s harder to spend time looking at all those email addresses and double-checking.” (Employees who have to care for children while working are all too familiar with being overwhelmed.)

Even if employees can use company-provided laptops they’re susceptible to the same risks they would face if they were still working at the office—phishing attacks clicking on malevolent links. —Joe Payne Code42

In malware attacks “the name of the game is to get you to click on something” says Daren Klum CEO and chairman of Secured2 Corp. a Minneapolis-based cybersecurity firm. “Someone can target an email to you that looks exactly like your email. You’ll click on a link to check your account. You’ll log into your account. And now they’ve got your username and password. A lot of these guys are so good that they’ll actually pass you on to your bank and it will log you in because they automate it.” The victim often suspects nothing until it’s too late.

Cybercriminals whether human or robot also exploit the sharing mentality engendered by social media. “There’s so much private information about people available publicly that it’s very easy to draw these roadmaps between [executives] and sometimes even sprinkle in some personal data” Marinac says.

“ ‘Hey I’m out of town on a hunting trip.’ It’s easy to find out the guy is hunting because he has it posted all over his Facebook page.” These kinds of details can make a fake email “more personal and more targeted than the old Nigerian prince scam.”

Ostra’s Kennedy argues that many email-based hack attacks succeed because bad actors try to evoke an emotion so people will click on something. “We’ve seen an increase in the variety of those attacks” he says. A new hire might be sent what appears to be an email from HR that provides a link to the company’s payroll schedule. During the federal Paycheck Protection Program application period many businesses received emails promising to “expedite your PPP loan” by simply clicking on a handy link.

Every business is vulnerable

To protect their valuable data and block malware attacks numerous companies have provided WFH employees with work-dedicated computers that can be linked to the corporate IT network via a virtual private network (VPN).

“This is your basic fastest way to get at least a modicum of cybersecurity in place” Adventium Labs’ Carpenter says. “Basically it won’t talk to anything else outside of that company network. If you get to the internet it goes through the company IT-managed network out to the rest of the world. It looks as though the employee’s laptop is on the company network.”

Carpenter acknowledges that many small businesses can’t afford to do that. But they also should keep in mind that they’re targets nonetheless. Cybercriminals are “hitting the small businesses because they generally don’t spend money on cybersecurity” he adds. Infiltrating small businesses can provide crooks access to the networks of larger companies that are vendors and customers of smaller companies. And there have been instances where small businesses have had to fold because they couldn’t access their IT systems after a ransomware attack.

Even if employees can use company-provided laptops “they’re susceptible to the same risks they would face if they were still working at the office—phishing attacks clicking on malevolent links” says Joe Payne president and CEO of Minneapolis-based software company Code42 which specializes in cybersecurity solutions. Remote workers could still be exfiltrating data out of the company’s control he says. According to Code42’s research employees were involved in about two-thirds of the breaches in 2019—even though hackers nation-states and cybercriminal gangs get most of the attention.

This “insider risk” isn’t necessarily due to an employee’s bad intentions. One reason for data exfiltration Payne says is that “companies have opened up their information and rightly so so that their employees can work from home. We’re seeing more employees taking advantage of that by copying that information to their Dropbox account or mailing it to their own Gmail account or putting it on a thumb drive.”

In addition Payne says companies are trying to increase collaboration within their teams to get them to work together. Technologies such as OneDrive Slack and Box “let us all collaborate on documents presentations and all kinds of important information. It’s made our workforce much more productive.” However he says that same technology makes stealing data even easier. Many cybersecurity solutions Payne says are designed to block that kind of sharing which can frustrate employees. In September Code42 introduced Incydr a software-as-a-service offering designed to protect company data across email as well as data-sharing collaboration platforms.

Twin Cities companies are offering other types of cybersecurity solutions. Secured2 for instance incorporates its Shrink>Shred>Secure>Restore data security technology into a suite of remote or hybrid work solutions designed to protect company data over the wire or at rest in the cloud. And the company’s Secured2 Toolkit provides secure cloud storage team collaboration and data backup; it also includes a security API (application programming interface) that can be integrated into existing applications.

Ostra provides what founder Kennedy describes as multilayered managed security which comprises email protection antivirus software VPN firewalls and cloud security. This multilayer approach has been available to the Fortune 100s Kennedy says but it hasn’t been easily scalable to a small or midsize business. Ostra offers this technology to smaller companies via a monthly “cybersecurity as a service” subscription.

These types of solutions and strategies can help protect company IT networks from attacks.

So can a Compudyne offering called SAT. The acronym stands for “security awareness training” and it focuses solely on end-user education. “We run false phishing campaigns” Compudyne’s Marinac says. “We then get metrics on how many people clicked on the link how many people entered their credentials into the link.” The goal isn’t for employers to shame their employees he says but rather “to get a sense of what they’re falling for and to teach staff how to identify and avoid email phishing attacks.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcGl0Y2hib29rLmNvbS9ibG9nL2hvdy10by1yZXNlYXJjaC1pbnZlc3RvcnMtcHJldmlvdXMtY29tbWl0bWVudHMtYW5kLWN1cnJlbnQtYWxsb2NhdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1waXRjaGJvb2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to research investors' previous commitments and current allocations with PitchBook,"In a previous article we walked you through how to create a list of target LPs using PitchBook.

The carmaker had caused uproar by continuing production even after Alameda County officials issued a shelter-at-home order that applied to businesses and individuals. Tesla did not qualify as an “essential business” which would have exempted it from the order. As recently as Wednesday the company was telling employees they could stay home if they were worried about the coronavirus outbreak but would have to use their time off if they wanted to be paid.

“In the past few days we have met with local state and federal officials” Tesla said in a statement on Thursday. “Despite taking all known health precautions continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees their families and our suppliers.”

Production at the factory in Fremont Calif. will stop at the end of the day Monday to allow for an “orderly shutdown” the company said. It will also temporarily suspend production at a factory in Buffalo. Work elsewhere including at its Gigafactory in Nevada will continue it said. Tesla also said that it had continued operating out of its Fremont factory at the “federal government’s direction.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy93aHktaXMtdGVzbGFzLWZ1bGwtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLW9ubHktbGV2ZWwtMi1hdXRvbm9tb3VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Tesla's Full Self-Driving Only Level 2 Autonomous?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2021/03/13/why-is-teslas-full-self-driving-only-level-2-autonomous/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy93aHktaXMtdGVzbGFzLWZ1bGwtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLW9ubHktbGV2ZWwtMi1hdXRvbm9tb3VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvd29ybGQvdGVzbGEtZWxvbi1tdXNrLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLW91dGJyZWFrLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Plant Elon Musk Reopened Logged Hundreds of Infections,"More than 400 workers at a Tesla plant in California tested positive for the coronavirus between May and December according to public health data released by a transparency website.

The data provides the first glimpse into virus cases at Tesla whose chief executive Elon Musk had downplayed the severity of the coronavirus crisis and reopened the plant in May in defiance of guidelines issued by local public health officials.

Automakers across the country halted production and closed plants for two months last year from mid-March until mid-May. After resuming production other automakers publicly announced when workers had tested positive for the virus and halted production to prevent further infection among employees and to disinfect work areas.

Tesla however has released little information about employee coronavirus cases.

The data was obtained by the website PlainSite which works to make legal and governmental documents publicly accessible. It showed that 440 cases were reported at the Tesla plant which employs some 10000 people.

In a series of tweets Mr. Musk said he would move the company’s headquarters out of California to Texas or Nevada.

The tweets came a day after health officials from Alameda County told Tesla that it was not yet allowed to resume production of electric vehicles in Fremont because of fears that the coronavirus could spread among the company’s workers. Manufacturers have been allowed to restart work in other parts of the state that have had less severe outbreaks of the virus.

“Frankly this is the final straw” Mr. Musk said on Twitter. “Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all it will depend on how Tesla is treated in the future.”"

She then turned a chance meeting into a successful Frisco company,"Sabari Raja walked away from a “perfectly fine” business development job at Texas Instruments in 2012 to pursue her dream of starting her own company. A year later her startup failed.

As she weighed returning to the corporate world or trying something else a colleague invited her to attend a local STEM event. She reluctantly agreed arriving 15 minutes late and drawing the attention of the speaker who promptly asked her to take a seat at the front of the room with a group of industry professionals.

Raja’s humiliation quickly turned into one of the biggest opportunities of her life. After a day of thorough networking and conversation about the gaps present in education she came away with a new startup idea.

“The education system is so disconnected from the industry in the real world” Raja said. “Connecting people from a mentoring perspective is helpful but the students are still not understanding what they’re learning is really relevant in the real world. So that’s exactly what we set out to solve.”

Now seven years later the South India native is CEO and co-founder of Nepris a virtual platform that connects students in the classroom to industry professionals across the country.

The Frisco-based firm’s goal is to promote student career exposure and readiness at a young age especially for underprivileged children.

“The No. 1 reason kids drop out and disengagement happens is because they don’t see the relevance of what they’re learning in the classroom and how it is applied in the real world” Raja said.

Through virtual appointments and video calls K-12 students from across the country can meet with educators and business professionals from a variety of industries. In addition to opportunities for mentoring and project feedback students can see how concepts taught in the classroom are practically applied to things like manufacturing a car or designing a roller coaster.

“There are these fundamental concepts that [students] are learning” said Binu Thayamkery Nepris’ co-founder and chief technology officer. “If we can connect them to the real world the sparks can actually go off in their minds and that could be a game-changer.”

Sabari Raja (Thao Nguyen)

Since 2013 the Frisco-based company has reached over 1 million students across the country connecting them with 100000 educators from over 5000 companies.

“All of a sudden it makes sense” Raja said. “They’re understanding the topic better students are excited to be in class and they are more engaged.”

By measuring engagement exposure and relevance Nepris found that 95% of students are more engaged in the classroom after connecting with educators. And 93% of participants say they learned something about a career they didn’t know before.

Raja attributes a large part of her success to her networking opportunities and support from investors along the way. Interestingly all of the people sitting at her table at the STEM education conference became involved in Nepris in some way.

“It was a coincidence” Raja said. “Coincidences happen but what you do afterwards matters.”

Texas Instruments senior vice president Kent Novak became one of the startup’s first investors and a major sounding board for feedback on Raja’s leadership. Coppell ISD chief technology officer Sam Farsaii signed the first districtwide pilot. As a former Irving ISD administrator he helped connect educators to students throughout the entire school district.

“They were crucial in contributing to getting Nepris off the ground from a funding perspective to being the first teacher to being the first district to pilot” Raja said. “It was meant to be.”

A teacher seated at her table was the first to bring Nepris into a school. Raja would visit Pam McBride’s high school classroom in McKinney ISD to observe students and listen to what she was teaching. Then the two would work together to understand the gaps that needed to be filled.

“I realized the issue was real and people [were] ready to do something about it but technology wasn’t playing a role in connecting communities” said Raja 46.

Nepris has raised $7.4 million in funding including $5 million a year ago. Lead investors included Stride (formerly known as K-12 Inc.) the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation Strada and Next Wave.

“The Nepris founders shared our mission and demonstrated a real commitment to improving outcomes for students” said Jami O’Toole senior director at the Dell Foundation one of the company’s early investors. “For an early-stage company they had made tremendous progress in building a great product.”

When reflecting back on her childhood in rural South India Raja said that played an important role in how the company came about. She grew up on a coconut farm with little understanding of the outside world.

From an early age Raja’s parents instilled in her the importance of education. Despite both not having college degrees they sent her to boarding school at age 5 a practice considered “just the norm” for children in the rural area.

“I grew up with very limited exposure” Raja said. “Now I look back and realize … there was always this inner drive to achieve more.”

Raja had an ambitious personality but lacked communication skills and confidence. The idea for Nepris grew out of her reflections on opportunities she did not realize existed as a child.

“Kids need to believe that they can do this” Raja said. “For that they need to be able to see people places and experiences that open the world to them. Many of the underserved students don’t have that opportunity.”

To reach the underprivileged population Nepris focuses on its social impact mission alongside financial metrics. Seventy percent of Nepris’ investors are impact investors meaning they’re not just interested in the company’s financial success but rather the social impact it makes on students.

“It is great to see the students’ excitement during a Nepris session and to hear the great questions they ask” O’Toole said. “It was clear that the students were experiencing what specific careers really mean in a way they can’t do by reading about it online.”

The educational technology platform sets impact goals and measures the percentage of students reached who are on free and reduced lunch plans indicating they’re from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

“Exposing students to a wide variety of industry professionals also inspires students to see themselves in a career they may never have imagined” O’Toole said. “The work Nepris does is particularly important in communities where access to a diverse set of career mentors isn’t always possible.”

Connecting more girls to role models in STEM an under-represented area for women is one of Raja’s personal passions.

Nepris’ service is most commonly purchased by public school districts though it also works with charter and private schools. Pricing per school district varies from $4000 to $6000 a year a rate that covers requests from every educator student and counselor for a year.

“There was always excitement around the product and what we’re doing” Raja said. “In the last three years the market has caught up to this company. Awareness readiness and federal and state funding have started aligning to it.”

The Nepris platform also hosts a large content library Raja said. Anyone on the platform can access 12000 hours of industry-generated content previously recorded by educators across the country.

“Forty states have put this as their top priority” Raja said. “It’s becoming more of a must-have than a nice-to-have.”

In the past three years Nepris has seen 100% year-over-year growth ending 2020 with revenue just over $6 million. In the coming year the company is shooting for $12 million in revenue. Its 30 employees in the U.S. work with an offshore team of 12 in Bangalore India.

Raja envisions Nepris becoming a global brand. It will launch its first international pilot in Dubai next year and there’s interest in India and the U.K.

“You want to be intentional but you don’t want to jump into every opportunity you get if you’re not ready for it” Thayamkery said.

As an entrepreneur trying to break barriers and “move mountains” Raja said she looks at the world to some extent through rose-colored glasses.

“We set off with the ambitious goal of changing how students learn in the classroom” Raja said. “We are reaching underserved students students coming from lower-socioeconomic populations and minority students. That is where we make the most impact.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZW50b25yYy9uYW1lL2h1Z2gtaGVuZGVyc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcwNjg4OTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hugh Henderson Obituary (1923 - 2021) - Dallas TX - Denton Record-Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dentonrc/name/hugh-henderson-obituary?id=7068899 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZW50b25yYy9uYW1lL2h1Z2gtaGVuZGVyc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcwNjg4OTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9zbmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMTMzMTYwL3RoZS1ub2tpYS1uOTAwLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtdGhhdC13YXNudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Nokia N900: the future that wasn't – OSnews,"In what seems like several lifetimes ago the mobile devices market seemed like it would be wide open. Even as the window for platforms that weren’t Android or iOS was closing rapidly we were all hoping we wouldn’t end up with another duopoly. While there were several contenders – BlackBerryos 10 Windows Phone to name a few – quite a few more nerdy mobile device users held out hope that instead of neutered restrictive and limited operating systems we’d end up with a true computer in our pocket.

No other device represented this slice of the market better than the Nokia N900.

Like what we do? Become an OSNews Patreon and support our continued work!

The N900 was the last standard Linux mobile device from Nokia the last in the line of the N770 N800 and N810 internet communicators. The N900 was the first to include mobile phone functionality making it the first Linux mobile phone device from Nokia but not the last – the N950 and N9 would follow but those were markedly different more Android and iOS than standard Linux.

The N900 ran Maemo Nokia’s Linux platform for mobile devices developed in collaboration with and/or using many popular open source Linux projects like the Linux kernel (obviously) Debian Gtk GNOME Qt and more. Maemo’s user interface used the Matchbox window manager and its application framework was Hildon. Underneath the Gtk+ user interface Maemo was a remarkably standard Linux distribution based on Debian so you had easy access to all the usual Linux and Debian command line tools. It used APT for package management and software installation BusyBox as the replacement for the GNU Core Utilities and the X window manager.

Still despite its heavy focus on open source software certain parts of the software stack were still closed source like some code related to power management as well as certain bits and bobs of the user interface like a few status applets. This “mostly open source but with some closed bits and bobs” would be a running theme into the future branches of the platform like Sailfish and MeeGo.

The hardware of the N900 is a case of throwing everything humanly possible into a single device but to keep costs down it mostly consists of cheaper parts. For example the 800×480 resolution looks crisp on the 3.5″ display but despite being released almost two years after the iPhone the touch screen is resistive and requires a stylus. The SoC is a Texas Instruments OMAP3430 with a single core running at 600Mhz supported by a 430 MHz C64x+ DSP and a PowerVR SGX530 GPU. You’ve got 256MB of RAM 256MB of NAND flash and 32GB of eMMC flash.

The star of the show of course is the slide-out keyboard. It’s a full QWERTY keyboard that’s reasonably comfortable to type on considering its small size and anyone who has ever used a Symbian device with a keyboard will feel right at home. It’s got a little kick stand stereo speakers and TV-out functionality through a special dongle and cable. Seeing Maemo 5 output to a giant 55″ 4K TV is a special kind of entertaining. Add to this the various standard things like WiFi Bluetooth a headphone jack removable battery rear and front camera a dedicated camera button and probably a few other features I’m forgetting.

The N900 comes packed.

Three spare batteries the TV cable and dongle and the original headphones.

Users of the N900 when it was new were a special kind of people. One of them was my brother – he was a die-hard N900 user for many years so much so he bought a spare N900 in case his main one died. It wasn’t until the N900 really couldn’t keep up with modernity anymore – well past that point honestly but let’s not hurt his feelings – that he begrudgingly decided to switch over to an Android phone. He gifted one N900 to me for my collection.

The N900 is a special kind of device that while a footnote in mobile history holds a special place in the hearts of a dedicated group of users who nobody is serving any more. These people wanted a proper mini-computer in their pocket preferably running Linux and the N900 was the only device that properly fit that niche. Its sort-of successors – the N9 and Jolla Phone which I both have as well – simply do not fill that niche and do not scratch that itch.

The Jolla Phone Jolla Tablet (which is very rare – I think mine is one of only a few hundred in existence maybe even less) the Nokia N9 and the Nokia N900.

Today most N900 users have probably migrated on to Android (and a few stragglers to Sailfish I’m guessing) leaving behind the standard regular Linux installation for the bastardised weird Linux offshoot from Google. While you can install BusyBox on Android and unlock the bootloader and sort-of create an approximation of a standard Linux computer in your pocket – without the keyboard without the more standard stacks and toolchains it’s just not the same.

There is still some hope for fans of the N900 – and other people who want a true Linux computer in their pocket – since there are two companies that sort-of cater to this niche. First there’s F(x)tec which probably comes closest with its line of smartphones with a slide-out keyboard. They currently offer a very cool device up for pre-order that’s capable of running Android Sailfish Ubuntu Touch and standard ARM Linux distributions as well. I’ve been trying to get into touch with them for a review unit but they have not responded (we’re small after all).

Another option that requires a bit more squinting are some of the very tiny laptops made by GPD – such as the GPD Pocket 2 and similar devices they make. They’re not quite the same as the F(x)tec or N900 but you can get quite close. GPD too has not responded to review requests but again – we’re small and if you can send stuff to outlets like Linus Tech Tips OSNews simply isn’t on your radar.

I’m genuinely sad that the N-line was yet another victim of Nokia’s endless mismanagement since the N900 is simply a unique one-of-a-kind device in a category virtually nobody even dares tip their toes in. I was never anywhere near the kind of hardcore user my brother was – I only used it as my main device for a few weeks years ago – but I’ve seen the kind of loyalty it inspired and that in turn was truly inspiring.

Despite its age the N900’s story isn’t actually over. The community has stepped up and is developing an updated version of Maemo called Leste. The last release stems from December 2020 and if there’s enough interest I’ll see if I can get it running for a short review.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vOXRvNWdvb2dsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xMy9nb29nbGUtcGktZGF5LWNhbGN1bGF0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Open the Google Search calculator for a fun Pi Day easter egg,"Pi Day — March 14 — in 2021 is this Sunday and Google is celebrating with an easter egg when you open Search’s built-in calculator. It tests how well you know the mathematical constant.

Searching for “pi” or “pi day” will bring up the Google Search calculator. π appears in the top-left corner with accompanying sparkles to catch your attention. Tapping launches the Pi Day easter egg that sees how well you can remember the constant.

A brief tutorial explains how you’re supposed to memorize the just-shown numbers and re-enter them. One digit is added each round with this game testing your recall skills. On desktop you can use your physical keyboard rather than the cursor/mouse but it’s an experience best suited for mobile touchscreens.

Google will note your Hi-Score to screenshot and share on social media. This Pi Day easter egg in Search will presumably run for the entire weekend though it’s unclear how far Google programmed the calculator to go. Pi is infinite and “has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point.” The first official celebration dates back to 1988 in San Francisco.

Pi Day is celebrated on March 14th (3/14) around the world. Pi (Greek letter “π”) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. Pi Day is an annual opportunity for math enthusiasts to recite the infinite digits of Pi talk to their friends about math and to eat pie. piday.org

City spokesperson Sue Jones said Friday that the Amazon facility which will occupy the building near Balsam Avenue and Bear Valley Road is “not a warehouse” but a speed package delivery outlet.

The company's delivery stations are designed to “power the last mile of Amazon’s order fulfillment process.” Packages are transported to delivery stations from the company’s fulfillment and sortation centers then loaded into vehicles for delivery to customers Amazon said.

The new Victorville delivery station inside the nearly 126000-square-foot building situated just east of Home Depot is expected to open later this year and bring 150 new jobs to the area Jones said.

Amazon pays its employees a minimum of $15 per hour and offers full-time employees medical vision and dental insurance benefits as well as a 401(k) with 50% match according to Amazon.

The delivery station will also offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to build small businesses by delivering Amazon packages.

The station will also allow independent contractors to deliver via Amazon Flex which enlists drivers to deliver packages for the nation’s largest online retailer.

“Improvements on the building have started and are expected to take four to five months” Jones said. “Updates will be made to the interior and exterior of the existing commercial building to accommodate delivery sorting and administrative functions for the new business.”

Exterior changes include the addition of roll-up bay doors on the north and west elevations and a new canopy at the north elevation to accommodate vehicle loading and staging.

A newly constructed entrance façade will be used as an employee entrance and exit and as a customer service area for the pick-up and return of items.

The traffic circulation pattern in the parking lots throughout the site will be redesigned to accommodate customer and employee parking as well as delivery vehicle parking and staging.

Landscaping will either be added or replaced along the right of way and throughout the parking lot. Balsam Road will also receive improvements to the curb gutter and sidewalk.

Access to the building will be from Balsam Road. The facility is expected to utilize a split shift schedule of 1:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. to help stagger vehicle traffic.

On Friday green construction fencing surrounded the building empty field behind the structure and most of the shopping center parking lot near several businesses including the Golden Gate Chinese and Las Carnitas Uruapan restaurants T-Shirt Emporium Elegant Hair Studio and Ciezi Insurance.

Walmart abandoned the building in September 2012 when it opened its Supercenter near Restaurant Row on Amargosa Road in Victorville the Daily Press reported.

Known as the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the U.S. Tractor Supply Company was expected to take over half the old Walmart building in 2014. But Tractor Supply's building permit expired in May of that year after nearly six months of inactivity according to the city.

After scouting several locations in the High Desert Tractor Supply eventually decided to build a new store on Main Street in Hesperia developer Brad Sobel told the Daily Press.

Jones meanwhile said Amazon's presence on Bear Valley Road means yet another large retail space in Victorville will soon be occupied.

Across the city on Palmdale Road Car X Change recently moved into the former Target building and Cardenas Markets moved into the old Ralphs supermarket. Jones noted that Inland Empire Health Plan Harbor Freight and Shark Solutions also moved into vacant space.

“This underscores the strength of Victorville’s economy and our ability to attract large businesses to our city” Jones said. “As a result once vacant retail space is being occupied and our large shopping centers are experiencing a resurgence.”

The family-owned recreational vehicle business is looking to set up a dealership in the Ripon Crossing shopping center along Jack Tone Road and Canal Drive.

“They want to want to locate near Boat Country and the (Alpine) climbing gym” said Planning Director Ken Zuidervaart at Tuesday’s Ripon City Council meeting.

Earlier elected leaders adopted a resolution approving the participation of Happy Daze RV in the City’s Economic Development Incentive Program. No discussion was necessary.

In his report Zuidervaart said the incentive program was implemented in 2017 in an effort to increase the City’s economic position by becoming more competitive with surrounding communities when it comes to non-residential growth.

“Another main objective of the Council (when adopting the program) was to work on changing Ripon’s negative image in the development community” he added.

Zuidervaart indicated that the next step for Happy Daze RV is the Planning Commission – that meeting is scheduled for Monday April 19.

Happy Daze RV is based in Northern California serving the needs of RV enthusiasts since 1974.

Besides Boat Country and the soon-to-be-open Alpine Climbing Adventure Fitness – Les Schwab Tires and Tractor Supply are the other occupants in the area – Ripon Crossing will also get a Burger King and Popeyes Chicken restaurants along with Shell Station / Convenience Store with a Tommy’s Express Car Wash.",,,,,,

“The issue of raising quality in short-term rentals is a fundamental one for our industry. It is so closely tied with raising standards trust guest experiences and professionalism. It’s an issue that each individual manager or host can’t ignore – nor us collectively as an industry. Many managers are already excelling in this area but for some there is still a long way to go.”

– Jeremy Gall Founder & CEO of Breezeway

Wait. Some of the most desirable vacation rental home destinations’ lure is their unique qualities. From accommodations to appointments to service what one brand or property does often is what sets it apart from the competition.

However with increasing traveler demand vacation rental operators – from boutique styled properties to larger global chains – are exploring the value that could come with setting standardization for pricing marketing operations and cleanliness.

Merilee Karr of UnderTheDoormat and Travis Riner of Homes & Villas by Marriott International offered their views on management standards during a conversation with AJL Atelier’s Simon Lehmann at Breezeway’s Elevate Operations Summit virtual event March 10-11.

“Our rental industry has been around for several decades much longer than the past 10 years when Airbnb first came on the scene” Karr said. “Professionally managed vacation rentals have existed since the 1950s but it was after the global financial crisis that the sharing economy and peer-to-peer homes managed by individuals really began to grow.”

Karr said the beauty of the industry is that it provides authentic stays. Keeping choice for consumers is very important. “I am really encouraged by companies such as Marriott entering the market and promoting standards in our industry because it is something that I am passionate about. It’s part of what we have sought to deliver at UnderTheDoormat since we began our business in 2014” she said.

“Back then having standards wasn’t something the industry had really identified or understood but I knew eventually everyone in the industry would embrace this as the industry grows and consumers demand the highest quality.”

Homes & Villas by Marriott International began in spring 2019 as a high-quality alternative to rental homes in markets that might not be ideal for hotel placements.

“Some markets just don’t support hotels” Riner said. “They are too seasonal or the homes there are too established so it doesn’t make sense to put a hotel there. When guests are using their [Marriott rewards program] Bonvoy points they expect a Marriott-level experience. This is an opportunity for us to provide that kind of service in a vacation rental.”

Riner said the unique brands within Marriott are not intended to squash any of the authenticity that comes with the homes or the neighborhoods in great destination vacation venue areas. For instance its Autograph Collection does not include any items that are Marriott-branded.

Karr says the industry would thrive with standards rather than standardization.

Finding More Time for Service

For Karr her company’s software Hospiria is a solution for smaller independent property managers and operators of five to 50 properties.

“Many property managers want to (and should) focus on the guest experience but they find themselves wrapped up in the administration of maintaining properties on the platforms managing inquiries or pricing” she said. “It takes all the marketing distribution and technology hassle away from property managers so they can focus on the hospitality experience.”

Some of that could be lost if larger companies buy up smaller ones and standardize operational practices.

“There are occasions when larger companies buy up the smaller companies as they just aren’t able to compete” Karr said. “I want to avoid that because I believe that authenticity is something the travelers want and the local companies who have local knowledge are best able to deliver. We have to avoid becoming standardized and guests getting basically the same experience in London as in Paris as in San Francisco.”

Cleaning House

Given the impression the pandemic has made and continues to make on cleanliness housekeeping has become a hot-button for any type of hospitality. Here standards could be more embraced.

“For us our cleaning standards are more about the outcome of what we want our rooms to be – get it cleaned” Riner said. “And not about you must use these steps at this regularity etc. Cleanliness and safety have moved to the forefront and customers expect the same level they would get when staying at hotels. The goal is to create the illusion to the guest that they are the only one to sleep and shower there.”

In hotels rooms typically are sized between 700 and 900 square feet of space they generally include consistent fixtures and have been maintained by the same housekeeper for years Riner said. Establishing and maintaining standards therefore would be simpler than applying them to the varied floorplans and appointments of vacation rentals.

“Vacation homes have so many more touchpoints for the guest Riner said. “It’s a more challenging job to maintain them and often the place is cleaned by a contracting company where different people service it each time unlike hotels that might have the same housekeeper cleaning the same floor of the same hotel for years.”

Sustaining Industry Growth

Ideally growth comes from a mixture of institutional companies and heart-and-soul owners Karr said.

“Short-term rentals are now commanding similar prices to what 4- or 5-star hotel rooms get” she said. “Many customers see short-term rentals as a safer option than hotels and provide a great experience for families and longer stays so there’s opportunity for our industry to grow as the sector recovers.”

She said a study by STR showed that there is an 11 percent increase in consumer preference by travelers for short-term or vacation homes since the pandemic.

Karr said that when one thinks about how corporations are now using vacation and short-term rentals as an option for their business travelers having standards is even more important. And this week UK-based TrustedStays became the first such company to win a government RFP.",,,,,,,,,

Crowded shift changes. Packed break and locker rooms.

The environment of Iowa meatpacking plants proved the perfect place for COVID-19 to spread. Weak mitigation efforts by companies early in the pandemic added to the outbreaks. Thousands of workers became infected with the virus some dying. Meatpacking infections spread into entire communities workers giving the virus to spouses who worked in nursing homes or neighbors at the grocery store.

The Tyson Foods plant in Waterloo saw more than 1000 of its workers get the virus. It temporarily shut down production in late April after not having enough healthy workers to keep up plant operations the company said. The decision followed weeks of intense pressure from local officials.

“It really is because of Tyson that Black Hawk County sits in the predicament that we sit in today” said Tony Thompson Black Hawk County sheriff. “We should’ve never had the amount of exponential growth in positive cases and the amount of deaths that we had early on. We should’ve never had any of that and it’s all due to Tyson.”

Nearly 800 workers at the Tyson plant in Dakota City Nebraska were infected with the virus by late May. The outbreak led the company to temporarily close the plant. The Storm Lake Tyson plant saw about 600 workers test positive for the virus the company announced in June. More than 500 workers tested positive at the Columbus Junction Tyson plant state records show.

Tyson plants had triple the number of COVID-19 cases as other American meatpacking companies according to a report by nonprofit Food Environment Reporting Network. This amounted to more than 11000 workers getting infected. Tyson saw twice as many COVID-19 deaths as plants at other companies the report said.

The company said it invested more than $540 million across its U.S. facilities to implement walk-through temperature scanners workstation dividers social distance monitors COVID-19 testing added pay and benefits and more health services staff including a chief medical officer. The company plans to open health clinics for workers and their families this year.

Workers at Seaboard Triumph Foods in Sioux City were infected with COVID-19 after complaining about inadequate protections. More than 100 workers had contracted COVID-19 by May last year at the Smithfield meatpacking plant in Denison.

The Iowa Premium Beef Plant in Tama experienced an April 2020 outbreak that left nearly 40% of its 850 workers with COVID-19. The company suspended production in April amid infections.

Gov. Kim Reynolds publicly opposed the closing of meatpacking plants like the one in Waterloo worried about possible disruption to the food supply chain. Former U.S. President Donald Trump used the Defense Production Act to sign an executive order calling on meatpacking plants to stay open. In June Iowa legislators and Reynolds passed protections against potential COVID-19 lawsuits lodged against meatpacking companies.

“It felt like we were a step behind corporate Tyson — that they beat us to the punch” Thompson said. “They got to the governor before we did. She was fighting with corporate America rather than her own citizens.”

Thompson an often outspoken critic of Tyson during the COVID-19 outbreak appeared in prominent media outlets like CNN MSNBC and The New York Times. Early in the pandemic he began to get calls about meatpacking workers sick with COVID-19. He was forceful in his warnings but felt he could not do enough to spur action.

He wonders whether more TV appearances or more dramatic pleas would’ve stopped escalating infections at the plants.

“That’s something that’s going to stay with me” Thompson said. “That’s something that’s going to be chalked up for me as a loss and I don’t take losing well. It’s a frustration for me. ... I re-evaluate and I say ‘What differently could I have done?’”

Allegations released in November from a wrongful death lawsuit against Tyson included claims that Waterloo manager Tom Hart organized a betting pool to wager on employee COVID-19 infections. Other allegations included Waterloo managers ignoring coronavirus symptoms and giving bonuses to people who showed up to work every day even if they were sick.

Tyson later suspended at least two upper-level managers at the Waterloo plant. After an investigation the company fired seven of its managers including Hart.

Another complaint against Tyson claimed the company lied to interpreters about the scope of COVID-19 infections in the Waterloo plant. The facility employs non-English speaking workers who rely on interpreters for accurate information.

Community advocates longtime unionists and workers criticized the Waterloo Tyson union UFCW Local 431 for being largely absent during the outbreak.

Waterloo Tyson workers started getting COVID-19 vaccines in March. Thompson said the company’s vaccination clinics distributed Black Hawk County’s first doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine recently approved for emergency use alongside Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Tyson did not share how many of its workers have been vaccinated.

Tyson is offering up to four hours of regular pay to workers who get shots to encourage widespread vaccination.

Thompson visited the Waterloo plant in April 2020 and was alarmed by the crowded conditions and lack of transparency. But he recently visited with Tyson officials to discuss the logistics of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and he said he is optimistic about the company’s direction.

He said he intended for the city’s initial interactions with Tyson during COVID-19 to spur collaboration. He hoped city officials could serve as a “force multiplier” to fight the spread of COVID-19.

“We’re not out to expose corporate secrets” Thompson said. “We’re not out to embarrass a company. ... We want them to do well and we want them to be successful. We want them to look good.”

The Tyson plant in Waterloo is the country’s largest pork processing plant. It employs about 3050 people the company said.

Tyson did not answer questions from The Courier about updated COVID-19 infections and deaths linked to the Waterloo plant. The Black Hawk County Health Department also did not provide the data.

Crowded shift changes. Packed break and locker rooms.

The environment of meatpacking plants proved the perfect place for COVID-19 to spread. Weak mitigation efforts by companies early in the pandemic added to the outbreaks. Thousands of workers became infected with the virus some dying. Meatpacking infections spread into entire communities workers giving the virus to spouses who worked in nursing homes or neighbors at the grocery store.

An outbreak at Tyson Foods' Dakota City plant sent the Sioux City metro area skyrocketing to the top of the nation's coronavirus hotspots for much of late April and early May.

Nearly 700 workers at the 4500-employee beef plant had tested positive for the virus as of April 29 a source familiar with the situation told the Journal. Two days later facing growing public scrutiny over the spread Tyson shut down the world's largest beef plant for six days for a deep cleaning and to screen the remaining workers for the virus.

On May 8 a few days after the testing finished Dakota County reported a single-day record of 361 new positive tests while Woodbury County confirmed 161 new cases. Twenty days later Tyson reported 786 active cases at the Dakota City plant but company officials said that number was continuing to decline.

Tyson's Waterloo Iowa plant saw more than 1000 of its 3050 workers get the virus. It temporarily shut down production in late April after not having enough healthy workers to keep up plant operations the company said. The decision followed weeks of intense pressure from local officials.

“It really is because of Tyson that Black Hawk County sits in the predicament that we sit in today” said Tony Thompson Black Hawk County sheriff. “We should’ve never had the amount of exponential growth in positive cases and the amount of deaths that we had early on. We should’ve never had any of that and it’s all due to Tyson.”

In Storm Lake about 600 workers at Tyson's two plants in the Buena Vista County seat tested positive for the virus the company announced in June. More than 500 workers tested positive at the Columbus Junction Tyson plant state records show.

In late July Tyson began testing thousands of workers weekly at its 140 facilities.

Tyson is offering up to four hours of regular pay to workers who get shots to encourage widespread vaccination. The company also is opening health clinics for workers and their families including a pilot clinic in Storm Lake.

Other Siouxland plants with confirmed cases of COVID-19 last year included Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork plant in Sioux City and the Smithfield Foods plant in Denison where more than 100 had contracted the virus by May.

Since late last year a number of large and regional banks have either replaced their CEOs or announced plans to do so in the coming weeks.

Some like Citigroup and MUFG Union Bank promoted senior executives from within while others brought in seasoned business-line leaders from larger banks. Perhaps not surprisingly two companies Texas Capital Bancshares and TIAA hired their new leaders from JPMorgan Chase the industry’s top training ground for future bank CEOs.

Here’s an introduction to the newest crop of bank CEOs.

Police body camera footage obtained by CNN affiliate KTRK shows a woman being arrested at a Galveston Texas bank after she refused to wear a mask or leave.

The arrest occurred Thursday the day after an order by Gov. Greg Abbott rolled back some of the state’s Covid-19 restrictions including the state’s mask mandate. Private business however are still allowed to require masks at their discretion.

The footage shows a police officer entering the Bank of America branch in Galveston and telling the woman the bank can refuse service to her if she won’t put on a mask. She insists she doesn’t have to and the officer tells her she will be arrested for “intruding on the premises” if she refuses to cooperate or leave the bank. Eventually the officer handcuffs her and removes her from the bank.

Terry White 65 told KTRK that she entered the bank without a mask and was asked by an employee if she had one. White replied “No thank you I don’t need one” and she was offered a mask by the employee.

When White refused the mask she said she was asked to leave.

“I said no I just want to close my account and then I’ll leave” she told KTRK. “(The employee) goes ‘Well if you’re not going to leave then I’m going to call the cops.’ I said ‘Well do what you have to do.’”

Galveston Mayor Craig Brown told CNN the woman was arrested on trespassing charges – “not on not wearing a mask.”

According to KTRK police said White was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest.

CNN has reached out to White but has not heard back. Neither the Galveston Police Department nor Bank of America have responded to requests for comment.

The body camera footage shows a Galveston police officer entering the bank and confronting the woman on Thursday telling her “Ma’am if they ask you to leave you have to leave.”

The woman tells the officer she’s trying to take her money out. The officer responds by telling her to which the officer says she still has to “abide by the rules.”

“Business have the right to refuse service even if you’re not wearing a mask. That’s their choice” the officer says.

“What are you going to do” she asks “arrest me?”

“Yes for intruding on the premises” the officer says. He tells the woman to step outside.

The woman insists she’s in a public place (“This is a private business” the officer says) and accuses the officer of “taking away people’s human rights.”

A brief struggle follows as the woman appears to initially resist while the officer starts to handcuff her. Soon she’s on the floor of the bank saying to other people inside the bank all of whom appear to be wearing masks “Police brutality people.”

“No” they say. “No it’s not.”

The officer takes the woman out of the bank. She says she thinks the officer broke her foot and the officer calls for emergency medical services. He places her in the back of a patrol car before the footage ends.

Reopening is a ‘delicate balance’ mayor says

In an interview Friday White told KTRK she traveled to Galveston in her recreational vehicle and was aware of the governor’s order lifting the mask mandate. KTRK reported that White was glad to have stood her ground and that she is “very opposed” to masks saying at one point “I won’t wear that diaper on my face.”

The order lifting the mask mandate has reignited the debate over face coverings in the state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Austin city leaders this week after they tried to maintain local mask requirements. On Friday a judge denied the state’s request for a temporary restraining order against the local mandate and pushed the injunction hearing back until March 26.

“Many of the businesses and restaurants and shopping areas here on the island are enforcing still or requesting that all their clients and customers wear masks” said Galveston Mayor Brown. “This particular incident was a lady that refused to do that the bank had said that’s their policy.”

“It’s a delicate balance” he added to maintain safety while places open up. “That’s why we still encourage everyone on our island to maintain social distancing and wear their mask.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYmFuay5vcmcvZW4vcmVnaW9uL2xhYy9icmllZi9jZW50cmFsLWFtZXJpY2EtZ3Jvd3RoLXBvdGVudGlhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unleashing Central America's Growth Potential,"As countries continue to manage the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic Central America’s priority is to recover from its deepest economic contraction to restore strong sustainable economic growth.

The allegations laid out in documents sent last week to the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service were made by a former Credit Suisse employee. The former employee said that the bank continued to hide assets for its clients long after it promised prosecutors it would close those accounts according to copies of documents obtained by The New York Times.

The whistle-blower whose identity is unknown is also contending that Credit Suisse lied to federal prosecutors the Internal Revenue Service and members of Congress during their yearslong inquiry into how Swiss banks helped Americans defraud the government. Those investigations ultimately led to a settlement in May 2014 between Credit Suisse and federal prosecutors in which the Swiss bank pleaded guilty to helping some of its American clients evade taxes by cloaking their wealth through offshore shell companies.

Credit Suisse was fined a total of $2.6 billion but avoided even higher fines because it vowed to the Justice Department and a Senate panel that it had not only stopped the practice but that it would close “any and all accounts of recalcitrant account holders.” The bank also pledged to help the United States pursue other criminal investigations according to the plea agreement. Credit Suisse’s guilty plea and steep fine were rare in 2014.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- An Uber driver shared some disturbing video with ABC7 News of passengers he says attacked him after one refused to put on a mask.

The incident happened Monday afternoon at San Bruno Ave. and Felton Street in San Francisco

An Instagram account that appears to belong to one of the women in the car posted several public videos of the incident.

The owner of the account claims that the driver was about to drop them off in a bad neighborhood or on the side of the freeway and that the video he shared did not capture the entire incident.

In the videos the driver Subhakar Khadka pulls into a gas station so that one of the women can buy a mask but as she gets out of the car the driver can be heard saying that he was canceling the ride. He then asks the woman to get out of the car because he was going home.

""She started taunting me cursing me questioning me about being a man. The ladies were even talking about shooting me calling their cousins to shoot me. They were making fun of my race"" said Khadka.

The women say they won't get out of the car until their other Uber arrives but the driver persists in asking them to ""please leave the car.""

After asking a final time he starts driving away with the women still in his car. In the videos the women can be heard laughing at him and asking him if he's kidnapping them. At a stoplight he can be heard asking them a final time for them to get out or that he will have to drop them off on the freeway.

According to police the suspects exited the car and the third passenger reached into an open window and sprayed what is believed to be pepper spray into the vehicle and towards the driver. The suspects then left the car.

""You know the pepper spray that was sprayed inside my car it was everywhere it was literally everywhere"" said Khadka.

Subhakar reached out to Uber asking for help to get his car cleaned. He sent ABC7 screenshots of his correspondence with them. He said at first UBER only offered him $20.

A San Francisco arrest warrant had already been issued for King for her role in a March 7 assault of a Uber driver in San Francisco. She faces charges that include assault with a caustic chemical assault and battery conspiracy and violation of health and safety code.

A second woman -- 24-year-old Arna Kimiai -- remained at large early Saturday although her legal counsel has told San Francisco police that she intends to turn herself into the authorities. An arrest warrant has been issued.

The two women were passengers in a Uber driven by Subhakar Khadka when a confrontation erupted. The incident was captured on in-car video and has since gone viral.

KPIX 5 first reported on the story Monday night. In the video three women are seen in the back seat berating the driver using profanities. At one point the woman now identified as Kimiai who coughed on the driver also ripped off the facemask he was wearing.

Warning: Disturbing video explicit language (Source: Subhakar Khadka)

Khadka said he had pulled over to tell the women to wear facemasks and the driver is heard telling the women to get out of his car. The video begins with one woman telling the driver ""F--- the masks!"" and then repeatedly coughing at him.

Both Uber and Lyft have banned Kimiai in the aftermath of the incident.

Uber also issued a statement early Thursday evening thanking the police department after the arrests were announced.

""We thank the San Francisco Police Department for their swift action. Uber does not tolerate racism or hate in any form against any community. When one community is being attacked we are all being attacked. We are shocked and saddened by the recent increase in anti-Asian hate particularly when it affects a driver or rider. In this case we have banned all three riders and have been in contact with Mr. Khadka to offer our support"" the Uber statement said.

Kimiai also posted video from her perspective behind Khadka where she claims he tried to get her and her friends to exit his car while on the freeway.

Her Instagram account @keepinupwforeign posted a series of videos that appeared to precede the incident on Sunday but the account has since been made private.

Kimiai also apparently posted a video on social media in which she expressed some remorse for her actions but continues to rail against and blame the driver for ending her ride and demanding her group leave his vehicle.

In that video Kimiai threatens to sue Uber and ends the video by saying ""That's why I take Lyft.""

More than 800 drivers for the New York-based company claim Via wrongly classified them as independent contractors in a bid to deny them higher pay and job protections.

The dispute is similar to ones with embattled ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft who have fought against efforts to force them to consider their drivers employees who get benefits.

Via allegedly advertised high earnings for those who signed up to drive but failed to make clear how much the gig would cost drivers say two such workers who insist in a recent Manhattan Supreme Court filing they earned less than minimum wage.

After taxes and costs Gideon Itenberg of Queens claims in the legal filing he earned just $4.69 an hour driving for Via well below the $15 a hour minimum wage in New York City adding the company never explained the “multitude of fees and costs that Via either refused to pay for passed on to me [to] cover or deducted from my earnings.”

Itenberg signed up in November 2017 to earn “desperately needed” extra cash.

Itenberg and driver Felix Lam who says he earned just $9 to $11 an hour for Via are now fighting for their day in court claiming Via forced them to agree to arbitrate any dispute behind closed doors but wants each driver to pay at least $17000 in fees first.

The ride-sharing company which operates in more than 20 countries and also partners with governments and schools to provide transportation has refused to let the drivers band together to fight their claims and reduce costs.

“I lose no matter what I do” Itenberg lamented in the litigation which seeks to force Via to pay the arbitration costs or a judge’s permission to pursue their claims collectively or in a different forum.

“Via refuses to submit to arbitration refuses to pay the costs to commence arbitration and … the costs of arbitration are intentionally absurdly and unnecessarily high compared to nearly any alternative” attorney Marc Held noted in the legal filing.

Via claims the drivers complaint “is filled with inaccuracies” and it has consistently paid its drivers above the minimum amount set by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission and more than other ride sharing companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL21hbGF5c2lhLWtpbmctdWJlci1pbnN0YWdyYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malaysia King and Arna Kimiai's Video Attacking Their Uber Driver Went Viral,"Home > News 'Uber Girls' Arna Kimiai and Malaysia King Are Turning Themselves In By Chris Barilla Mar. 14 2021 Updated 5:48 p.m. ET Source: Instagram

Malaysia King and Arna Kimiai's Uber video went viral on Instagram and Twitter.

The now-famed altercation took part when Malaysia Arna and an unnamed third woman were picked up by Subhakar at the intersection of San Bruno and Felton street in San Francisco. The driver decided to end the ride early after asking the women to wear their masks in the vehicle.

When they didn't comply Subhakar opted to end the ride early causing Malaysia and Arna to berate and assault him. As can be seen in the above footage the two women yelled took his phone and coughed maskless on Subhakar.

Who exactly are Malaysia King and Arna Kimiai?

There's not much information available about Arna and even less available about Malaysia. Arna prior to deactivating her Instagram account seemed to be an aspiring influencer going by the name @keepingupwithforeign.

She frequently posted photos of her extravagant travels (many during the COVID-19 pandemic) and designer goods that she owns. Once the initial video from the Uber went viral Arna was the one who went live multiple times on the app to defend her and Malaysia attempting to paint Subhakar as the bad guy in it all.

Nonetheless both women have effectively scrubbed their online presence for the time being. This may have been a smart move for the clearly-outspoken duo whose legal issues are only just beginning.

Malaysia and Arna are facing some serious criminal charges now.

Per San Francisco Police Lt. Tracy McCray the department is charging the girls with assault and robbery in connection with the Uber incident. Malaysia King was already arrested shortly after the incident and it appears as though Arna is preparing to turn herself in."

Already available on the beauty retail giant Ulta Beauty’s website as well as 100 physical stores across the U.S.’Gossip Girl’ and ‘Frozen’ star Kristen Bell is all set to expand her vegan skincare brand Happy Dance that features CBD-infused products at over 500 stores of beauty retail giant Ulta Beauty across the country.

Back in October of last year Kristen Bell in collaboration with Lord Jones a leading U.S.-based CBD products brand launched her brand Happy Dance via DTC sales.

Both brands are owned by Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group and Happy Dance consists of CBD-infused products like a bath bomb body butter and an ‘all-purpose coconut melt’.

Just recently Bell launched her brand online on Ulta Beauty’s website as well as at 100 Ulta stores. Now she is all set to expand her brand at the all 500 of the beauty giant’s U.S. stores.

CBD stands for cannabidiol one of the compounds found naturally in hemp plants and unlike some of the other compounds like THC Bell mentioned that CBD is not intoxicating meaning it will not get you high.

One study found that despite having no psychotropic effects CBD can stimulate endo-cannabinoid system which helps maintain our body’s natural physical and chemical balance a state known as homeostasis. This could also help our muscles recover as it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Bell discovered the qualities of CBD a few years ago when her hairstylist used a Lord Jones cream on her shoulders after a haircut. Though CBD became a part of Bell’s life she found that its usefulness was yet unexplored in the market and that’s how Happy Dance was born.

In an interview with Forbes Bell said that she contacted Lord Jones and just asked them if they could create a product together that demystifies CBD. “I didn’t want to play into the stoner trope or feel too clinical but that feels cheeky and a little more me and at a price point that can be more accessible. I really wanted to allow people who had not used it before or who had not been exposed to it the accessibility and in any of my entrepreneurial ventures that’s always been the priority.”

The brand’s products feature CBD from full-spectrum hemp extract meaning that the extract features elements of the whole plant such as terpenes and rare cannabinoids in its addition to CBD and a full-spectrum hemp extract can also contain less than 0.3% THC which is the legal limit of what will not get you high.

I contacted Lord Jones and just asked them if we could create a product together that demystifies CBD. I didn’t want to play into the stoner trope or feel too clinical but that feels cheeky and a little more me and at a price point that can be more accessible. I really wanted to allow people who had not used it before or who had not been exposed to it the accessibility and in any of my entrepreneurial ventures that’s always been the priority Kristen Bell Owner of Happy Dance

According to 2020 data from Surfside a provider of advertising and data solutions focused on the cannabis industry women make up 59% of CBD consumers.

Bell has been vocal about some of the benefits she has experienced in her own life using CBD for instance taking a bath with the CBD bath bomb makes her feel a calm sense of wellbeing. She also uses the coconut oil on her temples and cuticles which helps her feel at peace especially when she is in ‘mom’ mode.

Bell said that the partnership with Ulta will help the brand reach more people. “Accessibility means two things. It means a price point that you can afford but it also means availability on a shelf where you can purchase it at a store near you. So the partnership with Ulta is what makes that dream a reality.”

Happy Dance will donate some of the proceeds to the New Way of Life Reentry Project which helps women rebuild their lives after prison and also look to help communities that have disproportionally been affected by marijuana-related offenses. “It was not lost on me that the BIPOC community has been adversely affected for marijuana-based crimes throughout history. And because CBD is pulled from the same strand of the hemp plant we thought it was the perfect chance to donate 1% of profits back to this amazing organization.”

Several celebrities are recognizing the importance of sustainable products and are launching vegan product lines in the market. For instance actress activist and entrepreneur Jada Pinkett Smith recently debuted Hey Humans a vegan gender-neutral and 99% plastic-free beauty care line and Aquaman’ and Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa unveiled a sustainable vegan shoe line that incorporates upcycled and biodegradable materials in its footwear.

Bollywood & Hollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra Jonas founded a new vegan haircare line Anomaly that is not only free of parabens and sulfates but also comes in 100% recyclable packaging and singer-songwriter and actress Selena Gomez also launched her vegan makeup brand Rare Beauty last September.

Aside from shoes and beauty celebrities are also developing vegan F&B products such as Cameron Diaz and Katherine Power’s new vegan wine brand and Kate Hudson’s new range of plant-based nutrition supplements.

Happy Dance products are available to buy on Ulta’s website and select stores with prices starting from US$15.

McCammond apologised for the tweets in 2019 and again this week calling them “offensive idiotic” posts. On Thursday she posted a new statement to Twitter in which she said: “I’ve dedicated my career to giving a voice to the voiceless and the last thing I’d ever want is to make anyone – especially our Asian brothers and sisters in particular – feel more invisible” she wrote. “And I know that that is a unique source of pain in all of this too: That historically the AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community has been left out or ignored in critical conversations around race racism justice and equality. I am determined to play a part in changing that.”

After Teen Vogue staffers put out a statement earlier this week to say they were in conversations with publisher Condé Nast about her recent appointment to the role the magazine’s former editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth appeared on CBS’s The Talk on Wednesday and condemned McCammond’s past actions.

“Everybody knows I was a former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue” she said “so I have to put that out there. That aside it doesn’t matter – her tweets and the sentiments behind them were racist and abhorrent and indefensible period. And I think at a time like this when there is a call for accountability around anti-Asian sentiment and just racist violent actions against Asian people we need to speak up.”

The tweets resurfaced at a time when hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise in part due to racist attitudes to the coronavirus pandemic. Last year 2500 incidents were reported.

Additionally the controversy appears to be causing problems with Teen Vogue’s advertisers. The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Ulta Beauty had “paused” an estimated seven-figure advertising campaign with the magazine because of McCammond’s tweets.

“Diversity and inclusion are core values at Ulta Beauty – and always have been” a spokesperson told the publication. “Our current spend with Teen Vogue is paused as we work with Condé Nast to evaluate the situation and determine next steps regarding our partnership.”

In the past Ulta Beauty have been accused of racial profiling in their stores (in response the company said these “accounts are disappointing and contrary to our training and policies. We stand for equality inclusivity and acceptance and strive to create a space that is welcoming to all.”).

The Daily Beast also reported that there continued to be “top level” concern within Condé Nast’s advertising team over the fallout from the tweets.

McCammond was previously a reporter for the political website Axios. She found herself in the national spotlight last month when her relationship with TJ Ducklo was at the centre of a scandal over his behaviour towards a reporter which led him to resign as a communications aide to Joe Biden.

Last Friday in a statement to announce her hiring Anna Wintour global editorial director of the Condé Nast said: “Alexi has the powerful curiosity and confidence that embodies the best of our next generation of leaders … I’m so very pleased that she will be bringing her expertise and talents to our team.” McCammond will begin her role on 24 March.

The Guardian has reached out to Condé Nast for additional comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvYmVzdC1jZWxlYnJpdHktYmVhdXR5LWJyYW5kcy00MTQ0NTY3L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvYmVzdC1jZWxlYnJpdHktYmVhdXR5LWJyYW5kcy00MTQ0NTY3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Best Beauty Products from Celebrity Brands by Jennifer Lopez Issa Rae and More,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.

Some in Hollywood — including Black-Ish‘s Tracee Ellis Ross and Enola Holmes actress and producer Millie Bobby Brown (who recently dropped a Converse collaboration) — team with a brand incubator to turn their vision into reality. Others such as Hidden Figures star Taraji P. Henson package their tried-and-true recipes into a namesake label.

Rosy cheeks and bronzed features are staples of Jaclyn Hill's signature makeup look.

That being said it's no surprise that Jaclyn Cosmetics recently launched a line of seven blush and bronzer duos. The collection was first released on March 2 via her brand's website and it's now sold both online and at some Ulta Beauty stores.

I put two palettes from the line to the test and while I think they're pretty for spring I probably wouldn't buy them again. Here's why.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Jaclyn Hill's blush and bronzer powders are sold in 7 different duos

When Jaclyn Cosmetics first released photos of its face palettes I was a bit confused. At least five of the palettes seemed to include light shades and in my opinion many of them looked identical to one another.

With that concern in mind I figured the purple-hued Lilac Love/Top Tan duo and the orange-toned Warm Flush/Golden Goddess palettes would be different enough from each other.

The latter palette includes a shimmering peach blush alongside a warm-toned bronzer.

The lighter palette is described on the Jaclyn Cosmetics website as featuring a ""satin lilac"" blush and a ""fair to light"" bronzer with neutral undertones.

While the latter description seemed accurate to the naked eye I was a little disappointed to see that the Lilac Love blush looked more pink than purple both in the pan and on the skin.

The powders are undeniably pretty but it takes a lot of effort to see results

With one tap of a brush into the Lilac Love/Top Tan palette bronzer went everywhere.

It should be noted that product fallout is normal for soft powders but it seemed like more of the bronzer landed across the palette blush and even on my hands than it did on my brush. The blush in my experience didn't have this problem.

Luckily I found the powders to be a bit more manageable on my face.

Though I couldn't see much color after applying my first layer of bronzer I spent some time building the product and eventually achieved a minimal contour effect. The Lilac Love blush was slightly more visible upon first swipe but I still needed more layers to achieve a wash of color.

I wasn't overly impressed by the finished look — especially considering the work required to achieve it — but I would still wear it on minimal-makeup days.

The Warm Flush/Golden Goddess palette worked similarly in my experience. I needed a few layers of each powder — albeit less than the lighter palette — to achieve bold color on my skin.

I personally prefer stronger blush looks so I really enjoyed the Warm Flush shade. The Golden Goddess bronzer also looked nice though I didn't find it much different than other powders I already own.

Although I like these Jaclyn Cosmetics palettes I can't justify spending nearly $40 on them

There's no doubt that the Jaclyn Cosmetics blush and bronzer duos look pretty on the skin. They're extremely soft and they seem to create a blurring effect that leaves your skin with a satin finish.

That being said it took too much work in my opinion to create a natural-looking wash of color on my cheeks with these products.

I typically enjoy buildable makeup as it gives you more control and flexibility — but these powders are more frustrating than versatile. And when a brand has a history of messy makeup launches as Jaclyn Cosmetics does expensive and subpar products don't leave the best impression.

At the end of the day these two-shade palettes aren't bad but they're also far from great. Rather than spending $36 in the future I'd rather stick to my drugstore favorites."

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmlxdWUubmV0L2xpZmUvMjAyMS8wMy8xMy91cHMtY2VvLWNhcm9sLXRvbWUtb24td29tZW5zLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS CEO Carol Tomé on women’s leadership,"On Mar. 4 Carol Tomé of United Parcel Service (UPS) engaged in a virtual discussion about women in leadership roles with Maryam Alavi Dean of the Scheller College of Business.



Tomé became the first woman CEO of UPS in June of last year having served as a board member since 2003.



As of 2020 she is one of 37 female Fortune 500 CEOs in the world making her position rare and inspiring.



Before becoming CEO Tomé had retired from her position within UPS and was spending time on her 550-acre farm.



According to Tomé this new role was not something she was looking for or expecting but she was offered the role because of her long history with the company and their shared values.



“I thought it would be a good fit” Tomé said. “The stock price had been flat for six years and I thought I could get in there and make some money. I really like to make money and I really like to create value.”



When describing her leadership approach and philosophy Tomé praised above all else the inverted management pyramid.



In this system leaders are at the bottom and bear the weight of the company so that they can empower their employees to serve customers better.



Tomé emphasized the power of servant leadership and of working on the frontlines rather than sitting at the top of the corporate ladder removed from the company base.



Among her main inspirations are Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank co-founders of The Home Depot.



She commended their insistence on being value-based leaders — on applying values important to our culture to their business goals. Tomé spoke specifically about her vision for the role of business in current environmental issues.



“I think the purpose of the corporation is to tend to the needs of all of its stakeholders” Tomé said. “At UPS we are committed to diversity equity and inclusion. We want to give back to our communities and are proud to be a first responder. We believe we need a healthier planet. Our drivers drive over two billion miles a year but despite and because of this we have invested in driving down our carbon consumption. We are investing in carbon neutral activities especially in electric vehicles. We were also the first to be authorized by the FAA to have a drone aircraft.”



On the value of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace Tomé stressed its simple advantages for a healthier business.



“If we look like the customers we serve it’s good for business” Tomé said. “It’s also just the right thing to do. The George Floyd killing this past summer happened as I was onboarded as CEO. I was ashamed and mad and I wanted to turn my anger into action through living values. There’s no place for racism or bigotry at UPS. DEI should be a strategic imperative for our company. We in fact named a DEI executive who reports to me.”



Tomé highlighted the importance of listening to the whole UPS community even as a company with 540000 employees. Although unable to meet every person she insists on holding meetings with workers further down the corporate ladder. In doing this she can listen to what her employees are worried and excited about which is especially important to learn as a new leader.



Crucially UPS is heavily involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.



“Most people don’t realize this but we’ve been in the healthcare logistics business for 15 years” Tomé said. “We’re an expert in cold-chain logistics and in the last decade have handled vaccines for smallpox and influenza. We got ahead of the COVID vaccine. We have freezer farms in Louisville and in the Netherlands. We invested in the manufacturing of dry-ice because the Pfizer vaccine needs to be frozen. We also reserved capacity in our network so that when the first vaccine was approved we could ship it. It’s incredibly complicated but it’s exciting.”



Speaking about her vision for the future Tomé said that the company wants to lean into the experiences that customers want. They recently completed a mission to deliver packages faster than ever before for small and medium-sized companies.



Tomé has plans to expand UPS’s presence in international markets which she says are underpenetrated.



She also intimated her plans for continuing remote work even as business opens back up. This would reduce commute times for employees and free up office space.



“Our goal is to make sure we’re around for the next 114 years” Tomé said. “We’ve got to be nimble agile and think about things in a different way than we have in the past. You should think about us as a technology company as well as a logistics company. We have drones in the sky autonomous vehicles on the road and robots unloading vehicles. Technology is our secret sauce I think.”



As the first female CEO of UPS Tomé shared her advice for emerging female leaders.



“Don’t be too planful” Tomé said. “You may miss out on an opportunity. I started out as a banker — never did I think I would be the head of a logistics company. But because of my open-mindedness I’ve worked with some really cool leaders along the way.”



“The second piece of advice is to build your network. Women often find that they’re balancing work and family and aren’t taking time to build out their network. You can do that through activities with your church with clubs you’re in or with your school. You can create your own personal board of advisors. If I run into a challenge I want advice for I just go into my network. I’ve been a part of some very cool things and frequently roles that women haven’t historically held.”



About past regrets Tomé talked about not understanding the importance of surrounding herself with people who were smarter faster and better than herself. She made a point of the importance of the team rather than the individual. Unique to Tomé are her quirky personal habits that she says contribute her to efficiency as a leader.



After waking up at 4:30 a.m. she has a Diet Coke works out and then answers all of the emails that came in during the night. She also reads the Bible every day calling it her daily source of strength.



As a piece of advice for older women in new roles she told listeners to not try to be anybody else.



“Just be your authentic self” Tomé said. “Make every day a learning day especially as an older person. Let younger people teach you about technology and simple solutions.”



“You’re not competing with younger people — you’re learning from them.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The good news is that you can rent the ranch so you and up to 34 friends and family can have the perfect vacation or memorable event.

Located just minutes away from downtown Aspen the 160-acre retreat is known as Dunbar Ranch — named after the character Lieutenant John Dunbar in Costner’s movie Dances With Wolves. The ranch is situated in “pristine wilderness with its own private lake and unparalleled views up Independence Pass over the North Star Nature Preserve along to the east side of Aspen Mountain” realtor Amy Mottier explains.

Main Lodge

Dunbar Ranch which Mottier calls “the ultimate luxury retreat” has three residences. In addition to the main residence there is a lake house and a river house. All three “offer stunning and comfortable spaces for you and your family to experience the true Colorado lifestyle” Mottier says. Altogether there are 12 bedrooms and eight bathrooms.

It’s the main house however that is the star attraction. The 5800-square-foot house has six bedrooms and six bathrooms with “an elegant-rustic aesthetic that matches the wilderness outside” Architectural Digest notes.

“Exposed wood columns and ceiling beams help to create a cabin-like atmosphere while high-end materials elevate the aesthetic to something fit for a Hollywood star” the article continues. The master suite even has a trapdoor that opens to stone steps leading to a private jacuzzi with views of the Continental Divide.

Things To Do

Once you’re at the ranch there’s plenty to do while taking in the majestic scenery. For instance in the summer you can take a walk run or bike ride on the numerous trails. You can also spend the day using kayaks canoes and paddleboards on the lake or even fish from the dock. What’s more since the ranch belongs to Kevin Costner who has been in several baseball movies there’s even a baseball field with a view of Independence Pass.

In the winter given its location it comes as no surprise that the ranch is a ski lover’s paradise. It has its own sledding hill so you can tube all day as well as at night. Weather permitting you can also ice fish on the lake and cross-country ski on paved paths around the property. And when the day is done there — of course — are three hot tubs so you can relax.

What It Costs

By now you probably have two questions the first being “Why isn’t Kevin Costner at his ranch?” The answer is that while Costner does occasionally visit the ranch he has been spending most of his time on location in Montana filming his TV show Yellowstone.

The next big question — naturally — is “How much will it cost to rent Dunbar Ranch?” Mottier told TravelAwaits that “If you have an event which comes with a week stay including all three homes the price is $350000 plus service fee and tax.”

While the price is steep Mottier notes that the ranch has “majestic views” of the Continental Divide that make Dunbar Ranch “an amazing venue for corporate events weddings and family reunions.”

UNH,UnitedHealth Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzEzLzQtbG93LXJpc2stdmFuZ3VhcmQtZXRmcy1wZXJmZWN0LWluY29tZS1pbnZlc3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Low-Risk Vanguard ETFs Perfect for Income Investors,"Sick of earning little to no interest? These four Vanguard funds are just the fix.

The past year hasn't been kind to income investors. Next-to-nothing interest rates have translated to next-to-nothing returns on traditionally safe fixed-income investments like bonds and CDs. To get returns that can outpace inflation it's essential to invest in stocks.

Vanguard has a number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are perfect for those seeking low-risk investment income. ETFs give you the instant diversification that's almost impossible to achieve by handpicking your own stocks. And the beauty of Vanguard ETFs is that they have some of the lowest fees out there. Here are four Vanguard funds income investors should seriously consider.

1. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ)

The Vanguard Real Estate Investment ETF (VNQ 0.95%) offers a way to invest across the entire U.S. real estate market without buying up physical property. It invests mostly in equity real estate investment trusts (REITs) which own and operate income-generating commercial real estate.

Investing in REITs is a savvy move for income investors because they're legally required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends. The fund also includes a handful of real estate development and management companies.

With $61.4 billion in assets it's by far the largest real estate ETF in the U.S. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.12% which is cheaper than the 0.48% average for REIT ETFs. A 0.12% expense ratio means that just 12 cents of every $1000 you invest is going toward the fund's management fees.

The VNQ has an enticing dividend yield of 3.31% as of Jan. 31. That's more than double the 1.53% that the S&P 500 offers.

2. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM 0.31%) is the most popular dividend ETF in the U.S. It tracks an index of 410 companies with REITs excluded based on their dividend forecast for the next 12 months. Its five largest holdings as of Jan. 31 2021 were:

Johnson & Johnson

JP Morgan Chase

Procter and Gamble

Bank of America

Intel

Although the fund doesn't specifically screen stocks based on risk it tends to be less risky compared to the broad market. That's because companies that consistently pay dividends tend to be relatively stable.

The fund's dividend yield is 3.05% as of Feb. 28. But it also offers decent potential gains. As of that same date the ETF delivered a one-year total return of 19.68%. It has an expense ratio of just 0.06% making it a bargain compared to the 0.41% average for similar funds.

3. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)

The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 0.44%) invests in companies that not only pay dividends but also have a history of increasing their payments. It tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index which consists of 212 stocks known as Dividend Achievers because they have at least 10 years of consecutive dividend hikes. The VIG's five largest holdings as of Jan. 31 were:

Microsoft

Walmart

Johnson & Johnson

Procter and Gamble

UnitedHealth Group

Stocks with a history of increasing their dividends are attractive to retirees who are often hit hard by inflation. For investors in general though a steadily rising payout is appealing because it indicates the company's finances are stable enough to support that dividend growth.

The VIG also has a super-low expense ratio of 0.06%. Its yield of 1.66% is lower than Vanguard's High Dividend Yield ETF but one-year total returns as of Feb. 28 were higher at 23.62%.

4. Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)

The final fund to consider if you're seeking a low-risk investment with solid income-generating potential is the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV 0.32%). The fund tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index.

The index starts with stocks that make up the top 85% of the U.S. stock market by market capitalization. It then uses metrics such as the price-to-book ratio earnings to price and dividend-to-price ratio to identify value stocks which appear to be underpriced.

Income investors tend to like value stocks because they typically have stable revenue and earnings and most pay dividends. The fund consists of 328 holdings the largest of which are:

Johnson & Johnson

Berkshire Hathaway

JP Morgan Chase



Procter and Gamble

UnitedHealth Group



The VTV's one-year total returns were 21.34% as of Feb. 28 and its dividend yield was 2.44%. The expense ratio is the lowest for the ETFs discussed here at 0.04%.

Like the other funds on this list the VTV doesn't offer huge growth potential. But the stability of its holdings and its low fees make it a strong choice for those seeking investment income.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When Sloane’s 70-year-old grandfather fell and broke his leg and hip a few years ago the family scrambled to find emergency care in the small rural town. Now technology innovations in the country have transformed the care older people can receive. Sloane’s grandmother wears a fall detection bracelet gifted from the family and she is enrolled in a community smart ageing programme. Her risk of falling alone without someone knowing is now much lower.

Telemedicine platforms of city hospitals and community platforms that embed monitoring and alert system and directories of health service providers for older people living alone are just some of the measures that China has been rolling out in the nation’s efforts to harness technological innovation to become an age-friendly society.

Much effort has been made in China to establish an integrated care system for older people to link together at-home care nursing home care treatment and palliative care and local governments have long been encouraged to pilot tailored care services. These approaches are aligned with WHO’s ICOPE guidelines which provide a framework for health services and key approaches that ensure quality integrated person-centered care for older people. In addition recent central-level policies strongly advocate for the use of digital interventions to innovate aged services.[1][2]

The Action Plan for the Development of Smart Elderly Care Industry (2017–2020) was developed to encourage the private sector to expand supply for smart ageing. Wearables portable gadgets for health monitoring self-diagnostic medical devices elderly monitoring and alert systems robot butlers and data-driven smart care were identified as focus areas for product innovations. Service innovation meanwhile had a focus on non-communicable disease management personalized care at home telemedicine domestic assistance and the digital transformation of nursing homes.

The use of big data and platform technologies to provide personalized care has become the trend in community care facilities for older people. Virtual nursing homes a model which pools together care resources for older people to request as needed have been scaled and localized in many other cities across China throughout last decade. These have recently taken onboard IoT-based (Internet of Things) system for older people which ensures their safety provides early warnings and personalized support to help them overcome big and small everyday problems[3]. In Shanghai one district has adopted a hybrid approach that combines online service provision informed by a big data platform with offline specialists who can provide last-mile solutions to those out of online reach; more than 5000 older people living independently have been given smart devices that alert the platform in case of emergency.[4]

Coupled with demand-stimulating policies[5] and pledges for building age-friendly communities[6] both the supply and demand for smart ageing care has experienced strong growth. With an 18 percent annual compound growth from 2017 to 2019 the smart ageing sector was valued at more than 4000 billion Yuan in 2020.[7] By the end of 2019 every 1 in 18 Chinese is aged 60 and above and the number will continue to grow. The silver economy will inevitably boom.

The benefits of technological innovation to support age-friendly health systems are one side of the story. More recently COVID-19 revealed the costs of the digital exclusion that’s been creeping in and made more urgent the on-going efforts to help older people adapt to pervasive digitization.

Leaving no one behind

When chunyun (mass travel during Chinese New Year) in China approached in January Xiang Fei and his wife decided to come to Shanghai to spend the holiday with their daughter also to seek treatments for a few chronic conditions that came with age. As the couple walked towards the exit of Pudong International Airport they were gently reminded to show their health codes – the essential digital footprint on their mobile phone that records whether they have been in high-risk areas over the last 21 days and possible exposure to COVID-19.

The use of a digital health code has been firmly established for public services in China since mobility control was loosened after the extended CNY holiday of 2020. For older people like Xiang Fei and his wife in their 70s who still have sufficient cognitive capacity to learn and use a new digital app they found themselves able to overcome the digital challenges of travel this new technology presented. For others who do not have access to smart devices and health code apps they too would also be able to overcome the digital barrier thanks to government assistance at passenger transit stations a result of the latest guideline[8] ensuring that older people would not be effectively prevented from traveling.

Such age-friendly service came after the introduction of an implementation guide[9] by the State Council to promote digital inclusion of older people in the increasingly digitized society where access to smart phones have simplified young adults’ life but blocked older people’s access to everyday services such as digital public services car hailing online banking and telemedicine[10].

In the guide stakeholders and governments were urged to develop roadmaps timelines and solutions to bridge the digital gap. Service sectors and providers were instructed to take a two-pronged approach restoring non-digital service access and redesigning digital services to be truly elderly-inclusive. Car-hailing apps were encouraged to develop telephone booking services; voice navigation and facial recognition along with human agents were recommended to healthcare facilities; smart devices and digital apps will develop special versions for older people; and telecom service providers set out to further expand coverage in previously unreached areas all in a bid to leave no one behind.

By innovating for care and creating a more inclusive digital environment China is promoting full and independent social participation of older people. For Sloane’s grandma and the Fei access to these services will give them more autonomy to be healthier more engaged and active in the communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy93b2xsb25nb25nLXBvcnQta2VtYmxhLXdvbWVuLW9mLXN0ZWVsLWZpbG0tcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Wollongong Jobs for Women Campaign Shows the Power of Working-Class Solidarity,"“The steelworks just dominated the place” says Lou-anne a protagonist in the new documentary Women of Steel (2020) directed by Robynne Murphy and produced by the Jobs for Women Film Producers Group. Lou-anne is referring to the Port Kembla steelworks. Owned by BHP/AIS during the 1980s it was the major employer in Wollongong. These steelworks were also the site of the historic antidiscrimination campaign documented in Women of Steel. Lou-anne arrived in Wollongong in 1980 accompanied by three other young socialists: Robynne (the film’s director) Louise and Diana. Their goal was to organize women workers in heavy industry. As they soon discovered the Port Kembla steelworks’ domination wasn’t just economic — it was visible across the whole city. “With the steam coming out . . . it was like a sort of inferno.”

No Jobs for Women Wollongong an industrial city with a strong organized labor movement was a prime target for socialists who aspired in the late 1970s and ’80s to bring their politics directly to workers. “I think there’s only been one time that a Liberal candidate has entered Parliament here” a representative of the Working Women’s Charter tells the filmmakers. “He slipped through the net.” A large population of recent migrants from postwar Europe also called Wollongong home attracted by the promise of industrial jobs. Soon after arriving and applying for jobs at the steelworks the aspiring socialist organizers discovered that BHP systematically discriminated against women. The company typically offered men a job soon after applying but only hired women to work in the canteen. Many women applying for jobs at BHP had migrated from Soviet bloc countries where it wasn’t unusual for women to work in heavy industry. In Wollongong they often languished on the employment-office waiting list for years. The young organizers saw an opportunity to mobilize around the demand that BHP hire women and the Jobs for Women campaign was born. Beginning with a “tent embassy” on Wollongong’s main road the campaign quickly gained momentum eventually leading to a historic antidiscrimination court case. As the campaign grew its scope broadened beyond jobs and began to tackle the broader problem of gender discrimination at work. “We started to realize that discrimination wasn’t just a personal thing it was a systemic thing” says Robynne. This is one of the film’s strengths: by uniting the personal and systematic dimensions of sexism it persuasively weaves the story of the Jobs for Women campaign into the broader landscape of late twentieth-century Western feminism. To the credit of the filmmakers Women of Steel does not focus solely on the organizers as the architects of the campaign. Rather it showcases their voices and stories alongside those of the migrant women who made up the campaign’s rank and file. These women were not just passive participants in the campaign itself. As Lou-anne points out it was their idea to organize a public demonstration to increase the pressure on BHP. This was a powerful strategy. Two days before the demonstration BHP caved giving jobs to all thirty-four of the women who had registered as complainants under antidiscrimination legislation. “I feel in life you have to fight” says Alicia one of the complainants. “If people say you are going to fight against a giant I don’t care. I have to do it.”

There’s Only One Form of Membership in the Union One of the most striking aspects of Women of Steel is its portrayal of the solidarity that grew between the young Anglo-Australian organizers and the migrant women of Wollongong. The linguistic and cultural barriers to solidarity were real. To overcome them campaign organizers ensured that leaflets were printed in sixteen languages and that interpreters were present in meetings. This highlights the broader question of anti-migrant racism. While most of the women featured in Women of Steel would today be considered white at the time they were subjected to racism as were many Europeans who came to Australia in the twentieth century. This anti-migrant racism was endemic at BHP. Footage from a protest outside an annual general meeting shows a BHP shareholder telling news cameras that “all these people have got the same type of face. They’re foreign and I’m sure if you went in among them half of them wouldn’t know how to speak English.” This didn’t matter to members of the Jobs for Women campaign who became friends and comrades through their shared experience of struggle. Indeed the beating heart of Women of Steel is its moving portrayal of this experience.Campaigners built solidarity sleeping in the tent embassy together on the coldest night of the year or by raucously taking over an entire train carriage on the way up to Sydney for court hearings. “It was a good experience I reckon” one of the campaigners tells a news reporter. “We all stick together we understand each other support each other.” The campaign also won international solidarity including from a delegation of Cuban women visiting Australia. “One of the Cuban women got up [at a dinner] and she said ‘You’re going to win!’” Robynne recounts. “And I’ll never forget that. Because it was great solidarity and I think we really needed that.” Solidarity also flourished between the women who were eventually hired at BHP and their male colleagues. There were instances of sexual harassment and some men were skeptical of the “feminist types” hired as a result of the Jobs for Women campaign. Despite this the male Port Kembla steelworkers soon recognized their common interest with the women in part because of their strong tradition of unionism. Robynne tells the story of her first day at work in 1981: Everyone came up and they said Oh you’re one of the women! You beat the company! . . . And within a few weeks I was asked to be a delegate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3RyYXVtYS1pbmZvcm1lZC1hcHByb2FjaC1hLXNvbHV0aW9uLXRvLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1pbi1uaWdlcmlhLXByb2YtYWtpbmRvdHVuLW1lcmluby_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFuZ3VhcmRuZ3IuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvdHJhdW1hLWluZm9ybWVkLWFwcHJvYWNoLWEtc29sdXRpb24tdG8tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLWluLW5pZ2VyaWEtcHJvZi1ha2luZG90dW4tbWVyaW5vL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trauma-informed approach: A solution to mental health care in Nigeria – Prof Akindotun Merino,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/03/trauma-informed-approach-a-solution-to-mental-health-care-in-nigeria-prof-akindotun-merino/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3RyYXVtYS1pbmZvcm1lZC1hcHByb2FjaC1hLXNvbHV0aW9uLXRvLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1pbi1uaWdlcmlhLXByb2YtYWtpbmRvdHVuLW1lcmluby_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFuZ3VhcmRuZ3IuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvdHJhdW1hLWluZm9ybWVkLWFwcHJvYWNoLWEtc29sdXRpb24tdG8tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLWluLW5pZ2VyaWEtcHJvZi1ha2luZG90dW4tbWVyaW5vL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY2l0aW5ld3Nyb29tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL2docy10YWtlcy1zdGVwcy10by1hdHRyYWN0LWFuZC1yZXRhaW4taGVhbHRoLXBlcnNvbm5lbC1pbi1kZXByaXZlZC1hcmVhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GHS takes steps to attract and retain health personnel in deprived areas,"The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has developed a new policy aimed at attracting and retaining health professionals in deprived areas of the country.

In line with the new poliy the Regional Health Directors have thus been tasked to ensure that the policy worked effectively in their respective Regions to achieve its intended objective.

Dr. Yao Yeboah the immediate Past Chairman of the GHS Council who made this known underscored the need to ensure equitable distribution of health professionals as Ghana sought to achieve universal health coverage.

He was speaking at the opening of a two-day Central Regional health sector 2020 annual performance review in Cape Coast.

The performance review was on the theme: “Achieving universal health coverage containing the COVID-19 pandemic improving good governance and services; the role of stakeholders”.

“The issues of having very few professionals in deprived areas has been on the drawing table of the GHS for some time now. Accra alone has got 30 percent of all doctors in Ghana but does not have 30 percent of the population of Ghana” Dr. Yeboah indicated.

“One hospital in Greater Accra has more doctors than in the Upper West Region. That is unfair” he added and said the new policy would improve health delivery if holistically implemented.

Under it health professionals who opted to serve in deprived areas of the country would among other things have quicker promotion and opportunities for further training compared to their colleagues in the cities.

They would also be automatically transferred to the city after three years of service in a deprived community.

“If staff is sent to a deprived area the staff will not be condemned to life term imprisonment there maximum three years the staff should not request for transfer but automatically be brought to the city and be replaced. This has worked in some institutions and could work in the GHS too” Dr. Yeboah assured.

Dr Anthony Adofo Ofosu Deputy Director-General of the GHS said the Service was finalizing plans to set up and strengthen systems to help address staff needs like compensation benefits and training packages.

This he emphasized would ensure that staff were more skillful efficient motivated equitably distributed and well protected during the delivery of services especially in this COVID-19 pandemic era.

Going forward he said the Service would focus on promoting opportunities for health research which was paramount in the provision of evidence-based health policies and practices.

“One other area that the pandemic has brought to the fore is the importance of health research. There is strong evidence that a research-informed health system with a research-aware workforce ultimately results in better outcomes for patients” he said.",,,

A few hundred people were on hand for the event at Alonzo Weaver Park in South Memphis which featured speeches from Gore U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen community activists and landowners that would be affected by the pipeline’s path.

The proposed crude oil pipeline a joint venture from Plains All American and Valero Energy would span 49 miles. On its current route it would be constructed through predominately Black communities in South Memphis and over a Memphis Light Gas & Water wellfield drawing water from the Memphis Sands aquifer.

Gore an environmental activist and former member of Congress representing Tennessee called the pipeline “a reckless racist rip-off” in his speech.

“They’re putting the risk on Memphis and they’ve taken the reward for themselves” he said. “That is why it is a rip-off.”

The pipeline would connect two existing pipelines including the Diamond Pipeline that supplies the Valero Memphis Refinery with crude oil which Plains says would make U.S. crude oil transportation more efficient. Construction is planned for later this year with the pipeline coming into service nine months after.

In a letter addressed to Memphis residents Saturday Plains Vice President Roy Lamoreaux said the company has secured the necessary environmental permits from federal state and local agencies to start construction. Cohen asked President Joe Biden in February to rescind a pipeline permit granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The permit can be rejected or modified if the Biden administration asks the Corps of Engineers to do so one of “several ways to stop this” Gore said.

Gore also pointed out two pipeline-related actions local officials could take this week. A Memphis City Council will consider an ordinance against the project Tuesday. The ordinance is sponsored by Councilman Edmund Ford Sr. and Councilman Jeff Warren. A Shelby County Commission decision to sell county land for the pipeline has been delayed until Wednesday.

“They can’t use eminent domain against Shelby County” Gore said. “They need Shelby County to say ‘Yes sir’ to the pipeline company.”

Gore said if officials side with pipeline companies voters can let their voices be heard at the next election.

Gore is among the celebrities voicing opposition to the pipeline. Opponents to its development have said Memphis’ groundwater supply is at risk if the pipeline crosses the aquifer the area’s drinking water source.

“We are here to preserve our water we are here to preserve our land we are here to save our communities and we are here to honor our forefathers” said Linda Hayes a resident of the historically Black Boxtown community in Memphis.

Representatives of Plains have said the pipeline’s depth would be four feet below the surface which they say would provide enough of a buffer above the natural clay barrier protecting the aquifer in the event of a spill. Conservationists have said this depth would offer little protection and breaches in the clay have been discovered.

“Even though Memphis has more than 10 oil and gas pipelines we understand that they aren’t built every day and that this project might raise questions” Lamoreaux said. “We are committed to showing you that we stand behind our promise to operate our business safely for you the greater Memphis community and the environment.”

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said previously the pipeline “poses an unnecessary risk to historic Memphis neighborhoods” and “would run through predominantly African American neighborhoods and potentially endanger communities that have historically borne the brunt of environmental degradation.”

Harris’ administration has asked for a mandatory buffer between oil pipelines and schools places of worship residential structures and recreation centers in an application to the Memphis and Shelby County Land Use Control Board.

The Shelby County route accounts for seven miles of the total project route with the rest concentrated in portions of DeSoto and Marshall Counties in Mississippi Lamoreaux said. Plains has acquired agreements to construct and operate its pipeline with 96% of landowners along the project footprint he added.

Gore and other speakers referenced a pipeline representative saying that the proposed path is taking ""a point of least resistance.""

“I’m here to tell you our community is the path of resistance” said Kizzy Jones a founder of the grassroots organization Memphis Community Against the Pipeline.

Former Vice President Al Gore spoke Sunday in Southwest Memphis at a rally opposing the proposed Byhalia Connection Pipeline urging about 200 attendees to put pressure on local officials to stop a project he dubbed “reckless racist and a rip-off.”

“Our world is changing because these fossil fuel companies are dumping their waste into the sky using the sky like it’s an open sewer.” Gore said. “Now they want to use this aquifer as much as they please but now they have run into Memphis Tennessee …”

Follow this story Keep up with the latest developments and find out how this story began. All of our coverage is here.

The environmental activist and Nobel Prize winner appeared at Alonzo Weaver Park at the invitation of Memphis Community Against the Pipeline. Other speakers included U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen Councilman Jeff Warren and Southwest Memphis residents who are fighting developers in court over land rights.

Pipeline background

In 2019 Byhalia Pipeline — a joint venture of Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline and Valero Energy Corporation — revealed plans for a 49-mile pipeline route between the Valero Memphis Refinery and a Valero facility in Marshall County Mississippi. The proposed route runs through Black Memphis neighborhoods including Westwood Whitehaven and Boxtown.

The rally is in advance of a cluster of local government meetings this week where resolutions are scheduled to be considered concerning the pipeline. The Memphis City Council’s public works committee will deliberate Tuesday about an ordinance (PDF) that would require council approval for pipelines and other projects on city property. The Shelby County Board of Commissioners’ Delinquent Property Tax Committee will consider resolutions Wednesday to exclude the 38109 ZIP code from a moratorium on tax-delinquent land sales in South Memphis and sell two parcels that fall under that moratorium to Byhalia Pipeline.

Gore is founder of The Climate Reality Project an international organization focused on fighting climate change and one of the highest-profile names to oppose the controversial crude oil pipeline proposed to run through predominantly Black Southwest Memphis neighborhoods. He began his remarks by praising local organizers and residents for resisting developers efforts.

“This is a truly important fight” Gore said. “It’s an important fight not only for Boxtown and Westwood and Memphis… but for the United States and for the world. We are engaged in a struggle that we must win.”

MLK50: Justice Through Journalism provided comprehensive coverage of the event. See updates from the full rally below.

MLK50 journalists Carrington J. Tatum Andrea Morales and Shiraz Ahmed are reporting from the rally.

5:28 p.m. Gore was introduced by Cohen as “the father of the modern environmental movement before the crowd of at least 200 that also included local and state elected officials.

The former vice president took the podium with a big smile saying “I feel like I have been to church. I feel like people here are praying to God for the blessing to do the right thing.” He was referring to a rousing speech by landowner Robinson that ended with a spiritual before Cohen spoke.

“I want to first acknowledge the leadership that has arisen from this community. This is true leadership …” he said. Gore said he was told about a Byhalia Pipeline representative who said at a community meeting that Southwest Memphis was chosen for the route because the company took “the path of least resistance. … Well I see a lot of resistance today” Gore said to cheers. The resistance local officials are witnessing now “is nothing compared to what they are going to see if they go with this pipeline” Gore said.

His voice sometimes rising then lowering into a growl Gore blamed fossil fuel companies for much of the environmental problems the world faces today. “Our world is changing because these fossil fuel companies are dumping their waste into the sky using the sky like it’s an open sewer. … Now they want to use this aquifer as much as they please but now they have run into Memphis Tennessee which is not the path of least resistance.”

Gore said he uses the three Rs when referring to such pipeline projects: “Reckless racist and a rip-off. “People in the business community think of the risk and reward ratio. … They are putting the risk on Memphis and the reward for themselves.

He called on the Memphis City Council the Shelby County Commission and Memphis Light Gas & Water Division to fight the pipeline through resolutions and laws and urged voters to keep on the pressure. They should tell elected officials if they do not oppose the pipeline “we will make sure you are kicked out of office during the next election.”

He ended with accolades for Memphis Community Against the Pipeline. “This community has risen up in an extremely impressive way … if anyone is ever tempted (to give up) remember political will is itself a renewable resource.”

4:32 p.m. The crowd sings along with Clyde Robinson.

4:18 p.m. Marie Odum and her father Clyde Robinson speak before the crowd.

Odum is recounting the difficulty in learning how to work the judicial process around eminent domain.



“I remember when we showed up the judge said his job was to determine whether @ByhaliaPipeline was going to get our land… What? How? And why? We don’t owe Byhalia nothing.” — MLK50: Justice Through Journalism (@MLK50Memphis) March 14 2021

4:01 p.m.

Crosby: “The law is on our side. The law in Tennessee doesn’t allow” developers from Texas to take land under eminent domain without public purpose. — MLK50: Justice Through Journalism (@MLK50Memphis) March 14 2021

3:35 p.m Linda Hayes of the Boxtown community spoke about her father who told his daughters before his death in 2014 to take care of his garden and his land. “That is why we are here today we are here to save our water. We are here to preserve our land. …”

3:30 p.m.

Jones: “On Oct. 17 if anybody was there we had a meeting with @ByhaliaPipeline and the communications manager Katie Martin was asked by me what do we need to do… to make you all go away? She couldn’t answer.” — MLK50: Justice Through Journalism (@MLK50Memphis) March 14 2021

3:25 p.m. — Councilman Jeff Warren briefly spoke about the danger of the pipeline and said it will eventually leak. He also spoke about an ordinance and a resolution coming up before the council.

3:00 p.m. The rally is scheduled to start and they have turned off the music. We don’t have an official estimate of attendees but it appears that most of the non-reserved seats have been filled along with people gathered under the park pavilion. Organizers are making announcements about getting your temperature checked to ensure COVID safety protocols.

2:25 p.m. “Thank you for having a backbone and a conscience” Gore told Robinson. As Robinson walked alongside Gore to the edge of his property where the company plans to build he sang “Oh how I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in.”

2:15 p.m. Councilman Jeff Warren spoke with MLK50 about the ordinance he’s proposed to require council approval of pipelines that cross city property which he discussed with Gore.

“If we get the ordinance through I don’t think they’re going to get the approval. Nobody wants to see this. There are 3 R’s I heard (Gore) talk about this: it’s a racist risky ripoff. And it’s ridiculous as well to put Memphis citizens and our aquifer in danger. I asked (Gore) for national help I didn’t expect him to have any (advice) right away but I think he’s going to look into it.”

2:10 p.m. Gore just arrived to meet with property owners whose land is in the path of the pipeline and are being sued for easement rights through eminent domain. A group of about 20 were waiting for Gore to arrive at Clyde Robinson’s land on Nora Road including U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen.

Robinson’s grandson Omarie Taylor 16 who helps his grandfather cut the grass on the property told Cohen that he is upset about the pipeline’s treatment of his grandfather.

“One day I’m going to own this land too. It ain’t right for nobody to take it from him. That makes me angry. He worked hard to take care of this land and I don’t want nobody to take it from him. It makes me upset to see him having to fight for something he already earned and paid for.”

MLK50: Justice Through Journalism had an exclusive interview with former vice president and long-time environmentalist Al Gore on Sunday after his speech at a rally in Southwest Memphis in opposition to the proposed Byhalia Connection Pipeline.

Gore has been devoted to tackling climate change since leaving office in 2001 and is the founder of The Climate Reality Project an international organization devoted to developing solutions to the crisis. His 2006 documentary about his campaign against global warming “An Inconvenient Truth” won two Oscars and in 2007 he received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work.

Gore is one of the highest-profile names to oppose the controversial crude oil pipeline proposed to run through predominantly Black Southwest Memphis neighborhoods. During his remarks he called the project “reckless racist and a rip-off.” He is among several influential people and celebrities outside of Memphis asking local authorities to stop the pipeline.

Byhalia Connection Pipeline Learn more about the pipeline and keep up with the latest news by following all of our coverage here.

Byhalia Pipeline — a joint venture of Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline and Valero Energy Corporation — revealed its plans for the Byhalia Connection Pipeline in 2019. The proposal is for a 49-mile route between the Valero Memphis Refinery and a Valero facility in Marshall County Mississippi. The route runs through several Black Memphis communities including Westwood Whitehaven and Boxtown.

Gore has worked on environmental issues with another influential supporter of Southwest Memphis’ fight — Rev. Dr. William Barber II who co-leads the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for a Moral Revival.

Last year the two and their organizations rallied around residents of Union Hill a Black community in Buckingham County Virginia that fought to keep a piece of the now-canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline out of their community. Formerly enslaved people built Union Hill just like Boxtown in Memphis.

With long roots in Tennessee Gore was a Democratic U.S. senator and a representative in a seat once held by his father. Before entering the political arena he worked as an investigative reporter for the Tennessean in Nashville.

Carrington J. Tatum MLK50: Justice Through Journalism: On Twitter and in your speech you called projects like the Byhalia Connection Pipeline “racist.” That’s very direct. Tell me more about why you chose that wording.

Former Vice President Al Gore: Black communities often find themselves in a situation where there is a legacy of deprivation. Where the political and economic power to resist polluting facilities is less simply because of the legacy of racism.

(For example) the family wealth gap the political empowerment gap including voter suppression laws that continue the effort to minimize the political power of Black communities. So I think that it’s not a mystery that an outsize percentage of polluting facilities are located in Black brown and indigenous communities.

A local public affairs advisor for the project is a Black woman who formerly was president of the Memphis NAACP chapter (Deidre Malone) and a Black county commissioner (Edmund Ford Jr.) has spoken in favor of the project. Some observers might ask how the project can be racist with Black representation and support. How would you answer them?

Well I don’t want to get into criticizing Black leaders who take employment with corporations that are pursuing projects. Plenty of white men and women and white leaders do the same thing. But there is a well-known playbook that is used by fossil fuel companies including pipeline companies and it’s a standard way of trying to minimize the resistance in the community. … In my faith tradition I’ve been taught to hate the sin and love the sinner. So I’m not going to get into criticizing individuals that play their role in the playbook.

Byhalia Pipeline has donated more than a million dollars to area nonprofits many of which are doing good work. That includes the local NAACP chapter community development corporations food banks and a statue to a Black historical figure (journalist Ida B. Wells) which was later returned. When you see the company making donations like that what’s the first thought that comes to your mind?

You can see something similar in the donations by oil companies to environmental programs at universities and all manner of public relations activities to try to greenwash their activities. It is a very sophisticated blueprint for continuing their destructive business model.

I think that people are waking up to it. Some of the organizations that received money from these pipeline companies have now decided to return the money. And I think you’re likely to see more of that.

These organizations don’t get as much money as they need. And they should be getting more support from other parts of the community. When some polluter comes in and says ‘Here’s some money to do your good works.’ And now ‘If you can see your way clear don’t criticize what we’re doing as a corporation.’ Again it’s part of the playbook. The overall result is environmental racism. And that’s why people are waking up to it and trying to figure out ways to change it.

You used the term “greenwashing.” Could you tell me a little bit more about what exactly you mean by greenwashing?

Well the term greenwashing as I’m sure you’re aware refers to activities that are designed to present an appearance of environmental responsibility when the activities underlying the appearance they’re creating are not good for the environment at all.

Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland spoke on the pipeline publicly for the first time last week. He said he’s looking into the project and intends to “follow the science.” What do you think of that response and what does the science say to you?

Well I have respect for Mayor Strickland. I think that if he does follow the science he will use the authorities of the city mayor to block this pipeline. I won’t be surprised if he actually does come out against the pipeline. I hope he does.

I think that in general people have been starting just recently to wake up to the threat posed to the Memphis water supply. As I said in my remarks this has been a classic case of a valuable resource lying out of sight out of mind. We’ve always taken groundwater for granted. But the Memphis Sand aquifer is extraordinarily valuable. And it is extremely reckless to put it at such risk. And the science tells us that putting a high-pressure large oil pipeline — built by companies with a demonstrated record of leaks and violations and prosecutions — is reckless.

I hope that both the city and the county will take actions available to them to stop this pipeline.

Mayor Strickland said he would rely on earth science and engineering experts at the University of Memphis. However Byhalia Pipeline gave a donation to the Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research at the university. Does this concern you?

First of all I don’t know the individuals at the University of Memphis who will be asked for their science opinion and I don’t know if they personally benefit from any donations made by the pipeline company. But I will say that as a general matter any scientist who receives money from a corporation and is then asked to evaluate the activities of the corporation that has donated money has a conflict of interest.

Byhalia Pipeline says along with its donations the project will have a $14 million economic impact in the Mid-South and bring in $500000 in annual taxes and jobs to the county. Is it likely they’ll deliver on these numbers? And is it enough to justify the pipeline in a city with high rates of poverty?

That is another part of their playbook. They often will grossly exaggerate benefits they say will come to a community. But how would you put a value on the loss of the purity of the sole source of drinking water for a city of a million people? It is absurd.

This is a case where Memphis is asked to accept an absolutely intolerable degree of risk in return for rewards that don’t go to Memphis. They go to the shareholders of these two large fossil fuel corporations while the oil goes for export to other countries in other parts of the world where it will be burned to create yet more risk by adding to the causes of the climate crisis.

Should there be a federal effort to stop this pipeline and others like it? If so what should it look like?

They should revoke the Nationwide Permit 12 for all of the pipelines that have relied upon it for their permits. This Nationwide Permit 12 was intended originally for things like telephone lines. The notion that it can be used as a fast-track approval for oil and gas pipelines without consideration of the environmental harm done to local communities is absurd.

Are you or your organization in communication with the Biden administration regarding projects like this?

I have done it verbally and I will do it in other ways as well. I do think the most immediate solution for this is with the city and the county. The city has the authority to stop this. The county also has the authority to stop it. And the courts have the authority to stop it. I’m hopeful that the community will prevail.

You and the Rev. William Barber II visited Union Hill in Virginia another Black community that fought a pipeline company in 2019. Now that project is canceled. What similarities do you see between Union Hill and Memphis’ fights and what do you think the key to Union Hill’s victory was?

Union Hill and Boxtown are in a very rare category of being historically significant Freedmen’s communities. There were many such communities most of them formed immediately after the slaves were freed … so many of these communities that survived slavery have since succumbed to the Jim Crow laws and the racism since the Civil War.

But Boxtown and Union Hill are two of the freedmen communities that have remained stable and resilient in all the years since the end of the Civil War… (It’s awful) for them to suffer this environmental injustice at the hands of pipeline companies that see them as the path of least resistance.

(It’s) a phrase I’m sure that this pipeline company wishes it could take back. But it can’t because it accidentally told the truth about why it chose Boxtown. I hope that Boxtown and Westwood and Southwest Memphis are victorious in their struggle as Union Hill was victorious in its struggle.

“The purpose of our initiative is to help clubs to overcome these obstacles so that they can continue to remain active and at the very heart of their local communities. This is why we believe our initiative has been so warmly welcomed by sports clubs nationwide in its launch year” he added.



UCL Harps FC - whose teams compete in the Longford District schoolboys and girls league - draws its membership from three provinces thanks to its close proximity to Co Leitrim and by having its base at Aughnacliffe in Longford and its ground located across the Cavan border at Dernafest.



In 2017 the club opened its first full size pitch and registered its first senior team. In 2019 work on a second pitch was completed followed last year by the registration of a second senior team. Currently its numbers are in excess of 200 boys and girls aged between 5 and 17 years.



The €5000 award made to the club under the Texaco Support for Sport initiative will be used to purchase additional ground equipment in the form of mobile goal posts in full-size and for 7 and 5-aside use.



Overseeing the adjudication process was Texaco Support for Sport ambassador former Irish rugby international and broadcaster Donncha O’Callaghan.



Pointing to the club’s ‘great community spirit’ he said: “its planned investment in equipment will have a fundamental effect on everyone in the club and within the area”.",,,

La pieza más costosa fue adquirida por 89 ethers equivalentes a unos USD 151.300.

La banda de rock estadounidense Kings of Leon recaudó más de USD 2 millones por la subasta de la colección de tokens no fungibles (NFT) que salió a la venta esta semana como parte del paquete promocional de su nuevo álbum When You See Yourself.

La banda ganadora del premio Grammy en el año 2010 lanzó su nueva producción musical el pasado 5 de marzo a través de las plataformas Spotify iTunes Apple Music Amazon. Sin embargo lo que enloqueció a los fanáticos fue la colección titulada «NFT Yourself» que fue subastada en el mercado digital OpenSea. La suma recaudada fue confirmada por Billboard.

La venta fue catalogada como histórica por tratarse de la primera banda que usa la red de Ethereum para lanzar su trabajo musical. La empresa Yellowheart se encargó del desarrollo de la versión tokenizada del álbum que incorpora características especiales.

El token incluye una portada digital en movimiento y concede acceso para una descarga digital del nuevo material musical de Kings of Leon; también incluye un vinilo de edición limitada. En la plataforma de música en NFT se indica que la venta del álbum cerrará el 19 de marzo.

Sin embargo la subasta de la colección de tokens cerró el lunes 8 de marzo tras extenderse por 24 horas adicionales de lo que inicialmente estaba pautado. “Estamos aprendiendo de todo esto junto con nuestros fans muchos de ellos están comprando NFT por primera vez” señaló la banda durante una entrevista transmitida por Periscope.

Algunos fans reportaron dificultades con sus compras varios se quejaron de las altas comisiones de Ethereum para adquirir la versión tokenizada del álbum de USD 50. Otros se manifestaron confundidos incluso muchos se preguntan cómo recibirán la versión en vinilo que es prometido con el NFT. Mientras tanto hay quienes creen que deben adquirir el token aunque no les guste la banda.

Varios NFT vendidos en la subasta incluían sorpresas para los fanáticos. Entre ellas boletos dorados que otorgan acceso de por vida para los conciertos de la banda y trato VIP en cada gira. Una de estas piezas fue vendida por unos 50 ethers alrededor de USD 90.000. Otro token que incluía imágenes del grupo capturadas durante la grabación del álbum y extractos de audio fue adquirido por 89 ethers equivalentes a unos USD 151.300. La banda informó que parte de las ganancias fueron destinadas a obras de caridad.

El director creativo del conjunto Casey McGrath dijo que la música ha estado infravalorada durante mucho tiempo pero que ahora está encontrando nuevas alternativas para corregir lo que está mal en la industria. Cree que los NFT representan el cambio sísmico que ha estado buscando la industria musical. Desde su perspectiva ayudará a que muchos artistas puedan vender su trabajo de manera directa lo cual otorga una nueva oportunidad a los creadores independientes.

Lil Pump y otros artistas también prueban lanzando música en NFT

Aunque Kings of Leon se acaba de convertir en la primera banda que lanza una versión tokenizada de su trabajo musical otros músicos también están mirando a los NFT como una forma de vender sus creaciones.

Esta semana el cantante hip-hop Lil Pump también lanzó una colección de NFT en asociación con la plataforma Sweet. Se trata de una serie de cinco piezas catalogada por su equipo como “parte de las joyas especiales del artista que solo existen en el mundo digital”. 500 de estos tokens fueron distribuidos de manera gratuita mientras que otros 2.000 se venden por USD 10 cada uno.

A principios de mes CriptoNoticias informó que el DJ estadounidense 3LAU adoptó una estrategia similar para publicar una versión limitada de su álbum “Ultraviolet”. Con la venta obtuvo USD 11 millones lo que lo convierte en el lanzamiento de NFT más valioso hasta la fecha entre los relacionados con la industria de la música.

También Ozuna se unió a la fiebre y lanzó una colección de tokens en la blockchain de Ethereum. Sus NFT llamados “Ositos” de Ozuna están formados por el logotipo con el que se puede identificar al cantante a través de sus videos musicales y discos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saWJyZW1lcmNhZG8uY29tLzIwMjEtMDMtMTQvZmVyaWEtb3Rvbm8tMjAyMS1jdWFuZG8taGF5LXRvcm9zLW1hZHJpZC1sYXMtdmVudGFzLW5hdXRhbGlhLXBsYXphLTEtZ2FyY2lhLWdhcnJpZG8tY29yb25hdmlydXMtNjcxNzAxOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¿Cuándo habrá toros en Madrid? El empresario de Las Ventas Rafael García Garrido responde,"Rafael García Garrido asumió la dirección de Nautalia en 2015. Su periplo al frente de la agencia de viajes ha sido muy satisfactorio y tras un proceso de reorganización y refundación la facturación creció de forma significativa pasando de 250 a 400 millones de euros en apenas cuatro años y cambiando los números rojos por un beneficio creciente que se vio interrumpido con el estallido de la pandemia.

Una de las apuestas clave de la gestión de García Garrido ha sido la de diversificar la actividad de Nautalia entrando en nuevos sectores como por ejemplo la promoción de grandes eventos. Fue así como nació la UTE Plaza 1 que le acabó convirtiendo en empresario de la plaza de toros de Las Ventas de la mano del productor francés Simón Casas.

Como es lógico el año 2020 fue especialmente duro para la actividad profesional de García Garrido. ""La pandemia me ha tocado de lleno. Por lo menos podemos ser optimistas y parece que la luz al final del túnel se empieza a ver algo que hace mese era imperceptible. Esperamos que este año tengamos un verano con más actividad que el anterior y que la segunda mitad del ejercicio permita un cierto regreso a la normalidad"" reconoce en una entrevista a Libre Mercado y al programa Es Toros de esRadio.

Conforme se acerca el mes de mayo el rol de García Garrido en el sector taurino cobra especial relevancia. En 2020 Las Ventas no celebró ni un solo festejo taurino y este 2021 parece casi imposible que se celebre la Feria de San Isidro. ""No facturamos ni un euro desde octubre de 2019. Tenemos a trabajadores en ERTE. Además aunque no haya festejos tenemos que soportar una serie de gastos inherentes a la gestión de la plaza como la seguridad el mantenimiento los suministros… Todo eso lo tenemos que seguir pagando a pesar de que no tenemos actividad"" lamenta.

Toros y covid-19

La Comunidad de Madrid sacó pecho hace escasas semanas con el éxito de su estrategia de ""cultura segura"". Desde el pasado verano se han celebrado más de 700 actividades con más de 120.000 asistentes y sin rebrote alguno asociado a tales eventos. Sin embargo el último festejo taurino autorizado en Madrid tuvo lugar en febrero de 2020 y a pesar de que varios empresarios quisieron organizar corridas en los meses de agosto y septiembre del pasado ejercicio Sol no otorgó los permisos tras recibir informes desfavorables por parte de los técnicos sanitarios.

¿Cuándo habrá toros de nuevo en Las Ventas? García Garrido recuerda que ""la normativa que se aprobó en 2020 permite apenas 4.000 espectadores en una plaza con un aforo de 24.000. Los costes asociados a dar toros en Las Ventas son muy elevados y el pliego de gestión también nos compromete a una serie de costes muy altos de modo que esas condiciones de gestión son inviables"".

La esperanza de Plaza 1 está en la Feria de Otoño: ""Estamos trabajando para intentar hacer algo mucho antes en los meses de verano pero es muy difícil si hay que cumplir con ese aforo de apenas 4.000 espectadores. Además está el problema de asignar asiento a casi 16.000 abonados que evidentemente no podrían asistir"".

""Estamos lidiando con una pandemia brutal con una crisis económica sin precedentes. Hay un dato escalofriante: nosotros tenemos en torno a 2.400 abonados mayores de 75 años y hay 520 a los que no hemos podido devolver el dinero de 2020 porque no hemos tenido respuesta cuando les hemos contactado por teléfono y por correo... Por eso aunque ir a una corrida de toros o ir a un partido de fútbol desde luego es un deseo y una necesidad para millones de aficionados también tenemos que saber que no es algo tan vital ni prioritario si no lo podemos hacer en condiciones de seguridad y en condiciones económicas normales. No podemos obviar eso. Y luego tenemos que entender que las figuras del toreo y los toreros en general quieren colaborar y arrimar el hombro pero el toro de Madrid es el toro de Madrid y va a salir con los mismos kilos el mismo trapío que sale con o sin pandemia por lo tanto es muy difícil llegar a acuerdos económicos razonables si no se permite más aforo"" apunta.

Problemas de Las Ventas más allá de la covid-19

Aunque Plaza 1 ha celebrado varias Ferias de notable éxito artístico y la de 2019 fue un logro histórico en términos de público y crítica las condiciones explotación del coso madrileño han estado muy condicionadas desde hace al menos un lustro. Por ejemplo aunque el concurso de explotación que llevó a García Garrido al mando de la primera plaza de toros del mundo comprendía también la celebración de festejos no taurinos lo cierto es que diversos informes municipales han denegado buena parte de estas actividades generando un importante prejuicio económico a la empresa.

""Hemos encargado un estudio para el reequilibrio de contrato que vamos a plantear a la Comunidad de Madrid. Lo ha realizado un asesor independiente de prestigio que ha evaluado y cuantificado la suma económica que nos ha supuesto perder cada año la actividad que teníamos prevista. El coste soportado se sitúa en torno a los 2 millones de euros al año. En los cuatro años que llevamos al mano de Las Ventas hablamos de 8 millones de euros de facturación perdida"" explica.

En la misma línea va el problema de las obras de reforma y remodelación de la plaza. ""El tema depende de la Comunidad pero obviamente nosotros como empresa gestora de Las Ventas somos el primer interesado en que esto salga adelante. El problema es que es una obra de tal calado y de tal presupuesto que sólo la licitación de la misma tardará entre 16 y 18 meses en estar lista. A eso hay que sumarle el tiempo de duración de la obra en sí"" señala.

También se ha hablado de un supuesto distanciamiento entre García Garrido y su socio Simón Casas quien gestiona desde hace muchos años las plazas de toros de Valencia Alicante o Nimes. Nuestro entrevistado lo niega: ""es un rumor que no es real. Somos socios en la UTE que gestiona la plaza de toros de Las Ventas. Tenemos una relación muy normal muy buena de socios. Lo que pasa es que estamos divididos y cada uno se ocupa de una cosa distinta. En este caso la gestión financiera recae sobre mí y a él le corresponde en gran medida la cuestión taurina y artística. Pero lo tenemos dividido así no hay ningún problema. Es verdad que ese rumor existe pero no tiene nada de cierto"".

Lo que tiene claro García Garrido es que más allá de Madrid su llegada al sector taurino no ha sido temporal sino definitiva. Ha presentado su candidatura a plazas como Bilbao o Santander y figura en las quinielas para llevar la plaza de Málaga: ""Tengo muchísima ilusión y ojalá pueda estar muchos años y sobre todo intentar aportar lo mejor de mí. Yo creo que ahora mismo la pandemia nos va a dejar en una situación económica en la que es esencial que los pliegos de condiciones que aprueben las Administraciones sean flexibles y permitan que el espectáculo sea rentable. En Málaga o Albacete se han planteado condiciones de explotación que no son razonables. Se regulaba hasta el precio de la Coca Cola. Si tú eres empresario pero no tienes libertad de empresa es difícil que un espectáculo tenga nivel y que esa cultura perviva en el tiempo"" concluye.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1Z2FyZXNkZW5pZXZlLmNvbS8_cT1lcy9ub3RpY2lhL2VuLXZlbnRhLWNhc2EtZW5tZWRpby1waXN0YXMtYXNwZW4tcG9yLTM1LW1pbGxvbmVzLWRlLWRvbGFyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,En venta una casa en medio de las pistas de esquí de Aspen por 35 millones de dólares,"Esquiar en Aspen no es barato vivir en la exclusiva estación de esquí de Colorado aún menos pero los hay que se lo pueden permitir y además llegan a pagar hasta 35 millones de dólares por una casa.

Construida en 2003 la casa de 665 metros cuadrados y ubicada debajo del telecabina Silver Queen ofrece lo que los americanos llaman Ski-In / Ski-Ou (o sea entrar y salir esquiando) así como un ascensor privado.

Tres generosas suites en el piso superior una enorme sala multimedia y de juegos sala de equipos para esquís… Todo está dispuesto para satisfacer al propietario más exigente en una propiedad que ofrece la oportunidad única de tener la pista de esquí al lado de casa y con una de las historias más ricas que cualquier otra finca en Aspen.

El precio de la propiedad es un escándalo y los impuestos también: 62.000 dólares al año

Si bien hay otras casas más grandes en el resort del Colorado -esta solo ocupa una parcela de 1.000 metros cuadrados- cuenta con una ubicación inigualable a la que ninguna otra edificación puede aspirar y una de las historias más ricas que cualquier propiedad en Aspen una de las ciudades más populares de todo Colorado para las vacaciones de invierno de los norteamericanos.

De hecho en cuanto a magnitud no tiene comparación -por ejemplo- con el rancho del actor Kevin Costner situado en los alrededores de la estación y que está disponible para alquilar por noches para un viaje con toda la familia y amigos.

El rancho Dunbar cuenta con un terreno de 64 hectáreas su propio lago privado paisajes de ensueño y con capacidad para albergar a 34 personas.

En la habitación más grande de la residencia principal hay una puerta secreta que conduce a las personas hasta un enorme jacuzzi de hidromasaje con su propia cascada con vistas al río y a las montañas. Esta casa tiene seis baños y seis habitaciones con vista al horizonte de la montaña de Aspen y a Independence Pass. El actor alquila su propiedad por 36.000 dólares por noche.

La pandemia ha representado toda una serie de complicaciones en todos los sentidos pero sobre todo en cuanto a una debilitada economía y muchos impedimentos para que la gente pueda tener la seguridad de acudir a algún negocio de manera segura garantizando su salud.

Círculos Maquillistas dejan de percibir ingresos de un 90%

Manuel Aragón Montaño uno de los dueños de lubricantes y accesorios ubicado en la carretera que va de la colonia Centenario hacia el norte afirmo que las ventas de su negocio cayeron hasta en un 50% siendo una situación bastante dura para el y su hermano quienes son dueños de este negocio familiar.

“La pandemia la verdad es que nos ha perjudicado mucho en un inicio hubo mucho miedo de salir de los hogares la situación ha mejorado un poquito en estos tres meses pero esperamos que no nos vayan a querer regresar otra vez a los hogares porque la verdad nosotros necesitamos trabajar para reactivar un poquito la economía”.

“Lo que más vendemos es toda la línea de aceites y refacciones automotrices pero hemos tenido que vender también cubrebocas y gel antibacterial y artículos para la limpieza de los automóviles. Vendemos lubricantes baterías y refacciones automotrices les brindamos un servicio de calidad y eficiencia a los clientes”.

Manuel Aragón mencionó que ya va a cumplir 6 años en el negocio junto con su hermano de lubricantes refacciones y accesorios para autos. Esta idea de iniciar un negocio de este tipo fue a partir de que su hermano y él tenían esta inquietud y los conocimientos de muchos de los productos que querían vender así que decidieron emprender un negocio específicamente enfocado en los autos sus refacciones accesorios lubricantes y demás.

“Lo más difícil de esta pandemia ha sido la afectación a nuestra economía realmente los gastos siguen igual pero los ingresos son menores si ha resultado muy difícil tener que aguantar para no tener que cerrar este negocio”.

“Que le echen ganas y se cuiden porque realmente si es una situación bastante grave bastante dura sobre todo en la parte económica. Cuiden mucho su salud la economía como quiera poco a poquito podemos irnos levantando pero la salud nos falla eso si esta más grave ni teniendo vacunas ni doctores tenemos que cuidarnos”.

“Familiares muy directos no gracias a dios más bien amistades amigos que he conocido que si les pego y la verdad hay unos que si fallecieron”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZXMubW90b3IxLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5MzM0NS9yYXJvLWZhbGNvbi1mNy1zdXBlcmRlcG9ydGl2by1hbWVyaWNhbm8tdmVudGEv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9lcy5tb3RvcjEuY29tL25ld3MvNDkzMzQ1L3Jhcm8tZmFsY29uLWY3LXN1cGVyZGVwb3J0aXZvLWFtZXJpY2Fuby12ZW50YS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Un raro Falcon F7 con motor central se pone en venta,"Ya seas un coleccionista de coches o un entusiasta del automóvil con mucho dinero esta oferta podría ser de tu interés. Se trata de un superdeportivo estadounidense fabricado en las inmediaciones de Detroit en 2014. Se llama Falcon F7 y fue presentado originalmente hace casi una década. Ahora uno de los siete ejemplares que se construyeron está en venta.

Para ser más precisos el que se encuentra disponible es el tercer ejemplar producido de una tirada muy corta (como decíamos solo siete ejemplares). Se dice que uno de estos coches fue destruido así que de ser cierta la información solo quedarían seis en la actualidad.

Este vehículo en particular se exhibió en el salón de Detroit de 2014 y también protagonizó el 19º episodio de la serie televisiva 'How it's Made: Dream Cars' (Cómo se hace) Temporada 2. Así que efectivamente se trata de un coche célebre.

Y no creas que es un simple modelo de exposición. Con un motor V8 originario de un Chevrolet Corvette Z06 modificado por Lingenfelter desarrolla una potencia de 620 CV y 813 Nm de par motor lo que le convierten en un deportivo muy rápido.

La potencia se canaliza a las ruedas traseras a través de una caja de cambios manual de seis velocidades aunque no se conocen las cifras exactas de tiempos de aceleración o la velocidad máxima.

El vendedor dice que Falcon Motorsport ha mantenido este superdeportivo desde su fabricación y existe documentación al respecto que lo confirma. También sabemos que hace poco se le sustituyó el embrague y que no presenta ningún fallo mecánico importante. Eso sí las imágenes del anuncio muestran pequeñas abolladuras exteriores fruto del paso del tiempo pero nada que no sea reparable.

Si estás interesado date prisa porque la subasta finaliza en unos días. Hasta el momento de escribir estas líneas el Falcon F7 ha tenido 24 pujas y la más alta está en 75.000 dólares (63.150 euros al cambio actual).

Sin embargo tenemos la sensación que el precio definitivo de venta rondará los 100.000 dólares (84.200 euros aproximadamente) dado lo exclusivo de este ejemplar y de las pocas unidades que quedan. En este sentido el Falcon F7 tenía un precio de unos 250.000 dólares (210.000 euros) cuando se vendía como nuevo en 2014.

İllere göre haftalık vaka sayıları ve risk haritası bugün açıklanıyor,"Bugün kontrollü normalleşme sürecinin ikinci hafta sonu. Kısıtlamasız ilk haftada vatandaşlar sokağa akın etmişti. Bugün de Sağlık Bakanlığı kontrollü normalleşme sürecinde 100 bin nüfusa denk gelen haftalık vaka sayılarını içeren yeni haritayı açıklayacak. Kontrollü normalleşme sürecinde illere göre tedbirler bu verilere göre belirleniyor. Öte yandan illerdeki kısıtlamalar iki haftada bir güncelleniyor.

GEÇEN HAFTA EN FAZLA VE EN AZ VAKAYA SAHİP OLAN İLLER

Geçtiğimiz hafta Sağlık Bakanı Fahrettin Koca'nın paylaştığı illere göre haftalık koronavirüs vaka sayısı haritasına göre 100 bin nüfusta vaka sayısı en fazla olan ilk 5 il Samsun Sinop Giresun Ordu ve Trabzon olurken; vaka sayısı en düşük 5 il ise Hakkari Şırnak Batman Mardin ve Siirt olmuştu.

27 Şubat-5 Mart tarihleri arasındaki verilerin yer aldığı haritaya göre önceki haftaya kıyasla en çok artışın görüldüğü il Sinop olmuştu. Sinop'ta artış 100 binde 154 olurken bu ili 100 binde 95 ile Kilis 100 binde 86 ile Samsun 100 binde 73 ile Amasya ve Edirne izlemişti. İstanbul'un ise turuncu olan rengi 100 binde 22 artışla kırmızıya dönmüştü. Haritaya göre Ankara'daki artış 100 binde 15 İzmir'de ise 100 binde 13 olmuştu. RENK HARİTASI BUGÜN AÇIKLANACAK Sağlık Bakanlığı'ndan yapılan açıklamaya göre renk kodlarının belirlenmesinde tek kriter vaka sayısı değil. Haritada vaka sayısı nüfusa oranı artış/düşüş oranı aşılama oranı yoğun bakım ve servis kapasiteleri gibi kriterler birlikte hesaplanarak açıklanacak.

BİLİM KURULU ÜYESİ YORUMLADI: 2 GÜN DIŞARIDA OLMAK YERİNE 1 GÜNE DÜŞEBİLİR Sağlık Bakanlığı Koronavirüs Toplum Bilimleri Kurulu Üyesi ve Gazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Dekanı Prof. Dr. Mustafa Necmi İlhan haritalandırmada illerin maviden kırmızıya dönmesi halinde “Şöyle düşünelim; hafta sonu 2 gün dışarıda olmak yerine 1 güne düşebilir. Ya da o il kendi özelinde vaka sayısı çok artarsa hafta sonu tamamen İl Hıfzıssıhha Kurulu kararıyla kapanabilir” dedi. REKLAM Yerinde karar algoritmasında 4 tane önemli kriter olduğunu belirten Prof. Dr. İlhan bu 4 kriterin illerdeki duruma göre düşük orta yüksek ve çok yüksek riskli olarak adlandırılması olduğunu söyledi.

YERİNDE KARAR ALGORİTMASINDA 4 ÖNEMLİ KRİTER Prof. Dr. İlhan “Yerinde karar algoritmasında 4 tane önemli kriter var. O yüzden tüm vatandaşlarımızın örneğin maviyse eğer bulunduğu iller mavi renkte kalması için çaba sarf etmesi gerekiyor. Sadece vatandaşlar değil işletmecilerin o ildeki yöneticilerin toplumun tamamının aslında benzer bir şekilde çaba içerisinde olması gerekiyor. Şahit oluyoruz hakikaten yöneticilerimiz çok çaba harcıyor ama toplum ve işletmecilerin de o illerde bu kurallara uyması gerekiyor. Maviyse mavide daha az rakam nasıl oluşur sarıysa maviye nasıl düşerim turuncuysa sarıya nasıl düşerim kırmızıysa turuncuya ve sarıya nasıl düşerim diye vatandaşlarımızın ve o ildeki işletmelerimizin düşünmesi gerekiyor” ifadelerini kullandı.

“VAKA SAYISI ÇOK ARTARSA HAFTA SONU TAMAMEN KAPANABİLİR"" REKLAM Yerinde karar mekanizmasıyla vatandaşlara daha çok iş düştüğünü belirten Prof. Dr. İlhan eğer vaka sayıları artar ve haritalarda renkler değişirse izlenecek yol haritasını şu sözlerle anlattı: “Renkler değişirse; bir kere hafta sonu kısıtlaması; ‘Düşük ve orta riskli’ illerde kalkmış durumda. ‘Yüksek ve çok yüksek’ yani ‘turuncu ve kırmızı’ olan illerde ise pazar günü devam ediyor. Hafta sonu iki gün dışarıda olmak yerine bir güne düşebilir ya da o ilin kendi özelinde vaka sayısı çok artarsa hafta sonu tamamen İl Hıfzıssıhha Kurulu kararıyla kapanabilir.

Yine önemli bileşenlerden bir tanesi liselerdeki eğitim. Orta ve düşük riskli illerde liselerde eğitim devam ediyor. Renk turuncu ve kırmızıya dönerse yani yüksek ve çok yüksek riskli olursa bu sefer bu illerimizde liselerdeki yüz yüze eğitim kapanabilir. Biz eğitimde yüz yüze eğitimin ne kadar önemli olduğunu ve bir an önce açmak gerektiğini iyi bir şekilde biliyoruz. Bir diğer önemli husus restoran kafeterya lokanta gibi yerler. Gerçekten buraların esnafları da çok zorlanmıştı çok zor durumdaydı. Devlet bir algoritma geliştirdi ve buna göre bir açılma söz konusu oldu. Elbette saat kısıtlaması var kapasite kısıtlaması var. Kırmızıya dönüldüğü takdirde buradaki işletmelere baktığımızda buraların kapanması söz konusu olacak.

REKLAM Hafta sonları da yine aynı şekilde bir kapanma söz konusu olursa yine vatandaş sosyalleşmekten geri kalacak ve yine işletmelerimiz zor durumlar yaşayabilirler. Bir diğer önemli grup ise 65 yaş üzeri büyüklerimiz ve 20 yaş altı gençlerimiz. Biliyorsunuz bu grup için ‘orta ve düşük’ düzeyli yani ‘mavi ve sarı’ renklerde sokağa çıkma kısıtlaması kaldırılırken bu illerdeyse zamanın geniş olarak dışarıda bulunmalarıyla ilgili genişletilmesine gidildi. Ama bu illerimiz yine turuncu ve kırmızıya dönerlerse bu sefer büyüklerimiz ve 20 yaş altı gençlerimiz dışarıya çıkmakta zorlanacaklar. O yüzden bu dört bileşen yönünden baktığımızda açıkçası renk değişiminin özellikle turuncu hatta kırmızı renk değişiminin illerde toplumun daha çok zorlanmasına neden olacağı bilinciyle hepimizin önlemlerin büyük bir bölümünde; toplum işletmeciler ve kamu yöneticilerinin daha çok çaba sarf etmesi gerekiyor. Tabi çabaların sonu hiçbir zaman söz konusu değil.”

REKLAM HARİTADA BÖLGESEL BAZLI DEĞİŞİKLİKLER Haritada bölgesel bazlı değişikliklerin gözlemlendiğini belirten Prof. Dr. Mustafa Necmi İlhan “Harita ilk açıklandığı zaman Trakya Bölgesi’nden başlayarak gidersek önce Edirne orada kırmızıydı diğer illerimiz daha açık renkteydi. Edirne’den başlayıp Sakarya’ya giden bir koyu renk söz konusu. Aynı zamanda Karadeniz’de de aynı durum söz konusu. Karadeniz’de vaka sayları sabit olan iller var daha aşağı doğru çeviren iller var. Ama yukarı doğru ivmelenen illerimiz de söz konusu. Bunun ötesinde yine Ege ve İç Anadolu Bölgesine baktığımızda da yine renklerde koyulaşma söz konusu. Keza Doğu Anadolu’ya geldiğimizde orada da mavi renkten sarıya doğru bir yol alma söz konusu. Akdeniz Bölgesi’nde de yine rengi koyuya doğru dönen illerimiz var maalesef. Bu dönem açıkçası hepimizin çok daha fazlaca kurallara uyması gereken bir dönem” diye konuştu.",,,,,,,,,,,,
VZ,Verizon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIyMzI1NDIwL3QtbW9iaWxlLXZlcml6b24tYXR0LWFkLXRhcmdldGluZy1kYXRh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T use your web browsing app usage and location data to serve you ads,"T-Mobile raised a few eyebrows — and got some unflattering press attention — when the Wall Street Journal reported on its new privacy-invasive ad program. Beginning April 26 T-Mobile says it will use its customers’ web browsing and app usage data to sell targeted ads unless those customers opt out.

It sounds very creepy. No one likes to think that someone is watching and cataloging all the websites they visit. But it’s also a good example of just how much of our data can be and is collected through our mobile devices and how few rules there are for the carriers we’re forced to trust with it.

It’s not really clear what T-Mobile’s new program is or how it differs from T-Mobile’s current personalized ads program. As a T-Mobile customer I was personally annoyed to discover that I was automatically opted in to this program which uses data including the apps on my phone and “broadband information” to target ads to me. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for clarification but said it would share more about its ad partnerships when the new privacy policy takes effect at the end of April.

What T-Mobile is doing isn’t unusual however and it’s not new. Verizon and AT&T have been doing this for years. Mobile carriers figured out a long time ago that they have two ways of making money off of their customers: what those customers pay to use their services and then what carriers earn by selling the data those paying customers provide as they use those services. The former is clear and obvious to the customer especially when the monthly bill comes due. The latter is buried under lengthy and confusing privacy policies and account settings and most customers don’t even know it’s happening.

Here’s how this works: When you use a carrier’s cellular network (LTE 4G 5G etc.) that carrier then knows what sites you visit mobile apps you use phone calls you make — basically anything you do over its network unless you’ve taken measures to obscure it like using an encrypted messaging service like Signal or a mobile VPN. There are privacy laws that limit some of what your carrier can disclose or use without your express permission (or a court order) but marketing off of data that isn’t attached to personally identifiable information is generally fine. So that’s what they do.

T-Mobile’s new program is notable because it’s more aggressive in the kinds of data it collects and the fact that customers are automatically enrolled in it. Verizon’s and AT&T’s personalized ad programs that use web browsing information — Verizon Selects and AT&T’s Enhanced Relevant Advertising program respectively — are opt-in.

“Our customers must make an affirmative choice to opt in to our plans that would allow the use of location information or where customers go on the web to serve third-party advertisement” a Verizon spokesperson told Recode.

But alongside the opt-in programs Verizon and AT&T also automatically enroll you in their other advertising programs that collect less detailed information.

AT&T has “Relevant Advertising” which uses your “non-sensitive information” (age range zip code gender) to target you with ads including those served up by its digital and TV ad network Xandr which is named after Alexander Graham Bell who invented phones and surely never saw something like this coming out of them. AT&T also sells your data to third parties to target you with ads.

Verizon has its Business and Marketing Insights and Relevant Mobile Advertising programs. Business and Marketing Insights sells aggregate information to other businesses that might want to know how many Verizon users in a certain demographic go to a website or walk into a store or use an app. Relevant Mobile Advertising uses your general information — pretty much the same stuff as AT&T’s Relevant Advertising program — and also shares that information with its own Verizon Media ad platform and network which sends targeted ads to websites apps even your TV.

In addition to those two programs Verizon also opts you into sharing your Customer Proprietary Network Information (for example the calls you make and receive) with its own companies and affiliates to market more Verizon products and services to you. Verizon says it has to obtain your consent to do this but it also considers you not opting out within a certain amount of time to be consent.

So all of these mobile carriers are still trying to make money off of your data just less intimate types of it.

As the Wall Street Journal pointed out Verizon’s and AT&T’s ad operations are far bigger than T-Mobile’s so maybe T-Mobile is just trying to play catch-up here and it’s being a little sneaky to get as many users as possible on board. It’s also trying to get its new post-merger Sprint customers who previously had to opt in to this kind of data collection and use on the same page as the existing T-Mobile users.

There is a little bright spot here: These companies claim that they don’t attach your personal information like your real name or address to this data. They either just lump you in with a large anonymous pool of customers to use as aggregate data or they assign a unique identifier to you attach a bunch of categories based on interests or demographic information inferred from your data to that identifier and then give that to third-party advertisers to target their ads to. That’s supposed to prevent advertisers from knowing your real identity but depending on what’s used as an identifier and how specific the data attached to that identifier is it could be easy enough to re-identify you through it. You just have to trust that T-Mobile (or Verizon or AT&T) and their advertising partners won’t do that.

Unless you live in Maine these companies don’t have to get your permission to collect a lot of this stuff. They’re not exactly careful with your data either as demonstrated by the many Federal Communication Commission (FCC) fines these companies have incurred over the years for violating the few privacy rules that do exist.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The Obama-era FCC tried to enact privacy rules that would have required broadband service providers to get users’ permission before sharing certain information including websites they visit and apps they use. But the Republican-led Congress overturned those rules a few months after Trump took office.

“The FCC needs to revisit this issue ASAP” Alan Butler executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) told Recode.

But the FCC has not revisited this issue yet so T-Mobile and the others can still collect use and profit off of your data for now while you actually pay them for the privilege. They also give you ways to opt out so why not use them?

T-Mobile:

On the AT&T app: Go to “More” on the menu bar > Profile > Data & Privacy > Privacy settings > Relevant Advertising > Switch allow use to “No.”

Also you might as well check out Verizon’s and AT&T’s “opt-in” personalized ads while you’re at it just to make sure you haven’t opted in without realizing it via a sneaky pop-up with a lot of fine print (the owners of the AT&T account I used to research this article for example had no idea when or how they opted into Enhanced Relevant Advertising). For AT&T just follow all the instructions above but click on “Enhanced Relevant Advertising.” For Verizon follow the instructions above but click on “Verizon Selects.”

Of course you can always opt into (or stay opted into) all of these ad programs if you’re happy enough trading some of your most sensitive data for a personalized ad experience which these companies insist is something customers want. According to a report from AT&T’s Xandr ad platform (consider the source) two-thirds of people surveyed “wish advertisements were more relevant to them and their lifestyle.”

I have never personally met one of those people despite their supposed majority in the population but apparently they do exist somewhere.

Excitement around 5G and its promise of lightning fast download speeds and huge data capacity has ratcheted up since the first 5G-enabled iPhone was released last fall. But the actual experience of 5G doesn’t always live up to the hype — not yet at least.

This is partly because there’s been a lack of available infrastructure (called “spectrum”) needed to build fifth generation wireless networks that are both noticeably faster than 4G and widely accessible across broad geographic areas. That changed with the completion of the Federal Communications Commission’s latest spectrum auction last month where carriers shelled out a collective $81 billion to get their hands on the crucial resource.

“Spectrum is the lifeblood of the network” said Craig Moffett founding partner and analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Part of the reason we don’t have the 5G network that everybody has been waiting for is we didn’t have the right spectrum for it.”

To accommodate the huge level of traffic high-speed 5G networks will transmit wireless companies need to build highways for that data to travel on. Spectrum is like the real estate the US government auctions off for carriers to build those highways — the better the property the more lanes they can build and the faster and more accessible their 5G networks.

Last week Verizon (VZ) T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T) held events to update investors and analysts on the auction results and laid out plans for expanding their networks. (CNN parent company WarnerMedia is owned by AT&T (T).)

“This is a great day for Verizon — I would go so far as to say it’s one of the most significant days in our 20-year history” CEO and Chairman Hans Vestberg said at the start of Verizon’s event.

There is “no question” the carriers’ new spectrum holdings will improve consumers’ experience of using 5G Moffett said. But the carriers largely expect it will take several years to put the new spectrum to use.

This spectrum auction was crucial

This spectrum auction helps the carriers especially AT&T and Verizon fill a key gap in their 5G networks.

Three categories of spectrum are used to build 5G networks. High-band or “millimeter wave” networks provide blindingly fast speeds but limited geographic coverage. For that reason it only makes sense for carriers to build high-band networks in densely populated areas like cities and airports where many cell sites can be installed close to each other.”

Low-band spectrum provides much broader coverage making it effective for use in nationwide 5G networks but data speeds are only marginally faster than on 4G LTE.

Mid-band is the “Goldilocks” spectrum that balances speed and coverage which has largely been lacking in US 5G networks until now. Carriers bid on mid-band spectrum in the latest auction and it didn’t come cheap.

Verizon spent $52.9 billion to more than double its mid-band spectrum holdings. The company plans to allocate $10 billion more in capital expenditures over the next three years on top of its existing spending plans to put the new spectrum to use.

AT&T bid $27.4 billion to bolster its mid-band holdings and expects to spend between $6 billion and $8 billion in additional capital from 2022 to 2024 on the mid-band network buildout.

T-Mobile had an advantage coming into the auction: a significant amount of mid-band spectrum already in its portfolio thanks to its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint last year. As a result T-Mobile spent just $9.3 billion to fill select gaps in its network.

Its existing mid-band spectrum puts T-Mobile ahead of rivals analysts say. While Verizon and AT&T can’t start building on their new spectrum holdings until later this year T-Mobile already has a mid-band network up and running.

“T-Mobile won” Moffett said of the FCC auction. “Their mid-band spectrum position was far better than either Verizon or AT&T’s going in … and they didn’t have to spend anything like the same kind of money in order to keep that position.”

T-Mobile expects to cover 200 million people with high-speed 5G by the end of this year. Verizon says it will cover more than 175 million people over 2022 and 2023 reaching a total of more than 250 million people by 2024. And AT&T expects to cover around 100 million people by mid-2023. (Each carrier reaches many more consumers via their broader though somewhat slower low-band 5G networks.)

“We wanted to go into and come out of the auction with everything we need to be the leader in the 5g era for the duration of the 5g era” T-Mobile President and CEO Mike Sievert told CNN Business. “That’s exactly what we accomplished.”

However unlike T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T have fiber infrastructure that could help them compete with T-Mobile’s strong spectrum portfolio.

AT&T’s strategy for example is to serve broadband needs “in a hybrid fashion with fiber being deployed to homes to houses to hospitals to small businesses” AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh said in an interview. “We are balanced in our investments in spectrum and in fiber.”

A return on the 5G investment

It’s one thing to build 5G networks. But generating additional revenue from them will probably take more work.

Stealing individual wireless customers from other carriers by offering a high-quality 5G network is one way to increase sales. But experts say creating additional services on top of the new technology especially for businesses will likely produce the greatest return carriers’ on 5G investments.

The mid-band auction accelerates the ability to develop some of those new services and business models Tami Erwin executive vice president and group CEO of Verizon Business told CNN Business calling the company’s new holdings “spectrum for the next generation.”

“It’s really powerful for us to be able to unlock some of these use cases — think about autonomous driving” Erwin said.

AT&T and Verizon have aggressively marketed their 5G enterprise offerings such as tech to create automated smart factories. And T-Mobile two weeks ago announced new products aimed at attracting more business customers.

“In the end it’s going to be who really executes on the network build and on making this a more compelling experience” Gartner analyst Bill Menezes said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbG9zc3ByZXZlbnRpb25tZWRpYS5jb20vaW4tc2VhcmNoLW9mLWEtYmV0dGVyLWN1c3RvbWVyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWNyZWF0ZS1jeWJlci12dWxuZXJhYmlsaXRpZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9sb3NzcHJldmVudGlvbm1lZGlhLmNvbS9pbi1zZWFyY2gtb2YtYS1iZXR0ZXItY3VzdG9tZXItZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtY3JlYXRlLWN5YmVyLXZ1bG5lcmFiaWxpdGllcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Search of a Better Customer Experience Retailers Create Cyber Vulnerabilities,"With online shopping surging 30 percent in 2020 it’s little surprise that cyberattacks are common with nearly 400 million customer records exposed in attacks on retailers last year according to calculations by Bloomberg. Such events can do lasting damage—78 percent of customers indicate they would be concerned about doing business with a retailer if the company experienced a breach according to survey findings released in November by Generali Global Assistance.

Retailers are implementing advanced security to prevent online intrusions but as retailers expand their online operations the sheer expanse of their attack surface makes protection difficult. Many experts point to retailers’ desire to create better user experiences—faster shopping more personalization—as a primary challenge for retailers moving forward. To create fast and easy shopping experience for consumers retailers must deploy a complex web of applications. And with more applications at work the harder it is to spot and manage vulnerabilities.

Successful web application attacks pose a serious threat accounting for 43 percent of all data breaches in 2019 and up double from the year before according to the 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) by Verizon. Retail industry data tells a similar story with web applications becoming the primary target of attacks on the retail industry. “Over the last few years (2014 to 2019) attacks have made the swing away from Point-of-Sale devices and controllers and toward Web Applications” according to the DBIR.

- Digital Partner -

Many web applications contain a labyrinth of layers according to Stephane Konarkowski senior security consultant for Outpost24 a provider of vulnerability management technology. “If not designed with security in mind they can be a breeding ground for vulnerabilities” he wrote for RSA Conference.

In its research Outpost24 found 3357 publicly-exposed web applications running over 401 domains among the top retailers with eight percent of them considered suspect—often test environments left online and potentially providing a backdoor for bad actors—and 22 percent running on old components.

Exploitation of vulnerable web app infrastructure is one variety of the attack pattern according to the Verizon DBIR—and the use of stolen credentials is another. Data show the two “are close competitors for first place in the hacking varieties category and there is not a great deal to distinguish between them from a percentage point of view” said the report. “In a perfect world someone else’s data breach would not raise the risk to your own. However that is increasingly not the case with the adversaries amassing datastores of credentials from other people’s misfortune and trying them out against new victims.”

Other studies and surveys point to three other strategies that may help retailers get a better handle on current and emerging cyberthreats.

Cybercriminals shift from attacking people to business requiring a focus on employee behavior. Nationally data breaches were down 30 percent in 2020 with the number of individuals impacted down more than 60 percent according to preliminary data from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). Rather than going away the ITRC sees a fundamental change in how identity crimes are being committed. Cybercriminals are making more money defrauding businesses with ransomware attacks and phishing schemes that rely on poor human behaviors than traditional data breaches that rely on stealing people’s personal information according to ITRC predictions for 2021 which it believes could be a long-term trend.

“There is a clear shift in tactics away from cyberattacks that require mass amounts of consumer information to fuel identity crimes—and that’s good news for consumers” said Eva Casey Velasquez ITRC president and CEO. “With that said businesses of all sizes are now the targets of cybercriminals who know how to take advantage of human behaviors—not hope for a technology failure—to rake in billions of dollars.”

Cybercriminals are focusing on cyberattacks that require logins and passwords to get access to corporate networks for ransomware or Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams according to the ITRC. These attacks require less effort are largely automated the risk of getting caught is less and the payouts are much higher than taking over an individuals’ account the group notes. Data indicate that the average ransomware payouts for all businesses have grown from less than $10000 in Q3 2018 to more than $178000 per event by the end of Q2 2020. “Large enterprises are making average ransomware payments of over $1 million” said the ITRC 2021 predictions report. “BEC scams cost businesses more than $1.8 billion in 2019.”

Cyber-alignment is worth reviewing. Surveys with information security professionals show that sophisticated targeted attacks are often the greatest concern and threat to US businesses but that company IT security teams spend most of their time fixing security vulnerabilities introduced by their own application development teams. Social engineering attacks are similarly shortchanged in time and budget surveys suggest.

- Digital Partner -

In short many organizations—and perhaps most—are not spending their time budget and staffing resources on the problems that its security-savvy professionals consider to be the greatest threats. While issues such as compliance and application security take a significant amount of their time cybersecurity teams may need to focus more on emerging threats such as targeted attacks and social engineering exploits. Advice: Retailers should ensure that they’re correctly aiming cybersecurity resources at their greatest risks.

“Executive protection” should have a broader meaning. Because it’s getting harder to get average workers to open unknown email attachments hackers have been targeting bigger game with more sophisticated weapons. Hackers send extremely specific emails—containing attachments with malicious code to facilitate keystroke recording—to CEOs including to their personal email accounts called “whaling.”

The emails differ from mass attacks and are carefully and specifically crafted to encourage the big cheese to open them. Common targets are chief investment officers company CEOs and presidents directors of research and development and chief information and technology officers.

Protecting executives from this threat should include security for family members as executives’ loved ones have also received targeted email attacks. Tricking a relative into installing malicious code could allow a hacker to obtain sensitive information if an executive uses a home computer for work purposes.

A study by Verizon Enterprise Solutions showed that many high-level individuals with access to privileged information—CFOs directors of HR board members and so on—have increasingly become the specific targets of hackers as they focus their aim. In the past attackers used “spray-and-pray” tactics where they would attack broadly and hope to hit something. Targeting is now more refined the study showed. More and more studies find that malware samples are unique to a specific organization.

When an attack is highly targeted and customized to a particular organization it becomes harder to identify and can be difficult to recognize as something suspicious warned Ed Powers partner and former managing principal for Cyber Risk Services at Deloitte & Touche. His advice: Assume that some of these attacks are going to be successful to some degree and plan accordingly. That is be prepared to react quickly and effectively to minimize the business impact of successful hacks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhyYy5vcmcvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvYnJlYWtpbmctMjAyMS1iZWNvbWVzLXJlY29yZC15ZWFyLWZvci1hbnRpLXRyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLWxlZ2lzbGF0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: 2021 Becomes Record Year For Anti-Transgender Legislation,"Legislation filed this week mark the 80th 81st and 82nd anti-transgender bill introduced in the 2021 state legislative session surpassing the 2020 total of 79 and marking the highest number of anti-transgender bills in history. The anti-transgender legislation filed in the last two days include South Carolina HB 4047 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) Texas SB 1311 (an anti-transgender medical care ban) and Michigan SB 218 (an anti-transgender sports ban). The Human Rights Campaign has been tracking anti-transgender legislation across state legislatures for decades including since the surge in anti-LGBTQ state legislation since 2015. The legislative fight to pass discriminatory anti-transgender legislation this year has been fast and furious led by national groups aiming to stymie LGBTQ progress. Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David issued the following statement in response to a record-setting anti-transgender legislative session:



These bills are not addressing any real problem and they’re not being requested by constituents. Rather this effort is being driven by national far-right organizations attempting to score political points by sowing fear and hate. What they don’t understand is opposing equality is highly unpopular — even among Trump voters — and states that pass legislation that attacks our community will face severe economic legal and reputational harm. In many cases these legislative pushes are being prioritized above COVID-19 response and relief. This push comes as equality measures gain not only popular support but legislative momentum on the federal level with the Biden Administration championing equality in early Executive Actions and Congress considering the Equality Act within the first 100 days of the new Administration.

Wide range of business and advocacy groups athletes oppose anti-trans legislation

Earlier this month more than 55 major U.S. corporations stood up and spoke out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. New companies like Facebook Pfizer Altria Peloton and Dell join companies like Amazon American Airlines Apple AT&T AirBnB Google Hilton IBM IKEA Microsoft Nike Paypal Uber and Verizon in objecting to these bills.

Nearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation

The nation’s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ people and transgender children in particular.

A fight driven by national anti-LGBTQ groups not local legislators or public concern

These bills come from the same forces that drove previous anti-equality fights by pushing copycat bills across state houses — hateful anti-LGBTQ organizations like the Heritage Foundation Alliance Defending Freedom (designated by Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group) and Eagle Forum among others.

For example Montana’s HB 112 the first anti-transgender sports bill to be passed through a legislative chamber in any state was written by the Alliance Defending Freedom.

Trans equality is popular: Anti-transgender legislationis a low priority even among Trump voters

In a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group last fall:

At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.

At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care with many states breaking 90% support

When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues the issue came in dead last with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.

States that pass anti-transgender legislation suffer economic legal reputational harm

Analyses conducted in the aftermath of previous divisive anti-transgender bills across the country like the bathroom bills introduced in Texas and North Carolina and an anti-transgender sports ban in Idaho show that there would be or has been devastating fallout.

Idaho is the only state to have passed an anti-trans sports ban to date and that law was swiftly suspended by a federal district court. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) came out against the Idaho bill and others like it and subsequently moved planned tournament games out of Idaho.

The Associated Press projected that the North Carolina bathroom bill could have cost the state $3.76 billion over 10 years.

During a fight over an anti-transgender bathroom bill in 2017 the Texas Association of Business estimated $8.5 billion in economic losses risking 185000 jobs in the process due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and professional sporting event cancellations a ban on taxpayer funded travel to those states cancellation of movie productions and businesses moving projects out of state.

They still haven't released official 2020 results but the guidance seemed a bit light at $17.2 billion to $17.8 billion per revenue compared to the preliminary adjusted guidance of $18.15 billion for 2020. Shares ended down 17.7% last week. It seems like it was pretty deserved. Any thoughts for former Mylan and Pfizer shareholders and I think you are one of the shareholders because you got shares in the spin-off because you own Pfizer. Any thoughts on Viatris?

Keith Speights: Yeah. I was very glad for the spin-off. I thought it was a very good move for Pfizer. But hey when a company issues significantly lower revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance versus their preliminary outlook the stock is going to fall a lot and it fell. Like you said I think a lot of that decline was deserved because they just disappointed investors. COVID-19 is still a major headwind for the company. Probably won't be as big of an issue later this year but it'll still be a significant headwind for Viatris during the first half of this year anyway.

I think Pfizer and Mylan shareholders are probably especially disappointed about the new company's projection for their dividend. They should declare dividend soon. Last year when the company was formed they were saying that they were expecting a dividend yield of over 5%. Now they're projecting a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That's a pretty big drop. I think this really was an income play in large part and that income isn't going to be as great as people were expecting and that's not good. The company is projecting around four years of flat revenue then a transition to growth after that I'm assuming that's still what they are expecting. Still dirt cheap. It only trades at a little over four times forward earnings so it's really cheap. But it's not a growth play and it's not as attractive of a dividend play as it was.

Orelli: If it keeps falling and they are still able to give the same dividend then the dividend yield will go up.

Speights: Yeah I mean I for one I'm disappointed in that particular update. and I held onto my shares of Viatris I didn't have a lot and so I just held onto them. But I think they're going to need to show that they're going to be able to turn things around to make it a stock worthy of holding.

Orelli: Yeah I agree. It seems like it's a better deal for Pfizer shareholders to get rid of the slow-growing generics business than it was for Pfizer shareholders who held onto the Viatris shares.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Return to Learn Plan discussed at the March 8 meeting has been evolving since August.

The board discussed how the district plans to allow students to return to in-person learning safely while following the Center for Disease Control guidelines.

School Board Member Keith Logsdon said “according to weekly Oakland County Health Data we receive we are in the low percent for positive cases and are in the substantial percent for number of cases but we are still recommending this Return to Learn Plan as we see fit to get our students back in the classroom.”

The district’s vaccine deployment is continuing to pick up. By mid-April Logsdon said every staff member who wants to be vaccinated will be. He added that Rite-Aid would host a clinic for their district and their spouses over 50.

Logsdon said COVID-19 caes have declined in Oakland County since January. “We had a seven-day average as high as 345 cases per day and as of Friday we had a seven day average of 94.1 cases” Logsdon said.

Berkeley schools plan to return to in-person learning safely by social distancing students as much as possible requiring masks updating classroom ventilation and sanitizing students and staff as much as needed.

To adhere to CDC social distancing guidelines the board recommended that elementary students separate during lunch time. Some students will eat in their classrooms while others will eat in the cafeteria and gym.

“As far as our secondary students go we plan on having those students eat lunch in the gym or in the cafeteria to stay away from having too many students in the cafeteria at once” Logsdon said.

Board Member Mitchell Moses asked “how are we going to limit the flow of traffic when students enter the school in the morning?”

Berkeley schools have multiple entrances and students will be required to use a certain door when entering and exiting so they do not all use the same entrance.

The district plans to continue a hybrid option.

Kindergarten and first grade students who are taught remotely will have a dedicated virtual teacher while second grade through fifth grade students will have the option to live stream the class depending on the number of students wanting this option.

Moses said “We want to make students feel like they are in person with the teacher as much as possible so the live-stream option for students will allow them to feel like they are right there in the classroom.”

On March 15 the board will vote on the new recommendations and whether students can return in-person learning full time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXBlY29kdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIxLzAzLzE0L2NhcGUtaXNsYW5kLWxlYWd1ZS1hbGwtc3RhcnMtYm95cy1pY2UtaG9ja2V5LWdpcmxzLWljZS1ob2NrZXktYXRsYW50aWMtbGlnaHRob3VzZS1zb3V0aC1jb2FzdC80NjU3NTIyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cape & Island League All Stars: Boys Ice Hockey; Girls Ice Hockey,"No commitment required.

Each month the Columbia Public Library offers selections from its collection related to a current best-seller or hot topic. Collection Management Librarian Liz Aleshunas compiled this month’s selections.

In honor of Women’s History Month let’s take a look at several books on the topic of women in medicine and women’s health.

With everything that’s happened in the last year health feels like a very important topic to consider. Women have had to work very hard to make inroads into the field of medicine and also actively advocate for their health. It is a testament to that hard work that one of the more recent innovations in medicine the creation of a vaccine to fight COVID-19 was made in part by the Black female scientist Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett.

In the early 19th century many women died from treatable diseases after avoiding medical care. Due to their own experiences Elizabeth Blackwell Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Sophia Jex-Blake decided to pursue medical careers in a male-dominated sphere. Their stories are explored in “Women in White Coats: How the First Women Doctors Changed the World of Medicine” (Park Row 2021) by Olivia Campbell.

After Elizabeth Blackwell paved the way her sister Emily also chose to follow in her footsteps. “The Doctors Blackwell: How Two Pioneering Sisters Brought Medicine to Women — and Women to Medicine” (W.W. Norton Company 2021) by Janice P. Nimura looks at the path Elizabeth and Emily took to become some of the first female doctors in America. The sisters teamed to establish the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children.

During World War I women were needed in the medical field more than ever before. Wendy Moore’s book “No Man’s Land: The Trailblazing Women Who Ran Britain’s Most Extraordinary Military Hospital During World War I” (Basic Books 2020) follows doctors Flora Murray and Louisa Garrett Anderson (daughter of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson) as they open a hospital in a Paris hotel treating wounded soldiers from French battlefields.

If fiction is more your speed there are several great novels that tell the story of some of the first women doctors. “The Gilded Hour” (Berkley Books 2015) by Sara Donati is the first book in the Waverly Place series. This book opens in 1883 following cousins Anna and Sophie graduates of the Women’s Medical School as they begin their journey as doctors in New York City. The second book “Where the Light Enters” (Berkley Books 2019) continues their story.

“My Name Is Mary Sutter” (Viking 2010) by Robin Oliveira follows a young midwife who wants to be a surgeon. Mary heads to Washington D.C. to treat those injured in the Civil War. This book is followed by a sequel “Winter Sisters” (Viking 2018). Another novel dealing with women in the medical field is “The Pull of the Stars” (Little Brown and Company 2020) by Emma Donoghue. This story is told over a few days in the life of nurse Julia Power as she works in a flu ward for expectant mothers in Ireland during the 1918 pandemic.

Sometimes truth is stranger and scarier than fiction and this can be seen in several recent books that look at how healthcare is still failing women. ""Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed Misdiagnosed and Sick"" (HarperOne 2019) by Maya Dusenbery ""Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men"" (Harry N. Abrams 2019) by Caroline Criado Perez and ""Sex Matters: How Male-centric Medicine Endangers Women's Health and What We Can Do About It"" (Hachette Go 2020) by Alyson J. McGregor all explore the fact that most medical treatments were created for men and therefore don’t take into account the differences in women's bodies. Women are also often not taken seriously with their symptoms and are ignored and misdiagnosed.

Women have added so much to the advancement of medicine but they have also struggled with benefitting from these medical gains through more equal treatment in healthcare. There is no doubt women will continue to make important contributions to the medical field; and hopefully through advances in science and the emphasis on providing women with the healthcare they deserve changes can be made to better serve them."

EGYPT: The World Bank’s executive board has approved a US$440m loan to support the Railway Improvement & Safety for Egypt project.

The RISE programme has a total value of US$681·1m including a US$241·1m contribution from Egyptian National Railways. It is a continuation of the ENR Restructuring Project concluded in 2020 which included the modernisation of signalling on the Alexandria – Cairo and Beni Suef – Nag Hammadi routes.

RISE includes continuation of work on those routes and renewal of track and signalling between Cairo and Beni Suef.

It also aims to improve safety for passengers and staff through the introduction of an upgraded Safety Management System and efforts to improve punctuality with a target of increasing the number of on time trains from 75% to 90%.

RISE will also support the Ministry of Transport in aligning ENR with international best practice by introducing performance-based funding.

Around 270 million passengers used the Egyptian main line network in FY2019 up from 228 million in 2015 and 247 million in 2010.

‘Modernising and reforming Egypt’s railways is critical to meeting citizens’ travel needs and boosting the overall economy’ said Minister of Transport Lieutenant General Kamel El Wazir when the loan was approved on March 5.

‘Improving the service for millions of passengers per day is a priority particularly because citizens depend on ENR to access jobs and do other tasks including fulfilling personal errands. Increasing freight transport is also a critical objective which will increase the economy’s overall competitiveness.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxhZHZlbnQuY28udWsvMjAyMS8wMy9maW5hbC1iYXRjaC1vZi1yZWZ1cmJlZC1pbnRlcjdjaXR5LXRyYWlucy1oYW5kZWQtb3Zlci10by1zY290cmFpbC5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmFpbGFkdmVudC5jby51ay8yMDIxLzAzL2ZpbmFsLWJhdGNoLW9mLXJlZnVyYmVkLWludGVyN2NpdHktdHJhaW5zLWhhbmRlZC1vdmVyLXRvLXNjb3RyYWlsLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Final batch of refurbed Inter7City trains handed over to ScotRail,"ScotRail has announced that the last upgraded Class 43 High-Speed Trains (HSTs) have been delivered to them for their Inter7City services.

Teachers and staff in pre-K-12 schools and childcare programs will be able to sign up for an appointment at over 9000 pharmacy locations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this year pharmacies were also on the front lines in getting vaccines into the arms of residents of long-term care facilities.

How other eligible Americans get a vaccine at their local pharmacy depends upon vaccine rollout plans in individual states and upon the supply which has been unpredictable.

In November even before a vaccine became available 19 pharmacies partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services for consumer access to a COVID-19 vaccine. That number has grown to 21. On February 11 the federal government announced that one million doses would be going directly to 6500 pharmacies as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.

But vaccination confusion plagued some initial pharmacy efforts in February.

A spokesman for CVS among the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Pharmacy Retail Program acknowledged the potential for vaccine appointment confusion.

""When the first two approved vaccines were in development the challenges that CVS Health faced were related to storing the vaccines as they both have special requirements and both vaccines require two doses and timing between each dose varies"" said Charles Keller a CVS District Leader in Houston Texas by email.

""Additionally there are state-specific eligibility requirements that we must adhere to and this can cause some confusion for customers looking to make an appointment.""

The CDC directs individuals who are interested in getting vaccinated at their local pharmacy to their pharmacy's website or to visit VaccineFinder.org.

A visit to the VaccineFinder.org site muddies the waters except for residents of Alaska Tennessee Indiana Iowa Oklahoma Utah and New York excluding New York City where it says the vaccine is available at pharmacies. ""In other states information may be limited while more providers and pharmacies are added in the coming weeks"" the site says.

Most pharmacy partners are using online scheduling systems and walk-ins are not accepted.

In February even the National Governors Association looked for clarification on how the pharmacy program would work in tandem with state efforts.

""We believe it is important that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in its reporting distinguish between these separate efforts to avoid confusion and provide a clear understanding to the American people"" according to the February 15 letter to President Joe Biden.

HOW TO GET VACCINATED THROUGH PHARMACIES

Healthcare Finance News asked three of the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program – CVS Health Walgreens and Walmart – about their vaccination programs.

CVS is currently vaccinating individuals in 29 states and Puerto Rico based on federal eligibility guidelines with a ""limited supply"" of the Moderna Pfizer and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine according to Keller.

""CVS Health is also prioritizing CVS pharmacies located in vulnerable communities with a particular focus on Black and Hispanic populations which includes proactive patient outreach community-based partnerships vaccines clinics and education-focused marketing"" Keller said.

""As we expand to additional states and locations we will begin to increase access to vaccines by using mobile vaccination vans and offering community-based vaccination clinics by working with nonprofit organizations.""

Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the expectation is that the vaccine will be available in the vast majority of their pharmacies across the country as supply allows.

""Walmart is partnering with the CDC and states to move as quickly as possible to help administer vaccines to eligible populations in participating states with an emphasis on reaching customers in vulnerable communities with limited access to care"" McInnis said.

""Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering vaccines in more than three dozen jurisdictions including Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. through federal and state efforts.""

Walgreens supports vaccinations across 43 states and jurisdictions as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. It has administered approximately five million COVID-19 vaccinations across long-term care facilities in more than 4700 stores and through clinics.

""As we have throughout the pandemic Walgreens will continue to be there for our customers to help them with their health and wellness needs and we're committed to accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations as quickly as supply allows"" said Rina Shah the group vice president of Pharmacy Operations for Walgreens.

""With a flexible model of care that can meet patients where they are – be it in our stores or at off-site vaccination clinics – we're ready to administer COVID-19 vaccines in all of our more than 9000 store locations once they become available for mass availability.""

All three pharmacy chains recognize that demand for the vaccine currently outweighs supply.

Walgreens has received approximately one million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson Moderna and Pfizer per week as of early March.

""Consumers are eager to get vaccinated but we don't yet have enough vaccine supply for everyone who wants one"" Shah said. ""With the recent emergency use authorization of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and as supply increases we anticipate vaccinations to be available to the general population in the late spring/early summer time frame.""

As vaccine availability grows more appointments will become available.

""Once the vaccine is available to the general public we plan to administer vaccines at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide with the ability to administer up to 20 to 25 million shots per month by our approximately 50000 healthcare providers"" Keller said.

Individuals who are interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine through CVS can confirm their eligibility on their state's website and then schedule an appointment online in the CVS app or by calling customer service.

""Walk-ins will not be accepted so it's important for customers to check their local CVS pharmacy location and book an appointment when they are eligible to do so"" Keller said.

Consumers can sign up to get a vaccine through Walmart based on vaccine supply and eligibility which will vary based on state and local guidelines. Eligible customers can make an appointment through the Walmart and Sam's Club online schedulers.

""Appointment availability is based on current allocation so appointments will be limited based on quantities allocated by federal and state governments"" McInnis said.

To make a vaccine appointment at Walgreens eligible patients can schedule online through the pharmacy's online portal. For scheduling via phone individuals can call 1-800-Walgreens or their local Walgreens to access the scheduler which is available in English and Spanish.

In addition to the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program pharmacies can get vaccines from states through the Pharmacy Transfer Program according to the CDC. With this states can choose to transfer some of their federally allocated vaccine doses to federal pharmacy partners to further expand vaccine access.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Getting vaccinated is seen as the most effective way (along with the other safety measures such as mask-wearing) to stem the year-long pandemic and lockdown and prevent COVID-19 cases deaths and surges at area hospitals.

Hospitals continue to suffer financially due to the pandemic and the loss of elective procedures that keep them afloat. The American Hospital Association asked Congress for relief funding for hospitals in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed the House today but did not get it.

COLLECTION OF PATIENT DATA

The pharmacy program recently came under fire for collecting patients' information.

Chains such as CVS Health Walmart and Walgreens-Boots Alliance are collecting data from millions of customers as they sign up for shots enrolling them in patient systems and having recipients register customer profiles according to The Wall Street Journal.

The companies said the information is critical in streamlining vaccinations and improving record-keeping while ensuring only qualified people are receiving shots.

Neither CVS nor Walgreens require members to sign up for loyalty programs which track purchases in order to register for a vaccine.

McInnis said that in addition to appointments the Walmart scheduler ""will provide a digital reminder when it is time to return for a second vaccine if required which is why customers are asked to create a profile helping to ensure they receive the second dose of the vaccine.""

THE LARGER TREND

As of March 10 the U.S. had administered more than 95.7 million vaccine doses according to the CDC. Roughly 19% of the population have had at least one dose and about 10% are fully vaccinated.

A third of adults reported feeling confused about the vaccination process in the U.S. according to a January survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Feelings of confusion were most commonly reported among individuals 18 to 29 years old (40%) and Black adults (46%).

Reports of widespread confusion stretch from Massachusetts to California and are related to disjointed online portals for vaccine appointments and muddled communications around eligibility.

Making matters worse scammers are taking advantage of the confusion in attempts to squeeze money out of vulnerable individuals according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Participating pharmacies will bill private and public insurance for the vaccine administration fee. For uninsured patients this fee will be reimbursed through the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. No one will receive a bill for a COVID-19 vaccine according to the CDC.

In July the U.S. agreed to pay Pfizer $1.95 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine – the equivalent of $39 for a two-shot immunization according to Bloomberg. In August Moderna released a price of $32-$37 per dose ($64-$74 for a two-shot immunization). These prices include only the vaccine itself not administrative costs.

The average administrative cost is $45 per member to receive the appropriate vaccine dose or doses according to Eileen Flick director of Health Technical Services at Segal.

MIDLAND Texas — Midland Police are investigating a 'suspicious package' found at the Walmart off Loop 250 and Midland Drive.

Officers were alerted about the package located on the north side of the parking lot inside the trunk of a car Sunday evening.

Midland Police have a bomb squad including a bomb robot working on the scene along with Midland Fire and Hazmat Rescue.

According to witnesses the store is not being evacuated and traffic has not been blocked off in the area.

Teachers and staff in pre-K-12 schools and childcare programs will be able to sign up for an appointment at over 9000 pharmacy locations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this year pharmacies were also on the front lines in getting vaccines into the arms of residents of long-term care facilities.

How other eligible Americans get a vaccine at their local pharmacy depends upon vaccine rollout plans in individual states and upon the supply which has been unpredictable.

In November even before a vaccine became available 19 pharmacies partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services for consumer access to a COVID-19 vaccine. That number has grown to 21. On February 11 the federal government announced that one million doses would be going directly to 6500 pharmacies as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.

But vaccination confusion plagued some initial pharmacy efforts in February.

A spokesman for CVS among the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Pharmacy Retail Program acknowledged the potential for vaccine appointment confusion.

""When the first two approved vaccines were in development the challenges that CVS Health faced were related to storing the vaccines as they both have special requirements and both vaccines require two doses and timing between each dose varies"" said Charles Keller a CVS District Leader in Houston Texas by email.

""Additionally there are state-specific eligibility requirements that we must adhere to and this can cause some confusion for customers looking to make an appointment.""

The CDC directs individuals who are interested in getting vaccinated at their local pharmacy to their pharmacy's website or to visit VaccineFinder.org.

A visit to the VaccineFinder.org site muddies the waters except for residents of Alaska Tennessee Indiana Iowa Oklahoma Utah and New York excluding New York City where it says the vaccine is available at pharmacies. ""In other states information may be limited while more providers and pharmacies are added in the coming weeks"" the site says.

Most pharmacy partners are using online scheduling systems and walk-ins are not accepted.

In February even the National Governors Association looked for clarification on how the pharmacy program would work in tandem with state efforts.

""We believe it is important that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in its reporting distinguish between these separate efforts to avoid confusion and provide a clear understanding to the American people"" according to the February 15 letter to President Joe Biden.

HOW TO GET VACCINATED THROUGH PHARMACIES

Healthcare Finance News asked three of the biggest pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program – CVS Health Walgreens and Walmart – about their vaccination programs.

CVS is currently vaccinating individuals in 29 states and Puerto Rico based on federal eligibility guidelines with a ""limited supply"" of the Moderna Pfizer and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine according to Keller.

""CVS Health is also prioritizing CVS pharmacies located in vulnerable communities with a particular focus on Black and Hispanic populations which includes proactive patient outreach community-based partnerships vaccines clinics and education-focused marketing"" Keller said.

""As we expand to additional states and locations we will begin to increase access to vaccines by using mobile vaccination vans and offering community-based vaccination clinics by working with nonprofit organizations.""

Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the expectation is that the vaccine will be available in the vast majority of their pharmacies across the country as supply allows.

""Walmart is partnering with the CDC and states to move as quickly as possible to help administer vaccines to eligible populations in participating states with an emphasis on reaching customers in vulnerable communities with limited access to care"" McInnis said.

""Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering vaccines in more than three dozen jurisdictions including Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. through federal and state efforts.""

Walgreens supports vaccinations across 43 states and jurisdictions as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. It has administered approximately five million COVID-19 vaccinations across long-term care facilities in more than 4700 stores and through clinics.

""As we have throughout the pandemic Walgreens will continue to be there for our customers to help them with their health and wellness needs and we're committed to accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations as quickly as supply allows"" said Rina Shah the group vice president of Pharmacy Operations for Walgreens.

""With a flexible model of care that can meet patients where they are – be it in our stores or at off-site vaccination clinics – we're ready to administer COVID-19 vaccines in all of our more than 9000 store locations once they become available for mass availability.""

All three pharmacy chains recognize that demand for the vaccine currently outweighs supply.

Walgreens has received approximately one million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson Moderna and Pfizer per week as of early March.

""Consumers are eager to get vaccinated but we don't yet have enough vaccine supply for everyone who wants one"" Shah said. ""With the recent emergency use authorization of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and as supply increases we anticipate vaccinations to be available to the general population in the late spring/early summer time frame.""

As vaccine availability grows more appointments will become available.

""Once the vaccine is available to the general public we plan to administer vaccines at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide with the ability to administer up to 20 to 25 million shots per month by our approximately 50000 healthcare providers"" Keller said.

Individuals who are interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine through CVS can confirm their eligibility on their state's website and then schedule an appointment online in the CVS app or by calling customer service.

""Walk-ins will not be accepted so it's important for customers to check their local CVS pharmacy location and book an appointment when they are eligible to do so"" Keller said.

Consumers can sign up to get a vaccine through Walmart based on vaccine supply and eligibility which will vary based on state and local guidelines. Eligible customers can make an appointment through the Walmart and Sam's Club online schedulers.

""Appointment availability is based on current allocation so appointments will be limited based on quantities allocated by federal and state governments"" McInnis said.

To make a vaccine appointment at Walgreens eligible patients can schedule online through the pharmacy's online portal. For scheduling via phone individuals can call 1-800-Walgreens or their local Walgreens to access the scheduler which is available in English and Spanish.

In addition to the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program pharmacies can get vaccines from states through the Pharmacy Transfer Program according to the CDC. With this states can choose to transfer some of their federally allocated vaccine doses to federal pharmacy partners to further expand vaccine access.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Getting vaccinated is seen as the most effective way (along with the other safety measures such as mask-wearing) to stem the year-long pandemic and lockdown and prevent COVID-19 cases deaths and surges at area hospitals.

Hospitals continue to suffer financially due to the pandemic and the loss of elective procedures that keep them afloat. The American Hospital Association asked Congress for relief funding for hospitals in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed the House today but did not get it.

COLLECTION OF PATIENT DATA

The pharmacy program recently came under fire for collecting patients' information.

Chains such as CVS Health Walmart and Walgreens-Boots Alliance are collecting data from millions of customers as they sign up for shots enrolling them in patient systems and having recipients register customer profiles according to The Wall Street Journal.

The companies said the information is critical in streamlining vaccinations and improving record-keeping while ensuring only qualified people are receiving shots.

Neither CVS nor Walgreens require members to sign up for loyalty programs which track purchases in order to register for a vaccine.

McInnis said that in addition to appointments the Walmart scheduler ""will provide a digital reminder when it is time to return for a second vaccine if required which is why customers are asked to create a profile helping to ensure they receive the second dose of the vaccine.""

THE LARGER TREND

As of March 10 the U.S. had administered more than 95.7 million vaccine doses according to the CDC. Roughly 19% of the population have had at least one dose and about 10% are fully vaccinated.

A third of adults reported feeling confused about the vaccination process in the U.S. according to a January survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Feelings of confusion were most commonly reported among individuals 18 to 29 years old (40%) and Black adults (46%).

Reports of widespread confusion stretch from Massachusetts to California and are related to disjointed online portals for vaccine appointments and muddled communications around eligibility.

Making matters worse scammers are taking advantage of the confusion in attempts to squeeze money out of vulnerable individuals according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Participating pharmacies will bill private and public insurance for the vaccine administration fee. For uninsured patients this fee will be reimbursed through the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. No one will receive a bill for a COVID-19 vaccine according to the CDC.

In July the U.S. agreed to pay Pfizer $1.95 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine – the equivalent of $39 for a two-shot immunization according to Bloomberg. In August Moderna released a price of $32-$37 per dose ($64-$74 for a two-shot immunization). These prices include only the vaccine itself not administrative costs.

The average administrative cost is $45 per member to receive the appropriate vaccine dose or doses according to Eileen Flick director of Health Technical Services at Segal.

(VVNG.com) — An Amazon Last Mile Delivery Station will be moving into the retail building that once housed a Walmart on Bear Valley Road in Victorville.

City Spokeswoman Sue Jones said the new delivery station is expected to bring 150 new jobs to Victorville which is exciting news for our community. “I’d like to make it very clear that this will be an Amazon Last Mile Delivery Station – not a warehouse” stated Jones. “Another great part of this story is that we will see yet another large retail space in Victorville occupied.”

Recently Car X Change moved into the former Target building on Palmdale Road Cardenas Markets moved into the old Ralphs also on Palmdale Road Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP) opened in the property that once housed Michaels Harbor Freight moved into space that once housed a furniture store on 7th Street and Shark Solutions moved into a vacant building on Hesperia Road.

“This underscores the strength of Victorville’s economy and our ability to attract large businesses to our City. As a result once vacant retail space is being occupied and our large shopping centers are experiencing a resurgence” stated Jones.

The Delivery Station concept was started by Amazon to speed package delivery to customers and to give individuals the ability to own and operate their own package delivery businesses.

The Old Walmart building has been vacant for more than eight years and the building is approximately 126000 square feet in size.

Jones said improvements on the building have started and are expected to take four to five months.

Updates will be made to the interior and exterior of the existing commercial building to accommodate delivery sorting and administrative functions for the new business. Exterior changes include the addition of roll-up bay doors on the north and west elevations a new canopy at the north elevation to accommodate vehicle loading and staging and a new entrance façade that will be used as an employee entrance/exit and as a customer service area for pick-up and return of items by patrons.

The circulation pattern in the parking lots throughout the site will be redesigned to accommodate customer and employee parking as well as delivery vehicle parking and staging. Landscaping will either be added or replaced along the right of way and throughout the parking lot. Balsam Road will be improved to include curb gutter and sidewalk.

Access will be from abutting Balsam Road. The facility is expected to utilize a split shift schedule: 1:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. which will help stagger vehicle traffic.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjEvbWFyLzE0L2Rpc25leS1mb3JlY2FzdC10by1zdGVhbC1uZXRmbGl4LWNyb3duLWFzLXdvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LXN0cmVhbWluZy1maXJt0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMS9tYXIvMTQvZGlzbmV5LWZvcmVjYXN0LXRvLXN0ZWFsLW5ldGZsaXgtY3Jvd24tYXMtd29ybGRzLWJpZ2dlc3Qtc3RyZWFtaW5nLWZpcm0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney forecast to steal Netflix’s crown as world’s biggest streaming firm,"Netflix is forecast to lose its crown as the world’s biggest video streaming provider within three years amid explosive growth at Disney after the launch of its rival on-demand service only 16 months ago.

The Walt Disney Company announced earlier this month that its flagship Disney+ platform launched in late 2019 had passed 100 million global subscribers – a feat that took its arch-rival Netflix a decade to achieve. Taken together with subscriber numbers for the group’s ESPN+ sports platform and Hulu subscription service in the US the surge puts Disney on track to dethrone Netflix by 2024.

The Mandalorian-driven success story has smashed the expectations of management which had conservatively estimated it would take five years to reach 90 million subscribers. In December an emboldened Disney tripled its target to 260 million by 2024 and doubled its content budget to $15bn (£10.8bn) underscoring its position as the third major force in the global streaming wars.

Last month Netflix announced it had 203.7 million subscribers taking four years to notch up its second hundred million while Amazon Prime Video – home to series such as Outlander and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel as well as sport including Premier League football and NFL – is estimated to have about 147 million regular global users.

“Disney+ has obviously experienced some of the fastest growth seen from a subscription video-on-demand service; kudos to them for establishing themselves as a global force so fast” said Richard Broughton an analyst at Ampere Analysis. “While Disney+ is still only half the size of Netflix it has reached that milestone in an unprecedented timescale.”

Ampere said Disney+ would overtake Amazon Prime Video in 2024 to become the world’s second most popular streaming service. Netflix would remain on top until at least 2025 when he forecasts subscriber numbers would hit 247 million and 286 million respectively. However taking into account ESPN+ and Hulu the Walt Disney Company overall would pull ahead of Netflix in two or three years’ time.

The group is forecast to hit 266 million subscribers by the end of 2023 just shy of Netflix on 269 million. A year later the positions will be reversed with Netflix’s 279 million subscribers trailing Walt Disney’s 295 million.

With Britons spending 40% of their waking hours in front of the TV during the height of the coronavirus pandemic streaming services have experienced a boom in popularity. By the end of last year more than 32 million Britons had become subscribers to Netflix Amazon or Disney+ double the number signed up to traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky BT and Virgin Media.

While Netflix enjoyed a record year on a global scale the addition of 37 million new subscribers is the most in a single year in its history Disney+ proved to be the biggest winner in the UK.

Helped by the serendipitous timing of its UK launch – in the week the nation entered the first lockdown in March 2020 – Disney+ hoovered up almost 40% of the 13 million new streaming subscribers in the UK last year. Amazon Prime Video took a quarter while Netflix the most popular service in the UK attracted 19% according to the data firm Kantar.

On the face of it the level of success Disney+ has achieved could be surprising given the relatively slim catalogue of content it launched with compared with its rivals. As of January this year Disney+ offered 4500 hours of content compared with 40000 on Netflix and 50000 on Amazon. Even relative minnows such as BritBox (10000 hours) and Hayu home to reality shows such as Below Deck and Keeping up with the Kardashians (6000) offered more.

Disney is aware of the need for a steady pipeline of new TV programmes and films in the content arms race to attract and keep subscribers. It has a target of adding more than 100 new titles to the service each year. In addition it launched a global companion streaming service Star last month – doubling the amount of content it offers with programmes designed to appeal to a wider non-Disney audience such as Lost Desperate Housewives 24 and The X-Files.

“It is about quality over quantity” Broughton said. “The others have volume Disney relies on the quality of its brands. It has shows and films that people fans feel they must watch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYWxsZWFycy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wMy8xNC90aGUtaGlzdG9yeS1hbmQtZXZvbHV0aW9uLW9mLWRpc25leXMtanVuZ2xlLWNydWlzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The History and Evolution of the Disney's Jungle Cruise,"Since it opened in Disneyland Park in July of 1955 Jungle Cruise has become one of the most iconic attractions in Disney’s theme park catalogue. Everything from the distinctive ride vehicles comical tableaus animatronic animals and even the purposely over-the-top skipper spiel have become iconic elements of the Disney theme park experience explaining why the Jungle Cruise has been cloned to nearly every Disney resort around the world.

However despite its beloved stature the attraction has met its fair share of controversy over the years which has led to numerous changes including a major refurbishment in 2021.

To analyze this attraction’s controversial history we must first look at its origins years before Disneyland was constructed.

The Origins

The origins of the Jungle Cruise can be traced back to the late 1940s when Walt Disney Pictures began production on their True-Life Adventures series. Beginning with Seal Island in 1948 these somewhat staged wildlife documentaries followed various groups of animals in their natural habitats. The series was so successful with movie-goers and critics that it eventually evolved from two-reel shorts to full-length documentary films that quickly became a cornerstone of Walt Disney Studios.

With the immense success of True-Life Adventures Walt Disney planned on including something related to the series in his Mickey Mouse Park from the beginning. As Mickey Mouse Park evolved into the concept of Disneyland the idea of a section of the park themed to the documentary series was retained. Scheduled to be called True Life-Adventureland (later shortened to Adventureland) the land’s centerpiece attraction was to be a “jungle river cruise” boat ride.

As the construction phase of Disneyland began plans for the river ride were solidified. Walt’s initial plans to have real animals – yes really – was quickly nixed for logistical reasons. Instead the ride principally designed by Imagineer Harper Goff would feature animated animal and “native” figures with “lifelike” movements. In retrospect these figures were forefathers of the Audio-Animatronics that Imagineering would develop a decade later.

Guests would view the animals from skipper-guided ride-vehicles modeled after the titular boat from the 1951 hit film The African Queen while traveling through a jungle designed by Disneyland landscape extraordinaire Bill Evans.

Welcome to the Jungle

Jungle Cruise opened with the rest of Disneyland on July 17 1955. However a modern guest would be hard-pressed to recognize much of the attraction. Sure they would be familiar with Goff’s general concept and if they squinted they could imagine how the rather light jungle Evans planted would grow into the lush greenery seen today but many iconic elements of the attraction would be absent. There was no ad-libbed humor from the skippers who played the entire experience straight. In fact there was no humor period.

The Jungle Cruise like Disneyland overall was a massive success upon its opening quickly becoming an integral part of American pop culture. However as the park’s first decade came to a close Walt Disney felt his park needed some new blood. According to legend he once overheard a child ask his mother to ride the Jungle Cruise and was aghast when the mother responded that they’d ridden it last time and didn’t need to again. Whether this story is apocryphal or not in the early 1960s Walt brought over animator Marc Davis from the Studios to “plus up” some of Disneyland’s attractions.

One of the first attractions Davis – who would go on to become one of the company’s most influential Imagineers – worked on was Jungle Cruise. A visual comedian by nature Davis decided to liven up the attraction by adding the playful elephant pool and comical trapped safari sequences.

These comedic elements in-turn influenced the ride’s skipper narration which became more and more comical over the years. Davis’ changes led to the attraction becoming even more popular.

Disney World’s Jungle Cruise

The Jungle Cruise’s status as one of Disney’s premier attractions was further solidified when a version of the ride opened with Walt Disney World and Magic Kingdom in 1971.

The Orlando version of the ride was similar to its Anaheim counterpart though not a direct clone and served the same purpose as the anchor attraction of the park’s Adventureland section.

Jungle Cruise International

A near-direct clone of the Magic Kingdom version of the attraction opened with Tokyo Disneyland in 1983 but when Disneyland Paris then known as EuroDisney opened in 1992 the park became the first “castle park” not to feature a Jungle Cruise on opening day. This was due partially to the cold French climate not being hospitable to water rides and partially because there were several knockoff Jungle Cruises already built at various French amusement parks.

The attraction’s international expansion got back on track in 2005 when a vastly different version of the Jungle Cruise opened with Hong Kong Disneyland. Differences included a route that circumnavigates Tarzan’s Treehouse and features a grand finale that culminates in a battle between angry fire and water gods.

Disneyland Levels Up

While these alternate versions of the Jungle Cruise were being built around the world the Disneyland original continued to be “plussed” over the years. Throughout the 1960s and 70s various new animals and show-scenes were added to the attraction. The biggest changes up to that point came in 1994 when the attraction was rerouted and shortened to make room for the then-upcoming Indiana Jones Adventure attraction. In addition the ride (and the entirety of Adventureland) were rethemed to be set in the 1930s to tie into Indy.

While these changes were substantial they were nothing compared to the original plans which were going to see a portion of the Jungle Cruise take place inside the Indiana Jones show building as part of a plan to build a massive complex that would house four attractions.

Holiday Overlays

Following these mid-90s refurbishments the Jungle Cruise continued to be one of Disney’s marquee attractions. As a testament to said importance in 2013 both American versions of the attraction were given a holiday overlay and temporarily renamed The Jingle Cruise.

The overlay was so successful that it was greatly expanded for 2014 and remained in both parks through 2016. For reasons unknown Disneyland dropped The Jingle Cruise from its Holiday offerings in 2017 though the overlay remains a Magic Kingdom staple to this day.

Controversy in the Jungle

Despite Jungle Cruise’s ongoing popularity in recent decades the attraction has become controversial due to its purported negative depictions of native people specifically the “headhunter” party as well as the Trader Sam “head salesman” character.

In January 2021 Disney announced that it would be making significant story changes to the Jungle Cruise at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World to alleviate these issues. Carmen Smith creative development and inclusion strategies executive at Walt Disney Imagineering explained the changes in a statement to the Los Angeles Times saying:

As Imagineers it is our responsibility to ensure experiences we create and stories we share reflect the voices and perspectives of the world around us. With Jungle Cruise we’re bringing to life more of what people love – the humor and wit of our incredible skippers — while making needed updates.

Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger added “The exciting changes we’re making to one of Disney’s most popular classic attractions Jungle Cruise reflect our commitment to creating unparalleled experiences that reflect not only the best in storytelling but also the values and rich diversity of our world.”

As part of these announcements Disney made it clear that these changes to the attraction were not going to be related to the upcoming film based on the attraction.

Said film simply titled Jungle Cruise was released in July of 2021. The film starred Dwayne Johnson Emily Blunt Édgar Ramírez Jack Whitehall Jesse Plemons and Paul Giamatti and was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. It was such a hit a sequel is already in the works.

Another major change was that meet and greets with Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse Pluto Disney Princesses and other beloved Disney Parks characters were not available.

Instead Walt Disney World Guests had (and still have) the opportunity to watch character cavalcades (similar to parades but not held at scheduled times throughout the day) at all four of the Florida Resort’s theme parks — Magic Kingdom EPCOT Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Disney’s Hollywood Studios. Additionally socially distanced character interactions were also available at Walt Disney World as meet and greets are suspended.

And the best part is that in December of last year Disney confirmed that even more brand new character experiences would be coming in 2021. The latest characters to make their return are Donald and Daisy at Disney’s Hollywood Studios!

Instagram user Liz shared a photo with Daisy Duck while enjoying a sunny Saturday at Hollywood Studios.

Another Instagram account called Here With the Ears shared a video of Donald Duck watering the plants outside of the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant. This is the same garden where Daisy was also stationed to greet Guests!

Another social media user Alan McDonald also got the chance to meet Daisy this weekend at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. Here Daisy looks ready for spring with the same watering can Donald was using!

Twitter user E.M. Fett also shared a photo of Donald Duck gardening with a hilarious caption:

Ok wow Donald is gardening is Hollywood Studios why are they entrusting a duck with this

Remember at this time Guests are still prohibited from hugging Disney Parks characters or having other close contact. Furthermore in order to visit a Walt Disney World theme park at this time both a valid ticket or Annual Pass and a Disney Park Pass reservation are required.

ANAHEIM Calif. — For eight years three months and 13 days Jeff Reitz was a fixture at Disneyland.

For 2995 consecutive calendar days starting New Year's Eve 2011 Reitz a 48-year-old annual passholder from Long Beach would stroll inside the Anaheim theme park wearing a slogger hat chat with a few Disneyland cast members wave hi to some friends and maybe even hop on a ride on the Matterhorn his favorite.

What started as ""a joke and a fun thing to do"" with another friend when both were unemployed and were looking for new jobs on New Year's Eve 2011 became a type of lifestyle and habit. Sometimes it became an escape from the doldrums of work he said.

""Once you step into Disneyland and inside that berm you hear the music and see the people and you just forget about everything and focus on having fun"" Reitz said.

He would have kept on visiting hoping to reach the 3000 consecutive visit mark but the coronavirus pandemic stopped his Cal Ripken-esque Disneyland streak on March 14 2020.

And then the depression hit. A couple of weeks after the mandatory shutdown Reitz found himself having difficulty getting out of bed.

Reitz said he wasn't experiencing withdrawals. He just missed the people – the cast members the other annual passholders he became friends with the people who recognized him or even seeing the smiles on parents' faces and their kids having a great time.

It was tough not to be around that environment this past year Reitz said.

""I had flareups of depression because of not having the people"" Reitz told Spectrum News. ""It turns out Disney for me wasn't just a theme park. It was a source of camaraderie friendship.""

Reitz is not alone. The closure of Disneyland and other theme parks across the state this past year has affected many loyal Disney theme park fans. For many Southern California residents an annual pass to Disneyland was a great way to spend a few hours at the park.

Nearly a year of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure closed many have realized how much the theme park has meant to them.

Jon Alan Hale who has ridden Radiator Springs Racers more than 10000 times previously told Spectrum News he became teary-eyed when Disney opened up part of the Buena Vista Street area of Disney California Adventure. He was able to see the Radiator Springs Racers sign again.

""I missed the ride so much"" he said.

Several fans have expressed how much they miss Disneyland on Twitter and other social media sites.

Boy do I miss Disneyland. That's all. — Ryan Bergara (@ryansbergara) February 25 2021

For Reitz this past year has been especially tough. A heavyset former Air Force veteran Reitz works at the Long Beach Veterans Hospital. He's been on the frontline of the pandemic.

Before the pandemic he would go to work early in the morning leave by 3:30 p.m. and be at Disneyland around 4:30 to 5 p.m.

He'd spend three to five hours a day grab some dinner and average about 10000 steps per visit he said. His trips would vary. Sometimes he'd meet up with friends or walk around taking photos. Other times he'd spend most of his time talking to cast members.

""I've always said it's the cast members who make the magic"" Reitz said. ""Characters are cool to see but there are so many cast members that have so many different stories to tell. They are the ones that make a guest's experience magical.""

Initially when Reitz started the streak with an old friend on New Year's Eve 2011 he only wanted to spend every day at the park since 2012 was a leap year. They would spend one extra day – 366 – at the park.

But he kept going – every day beyond.

Eventually Disney took notice of his streak and celebrated him. In 2014 he set an unofficial record of visiting Disneyland for 1000 consecutive days. Three years later he logged 2000 straight visits.

When the pandemic hit and Disneyland closed Reitz thought he could manage his days of not being at the park. He always kept up his spirit knowing that it took a global pandemic to stop his consecutive visit streak.

""It was sad that I didn't get to choose my final day but I was glad that I didn't have to choose my final day"" he said. ""I didn't stop going because of an illness accident or death in the family. It was a worldwide pandemic.""

But a couple of weeks in it was getting harder and harder for him to get out of bed. Going to Disneyland after work and during the weekends was drilled into his head and habits.

""It was like 'What am I getting up for?'"" he said. ""Especially the weekends it's not like you can go anywhere.""

There was always a running joke among his friends that if he ever stopped going to Disneyland he would have more time to do other things.

The pandemic however robbed him of visiting Disneyland and partaking in other activities at least early on.

""I was stuck in purgatory"" he said. ""I wasn't going to Disneyland but everything else was closed. I can't go anywhere because of the shutdown and couldn't hang out with people because you had to be separated.""

In April after the coronavirus catalyzed shutdown he signed up to be part of Team Red White and Blue's local Orange County chapter. This nonprofit group brings together military veterans for outings and other group activities.

For most of the year those activities were happening in virtual settings. But in September Reitz finally had his chance to go out and went on a hike with the group.

He's been going on a couple of outings every month with the group since. He felt a bit liberated.

""I enjoy being outdoors. We go hiking and now I have time to walk the trails and hills and check out other things and see other places"" Reitz said. ""I may go back into scuba diving.""

When Disney opened up Downtown Disney and Buena Vista Street he noticed he didn't feel the same. Things were different. The Disney magic was different. He's only visited twice in the last year. He didn't bother to buy tickets for the Touch of Disney food and beverage event at Disney California Adventure.

And with theme parks being allowed to reopen starting in April he's not sure if he'll visit Disneyland once it does reopen and start a new streak. Disney ended the annual pass program.

To Reitz his streak ended when the pandemic shut down the park.

""I haven't decided yet if I'm going to go back"" he said. ""I'm waiting to hear what they'll do with the annual pass program and what's going to happen with that.""

After 2995 consecutive days he's okay not being able to visit Disneyland again. On the eve of the last day before the pandemic shut down the park Reitz placed his slogger on the concrete in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland. It was a symbolic gesture.

""To me my streak is already done"" he said. ""Once the calendar hit March 14 and the park closed [the following day] it was done for me. My streak was always based on consecutive calendar days.

""A lot has changed over the eight years that I started it"" he added. ""I'm good with it. I went [to Disneyland for] more than eight years. I got to see a lot of changes at the park. Now I'm not worried about going every day like I was.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2VjaGF0LmNvbS8yODI0MDItc3BlY2lhbC10cmlwLWJ5LXJhaWwtdG8td2FsdC1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtZm9yLXRoZS01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Special Trip: By Rail to Walt Disney World for the 50th Anniversary,"MiceChat contributor and self-professed train nut Roger Colton has a very special trip planned for you Walt Disney World and train fans. Read below for more information on a trip to Walt Disney World by train for the 50th anniversary of the Magic Kingdom!

Magical 50th on Rails!

If you are a Disney theme park fan the date of Friday October 1 2021 should be well marked on your calendars by now. For those who may not remember it was fifty years ago on that date that the Magic Kingdom and the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando Florida opened their doors to guests for the first time.

As that date draws near Private Car Service is pleased to be able to offer a vintage travel experience to coincide with that event: A Private Railroad Car Excursion from New York City to Orlando and back with 4 nights at the Walt Disney World Resort – all for the price of $4750 per person based on double occupancy.

Disney’s Florida resort project was the culmination of the dream of Walt Disney and a revolution in the world of urban planning. After the success of Disneyland’s opening in 1955 many people wondered when Walt would look to open a similar theme park elsewhere. Initially Walt resisted the idea; saying that “There would only be one Disneyland.”

It is no secret that Walt Disney was a dreamer. A big dreamer. Look at how Disneyland added attractions in the first few years it was open and you see those dreams in action. Yet Anaheim had limits on just how big those dreams could become. So Walt began quietly looking elsewhere for a space big enough to bring all his dreams to fruition.

Now Florida had become a destination for travelers many years before Disney ever set eyes on the state. With swift and speedy trains from points all along the East and Midwest and steamships sailing to many Caribbean island destinations generations had left winter weather of snow and cold temperatures behind. At one time you could even board a train from New York City and travel directly to Key West where sun and balmy tropical breezes awaited.

Trains such as the Florida Special routinely operated in as many as seven or eight sections to meet the demand of those happy travelers. With Pullman accommodations on every train making sure the trip was as comfortable as staying at the best hotels. The meals and beverages served in the dining cars and lounges of these named trains were famed for the treats enjoyed by passengers.

Florida enjoyed being the prime destination for travelers for many years. With the establishment of many military installations during World War II even more people saw that the state was the place to grow. So when the Disney company looked for a new location for another theme park it was a great choice.

Walt saw this as the opportunity to shape the future in many ways not just theme parks but urban planning in shaping the communities of tomorrow. Along with the contributions of the industries of America that future promised many innovations. Sadly Walt passed away before he could lead the efforts to bring those plans to completion. It was up to his brother Roy to follow through on Walt’s dreams. And so he did with the help of the many talented people Walt had brought on board Walt Disney World opened its door to guests with the Magic Kingdom on Friday October 1 1971.

Since that date Walt Disney World has welcomed hundreds of millions of people creating memories and enjoying all kinds of experiences. Today with four theme parks thirty-three on-property hotels a dedicated shopping district two water parks four world-class golf courses (and two miniature golf courses) and much more there is no shortage of things for guests to enjoy during their stays.

Before Disney World opened its doors the traveling public was already visiting Florida in droves. Even though the Interstate Highway system and airlines had become more attractive options the passenger train was still a primary mode of travel for many. When Amtrak took over operations the year before there were multiple trains coming to the Sunshine State from the North. The idea of boarding a train for a relaxing trip to start and end a vacation still continues today.

Private Car Service has arranged to charter two classic railroad passenger cars to make this trip to WDW’s 50th anniversary. Taking a page from the past the travel experience aboard evokes memories of the standards of service and attention to the passenger accommodations.

The first car is the Pullman sleeping car “Salisbury Beach.” Delivered in December 1954 to the Boston & Maine by Pullman Standard this car has six roomettes (for single occupancy) four bedrooms (for double occupancy) and five open sections (for either single or double occupancy). Altogether there are accommodations for 20 aboard.

The car was originally built for service between Concord New Hampshire and New York City on the “State of Maine Express”. The car subsequently was assigned to first-class trains throughout the United States until it was sold to the Canadian National Railway in 1966. It was retired in 1982 and restored/upgraded by private owners.

The second car we are using is the “Lamberts Point”. Disney fans may recall the car from a previous charter trip where it was one of several railcars Disney used on a promotional tour for the film “A Christmas Carol” in the summer of 2009.

It also has a classic railroad history: it was built in 1918 by Pullman for the Norfolk and Western Railroad as their business car #200 and later given the name “Lamberts Point”. The car was used by the railroad as a mobile office for officials. They could tour the railroad making inspection trips or visiting customers along the line to discuss how to improve their business relations.

The plan of the car is similar to many other business cars. The open platform allowed for observation from inside the car with the large windows. Lounge seating offers a comfortable place to enjoy the view and socialize while en route.

There are three bedrooms aboard; a master suite for the railroad official assigned the car the secretary’s room (with and upper and lower berth) and a room for the crew of the chef and steward assigned to the car. There is also a bathroom and shower in each room; and a separate shower and bathroom for general use.

But the highlight of any trip is the dining room between the bedrooms and the kitchen. Meals are still enjoyed from a modern kitchen prepared by a chef aboard the car. The length of our trip will give everyone the opportunity to dine at the table once reserved for the finest meals for guests of the railroad.

For more information on the two railcars including floor plans visit the Private Car Service web site at: privatecarservice.net

The reason for our excursion is the 50th anniversary of the opening of not only the Magic Kingdom theme park but of the Walt Disney World resort itself on Friday October 1st. While Disney has not announced details of what will await guests for the day we do expect to enjoy new attractions and entertainment throughout the resort.

We are booking our stay at the Cabins at the Fort Wilderness Resort for four nights starting Wednesday September 29th. The cabins are just a brief ride in a water launch across Bay Lake and the Seven Seas Lagoon from the Magic Kingdom. This location offers a great place to act as our base for our visit. Theme park tickets for 4-days are also included along with access to all of the usual amenities.

On Sunday October 4th we will travel by motorcoach back to the Orlando Amtrak station to board our private railroad cars for the overnight trip back to New York City.

We also hope that as the summer progresses and Disney expands operations throughout the resort that various classic experiences may resume. When these are announced we will share them with passengers so that more can be planned or more available during our stay.

If you are a fan of Walt Disney World the 50th-anniversary celebration promises to be a special time. Why not combine that with a classic travel experience for the best of all worlds? It promises to be a memorable seven days!

This together with the poor critical and commercial reception of the film made fans wonder just how much of Snyder’s original vision remained in the theatrical cut of the film? And more importantly what would it take to get that cut released? Four years an extensive fan campaign and an additional $70 million added to the budget later Zack Snyder’s Justice League is finally about to be unleashed on the world.

If you didn’t spend the last four years on Vero meticulously analyzing every single post by Zack Snyder looking for clues it can be confusing to know just what the big deal is with watching a 2017 film again or why you should care. With the HBO Max premiere date of March 18 coming at us faster than the Flash and the latest trailer already making waves like it was the king of Atlantis we’re here to give you a primer on the major differences between 2017’s version of Justice League and Zack Snyder’s Justice League.

It’s a Much Longer Film With a Bigger Cast

This is the difference that will make or break the “Snyder Cut.” Where the theatrical cut of the film was reportedly mandated by former Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara to be under 2 hours Snyder’s original assembly cut was 5 hours long and the finished product is closer to four hours — which Snyder has long held to be his “optimal version” of the film. Though the longer cut of Batman V Superman didn’t add enough material to make the film feel fundamentally different the Snyder Cut is basically adding a whole other movie on top of the movie we saw in 2017 so there’s bound to be enough new material to feel like a completely new film or at least a much longer one.

REVIEW: ‘Zack Snyder’s Justice League’

Is the added runtime necessary? Like most other changes we’ll list here it depends. Most of what is being restored from Snyder’s original cut are set-ups for his planned Justice League trilogy characters and storylines that would pay-off years down the line. The problem is that it is extremely unlikely we’ll ever get to see those pay-offs. For one Warner Bros. has recently been moving away from the interconnected stories with the DC universe and more importantly it doesn’t feel like Snyder would like to go back and work with a studio he’s been fighting for the last four years. If we don’t ever get Snyder’s planned JL2 then most of these additions will end up being little more than just cool easter eggs — and that includes all the new character cameos in the film.

Together with the new runtime Zack Snyder’s Justice League promises to bring back a whole lot of character cameos that got cut in the theatrical cut including Kiersey Clemons‘ Iris West Amber Heard‘s Mera and Willem Dafoe‘s Vulko — the last two of which were supposed to be introduced here before having larger roles in Aquaman. Seeing cameo introductions for characters we already know from other films and the addition of such an important character for the Flash’s story like Iris but (presumably) without the necessary runtime to give her character any nuance feels unnecessary.

Then there’s Martian Manhunter. One of the seven original members of the Justice League of America and a central character in the DC Universe Snyder planned on introducing the character in his original cut of Justice League by retconning Harry Lennix’s Secretary of Defense Calvin Swanwick (who first appeared in Man of Steel) to be the alien superhero. Though Snyder left production before he could film a scene that would show Swanwick reveal his martian form Lennix recently confirmed he’s shot additional footage as Martian Manhunter specifically for the Snyder Cut.

Now seeing the whole Justice League united even if it lacks a Green Lantern is incredibly excited for fans — and it finally fulfills the promise from all the way back in 2015 that Snyder would “Unite the Seven.” Martian Manhunter is also a very popular character that unfortunately has never made his way into a live-action movie before so seeing him should please diehard DC fans but those not familiar with the character? Since there are no current plans for either a solo Martian Manhunter film another Justice League or even a Man of Steel 2 the shapeshifting superhero adds little to the experience of watching Justice League other than a glorified cameo.

A Lot More Villains Show Up

Just as we get new side characters and a new hero the trailer for Zack Snyder’s Justice League has shown a bigger focus on the villains than the theatrical cut. For once the main villain of the film Steppenwolf has a new design that feels redundant. The main draw however is that the Snyder Cut will finally introduce DC’s answer to Thanos.

Since at least 2018 Snyder has alluded to his plan to introduce Darkseid a tyrannical New God ruler of Apokolips and one of the most powerful beings in the entire DC Universe. Darkseid was intended to be an evil lurking behind the scenes controlling Steppenwolf’s assault on Earth before becoming the main villain in the sequel. With plans for a JL2 scrapped for now we won’t see Darkseid play as big a role as once intended but trailers indicate that he will still play a significant role. Played by Ray Porter Darkseid will be shown during a flashback sequence that was briefly shown in the theatrical cut (except Darkseid was replaced with Steppenwolf for that scene) as well as during an alternate reality sequence titled “Knightmare.”

SEE ALSO: What ‘Zack Snyder’s Justice League’ Actually Does Right

Even if he doesn’t play that big a role the introduction of Darkseid is huge for fans of the DC universe and particularly Jack Kirby’s legendary and influential Fourth World comics. Plus given how much more powerful he is than any other villain we’ve seen in the DC universe should make for an incredible fight scene. Plus Darkseid will not be alone as the latest trailer also teases the appearance of Darkseid’s chief torturer Desaad (played by Peter Guinness) and the master of brainwashing Granny Goodness. Now given how Ava DuVernay is still scheduled to make a New Gods movie we could see Darkseid and his followers return for that film so it should be interesting to see if that impacted the characters’ role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League.

Another big change we see in the trailer is the appearance of Jared Leto’s Joker who is seen saying the quiet part loud by proclaiming we “live in a society.” Though Joker was not a part of Snyder’s initial plan his inclusion is a good opportunity for Snyder to give a proper send-off to this version of both Joker and Batman now that Ben Affleck is no longer making his own Batman film. Even if it’s just a dream sequence fans of “Batfleck” should appreciate the nod especially since Snyder has said that he wants to tease the death of Robin at the hands of Joker in his cut of Justice League.

The Extended “Knightmare” and Flashback Sequences

During Batman V Superman we see a weird and kind of out-of-place sequence in which Batman has a dream of an alternate reality where Superman becomes evil. For years Snyder has hyped up the importance of this “Knightmare” sequence for his multiple-film-plan and he’s finally paying that off in Justice League.

According to Snyder this alternate reality is meant to show what happens if Darkseid wins but also a reality caused by the Flash creating a rift in time. Though plans have probably changed since 2017 Zack Snyder’s Justice League has the opportunity to build a bridge between Batman V Superman and the upcoming Flash solo film which is said to introduce the idea of the multiverse to the DCEU. This is the one sequence that has the most potential for the future of the DC films and it gives Snyder free rein to do whatever he wants without having to care about canon since it’s all an alternate reality. Not only is Joker coming back for this sequence but so is Deathstroke.

It wouldn’t be a Zack Snyder film without tons of action and we know of at least two extended action sequences in the film. One is the “Knightmare” sequence and the other is an extended flashback scene that was heavily reduced in the theatrical cut showing the first invasion of Earth by Darkseid’s forces and how the united forces of humans Atlanteans Amazons and literal Greek gods held them back. Snyder has even promised a fight between Darkseid and Ares the god of war. If nothing else the Snyder Cut promises to provide a more brutal (thanks to its R-rating) and visually stunning version of Justice League that kids won’t be able to see but hardcore adult fans will go nuts for.

A New Soundtrack Accompanies the Film

This is a smaller yet still significant change. Originally composer Junkie XL was meant to score Justice League continuing his involvement with the franchise after helping score Batman V Superman but got replaced by Danny Elfman for the theatrical release.

For the Snyder Cut Junkie XL is coming back to finish the job which will at least bring some consistency to the sound of the film.

No Super-Mustache This Time

Most of Henry Cavill’s scenes as Superman were reshot by Whedon and his glorious Mission Impossible: Fallout mustache got digitally removed in the theatrical cut of Justice League as most of Superman’s storyline was remolded for a big change in tone. The latest trailer not only shows different takes of some scenes featured in the theatrical cut but it really wants you to know that this Superman is wearing the iconic black suit from the Reign of the Supermen comic storyline. In a way this suit represents the difference between Snyder’s cut and the theatrical version of Justice League as Snyder’s version of Superman is rumored to be a darker more violent version of the character compared to the smiling boy scout of the theatrical cut.

At the moment there are no Superman movies in the works meaning this will be the last time we’ll see Cavill in the role for the foreseeable future. Even if it doesn’t amount to much or if it feels incomplete seeing Snyder getting to show his original vision for Superman’s story vis an exciting prospect especially since there is no way it can be worse than the horrifying Super-mustache.

Cyborg Is the Heart of the Film

According to Cyborg actor Ray Fisher he reshot virtually all of his scenes for the theatrical cut and as Snyder himself said last year “Cyborg is the heart of the movie.” In the theatrical film Cyborg is more of a comic-relief character together with Flash and we get the bare bones of a character story but Snyder’s cut of the film promises to tell the full story of the popular character. The trailer already teases a pre-transformation Victor Stone as well as new powers and a deeper connection to the Mother Boxes — a key part of his character in the comics.

This is important because the approach taken by Snyder and the DC films would mean that we met the members of the Justice League fight together long before they got their solo films unlike with the MCU. The original plan was for Cyborg to become the first Black DC superhero with his own solo film which was scheduled to come out last year. Of course that didn’t happen and there haven’t been any public announcements about the Cyborg film so Zack Snyder’s Justice League is the one chance for audiences to get to know Cyborg as an actual character. Unlike Martian Manhunter Cyborg as both the screen time and the connection to the main plot to have his arc mean something to the film and to the audience (if done right).

Is It Worth It?

That’s the big question isn’t it? The answer depends on your expectations. Do you need every film to build up to the next one? If so Zack Snyder’s Justice League will offer very little. As a source for easter eggs and nods to the comics? There are sure to be plenty so hardcore fans will have lots of chances to analyze every frame to look for references.

What the Snyder Cut offers is a vastly different tone from the theatrical cut for better or worse. This is a filmmaker free of every studio mandate with a budget to finish his pure and unrestrained vision but with the hindsight of how the franchise has moved on in the past 4 years. Snyder knows how Justice League was received what audiences liked and what they hated. And most importantly the parts that felt rushed or cut down. If nothing else this should feel like a fuller more complete story for the main characters.

Zack Snyder’s Justice League will premiere on HBO Max on March 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvdHJpYnVuZS1oZWRnZS1mdW5kLWFsZGVuLW5ld3NwYXBlcnMtc2FsZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Suitor May Enter Fray for Tribune Publishing (Published 2021),"A deal that would reshape the American newspaper industry has run into complications just one month after an agreement was reached according to three people with knowledge of the matter. As a result the New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital may have to fend off a new suitor for Tribune Publishing the chain that owns major metropolitan dailies across the country including The Chicago Tribune The Daily News and The Baltimore Sun the people said.

On Feb. 16 Alden the largest shareholder in Tribune Publishing with a 32 percent stake reached an agreement to buy the rest of the chain in a deal that valued the company at $630 million. In the deal Alden would take ownership of all the Tribune Publishing papers — and then spin off The Sun and two smaller Maryland papers at a price of $65 million to a nonprofit organization controlled by the Maryland hotel magnate Stewart W. Bainum Jr.

Swift is performing tonight and is up for Album of the Year (for folklore) Song of the Year (for “Cardigan”) Best Pop Solo Performance (for “Cardigan”) Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (with Bon Iver for “Exile”) Best Pop Vocal Album (for folklore) and for Best Song Written For Visual Media Category (for “Beautiful Ghosts [From Cats]”).

This is the 13-year anniversary of Swift’s first Grammy nomination and the singer spoke to Entertainment Tonight earlier this week about the advice she’d give her younger self knowing what she does now at 31.

“It's pretty wild how much time has passed since my first GRAMMY nomination. I still feel pretty lucky to still be a part of this night” Swift said. ""I think the advice I would give myself when I was younger is probably to when things get hard always focus in on how much I love music.”

“That has been the thing that no matter what has protected me from any of the other outside things that have made me feel strange” she added. “I've never had a problem with the general fact of making music or playing music. I've never stopped loving it. It's been the outside stuff that has made me feel down at times.”

Star Trek: Discovery season 3 brought back the USS Voyager for the first time since the 90s TV show named after the iconic starship ended. When Disco did it they gave us a new futuristic version and then proceeded to only put it on screen in extremely blurry far away shots where you couldn’t tell at all what it actually looks like. Now months later we finally have a detailed full look at the USS Voyager-J.

The images below come from the game Star Trek Online. They were given the CGI models for the Voyager-J used by Star Trek: Discovery and allowed to add detail to them. Detail which the always slipshod Discovery team didn’t bother to add. Luckily the people in charge of Star Trek Online actually care about Star Trek. So they delivered this…

By way of comparison this is what the crack team at Star Trek: Discovery gave us the first time around…

But Star Trek Online is for actual Star Trek fans so they’ve released detailed specs on the vessel. For Star Trek Online purposes they’re calling the ship a “Janeway class” starship. On Star Trek: Discovery however they called it an Intrepid class the same class of ship that the original Voyager was. The reason for the change is that Star Trek: Online already has an Intrepid class the one that Captain Janeway actually flew around on in Star Trek: Voyager so they had to call it something else.

Here’s Star Trek: Online’s detailed description of their new Janeway class vessel…

In a distant future timeline Federation starships have undergone a number of interesting evolutions of both technology and aesthetics. Some still reflect elements of their original lineage though as is true with the Janeway-class Command Science Vessel. Drawing its original inspiration from the Intrepid-class starships of the late-24th century this ship has been updated to focus on speed and maneuverability in local space without sacrificing its scientific capabilities. Unlike classic science vessels this ship focuses its power output on hull integrity rather than shield capacity and has also been specifically outfitted to serve as a fleet command vessel.

And to go with it they’ve delivered a detailed flyby of the ship in motion…

If you’re wondering what’s up with the Voyager-J’s detached nacelles they’re all the rage in the much farther and more distant future Discovery is flying around in. There they’ve come up with something called “memory metal” which makes actually connecting things together pretty unimportant. What advantage there is to leaving things floating free isn’t known but as a high-tech style choice it does look kind of cool…

If you’re wondering how the Voyager-J’s crew members get to a bathroom in the saucer section if they’re working in the engineering section since there’s nothing connecting the two together the answer is transporters. In Discovery’s way farther off future everyone has personal transporters built right into their combadge. A tap of the badge and you’ll find yourself sitting directly on the toilet. Another tap and you’re back at work with toilet paper stuck to your shoe. Some things never change no matter how far into the future you go.

Star Trek: Discovery season 4 is slated to show up on Paramount+ some time in 2022. When it does hopefully they’ll give us more of the USS Voyager-J."

OLIO builds a Food Sharing Platform

Food waste is responsible for about 7-8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additionally nearly 30% of the world’s agricultural land is currently occupied to produce food that is ultimately never consumed. One of the possible solutions to the food waste problem is creating platforms for food sharing. Such platforms enable local businesses and citizens to share excess food with their neighbors local NGOs or underprivileged people. That is why startups are developing food sharing platforms and apps that empower local communities to save nutritious products from being wasted while also helping those in need.

UK-based startup OLIO builds a food sharing platform that brings neighbors together to rethink the wasteful culture of the linear economy. The platform helps hundreds of businesses such as retailers caterers hotels and restaurants to prevent food waste. The surplus food rescued by volunteers is safely re-distributed to the local community via OLIO’s platform. To date OLIO has 1.8 million users all over the world sharing over 3.4 million portions of food. According to the company that is the equivalent of preventing 2.898 CO2 emissions from entering the atmosphere.

Replate facilitates an On-Demand Pickup of Surplus Food

If food waste was a country it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter globally behind China and the United States. This is because the resources needed to produce the food that is wasted have a carbon footprint of about 3.3 billion tons of CO2. In order to help in solving the food waste problem startups offer platforms for on-demand surplus food pickup. By saving food from the landfills such platforms help to prevent methane emissions while also saving people that experience food insecurity.

US-based Replate offers a platform and services for on-demand pickups of surplus food. The platform enables businesses to easily donate surplus food to people in need. Replate’s food rescuers pick up the food at a convenient time for businesses and then bring it to those experiencing food insecurity in their local community. Businesses that donate surplus food can track their social and environmental impact through a personalized dashboard.

FoodChain creates a Marketplace for Food that is close to expiration

One-third of all food produced in the world – approximately 1.3 billion tonnes – is lost or wasted every year. In order to overcome the food waste problem the world needs a systemic approach and multiple solutions that complement each other. One of such solutions that are beneficial both for business and consumers is a marketplace where products nearing their expiration date are sold at discounted prices.

Bulgarian startup FoodChain creates a marketplace where companies can offer unsold food for a reduced price. This marketplace enables businesses to gain new customers increase revenue by selling products that would otherwise be wasted as well as reduce their environmental impact. Using the web or mobile app people can find book and pay for their desired products. Thus they save food from being wasted while also saving money.

Goodr develops a SaaS Logistics Platform for Surplus Food Management

The problems of hunger and food loss are interconnected. In the United States alone over 72 billion pounds of edible food is wasted every year while 42 million people are suﬀering from food insecurity. Thus it requires not only good intention but also well-organized logistics to bridge the gap between the businesses that have surplus food and people suffering from hunger. In order to help in solving the above-mentioned problem startups develop platforms to optimize surplus food logistics.

Goodr a US-based startup develops a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that tracks an organization’s surplus food from pickup to donation delivering real-time social and environmental impact reporting analytics. This platform enables businesses and organizations to track account for and manage their surplus food and organic waste. The Goodr model provides its clients multiple benefits such as tax deduction for charitable donations reducing greenhouse emissions and helping underprivileged members of the local community.

FeedBack App works on an App for Discounted Food from Local Restaurants

Approximately 4% to 10% of food purchased by restaurants is wasted before ever reaching the consumer. Cooked meals also often are wasted due to overpreparation and other reasons. Thus surplus food in restaurants and cafes is one more issue that requires a circular economy approach. That is why startups offer a way to solve the above-mentioned problem by creating platforms where people can buy remaining meals from local restaurants for a reduced price.

Canadian startup FeedBack App works on a mobile platform that enables customers to rescue excess food from local vendors while saving money. In the app users get access to hundreds of time-specific promotions at Toronto’s restaurants. Customers order food directly through the app then arrive at a selected restaurant during the given pick-up hours and present an in-app mobile receipt to collect the ordered food.

Zooming closer reveals grimmer realities. The Sundarbans are a part of the world’s largest delta the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta covering most of Bangladesh and large amounts of West Bengal in India. Home to more than 100 million people it is one of the most densely populated regions globally and faces extreme poverty and plastic pollution.

Fringed by the large arc of the Bay of Bengal the coastal population here relies on the ocean upstream rivers rich delta soils monsoons and mangrove forests for its livelihood. Primary industries are marine and freshwater fishing rice farming and tourism. Life here teeters on a fragile balance with nature. Annual monsoons cause floods and rising ocean levels threaten to submerge the lands. However they also bring fertility and rich aquatic life that are vital to the livelihood of millions.

A particularly grave human-made threat to this delicate coastal ecosystem is plastics. Plastics pour into the bay from upstream rivers and neighboring areas and choke the coastal lands with the locally generated waste.

Impact of Plastic Pollution in the Sundarbans

The plastic in the food supply chain gravely impacts the fishery industry of the delta region as evident in its clogged mangroves and plastic-choked fish farms. Plastic also pollutes the population’s primary food source: fish and other aquatic life. As plastics disintegrate into fundamental particles they make their way into the biota and eventually into humans causing many health issues.

The area’s waste-blanketed beaches also deter tourism. Accumulations of plastic mar beautiful coastlines due to poor infrastructure and waste management.

Additionally increasing plastic use by ever-growing populations depletes natural resources and poisons life-giving food sources. This creates conditions for poverty and unsustainable living in the Sundarbans. Reducing plastic accumulation in the ocean and coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal is critical and needing concerted multi-pronged actions.

Addressing the Plastic Pollution Issues at the Source

Measuring and identifying pollution problems upstream as with the National Geographic-led Ganges Sea to Source Expedition project will be vital to deploying preventive solutions closer to their source. Projects such as this one seek to understand the plastics’ journey in the river tracking the patterns volumes and trajectory into the ocean. The Ganges one of the world’s largest rivers is a principal source of water into the Bay of Bengal and a principal source of its plastics. The Ganges and two other rivers are estimated to empty one to three billion microplastics into the Bay of Bengal each day.

Waste Management Programs

Waste management programs to reduce plastic in the ocean and neighboring coastlines are critical in this fight against poverty and plastic pollution. Such programs can include installing waterway bins and collectors in the bay and plastic collection programs in coastal areas. Such programs have the added benefit of employing local labor in building these infrastructures. However solutions such as installing obstructive bins in the ocean have their limitations. A push to longer-term restructuring and design will be necessary while relying on short-term solutions.

Awareness and Innovative Products

Large-scale education campaigns on anti-littering and plastic-use awareness are also crucial to addressing current pollution challenges. Encouraging reuse responsible disposal of wastes and moving to environment-friendly alternatives in daily life can help slow the current plastic pollution rates.

In the long term establishing programs that focus on bio-friendly products and innovations offers the best route out of the current predicament. Boosting programs and research in topics that rethink current practices and modes of plastic-dependent systems can also stimulate the local economy and employment while generating viable solutions. Levying taxes to deter plastic use should also be considered within a broader governance and policy framework.

As gloomy as the Sundarbans’ current pollution circumstances seem there are many paths to reversing plastic’s impacts in the Bay of Bengal while boosting labor in local populations with innovation research and collective action.

But the ex-broadcaster is now being recast as a content studio with its new offshoot AMM Global leading the charge.

The division is headed by Bizhan Tong a Chinese-British former banker turned filmmaker (“The Escort”). He joined the company after directing “Lockdown” a U.K.-Hong Kong co-venture film produced and co-financed by Tong’s Phoenix Waters Productions Hong Kong asset management firm YG Capital and AMM Global. International sales are handled jointly by AMM Global and US firm OneTwoThree.

The movie being launched at FilMart is a pandemic-era thriller in which an actor must keep passing devious tests set by a casting director in order to keep the people around him alive. As events escalate and more people are trapped the actor must confront his past overcome his present and find out why events are happening.

The film is currently in post-production but this week released a new poster and trailer. Completion is set for April.

Popular on Variety

The companies are exploring all release formats. They are targeting theatrical in Hong Kong and certain other territories. Streaming is likely for countries which are still wrestling with pandemic conditions.

The eclectic cast includes Xander Berkeley (“The Walking Dead”) John Savage (“The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone”) Hong Kong actress Anita Chui (“OCTB”) Reza Diako (Apple TV Plus’s “Tehran”) Jumayn Hunter (“Small Axe: Mangrove”) Alix Wilton Regan (“Cyberpunk 2077” “The Wife”) Kevin Leslie (“The Rise of the Krays”) Pamela Nomvete (“Gangs of London”). Other roles go to film production executive Mike Leeder and Japanese adult film star Meguri.

“ ‘Lockdown’ was inspired by the passing of my mentor who died from COVID-related complications and by the George Floyd protests which erupted soon after. The film touches upon the various events of 2020 within the structure of a thriller” Tong told Variety.

“The film is also intended to be the first launch of a new franchise with the story expanding in the sequel. We are already in talks to shoot with a star in Korea.”

AMM Global and Phoenix Waters are developing a slate of films series and variety shows to be produced in Hong Kong for local and international audiences. Other upcoming projects include: crime drama series “Forensic Psychologist” with both a Cantonese and English-language versions planned the latter in partnership with Debbie Mason co-founder of Kudos Productions (“Spooks”); and an Asian remake of Richard Linklater’s “Tape” with its original writer Stephen Belber (“Match” “What We Do Next”).

AMM will also work with third party producers. “As part of our strategy we are targeting collaborations and partnerships with other production companies and studios on projects which fit our model” Tong said. “We recently agreed a partnership with Mercury Pictures in the U.S. run by Francis O’Toole and I am currently in talks with producers both within Hong Kong and neighboring regions such as the Philippines on certain films and shows.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbWVzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JrLXVuZGVyLXdheS1hdC1zZW50aW5lbC1zLWZ1dHVyZS1zaXRlL2FydGljbGVfMzNmOGY1NmItZDQ4My01ODVlLTlkMTAtZDExZDYzMjc4ZWRkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work under way at Sentinel's future site | News | romesentinel.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Icebreakers from the Canadian Coast Guard and contracted boats began clearing the waters near Shippagan and Caraquet on the Acadian Peninsula over the weekend.

Gilles Thériault president of the New Brunswick Crab Processors Association said the early opening will help get fishermen setting traps before the whales begin migrating into the Gulf of St. Lawrence in May.

""This is a really short season and it really depends on every crab that we can catch in terms of making a significant contribution to the economy of northern New Brunswick"" he said in an interview.

The season is expected to start at the beginning of April up to four weeks earlier than normal. While the season extends into late June the presence of whales means most of the fishing grounds are forced to close.

Below target last season

The early start is expected to boost profits compared to last season.

Thériault said the industry left about 11 per cent of its quota in the water in 2020 or between $40 million and $50 million worth of product.

""This fishery is really important and it's certainly a loss to the community when you basically leave that much crab in the water"" he said.

Gilles Thériault is president of the New Brunswick Crab Processors Association. (CBC)

Despite early concerns about the pandemic hurting sales the price remained stable. The retail market absorbed about 85 per cent of product making up for the loss of sales to casinos and restaurants primarily in the U.S.

Thériault said the price this year is expected to be at its highest level up from between $4-$4.50 at the end of last season.

In recent years the industry association has been advocating for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to provide icebreaking. But those operations have been primarily to access areas with flooding not specifically to help fishermen.

Thériault who lives in Tracadie said fishermen are thankful for the icebreakers.

""The quicker we catch our quota the less danger there is of whales being trapped into ropes"" he said.

""We hope that the vast majority of the quota will be caught before the whales arrive.""

Avoiding right whales

North Atlantic right whales normally migrate to waters in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Bay of Fundy toward the end of May after spending the winter off the shores of Florida and Georgia.

The population is dangerously low with entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes the biggest causes of right whale deaths. Researchers estimate there to be only a little more than 350 left in the world.

Thériault said the presence of whales makes fishing ""nerve-racking"" and expensive as different areas close in response to sightings.

The biggest cause of death for North Atlantic right whales is fishing gear entanglements and ship strikes. (Submitted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute)

""You keep shifting your traps toward the end of the season"" he said. ""So it's a very stressful and a very tense situation and sometimes you have to get out of the best fishing grounds because that's where the whales happen to be.""

A warmer than average winter has resulted in less ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. But there remains ice along the coast inside wharves and in the entrance of the Shippagan Gully.

The Mariinsky Theatre dancer posted the video online adding music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake in a nod to the swans that live in the area about 50 km (30 miles) west of St Petersburg.

""This is a unique natural and historical place where swans nest in the spring where families with children holiday in the summer where hundreds of fishermen go out onto the ice in the winter. All this is threatened with destruction"" she wrote on Facebook.

Russia's TASS news agency reported last year that the Baltic Grain Terminal company wanted to start building a USD 477 million terminal on Batareinaya Bay. Sodruzhestvo an agro-industrial group that owns Baltic Grain Terminal declined to comment.

The Leningrad regional authority told Reuters it had not issued any construction permit to build in the area.

Bagautdinova called on Russians to sign an online petition addressed to President Vladimir Putin calling for the bay to be left in its natural state. The petition has so far garnered more than 7650 signatures.

""It was my cry from the heart to save an amazing place that has a special meaning for me"" the 29-year-old told Reuters.

Bagautdinova said her family often visited the bay's sandy beaches in the summer and sleighed there in the winter.

""It would be great if after I danced here the construction would stop and we could save this amazing natural place. But I don't think it's that easy"" Bagautdinova said.

Broadway Ave. will close at noon on Wednesday June 2.

Wells Fargo employs 911 people across the state.

A company official said the building will be sold.

FARMINGTON — Downtown Farmington will lose one of its more prominent businesses later this spring as Wells Fargo officials have announced they plan on closing their branch on East Broadway Avenue.

Franchesca Pancham a communications adviser for Wells Fargo New Mexico said the company's main Farmington branch at 100 E. Broadway Ave. will close at noon on Wednesday June 2. She described the move as a consolidation in an email to The Daily Times.

""This is not an easy decision or one that we take lightly"" she wrote. ""We continually evaluate our branch network and make adjustments based on changing customer needs market factors and economic trends. This process leads to both expansions and consolidations. While the branch continues to be important in serving our customers' needs we're finding that customers increasingly use digital tools for transactions such as bank deposits. As a result more transactions are happening outside the branch.""

It was unclear how many employees would be affected by the move as Wells Fargo does not disclose staffing numbers at specific locations for security reasons. Nor was it clear whether those employees would be laid off or absorbed by the company's other branches in Farmington.

""At this time we are reviewing staffing needs and will determine what impact this consolidation may have on employees at the Farmington Main Branch"" Pancham said.

She said Wells Fargo employs 911 people across the state.

Warren Unsicker the city's economic development director said the news was unexpected. A nearly $12 million project to renovate the downtown district and replace much of its infrastructure recently was completed and city officials have expressed hope that the changes will revitalize the area.

""I hadn't heard that was coming"" Unsicker said. ""It is unfortunate and obviously we don't know what went into their thinking and reasoning. … But we are thankful that right now there is an interest in downtown.""

He said the city looks forward to partnering with a business owner or developer for the location who shares the city's vision of what downtown can become.

Pancham said Wells Fargo will place the property on the market. The building in which the branch is located is one of downtown's larger structures and the branch includes a drive-thru operation across Broadway Avenue.

Unsicker said he considers the property to be one of downtown's more desirable locations.

""I think it will be"" he said. ""It's pretty central to downtown. We're trying to develop housing and office space that's not smack on Main Street.""

Unsicker reiterated his disappointment at the news and said he hopes for the best for the bank employees who will be affected by the closure. But he said he believes the building has the potential for a variety of purposes and he looks forward to discussing those possibilities with interested parties.

The closure means customers who have been using the downtown branch will have to conduct their business at Wells Fargo's other San Juan County locations the closest of which is a branch at 501 E. 20th St. The bank also operates one more Farmington location one in Bloomfield one in Kirtland and two in Shiprock according to its website.

Some Americans are seeing their stimulus checks pending in their bank accounts and they’re complaining about banks holding their stimulus direct deposits.

If you’re included in that group don’t worry: Banks aren’t sitting on stimulus payments. It just takes a couple days for the checks to process.

“Some people will see the money in their accounts as early as this weekend as a pending or provisional payment until it is cleared by their financial institution” a Treasury official told reporters during a call on Friday.

The stimulus payments worth up to $1400 per person (and more for married couples and those with children) were included in President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package that was signed on Wednesday.

“Customers who are eligible to receive direct deposit of their stimulus payment may expect it as soon as March 17 2021” Wells Fargo tweeted Friday. And many Twitter users responded to the tweet complaining about the bank’s projected timeline.

Yeah I'm switching banks after this.



There is NO reason why you can't send them out this minute. — Casper Raine 🐰❌️ VTuber (@Casper_Raine) March 13 2021

It's criminal that you're holding on to the stimulus payments until the 17th. There is zero reason to hold onto them.



I predict this will be the last straw with a lot of people. This is a horrible move on your part. You deserve the loss of customers. — 🎶SifiChick Ingvar 🎵 @ 🏡 (@Sifichick) March 13 2021

Wells Fargo responded to Twitter users’ complaints Saturday saying the bank would “process all of the direct deposits according to the effective date provided by the US Treasury.” The tweet also highlighted that people can check the status of their payments by using the Get My Payment tool from the IRS.

Chase Bank also tweeted saying “We are making funds available as they are received. Most eligible customers can expect to see stimulus payments in their Chase account as soon as Wednesday March 17.”

Some Americans have already seen the latest round of stimulus payments hit their bank accounts. By Saturday morning several people had posted on social media about seeing their stimulus payments pending in their bank accounts. Although direct deposits have gone out first paper checks and prepaid debit cards will be sent out before the end of March.

The money is expected to reach about 90% of families according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

However some of the nation’s biggest banks say they will not be processing the payments this weekend instead announcing they will begin to do so on the 17 March.

While the official payment date for the $1400 stimulus checks has been established as 17 March the likes of Wells Fargo and Chase have faced heavy criticism for not releasing those payments already being deposited by the IRS this weekend.

Customers who are eligible to receive direct deposit of their stimulus payment may expect it as soon as March 17 2021. https://t.co/ujd9oUUWmP — Wells Fargo (@WellsFargo) March 12 2021

Stimulus check payments: Chase and Wells Fargo issue statements

""We expect that electronic stimulus payments will be available in eligible Chase accounts as soon as Wednesday March 17 2021"" Chase wrote on its website.

Meanwhile Wells Fargo tweeted: ""Customers who are eligible to receive direct deposit of their stimulus payment may expect it as soon as March 17 2021” emphasizing on its website that it would process the payments in line with effective date provided by the U.S. Treasury of 17 March.

To our understanding Bank of America has not issued a statement regarding when they will process the payments but it appears that many Bank of America customers on Twitter are complaining about their payments being withheld.

Some digital banks like Chime meanwhile have said they authorized their clients to have instant access to their payments. On Friday Chime issued a so-called ""stimmy alert"" on Twitter saying it had already distributed $600 million-worth of payments to its customers.

Millions of Chime members have received over $3B in stimulus payments and more are on the way. That’s up to 5 days earlier than most traditional bank accounts. We know that every day counts and Chime always has your back 💚 — Chime (@Chime) March 14 2021

Why are Chase and Wells Fargo withholding payments?

The banks are in their right to hold back on releasing the payments until the official 17 March payment date outlined by the US Treasury. But why have these big banks not made an effort to start disbursing those payments that have already been transferred by the IRS – as has been the case with digital banks like Chime?

According to the Huffington Post part of the reason is because Chase and Wells Fargo are set to gain from delaying the processing of payments at the expense of their customers who are eagerly awaiting the money.

""Sluggish check processing only works to banks' advantage because of the increased 'float' created by a massive influx of government cash. They can juggle the delays to boost outgoing loans to other customers and to boost their profits"" the HuffPost noted.

How to track the payment status of your stimulus check

The IRS Track My Payment Tool is now available for this latest third round of stimulus payments allowing you to check the status of your $1400 check. Up until early Sunday morning the Tool was only available for tracking the status of the previous $1200 and $600 payments but it has now been updated by the IRS to give information on these latest payments approved under the American Rescue Plan.

""Get My Payment updates once per day usually overnight...Previous payment information is no longer available in Get My Payment"" the IRS says. ""The first batch of payments will be sent by direct deposit which some recipients started receiving as early as March 12. Additional batches of payments will be sent in the coming weeks by direct deposit and through the mail as a check or debit card.""

Many of these circular earth mounds are over 1000 years old the remains of stone or wooden forts which housed an extended family in early medieval times. Others which are often classified as fairy forts are in fact remnants of underground passage tombs or ritual sites dating back to around 3000 BC.

In 2010 the environmentalist and author Tony Lowes first wrote about farmers destroying the forts on their land in the name of modernity and progress. A man on the Dingle Peninsula levelled a large part of the 3000-year-old Dún Mór fort while the government was in negotiations with him to purchase it and a farmer near Mallow in Cork destroyed the half of an extensive ringfort that lay on his own land then tore down the other half when his neighbour was at a family funeral. There was also the story of a Cork dairy farmer who demolished two ringforts on his land and whose family had previously destroyed three others.

The title of Lowes' article in Village magazine was The Men Who Eat Ringforts in recognition of the fact that these farmers (and developers and engineers) are invariably male. The title has been adopted for a volume of book art Men Who Eat Ringforts published by the conceptual artists Sean Lynch and Michele Horrigan of Askeaton Contemporary Arts. It's a large-format book designed by Daly+Lyon with thought-provoking essays by Sinéad Mercier and Michael Holly exploring the determined desecration of our ancient past.

Mercier a researcher of climate change law points out that in general Irish people didn’t consider ringforts in terms of archaeological monuments but instead saw them as “symbolic of ‘something else’ – manifestations of the mythological netherworld of ‘the good people’ – na sióga... part of an old animistic faith found in the spiritual nature of land.”

Liminal status

Their complex liminal status has made them hard to enshrine in law possibly due to the fact that the legal system is “a product of the Enlightenment” Mercier suggests “a time in which rationality attempted to discredit all perspectives of nature that were not grounded in science and in market economics”.

In 2015 the destruction of a 5000-year-old ringfort was sanctioned to make way for a multinational pharmaceutical plant development in Waterford

It means that whatever meagre legislation is designed to protect ringforts is somewhat obtuse and circuitous.

“Any individual who has been successfully legally prosecuted has received a conviction not for destroying a monument outright” writes Mercier “but for failing to inform authorities of an intention of completing earthworks in its vicinity.”

Since 2007 a total of nine cases have been taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions for alleged offences under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014. Of these four convictions were secured by the State.

Nowadays it is more common for the State to dismantle ringforts than individual farmers. The power to sanction the demolition of a national monument was first invoked to facilitate the destruction of the Viking site beneath Dublin Corporation's new office blocks at Wood Quay in 1978 and again during the construction of the M3 motorway through the Tara-Skryne Valley in Co Meath in 2003. The legislation was amended in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 to further empower the State to demolish any newly discovered national monument on every motorway route in Ireland without any kind of environmental impact assessment. This was used for instance to allow the M50 motorway to proceed through Carrickmines Castle.

Hallowed

The idea that these were once considered as Mercier writes “places of magic sacred hallowed and revered ultimately representing a sense of oneness and yet otherness” ended in the eyes of the State with the 2004 Act. The complex and nuanced status that fairy forts held in the nation’s consciousness now survives in the minds of mystics and romantics.

Michael Holly sought out one such individual for the book. During the spring and summer of 2019 Holly brought the folklorist and seanchaí Eddie Lenihan on a series of journeys along the M18 motorway between Limerick and Galway in search of ancient sites that had been interfered with either by road construction farming or industry. Lenihan's connection to this road began in 1999 when he wrote to The Irish Times warning of dire consequences if a sacred sceach or whitethorn bush was interfered with during the construction of Junction 10 of the M18.

Lenihan's letter pointed out that the bush was referred to in many folk tales as a meeting place for the fairy hordes of Connaught and Munster and he warned that if riled the fairies might retaliate by causing road accidents. His forebodings were picked up by the New York Times and CNN and eventually led to the National Road Authority diverting the motorway around the bush although the body denies this was the reason. Yet as Holly points out from the overpass ""you can see how the route kinks slightly to the east to avoid"" the bush which stands ""proudly between the northbound lane of the motorway and the on-ramp on the western side.""

Lenihan appeared on Clare FM's Morning Focus to discuss the freak hailstorms that frequently cause crashes on the stretch of the M18 between Crusheen and Gort

During Lenihan and Holly’s M18 peregrinations they navigate a maze of slip roads on-ramps off-ramps carriageways and overpasses trying to access ringforts such as at Ballycasey near the major junction where the N18 Ennis bypass becomes the M18 motorway. It was here that Lenihan saw beech trees being felled in 1999 and again he warned the road workers that there could be dire consequences for their actions.

At the time Ballycasey’s fort had been on a prominent hilltop location but now it has been dwarfed by the motorway interchange overlooking it. The gargantuan scale of motorway infrastructure and quite how alienating it can be in the landscape is made clear. These concrete ribbons stretching from one location to another without ever interacting with the local environment appear to exist on another dimension. As Holly writes: “The motorway as it is either cut into the landscape or is built on top of it disavows the place that it runs through. It provides you with a trance-like experience of time and space in between destinations.”

Elemental forces

Yet there are still certain elemental forces that can impact these giants. In August 2017 Lenihan appeared on Clare FM's Morning Focus to discuss the freak hailstorms that frequently cause crashes on the stretch of the M18 between Crusheen and Gort. Lenihan suggested that it could be the fairies who were responsible for the high number of accidents on this route which passes alongside the Curtaun ringfort that was partly damaged by the motorway. TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) dismissed the claim saying it was to do with a rare microclimate in the area but a Freedom of Information application sought by Holly ""reveals that over half of the accidents that happened on the M18 between 2013 and 2019 occurred near the ringfort and that freak hail showers were a contributing factor in every case"". It was an elderly local man who first made the connection and told Lenihan about it saying: ""But sure what could they expect after what they did to the fort?""

The sheer number of ringforts that have managed to survive for millennia in the landscape make it inevitable that each subsequent generation has to contend with them to some degree.

To get a sense of just how ubiquitous ringforts are in the landscape check out the Twitter bot and Instagram feed created by Irish designer and tech developer Keith Ó Faoláin who used a combination of a dataset obtained from the Irish National Monuments service and a text-character recognition algorithm to create an online bot that isolates the location of a ringfort on satellite imagery and posts an image of it on Twitter every hour. The @everyringfort account claims that there are enough ringforts in Ireland to keep posting new hourly images continuously until August 2022. It has already been running for a few years.

We may have turned our backs on fairy forts but they haven’t gone away.

Submitted

This spring Ballet Theatre Company (BTC) West Hartford’s premier ballet company will continue to entertain audiences locally and nationally with the premiere of two digitally presented performances “Up Close: Spring” featuring the premiere of “Budding Affairs” and the full-length classical ballet “Snow White.”

This past Fall BTC produced its first ever digital performance “Up Close: Fall” featuring the premieres of “Autumn Aurora” set to Vivialdi’s “Autumn” concerto and “Flashes” set to music by popular 1960s artists. Households from 16 states across the country tuned into this digital performance and reconnected themselves with the power of the performing arts.

On May 1 BTC will premiere “Up Close: Spring” featuring a new work titled “Budding Affairs” sponsored in part by Ivan and Marianne Mueller. This piece set to Vivaldi’s “Spring” concerto will feature choreography by Artistic Director Stephanie Dattellas and dancing by BTC’s Season Dancers Emily Silva Jo-ann Burke and Joseph Beltre as well as guest artists from Dance Theatre of Harlem Alexandra Hutchinson and Derek Brockington.

Brockington a past guest artist featured in BTC’s 2018 and 2019 productions of “The Nutcracker”has become quite the dance world sensation with his friend and Dance Theatre of Harlem co-worker Alexandra Hutchinson. The two produced “Dancing Through Harlem” this past summer spearheading several other dancers from the prestigious Harlem-based company to perform Robert Garland’s “New Bach” throughout the streets of Harlem NY. Aside from a raving review from The New York Times they have been recognized on The Ellen Show and have raised a total of $4855 on their YouTube page through sharing their video on social media platforms. BTC is thrilled to be working with both of these talented and influential dancers this spring.

Since 2018 BTC has premiered a full-length storybook ballet each spring expanding its long-standing tradition of spring repertoire performances which previously featured excerpts from classical ballets or new works set by BTC faculty and guest choreographers. The effects of COVID-19 prohibited BTC from producing its planned spring performance of “Aladdin” last year but this spring from June 12-30 the company will present the classical full-length ballet “Snow White” in a movie-style presentation.

The classic story based off of the Grimm’s Fairy Tale will be told through dancing by BTC’s professional Season Dancers and pre-professional Corps de Ballet members local and regional guest artists and students from The School of Ballet Theatre Company. Scenes will be filmed in various Connecticut locations including Topsmead State Forest the Old New-Gate Prison and Copper Mine Harkness Memorial State Park and a private residence in Winchester CT. All filming and editing will be completed by Peter Cofrancesco of Creation Dream Video a talented local professional videographer and frequent collaborator with BTC.

BTC is currently seeking the support of local businesses to sponsor a leading character in its digital production of “Snow White.” Character Sponsorships offer visibility to sponsoring businesses in all of BTC’s “Snow White” marketing materials (print and digital) and are offered in two tiers. The first tier includes sponsorships for leading characters (i.e. Snow White the Evil Queen the Magic Mirror etc.) while the second is for each of the seven charming Dwarfs. Sponsorships directly support BTC’s local professionals including dancers costume designers videographers production managers and others involved in bringing this film-adapted ballet to life. To learn more about sponsoring a character in BTC’s “Snow White” visit BTC’s website.

Tickets for BTC’s Spring Digital Season are on sale now! Tickets for “Up Close: Spring Budding Affairs” are $15 per household. Tickets for “Snow White” are $35 per household. A $5 discount is applied at checkout when tickets to both spring performances are purchased at the same time. Household tickets are determined by IP address and allow unlimited viewing access to the ticket holder for the duration of the premiere length. “Budding Affairs” will premiere from May 1-9 and “Snow White” will premiere from June 12-30.

At that time it was difficult to estimate the impact that COVID-19 would have on 2020 corporate performance and compensation programs (and significant uncertainty still exists). Compensation-related actions in response to COVID-19 will be a major discussion point in CD&As and proxy advisor reviews that are released in early 2021. Below are the trends we observed through the 2020 proxy season.

We did not observe any change in the average Say on Pay vote support for Russell 3000 companies from 2019 to 2020 despite a significant number of companies disclosing mid-year pay We expect the 2021 average vote support and failure rate to reflect more of COVID-19’s impact as shareholders learn the full breadth of actions (such as discretionary bonus adjustments modifications to outstanding equity and other design changes) taken by companies through proxy filings covering FY20 executive compensation

Based on the Say on Pay failure rate’s cyclical trend since 2011 we predicted the Say on Pay failure rate for Russell 3000 companies would fall below 2% after two consecutive years above 5%. The failure rate decreased to 2.3% in 2020

We expected the standard deviation of Say on Pay voting to increase above the 13% standard deviation observed in 2019 due to differing approaches from investors measuring company’s pay-and-performance relationship; however this shift was not as impactful as expected and the standard deviation decreased from 13% to 12.3% in 2020

We anticipated average Director vote support would fall below 94.5% as shareholders continue to increase expectations for Average vote support in 2020 (94.9%) did not drop as drastically as predicted; however we expect this trend will continue at the current pace in 2021 as pay-related decisions in the COVID-19 environment are assessed in next year’s proxies

We predicted the median vote support for Environmental and Shareholder proposals would reach 30%. Overall vote support did not increase in 2020 but the number of proposals receiving above 50% support increased significantly. Investors are tightening their expectations around ESG-related actions and are holding companies accountable to these expectations through other avenues beyond shareholder proposals

Breakdown of Say on Pay Vote Results

56 Russell 3000 companies (2.3%) failed Say on Pay in 2020. Four companies failed since our last report in September – these companies are highlighted in bold below.

Say on Pay Observations

The number of failures (56) and failure rate (2.3%) were both lower than last year and were the lowest observed since 2017

The 90.5% average vote result in 2020 was the same as the average vote result in 2019

One-third of the S&P 500 has received vote support below 70% at least once since 2011

The percentage of companies that received support between 70% and 90% was the highest observed since 2011

10% of the Russell 3000 and 8% of the S&P 500 constituents have failed Say on Pay at least once over the same period

ISS Recommendation Rate

89% of companies received a “For” recommendation from ISS in 2020. This is the highest rate observed since 2011

We expect that COVID-19’s impact and ISS’ changes to its pay and performance tests are the primary reasons that the 2020 “For” rate is the highest observed over the last ten years

We will continue to monitor this number in 2021 as we expect that companies taking actions in contrast to ISS’ COVID-19 guidance will lead ISS to recommend “Against” for a higher percentage of companies in 2021

Source: Data provided by ESGAUGE Semler Brossy and ISS Voting Analytics; analysis by Semler Brossy. Russell 3000 sample effective as of July 1 2019

During the 2020 proxy season shareholders voted on 148 social proposals and 38 environmental proposals – median support for environmental proposals (22%) was 400 basis points lower than last year while median support for social proposals (29%) was equal to the median support observed last year

Thirteen social proposals (9%) and six environmental proposals (16%) received greater than 50% support in 2020

By comparison 6.2% of social proposals and 0% of environmental proposals received greater than 50% support in 2019 See additional analysis and insights on ESG in executive incentives at www.semlerbrossy.com/corporate-purpose-guidance/

Spotlight: Procter & Gamble

Shareholders submitted a proposal requesting that Proctor & Gamble publish a report on the company’s efforts to eliminate deforestation from its supply chain. The proposal passed with 68% vote support

The proponents of the proposal cited the company’s use of palm oil and forest pulp (commodities considered leading drivers of forest degradation) as well as the company’s connections with palm oil suppliers linked to illegal deforestation as the basis for the initiative

The proponents of the proposal specifically noted that potential remedies could include no-deforestation policies for all relevant commodities and disclosure of quantitative progress reports/ time-bound action plans

The Board’s response opposing the resolution stated that the company is already committed to responsible sourcing in its supply chain and already reports on its progress toward its goals in its Annual Citizenship report

ISS recommended “For” the proposal citing that environmentalists question the deforestation standards of some third-party certification partners that the company references in its Citizenship Report and that the company lags its peers in terms of deforestation commitments and policies to monitor its suppliers

Director Election Observations

Average vote support for Director nominees (94.9%) was 20 basis points lower than the average support observed in 2019; this continues a trend of declining average vote support for director nominees over the last five years

The percentage of Director nominees that receive vote support over 95% has declined from 79% of nominees in 2016 to 73% of nominees in 2020

Over the past five years average Director election vote support at companies that received a Say on Pay vote below 50% in the prior year is six percentage points lower than at companies that received above 70% vote support

Average vote support for female Director nominees was 180 basis points higher than average support for male nominees in a second consecutive year",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaGVyLmllL2NlbGViL3JvYmluLXdpbGxpYW1zLW1hZGUtZXZlcnktY29tcGFueS13b3JrZWQtaGlyZS1ob21lbGVzcy1wZW9wbGUtNTE5MzQ10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robin Williams made every company he worked for hire homeless people,"“Thanks Robin Williams – not just for laughs but also for a cool example.”

Robin Williams was one of the good guys. That much we knew already.

But just in case anyone did need a reminder of why the late actor was widely regarded as one of the kindest men to ever grace Hollywood well look no further than the words shared by former booking agent Brian Lord.

In a post shared on his own website Lord details a “little-known” story about Williams who passed away in 2014.

Lord never actually booked Williams he explains but did come very close on one occasion: to the extent that his representatives sent over his rider.

Whereas some of his Hollywood contemporaries might put forward a host of extravagant requests on their own riders Williams’ was more concerned with using it as an opportunity to help others.

“When I got Robin Williams’ rider I was very surprised by what I found” Lord writes.

“He actually had a requirement that for every single event or film he did the company hiring him also had to hire a certain number of homeless people and put them to work.

“I never watched a Robin Williams movie the same way after that. I’m sure that on his own time and with his own money he was working with these people in need but he’d also decided to use his clout as an entertainer to make sure that production companies and event planners also learned the value of giving people a chance to work their way back.

“I wonder how many production companies continued the practice into their next non-Robin Williams project as well as how many people got a chance at a job and the pride of earning an income even temporarily from his actions.

“He was a great multiplier of his impact. Let’s hope that impact lives on without him.

“Thanks Robin Williams- not just for laughs but also for a cool example.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL2luc3VyYW5jZS1icm9rZXJzLWluLWZvcnQtd29ydGgv0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly9rZXZzYmVzdC5jb20vaW5zdXJhbmNlLWJyb2tlcnMtaW4tZm9ydC13b3J0aC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Insurance Brokers in Fort Worth 🥇,"Below is a list of the top and leading Insurance Brokers in Fort Worth.

Posted on: March 13 2021 02:31h.

Last updated on: March 14 2021 01:26h.

Wynn Las Vegas casino armed security officers will start wearing ballistic body armor for increased protection. The decision comes days after a murder-suicide at the gaming property where a security guard was shot dead by a hotel worker.

The Wynn undertook a review of security protocols on Tuesday following the death of guard and ex-Marine Yoseph Almonte 31 of Las Vegas.

Police say Reggie Tagget 42 also of Las Vegas who worked at the hotel fatally shot Almonte before killing himself.

Almonte had gone to the hotel garage to do a welfare check. Tagget was sitting in a car.

He opened the door took out a firearm and shot Almonte about eight times in the torso according to KLAS a local TV station based on a statement from Almonte’s widow.

The number of shots could not be confirmed immediately. The local coroner’s office did not provide autopsy details to Casino.org.

In recent months Almonte had told his wife Marjorie he did not feel safe at the hotel-casino following the Labor Day weekend melee in the Encore lobby KLAS said.

“They were scared because they realized this is out of control” Marjorie told the TV station.

She also recalled asking him about wearing a bullet-proof vest which she says might have saved her husband. He responded “We have been asking for three years.”

“The Wynn had neglected them because they say it did not look good for guests” she added. “It was going to be intimidating for the guests.”

Typically such vests are worn over uniforms by security guards.

Hotels Less Reliant on Police for Help

When asked about violent risks at hotels security consultant Brad Bonnell told Casino.org “We are … experiencing across the country something of a strategic shift in policing that has resulted in a reduction in the level of support that the police are able to provide to some hotels.”

Bonnell is a principal at the Hotel Security Group. Formerly he was Global Director of Security at the InterContinental Hotels Group as well as chief of staff for the Georgia State Patrol.

The change in policing was brought on in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and possible changes in the political and budget climate faced by police departments Bonnell said.

“The net result is that we in the hospitality industry are now required to be less dependent on the police for our security” Bonnell explained. “We now must do more on our own to meet our duty of care.”

Nationally many hotels are employing more contract security personnel and off-duty police officers than ever before Bonnell said.

The presence of armed and armored security personnel in a hotel also creates a deterrent he said. It discourages those “who might be inclined to believe that hotels are now vulnerable due to an overworked understaffed and underpaid police force” Bonnell added.

Another security consultant Tommy J. Burns said most casino-resorts already allow security officers to wear body armor at their own expense.

The decision by the Wynn to have security officers wear body armor is not a trend Burns said.

“(I) don’t believe it is or will be a trend for the near future” Burns told Casino.org.

Burns is a former chief at the Henderson Nev. Police Department. He was security director at Harrah’s Las Vegas and The Flamingo Hotel & Casino as well as at Station Casinos’ Fiesta Henderson and Green Valley Ranch Resort.

Almontes Could Sue Wynn

When asked about the legal risks following the murder-suicide Robert Jarvis a professor at Nova Southeastern University’s Shepard Broad College of Law told Casino.org. “I would not be surprised if Almonte’s family sued the hotel.”

Tagget’s estate likely has no money so the only “deep pocket” is the hotel Jarvis said.

“Such a suit would be based on a claim that the hotel was negligent and its negligence led to Almonte’s death” Jarvis explained.

But the family’s suit is likely to fail he added. Almonte was killed on the job so his death is covered by Nevada’s workers’ compensation law and in general workers’ compensation law bars lawsuits for on-the-job injuries Jarvis said.

Second businesses normally are not liable for the criminal acts of a third party he added.

But from a legal point of view if attorneys for Almonte’s family bring a lawsuit and can prove that the hotel knew or should have known that Tagget was dangerous mentally disturbed or had a death wish then the hotel should not have sent Almonte to the parking garage Jarvis said.

Metro police could have been contacted instead given the risk Jarvis said. The Wynn declined to comment to Casino.org beyond confirming that its security officers will wear the armor.

Nationally security officers are at risk for injuries. For instance this week a security officer at an Arkansas casino was shot in the stomach during a gunfight with patrons outside the resort.

In response police departments such as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department use protective vests all the time. They also routinely cooperate with casino security staffs.

Not all vests are the same a law enforcement source told Casino.org. There are different levels of protection provided by manufacturers based on whether the vests will be used for uniformed officers or even SWAT teams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvcGFsbS1iZWFjaC1sYWtlc2lkZS1jdXN0b20taG91c2Utc2VsbHMtcmVjb3JkZWQtNDktbWlsbGlvbi80NjY0MDk1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palm Beach custom house sells to Steve Wynn for $49 million deed,"No commitment required.

The wife of a Wynn Las Vegas employee killed this week by a co-worker said the couple were days away from moving into their first house together in Henderson.

Marjorie Almonte 36 and husband Yoseph Almonte 31 had bought their first dining room set last weekend. It was all wood and included a bench Yoseph Almonte looked forward to using for homework; he was going to school to be an emergency medical technician.

“It’s so surreal” Marjorie Almonte said Friday night. “I’m moving on with our lives with our plans but he’s not around. His bed is empty.”

Yoseph Almonte a special operations guard at the Wynn was shot and killed in a murder-suicide Tuesday in the employee parking garage after he went to check on Reggie Tagget a co-worker who had been missing for four days before he parked in the garage that evening according to Las Vegas police and the Clark County coroner’s office.

Almonte approached Tagget’s car and was shot multiple times before Tagget 42 walked away from the car and fatally shot himself.

When Wynn security reviewed his badge Tuesday they found he had entered the garage around 4:40 p.m. police told Marjorie Almonte.

When Yoseph Almonte went to the garage with several other Wynn guards Marjorie Almonte said her husband was the only one armed so he approached the car and had a brief dialogue with Tagget.

She said police have since told her that Tagget was sitting in the garage for more than an hour waiting for his ex-wife to walk to her car.

When Almonte tried to help Tagget get out of the car he was met with eight shots to the torso Marjorie Almonte was told by detectives. Her husband fired one shot striking Tagget in the back while he ran from the car.

“He went down with a fight” Almonte said of her husband. “I’m so proud of him. … He knew there were other officers with him. He was protecting his workers.”

Marjorie Almonte said that since her husband started at the Wynn more than three years ago the guards have been asking for bulletproof vests but management told them it would look too intimidating for guests.

In a statement after Tuesday’s shooting a Wynn spokesman said the resort will be supplying ballistic body armor for armed guards after requests from the security team.

“If my husband had a vest he would have had a chance to at least go to the hospital because if you get hit maybe you have internal bleeding or bruising” Almonte said. “The impact can be bad but he would have had a chance the chance he deserved and he never got that chance.”

Plans for a baby a new city

After being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2017 Yoseph Almonte briefly returned to his home in New York City before moving to Las Vegas for a job at the Wynn. It was supposed to be temporary; his goal was to become a nurse after he finished EMT school. As Almonte neared four years in Las Vegas he was most proud of his purple belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu and the plans he and his wife had to get pregnant by the end of the year.

“Maybe because of the Marines they have to have a structure and something to look for. He was an A-type” she said.

The couple had a quiet downtown wedding in July but Almonte promised his wife that they would have the big wedding she wanted ideally when they moved to Denver someday. In the meantime they stayed home each night watching “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” and “The Crown” to save money.

“He was my best friend; we did everything together. In two years we never fought. I cannot explain — he was the perfect person” Almonte said. “The chapter was cut so short so soon. My husband should be here right now.”

The song was co-penned in 1979 by Paul Shaffer and Paul Jabara whose trademark disco musicality made him the go-to songwriter of 70s and 80s and hitmaker for Donna Summer among others. The zany concept of a deluge of men raining down from the heavens led to It’s Raining Men (despite being written from a woman’s point of view and sung by The Weather Girls) becoming a huge hit in the gay community as Jabara had intended; and its tongue-in-cheek playfulness eventually unleashed a downpour of mainstream success for years to come.

“Of all the honours one can receive recognition from one’s home country is the most meaningful. I know my late co-author Paul Jabara is proud of me as I thank the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for auspiciously acknowledging our song It’s Raining Men” said Paul Shaffer.

Paul Jabara conceived the idea for It’s Raining Men in 1979 for disco queen Donna Summer for whom he had written her other chart-topping hits Last Dance and No More Tears. He called upon the affable keyboardist Paul Shaffer who had done some arranging for him and invited him to compose the music. As Shaffer told the CBC Jabara said “You worked so hard as an arranger; I want you to write this one with me.” Shaffer enthusiastically responded “I’ll be right over!” — and the duo completed the song that afternoon.

Undeterred by the fact that true-believer Summer had turned down the song on the grounds of it being blasphemous Jabara recorded it as an instrumental which he shopped to various high-profile singers until he found the perfect vocalists in Martha Wash and Izora Armstead of the appropriately-named vocal duo Two Tons O’ Fun who already had some disco hits under their belts. Wash’s voice was a tour de force and her powerful bluesy-gospel delivery took the song to new heights beyond pop dance and disco into the R&B genre.

Produced by Jabara and Bob Esty the recording for It’s Raining Men was released in 1982 on the Columbia label and was an instant dance hit. By December the infectious song was No. 1 on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart in addition to reaching No. 34 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hiphop chart and No. 46 on its Hot 100 chart.

It was the song’s campy music video that propelled its success to the mainstream. Wash and Armstead had renamed themselves The Weather Girls and the music video featured men in raincoats and skimpy briefs as they rained down during a weather forecast. The light-hearted video was perfectly suited for the new platform called MTV which had just launched the previous year to gain a whole new audience for the song."

More than 450 employees contractors and partners are working around the clock to restore service.

Even so Xcel says many customers may not see their power restored until sometime on Monday. As of 9 pm. Sunday about 29000 customers were without power in northern Colorado. Another 545 customers in the Denver metro area were without power.

""Many of the outages are due to the heavy wet snow and blizzard conditions causing damage to powers lines and electric poles"" Xcel said in a news release. ""Because of the adverse weather challenges crews are facing power may not be restored this evening.""

(credit: CBS)

Emergency weather shelters are available in Morgan and Larimer Counties at the following locations:

Morgan County: Fort Morgan High School – 709 E Riverview Ave. Fort Morgan

Larimer County: Leeper Center – 3800 Wilson Ave. Wellington and Ridgeline Hotel – 101 S. Saint Vrain Ave. Estes Park

Customers can report a power outage on the Xcel Energy mobile app online at xcelenergy.com or by calling 1-800-895-1999.

Weld County experienced the most widespread outages Sunday according to Xcel Energy’s outage map. As of 10 p.m. 24871 customers were without power in northern Colorado mostly around Greeley.

Fewer than 500 people were still without power in the Denver area as of 10 p.m.

More than 600 people worked Sunday to restore the power said Hollie Velasquez Horvath senior director of state affairs and community relations at Xcel Energy. The heavy snow as well as high winds displaced powerlines snapped utility poles and damaged the arms that connect the powerlines to the poles she said.

Some poles were also damaged when drivers slid off the road and collided with them.

“We don’t anticipate letting up the restoration throughout this evening and into tomorrow morning” she said.

Xcel said in a release late Sunday night that customers in northern Colorado who lose service were encouraged to prepare for the disruption to last through the night.

Overall more than 152000 Xcel customers experienced outages Sunday though 56000 of those outages have been momentary disruptions that last a few seconds Velasquez Horvath said. Momentary outages are caused when wind pushes powerlines into each other. The system then automatically turns off the power briefly to those lines so that the contact doesn’t cause a fire or other damage.

Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association customers also lost power Sunday morning with outages concentrated near Berthoud and west of Fort Collins according to the association’s outage map. The co-op covers 2000 square miles of service territory in Larimer Weld and Boulder counties.

“We currently have roughly 1350 members out of power sporadically across our system” the association posted on its website. “Snowfall intensity has picked up with light winds out of the north. Lines and trees are loading up with heavy wet snows and getting together causing outages.”

The association said crews are out and “making progress” despite the tough conditions.

Caroline Maxwell said she and her three children lost power about 8 a.m. and they’re keeping themselves busy while her husband who works in the oil and gas industry is out clearing sites from the snow.

The family lives on the west side of Johnstown and it’s not clear when power might come back on Maxwell said.

“So far so good” Maxwell said noting that she stocked up on meat and dairy before the snow started falling. “I don’t think anybody can say they didn’t expect this or weren’t warned for the storm.”

Maxwell gave thanks that neither she nor her children have any medical conditions that could be made worse by a loss of power. Outside she said there’s a good 20 inches of snow on the ground.

For Calida Troxell to the northeast the snow drifts are up to about 6 feet and counting. Troxell who lives near Pierce guesses her home lost power between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and she can only text on her cellphone to conserve her battery.

“The wind is blowing pretty hard and the ice is the trouble now I would guess” Troxell texted.

While she has no guess as to when the power might return Troxell said she’s keeping an eye to the thermometer. So long as temperatures stay above 20 degrees most folks should be OK she said.

People who still have power should make preparations in case they lose it said Jennifer Finch Weld County spokeswoman. Keep medical devices and phones charged she said and if food must be cooked before eating it cook it now.

“Be prepared” she said. “Pull out the blankets and hunker down in one interior room in the house.”

Power outages are possible all along the Front Range the National Weather Service say because heavy snow can bring down tree branches onto power lines or accumulate on the lines themselves.

How to prepare for a power outage

Energy providers suggest these preparedness tips during severe weather:

Build a home emergency kit and store it in an easily accessible spot. It should include your energy provider's phone number; flashlights; batteries; and backup phone chargers. Other items include blankets; a battery-powered radio; a phone that does not require electricity; a nonelectric alarm clock; bottled water and nonperishable food; a manual can opener; a first-aid kit; and manufacturer's instructions on how to manually open power-operated doors such as garage doors.

Have other essential items on hand including medications/prescriptions and specialty items for infants seniors or people with disabilities.

Charge external power banks for electronics that can run out of power more quickly when Wi-Fi is down.

Ten years ago to the day (March 12 2011) Kyle Rau had the senior moment of all senior moments the walk-off of all walk-offs.

Rau then an Eden Prairie High School senior scored the game-winning goal in a 3-2 triple-overtime win over Duluth East in the Class AA Minnesota State High School League state tournament championship game.

He scored the goal while sliding across the Xcel Energy Center ice on his belly. The first assist went to his twin brother Curt.

“Because of the circumstances it’s said to be one of top goals in state tournament history” said Eden Prairie Coach Lee Smith. “They’ve called that game one of the best championship games of all time.

“I still hear about it” he added “and it happened 10 years ago.”

It goes without saying that said goal was the biggest goal in Eden Prairie High School hockey history.

Rau’s stick pushed home a rebound that went off a goal post and then off a defenseman’s skate before ricocheting into the net.

“It’s something I’ll never forget” said Rau.

Rau was playing his last high school game and taking what turned out to be his last high school shift.

“I remember the big hit he took in the neutral zone in the second period” said Smith. “They replayed it on the scoreboard during a TV timeout. They showed it over and over and every time the crowd moaned.

“I think that hit fueled Kyle even more” he added.

Nerve wracking

Question: Was Rau’s winning goal part of a winning-goal plan?

Answer: Yes and no.

“When you’re on that stage and in overtime you know everyone’s nerves are high” said Smith. “Instead of just dumping it in Curt had an opportunity to puck the puck on net. When the goalie mishandled it I was hoping the puck would get in on its own.

“I didn’t see any of our other players in position to get the rebound” he added.

Enter Kyle Rau 2011’s Mr. Hockey award winner.

“Kyle made an amazing play” added Smith.

The question remains was the play planned?

“No” said Smith “we didn’t plan to score the winning goal that way but putting the puck on net in that situation is something we like to do.”

In baseball if you put the ball in play good things might happen. The hockey equivalent is putting the puck on net.

Memories

Rau who has been on the Minnesota Wild’s taxi squad for much of the season was called up to the big club for a couple games in February. He’s played in four Wild games in March.

Are other Minnesota Wild players aware of Rau’s high school hockey successes (two-time state champion)?

“Some of them are” said Rau “but they’re always out of town when they play the state tournament. If they went I think they might think differently about our high school hockey.”

Note: 22 state tournaments have eclipsed the 100000-fans mark.

“Great memories” added Rau.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9raXJpbGwta2Fwcml6b3YtcmVjb3Jkcy1maXJzdC1jYXJlZXItaGF0LXRyaWNrLWFzLXdpbGQtc2h1dHMtb3V0LWFyaXpvbmEtNC0wLzYwMDAzMzgyNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kirill Kaprizov records first career hat trick as Wild shuts out Arizona 4-0,"One hand on his stick his hair flapping underneath his helmet Kirill Kaprizov darted from the Wild bench and made a beeline for the offensive zone.

He scooped up a pass in stride swung around the Arizona net and then veered into the slot before flinging the puck into the back of the net in one fluid motion.

The skill alone is enough to jolt the Wild a team that has been short on edge-of-your-seat talent for years.

But the work ethic is what makes Kaprizov a rare breed.

And both were on display Friday when the rookie scored his first career hat trick in epic fashion.

""He's a very special hockey player"" coach Dean Evason said. ""We're going to come to expect that to happen.""

Kaprizov interrupted a scoreless battle igniting the Wild to a 4-0 about-face vs. Arizona at Xcel Energy Center with a third-period clinic that pushed his team's win streak at home to six games and improved it to 10-2-1 over its past 13 overall.

Aside from being just the third Wild player to record three goals in the same period Kaprizov is only the second rookie in team history to secure a hat trick; Justin Fontaine (Jan. 9 2014) also registered his against the Coyotes.

The 23-year-old Russian also set a career high in shots (eight) which tied the team's rookie record; so did his plus-4 rating which is also a career-best clip.

BOXSCORE: Wild 4 Arizona 0

Not only does Kaprizov lead the Wild in points with 23 but he also paces all NHL rookies in goals (10) assists (13) and points.

""Players like that are very special and they don't come around that often"" said Cam Talbot who made 25 saves for his first shutout of the season and 23rd of his career in his return to action after backing up Kaapo Kahkonen the previous two games. ""Having a guy like him on your team in a 0-0 game you always feel like you have a chance for sure. Any time the puck touches his stick he can be dangerous and make something out of nothing.""

That certainly was the case in this game with the first two periods a trudge for the Wild.

The team was playing shorthanded since Marcus Foligno left the game in the first after taking a Jonas Brodin shot off the lower right leg. Evason did not have an update on Foligno's status.

But strong play from Talbot who was surprised to get the start since Kahkonen is on an eight-game win streak put the Wild in position to win the game if the team won the third.

Cue Kaprizov.

""He's having a fun time out there"" captain Jared Spurgeon said.

At 5:47 Kaprizov cut to the inside before slinging a shot by Coyotes goalie Adin Hill who totaled 28 saves. Both power plays went 0-for-4.

Next up was the highlight of the night Kaprizov's sprint off the bench around the net and into the middle for his second goal at 8:10 — a superb combination of finesse and determination in a breezy 10 seconds.

""Just a special play from a special player"" said Talbot who is familiar with superstars having played with Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl in Edmonton. ""That's the best way you can put it. Any time he's out there he seems to be able to make something happen.""

And then after Brodin chipped the puck into an empty net with 59 seconds to go Kaprizov one-timed in a Mats Zuccarello pass (Zuccarello's third setup of the game) at 19:11.

As he unleashed the shot Kaprizov hit the ice with his left knee — crystallizing the moment with a pose befitting a trading card.

Already it's embossed in Wild lore.

""He's got a couple good guys on his line that are really good finding him in open spaces"" Talbot said. ""But he just creates more space for himself where he doesn't need a ton of room. You could see that tonight. Any time he touches the puck a special play could be coming.

""It's fun to watch and I'm happy he's on our side for sure."""

The nets funded by the French Embassy in Ghana according to Play Soccer Ghana is to promote clean cites provide employment and ensure the participation of women’s football in Ghana.

Presenting the items to the Regional Football Association Programs manager at Play Soccer Ghana Anthony Asante Addo intimated it was the wish of the organization that there would be no hindrance to the development of women’s football in Ghana.

He says Play Soccer Ghana as a way to help communities deal with waste decided to collect plastic bags and turn them into something valuable that would promote football and create employment for the communities.

Anthony Asante Addo revealed his organization has trained volunteers in communities and also sensitize them to sort out their wastes so they could be woven into the nets.

“We go round the households collect the sachet rubbers and then weave them into goal post net. This is to promote clean cities help manage plastic wastes and most importantly promote the women’s participation in football” he stated.

The project that is being implemented across 8 communities throughout the country is expected to train community volunteers who will undertake the weaving of the nets and get some stipends out of that.

Also at the ceremony were two German female soccer stars who just retired from active football in Germany.

The two Josephine Henning and Thabea Kemme paid a courtesy call on Play Soccer Ghana and the Regional Football Association to explore ways of supporting and helping develop women’s football in Ghana.

Thabea Kemme who spoke on behalf of the two says they came to give back to society help people that have talents but do not have the support to appreciate the game and explore what football can do in their lives.

“It’s our pleasure to assist in getting these talents into the game. Whatever support we have we will use in supporting them. We just want to give back to society” she said.

Acting Central Regional Director of the National Sports Authority Alexander Tieku is upbeat should many girls get the needed support the female games would see a greater improvement.

“To be Frank with you we have many talents as far as the female soccer is concerned. Sometimes what holds them back is the support needed to bring them into the limelight. And it will take the collaboration and support like what we are planning to make us achieve these dreams” he stated.

The two female stars are in Ghana under the auspices of Common goal an NGO that seeks resources to support the development of football across the globe especially women soccer.

Hip-hop duo Das Racist said it best: ""I'm at the Pizza Hut / I'm at the Taco Bell / I'm at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell"" (via Genius). Not only has the song inspired a whole host of memes and TikToks including a page on the website Know Your Meme it's also based on a real phenomenon. The combination of Pizza Hut and Taco Bell that Das Racist speaks of is located on Jamaica Avenue in Queens New York and still exists to this day earning a 3.8 out of 5 stars on Google as of this writing.

Though the song's namesake is still around the combination fast food restaurant may not be as widespread as it used to be. In 2013 DNAinfo reported the Taco Bell-Pizza Hut in Penn Station had been closed for health violations and in 2016 the Daily Press reported a KFC-Taco Bell-Pizza Hut (aka ""Kentacohut"") in Poquoson Virginia would cease operations after over a decade.

In 2018 members of the Taco Bell subreddit mentioned that their local combination restaurant had shifted gears — one became just a Taco Bell and the other a KFC-Pizza Hut-Taco Bell combo just became a KFC-Taco Bell combo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2dyYW5kcmFwaWRzLmNvbS9mb29kLWFncmlidXNpbmVzcy93ZXN0LW1pY2hpZ2FuLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWJlbmQtY2F0ZWdvcmllcy10by1zdXJ2aXZlLXR1bXVsdHVvdXMtMjAyMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Michigan restaurants bend categories to survive tumultuous 2020,"Jeff Lobdell’s portfolio of restaurants took a nearly 40-percent hit to its top line revenue during a COVID-19 pandemic-rattled 2020 that took a hefty toll on the hospitality industry.

However one store under the ownership of his Grand Rapids-based Restaurant Partners Management LLC managed a sharp bounce back.

Bagel Beanery located at 455 Michigan St. NE in Grand Rapids took a similar initial nosedive early in the pandemic but finished off the year down around 3 percent in revenue Lobdell said. Bagel Beanery is also the only fast food/fast casual restaurant — often referred to as a quick service restaurant (QSR) — in the Restaurant Partners portfolio.

Lobdell’s experience with Bagel Beanery is a microcosm of a trend that has been playing out nationally where the food industry is seeing a boom in sales for quick service restaurants a trend that could lead to lasting effects post-pandemic.

Fast Food Rebound

The Bagel Beanery location on the Medical Mile is outfitted with an amenity that proved coveted during the pandemic: a drive-thru window.

Because of the drive-through capabilities Bagel Beanery was one of just two restaurants in Lobdell’s portfolio that was able to stay open during the pandemic. The other was The Beltline Bar in Grand Rapids which traditionally generates 15 percent of its sales from takeout orders.

However despite the drive-through window Bagel Beanery generated roughly half of its sales from patrons ordering inside the store.

This could explain why despite a healthy bounce back Bagel Beanery was unable to jump back into the black like many of its QSR counterparts across the country.

Fast food franchises were some of the biggest winners of the pandemic and the new dining format of choice.

“When everything was shut down — and all the sit-down restaurants closed — the fast food restaurants stayed open” Lobdell said. “They initially took a bit of a nosedive and a lot of them got big PPP loans and then they started pulling out of it and excelled through the rest of 2020 while the sit-down restaurants continued to suffer.

“During the second shutdown the fast food restaurants didn’t skip a beat. They were able to shed some costs of operating dining rooms while still having the efficiencies of the drive-thru going.”

Industry numbers underscore the fact that QSR was just about the only winner in the dining industry emerging from 2020.

Data from restaurant industry analytics company MillerPulse chronicled the journey through COVID-19 which kicked off with a 20-percent drop in same-store sales for QSR restaurants in April when the pandemic started to grip the country. By November quick service restaurants managed to creep into the black with a 1.1-percent increase in same-store sales for the month. MillerPulse also projected that performance will improve even more in 2021.

Many of the usual suspects saw a fortunate mid to late 2020. McDonald’s Corp. recorded a 4.6-percent increase in same-store sales for the third quarter of last year while Yum! Brands Inc. reported a 3-percent increase in same-store sales for Taco Bell for the third quarter. Kentucky Fried Chicken also owned by Yum! saw same-store sales jump 9 percent in its third quarter.

Grand Rapids-based Meritage Hospitality Group Inc. followed suit. An operator of 340 Wendy’s and other restaurants in 16 states Meritage’s sales grew 10.4 percent for 2020 totaling $516.2 million compared to $467.5 million in 2019. The improved sales happened after the company only developed or acquired three new restaurants.

Meritage did not respond to requests for comment.

In an earnings report last month CEO Robert E. Schermer Jr. said: “We achieved record financial results during an unprecedented and challenging year. This was quite an accomplishment given the negative impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter resulting from mandated closures associated with the pandemic.

“Our restaurant operating teams and real estate development group finished the balance of the year strong supported by a resilient Wendy’s brand. As we continue to build on our sales momentum with double-digit growth during the first quarter of 2021 we are focused on executing our critical priorities including employee and customer safety while delivering speed convenience and affordable quality food.”

Imitating Qsr

While quick service restaurants faced many challenges in what proved to be a rough 2020 the inherent nature of their business models did lend them some favors.

Daniel Estrada CEO of Grand Rapids-based 86 Repairs which provides end-to-end equipment repairs and maintenance processes for restaurant groups works with many of these types of restaurants. In fact 90 percent of 86 Repairs’ client base belong to the QSR sector.

“QSR operators they’re generally very process-oriented” Estrada said. “The franchise systems in fast food especially they have systems for everything. They systematized the creation of food the recipes how the food is served all of those things have a lot of process and thought. Full service restaurants tend to be more creative and less structured.”

This is why since spring of last year dine-in restaurants have worked to mimic the QSR model which isn’t an easy shift in some cases.

“A lot of full-service operations have been thinking a lot more about their menu design — how big the menu is the profitability of the menu — and focusing on that more so than the past” Estrada said.

Plus with sanitation now at the front of mind for many patrons more than ever restaurants have been intentional about emphasizing and showing customers the measures they have taken to maintain clean and healthy spaces Estrada said. This includes everything from proper social distancing to embracing paper or QR code menus.

Lobdell has made these and other pivots to keep his dine-in restaurants afloat. He is also noticing a pent-up demand for in-house dining especially now that restrictions on capacity and curfew are easing. While he expects in-house dining demand to eventually return to pre-pandemic levels he does foresee some long-lasting effects of this new fast food-friendly market.

“I think probably dining rooms will shrink in size; meanwhile exterior patios and outdoor dining will grow in size” he said. “I think fast food restaurants many of them have even determined they were more profitable without their dining rooms.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZHMtZ3J1bXBpZXN0LWNhdC1maW5kcy1sb3ZlLTA2MTYzODgyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Grumpiest Cat Finds Love — Fetching $83000 In NFT Sale,"The authenticated non-fungible token edition of “Grumpy Cat” a 2012 era internet meme has been sold for more than $80000.

Nike Panini and Vodafone are among the brands that were quick to see the potential of non-fungible tokens.

Decrypt’s Art Fashion and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

In recent days brands have leapt aboard the multi-million dollar NFT bandwagon with companies ranging from Taco Bell to Charmin minting their own non-fungible tokens.

Reactions have ranged from bafflement to weary eye-rolls—but is it so surprising that brands are wholeheartedly embracing the opportunity to engage with their audiences via these unique collectible tokens?

For some brands it’s the trend of 2021 so far and they've seized on the promotional opportunity presented by NFTs. Others though have seen a long-term value proposition in the digital scarcity that NFTs offer.

Here’s a quick rundown of some of the biggest brands already aboard the NFT hype train.

1. Pizza Hut’s pixelated pizza

Pizza Hut Canada (owned by Yum Brands! which also owns Taco Bell) put a pixelated pizza on Rarible for 0.0001 ETH ($0.18). The idea was that it should be affordable like the cost of a bite of Pizza Megan Farquhar Executive Creative Director at Ogilvy the agency responsible for the campaign told Decrypt.

Available for an extremely limited time but will last forever. https://t.co/f4831jybLc pic.twitter.com/yhUbxfs7YG — Pizza Hut Canada (@PizzaHutCanada) March 17 2021

The NFT was used as a marketing opportunity to promote a special offer on four favorite recipes available at Canadian restaurants. Each week the company will release a new pizza slice as an NFT. The first one was sold earlier this week and has been re-listed for 5 ETH ($9000). “Pizza Hut’s delicious pizza is here to stay digitally and otherwise” said Farquhar.

2. Pringles and the can of chips you can’t eat

Kellogg’s-owned Pringles announced the release of a limited-edition flavor that it's calling CryptoCrisp during the height of NFT mania. There were 50 packages auctioned but they only exist as NFT artwork. 10% of sales are going to the artist who created the NFT H+ Creative.

3. Taco Bell’s delectable collectible

Taco-themed collectibles hit the Internet when fast-food chain Taco Bell dropped its collection—which promptly sold out. Taco Bell created five distinct NFTs on sale for 0.001 ETH ($1.79) which is quite cheap as NFT sales go. But some collectors were asking for close to $200000 on the resale market. At least the proceeds go to a worthy cause; the Taco Bell Foundation which is focused on helping young people find careers.

4. MGA Entertainment gets bratty with dolls

MGA Entertainment’s Bratz franchise—spanning toy dolls movies TV shows and games—minted a series of “NFT dolls” in the form of collectible cards last December partnering with Animoca Brands. The rarest one “Shimmerin’” was redeemable for a physical doll.

5. Ubisoft and its disappearing Rabbids

Game publisher Ubisoft released an Ethereum-based Rabbids game last year which lets players purchase characters from the popular gaming title. Naturally with Rabbids there’s a twist players potentially won’t own the Rabbid for very long; it can be purchased by another user and “stolen.” But the proceeds go to charity UNICEF so that’s OK.

“We wanted to do something crazy something different and we really wanted to create our own NFTs and see how far we could go in the programmable aspect of things” Ubisoft's Blockchain Initiative Director Nicolas Pouard told Decrypt.

6. Charmin’s non-fungible toilet paper

Procter & Gamble lavatory-paper brand Charmin raised a few eyebrows when it released a series of “NFTP” art pieces dubbed Non-Fungible Toilet Paper this week. Bids for the Charmin NFTs were as high as 0.15 ETH ($264.72) with proceeds going to the humanitarian aid charity Direct Relief.

7. Nike raids CryptoKitties to patent CryptoKicks

Sportwear supremo Nike saw the NFT trend coming two years ago when it patented NFT shoes called CryptoKicks. The idea is that different designs of shoes can be ‘bred’ essentially to create new custom sneakers that can even be made in the real world. The concept pays homage to one of the first NFT releases CryptoKitties which enabled owners to breed virtual cats.

8. Vodafone gives London Vatom Vapor

Back in 2019 smartphone giant Vodafone launched an augmented reality game where players had to hunt down NFTs named Vatoms on the streets of central London. The game was part of a promotional Apple giveaway. Over a two-hour period every day for a week Vatoms appeared in six “high-footfall” locations. The game was so successful that Vodafone launched another version the following year partnering with Samsung to offer users thousands of tech prizes that were tied to the NFTs.



9. Panini premiers NFTs for the Leagues

The National Football League (NFL) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) have both partnered with Panini America for NFT cards featuring American players as crypto-collectibles. The top collectibles company was one of the first major card manufacturers to use NFTs allowing collectors to own trade sell or auction digital assets the same way they would a physical trading card.

10. Formula 1 races to NFTs

Players can build a collection of NFTs including car parts and drivers in an Ethereum-powered game named F1 Delta Time. The game was developed by F1 partner Animoca Brands which is working with hundreds of brands on NFTs including MotoGP and Formula E.

Although at the time the purchases were among the most expensive NFTs sold Metakovan's since gone on to spend a record-breaking $69 million on a digital artwork by crypto artist Beeple.",,,

ZTS,Zoetis,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzEzL2lzLXpvZXRpcy1zdGlsbC1hLWJ1eS13aXRoLWl0cy1zdG9jay1uZWFyLWFsbC10aW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Zoetis Still a Buy With Its Stock Near All-Time Highs?,"This leader in animal healthcare has shown strong financial performance through the years.

With the U.S. stock market butting against record highs valuations certainly deserve a closer look. One company that may survive such scrutiny is Zoetis (ZTS 1.51%).

Zoetis specializes in making pharmaceuticals for livestock animals and pets. While the company may not be a household name among investors like Pfizer Zoetis has been a great stock to own over the long term and has continued to report strong financial results throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zoetis's record 2020

2020 was a fantastic year for Zoetis. Earnings were up due to excellent performance in its companion animal segment (companion animals include dogs cats and horses). While the livestock segment was flat for the year sales in the companion animal division were up 17% thanks to the launch of a new product Simparica Trio and gains in the company's dermatology portfolio.

Simparica Trio is a parasiticide for companion animals to prevent heartworm ticks fleas roundworms and hookworms. What makes Simparica Trio special is that it is the first ""triple threat"" parasiticide on the market that combats all the major parasites at the same time. The new drug added $150 million of incremental sales in 2020.

Another part of the company's portfolio that outperformed was dermatology. Revenues increased more than $170 million versus the prior year thanks in part to continued performance from Apoquel and Cytopoint both of which benefited from pet owners being more attuned to their pets' behavior while stuck at home.

Zoetis's livestock segment had a very challenging year due to the pandemic which caused a massive contraction in livestock demand across the globe. However China helped mitigate some of these headwinds with significant revenue contributions in an effort to replenish the still-weakened herds caused by an outbreak of African Swine Flu in 2019.

Attractive long-term growth

Zoetis is expected to carry its momentum into the new year. The company provided financial guidance for revenue to grow 9% to 11% in 2021 driven by continued performance in the companion animal segment new product launches and increased demand for livestock-related products during the economic reopening.

The companion animal segment has driven most of the company's growth with new product launches as a highlight. Zoetis has one of the most robust development pipelines in the industry. For example management has high hopes for Librela and Solensia (osteoarthritis drugs for dogs and cats) which are expected to be released during the first half of 2021.

What is unique about these pharmaceuticals is that they use monoclonal antibodies to provide effective pain relief and joint mobility with minimal kidney and liver involvement. This is truly groundbreaking for the veterinary industry at large and is difficult for competitors to replicate.

Companion animal diagnostics is another interesting growth area for the company. When Zoetis acquired Abaxis in 2019 it gained access to a suite of testing equipment and kits that allowed the company to enter the highly lucrative diagnostics space. Zoetis intends to continue growing in the pet diagnostics space through mergers and acquisitions so investors should keep an eye on what the company acquires in the future.

Zoetis is fortunate to be built on strong fundamental trends. An ever-increasing number of families are adopting pets and they're finding medical care for them at increasing rates. And the livestock division is expected to sustain its mid-single-digit growth as emerging economies consume more protein and farmers shift to work more sustainably.

Valuation too high?

With a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 40 Zoetis's stock doesn't scream ""cheap."" However Zoetis is a high-quality business with a position in the attractive market for animal healthcare. Investors are paying a high multiple in expectation of continued growth.

If you compare Zoetis to human-oriented pharma peers the stock looks expensive. Pfizer carries a P/E ratio of 20 and Eli Lilly trades for 30 times earnings.

However if you compare Zoetis to other pet companies the valuation appears to be more reasonable. Idexx Labs a veterinary diagnostics company trades for 73 times earnings while pet food company Chewy is unprofitable and trades for 6.4 times its price-to-sales -- compared with Zoetis's price-to-sales multiple of 10.

An attractive growth story

Clearly Zoetis is running red-hot right now. The challenges of 2020 proved that Zoetis can rise to the occasion and management has clearly been forward-looking -- new product launches an expansive global presence diagnostics penetration and much much more all paint the picture of a company that truly understands its business.

Zoetis has provided excellent returns for investors and only seems to grow in potential. Its top-tier pipeline and robust portfolio look poised to dominate the market for years to come. Investors keen to join in on animal health would be wise to take a look at Zoetis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
