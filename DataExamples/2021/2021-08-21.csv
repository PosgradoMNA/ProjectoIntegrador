Katharina Ritz head of the ICRC delegation in Yemen posted on Twitter: “With the start of the school year in Yemen let us not forget that the conflict has destroyed hundreds of schools and made nearly three million children unable to enrol in education this year. Yemeni children like all children need to go back to school.”

On 8 August the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that 8.1 million Yemeni children require emergency educational assistance. A week ago the new school year started in Yemen amid extremely difficult living and health conditions.

For nearly seven years Yemen has been a stage for a war that has claimed the lives of 233000 people while 80 per cent of the population (amounting to 30 million people) have become aid-dependent in order to survive in the worst humanitarian crisis in the world according to the UN.

The conflict is further complicated by the fact that it has regional extensions. Since March 2015 an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been carrying out military operations supporting government forces against the Iranian-backed Houthis who control several governorates including the capital Sanaa.

Hasan’s success reached new heights in 2021. He currently has 1.5 million followers and 50000 active subscribers on Twitch and the numbers keep on rising. So it’s only natural that he’d cash in his chips and buy a new home.

However the internet erupted into a heated debate after an article reported his new home in West Hollywood cost him a whopping $2.74 million which some people saw as hypocritical given that he identifies as a socialist.

It’s not the first time it’s happened either. Nicole ‘Neekolul’ Sanchez was criticized for purchasing a $2m apartment for the same reason. Many people rushed to her defense and they’re doing the same for Hasan.

He’s also been hitting back at the haters himself too.

That includes individual responses to fans claiming he’s “disingenuous” should donate a “significant amount of money” to charity given his riches and should keep advocating for higher taxes on the rich including himself.

Hasan has responded to this outrage

The essence of the argument against him is simple; essentially some Twitch fans feel like Hasan isn’t practicing what he preaches given that he’s apparently indulging in an expensive lifestyle.

They’ve been calling him out on social media too. They made various points about his situation and he’s been responding.

In one example he took a swipe at a user who claimed it was “immoral” for him not to donate significant amounts of money to charity given his wealth claiming that he donates money both publically and privately.

He wrote: “I do donate some public most not. However this is a f**king brain-dead take that keeps dumbasses thinking Bill Gates is a good guy btw.”

More comments followed including one from a user who claimed buying mansions isn’t how you solve social issues and accused him of only donating to charity to evade taxes.

“You really think doing my personal accounting is valid political critique?” Hasan said in a deleted tweet. “I bought a house for my family. It’s also where I intend to stream every day. Why is this any of your f**king business?

It’s not all about the people criticizing him though. Many others defended him including Ethan Klein. “Y’all really think Hasan shouldn’t be able to own a nice house and also champion for the poor and underprivileged?” he said.

“There is a difference between making millions on Twitch and paying 50% in taxes and Jeff Bezons being worth 150mbillion and paying no taxes” Klein continued. “Happy Hasan is crushing it.”

“I’d like to congratulate Hasan for building a successful career” she said. “Enjoy the home. Nothing wrong with having nice things.

Her brother Declan 25 shelled out £750000 on a flat in the city last August.

And sister Bethany 22 bought an £825000 pad in Glasgow in October months after turning 21 — which she’s now selling for offers over £900000.

Sellers at property firm Savills describe it as recently “redeveloped” and “extensively upgraded with input from high end London-based interiors firms”.

Photos of late James Bond icon Roger Moore and Queen rocker Freddie Mercury adorn the walls of the home’s cinema.

Rebecca’s haul meanwhile started with a city centre flat at a modest £290000 in October.

But she added a “stunning blonde sandstone detached villa” on the outskirts of Glasgow for £1.35million last month.

The “elegant mansion” constructed in the 1900s is said to be in a “prime location”.

In May 2019 we told how Rebecca had successfully taken over Michelle’s tanning business transforming it into a £10million company in just five years.

Bethany’s foray into the city’s property market follows a controversial reality TV appearance in one of Glasgow’s most socially deprived communities.

The Baroness’s daughter spent a week in Bridgeton for Channel 4 series Born Famous in 2019 to simulate how her life could have turned out if her mum hadn’t become a famous businesswoman.

In June Baroness Mone and billionaire hubby Doug Barrowman announced an £18million investment in a hybrid-workspace concept.

The peer declined to comment but a source said: “Lady Mone’s kids are all successful in their own right. Their mum and her husband are one of the wealthiest families in the UK. Both are self-made which should be congratulated.”

Sean Lock died this week after a battle with cancer and it has been revealed that he has left behind a £3 million gift for his loved ones.

The 8 Out Of 10 Cats comedian was only 58 when he died from skin cancer which he was first diagnosed with in the 1990s.

The Daily Star reports that Sean filed annual accounts for his Sean Lock Ltd company a month ago and it had cash reserves of just over £1m and total assets – including property worth £350000 – of £2.8m.

According to The Mirror it is also reported that Sean earned more than £1 million in 2019 bringing home around over £250000 after taxes.

Sean was married to Anoushka Nara Giltsoff and they had three kids two daughters and a son together.

The funnyman previously opened up about how he'd battled skin cancer after working on a building site when he left school in the 1980s.

He wasn't diagnosed with the condition until the 1990s but blamed it on over-exposure to the sun admitting he never wore sunscreen while working on the site.

He was 27 when he was diagnosed with malignant melanoma.

Speaking about it in 2010 he told the Daily Mail : ""I liked the work and the wages - £340 a week which in 1981 was a lot of money.

""You could hardly ask a big Irish foreman 'Please could you rub some Ambre Solaire on my back?'

""And we didn't wear hats either. None of us took any notice of the fact that we were going red.""

His diagnosis came after a one night stand when the woman noticed an odd spot on his back.

""I asked her what it looked like and she said it was a patch of skin which was black misshapen with a crusty texture and about the size of a 10p piece.

""I had no idea how long it had been there.""

Sean said that the girl - named Tina - saved his life suggesting that if he hadn't been with her that night he could have died.

The redevelopment of the former care home has been funded by Babergh District Council and Homes England with a mix of one and two-bedroom flats available.

The home closed in 2019 and was bought by Babergh from Suffolk County Council with the hope of bringing more much-needed affordable housing to the market town.

Councillor Jan Osborne Babergh District Council’s cabinet member for housing said: “We believe everyone in Babergh should have somewhere affordable that they can call home.

""Social housing is required within every local community and this development meets a range of needs – whether they are adding to our 3500 council houses across the district or helping those on lower-income to own their own property with a part-rent part-buy option.

""Ultimately these properties are more than bricks and mortar. They are now people’s homes.”

The reasoning behind the development was because of the ever-increasing need for quality affordable housing.

Babergh District Council’s planning committee approved the first stage of plans for the redevelopment of the care home back in 2019.

Councillor David Busby Babergh District Council’s cabinet member for assets and investments said: ""This is just one example of the investment we are making to ensure we have the right type of housing in the right place to meet the needs of local residents.

""This was a significant council investment to breathe new life into a disused town centre site and solve a local need for social housing - offering a real demonstration of the council’s ongoing desire to support its communities.”

Applications to rent the new homes have already been received via the Gateway to Homechoice choice based letting system."

The unlimited vacation policy would eventually be adopted by many other companies (widely publicised ones include LinkedIn General Electric and Dropbox) and sometimes even touted as a perk.

The legal minimum amount of leave days an employee in Singapore is entitled to? Seven and that is if they are covered by the Employment Act and have worked for the employer for at least three months.

Most companies however typically offer anywhere between 14-21 days.

And given these numbers an unlimited number of vacation days does sound like a dream. But is it really?

When Hastings explained how he came up with the policy in his book No Rules Rules he had acknowledged that there was a fear that staff would turn into ""zombies"" from not being able to take a break.

One of their managers ""Donna"" who is always getting up early and working late was a case in point.

Donna hadn't taken a true vacation in four years because a sense of insecurity constantly gnawed at her: She didn't want to appear like she isn't working hard enough. To make things worse her entire team consisted of workaholics so she felt pressured to be at work constantly.

Donna's story hints at the possible gaps between employee privileges and the disturbing realities of work culture: Unlimited leave policies only work well when employees are actually able and willing to go on vacation where required.

""It could lead to a lot of guilt tripping""

In environments where it is simply not conducive to go on leave — either due to the sheer amount of work that cannot be handed over or because team mates and bosses make it incredibly difficult for employees to be away by guilt-tripping them or requesting that they set aside some time for a ""very important meeting"" on their vacation day — the unlimited leave policy turns out to be a perk but only on paper.

31-year-old Ben who spent four years working for a Southeast Asian company with unlimited vacation days explained how things can turn toxic very quickly if employees are afraid to go on vacations:

""Unlimited leave can hold employees back from taking leave for fear of taking more leave than the 'norm' or their peers. With no fixed number of days there is no longer any existing benchmark for what is acceptable in the company.""

Worse still Ben highlighted how such a policy can also make it easier for managers to convince their subordinates to defer their leave to a later time in the year or the following year since there is technically no cap on the leave days per year.

Kate (not her real name) echoed the importance of culture and being willing to ""cover for one another"" so that others can take a proper break. The 25-year-old works for an American advertising agency in Singapore offering unlimited leave days.

""My company is actually very supportive of people taking the leave they feel they need. My managers never guilt trip me when I take leave and actively try to make sure that we're not disturbed while on leave. I think if management isn't actively supportive it could lead to a lot of guilt tripping judgement and lead to a pretty unhealthy work environment.""

This is also why it's so important for managers to ""lead by example and take time off for important life events outside of work"" Ben added.

The irony of having unlimited leave is that you may end up taking fewer leave days

Hastings claimed in 2015 that he takes around six weeks of vacation a year according to CNBC and even urged his employees to do the same.

But not everyone sees the need to be away for so long — and that's fine as long as the number of leave days works well for them.

Ben who worked in a startup didn't go on leave at all in the first two years. In the next two years he took about 10 days a year.

27-year-old Wendy (not her real name) who also worked at the same company admitted that she too ""didn't really think much about taking leave"" and ended up only taking around 15 days of leave in two years.

An average of five days per year spread across four years might prompt one to think that Ben was surely working himself too hard. Interestingly Ben also admitted that he was likely to have taken more leave days if he was allocated a fixed number.

""Not because I needed the extra break but because a fixed number of leave days would likely have anchored my mind towards that number.""

The same goes for Wendy who also said that she would have felt ""pressured to use up the balance"" if she had a fixed amount.

However both Wendy and Ben told Mothership that they are ""generally satisfied"" with their leave situation. Ben also added that he ""took the time off that (he) needed"".

Which come to think of it is perfectly in line with the spirit of the policy of taking any many rest days as one requires.

""It's just peace of mind not having to always calculate the number of days left""

Done well an unlimited vacation policy can be beneficial to the mental well-being of employees.

Kate said that the unlimited leave policy at the company she works for allows her to ""feel better about taking leave"" as she would not need to worry about ""saving"" her leave days.

She is also ""overall quite happy"" with the amount of leave she has taken adding that she ""feels rested"" and is ""in a good head space about work"".

""With fixed days I was always trying to save the days. Even when I felt like I was burning out a little I would just plough through for the sake of 'saving leave'. With unlimited leave it's easier to balance family obligations and social life. I feel better about taking leave because I know I'm not using up a limited number of days. For example I can afford to take a day off to take my dog to the vet and have enough days to go on that family holiday — it's just peace of mind not having to always calculate the number of days left.""

""It can be abused by both employers or employees""

When Hastings introduced policies such as unlimited vacation and no approval needed for company expenses he was well-aware of the risks.

""The challenge of freedom is that it can be abused"" Hastings was quoted saying in an interview with NPR. ""There are very few people who do abuse it but it's a pity when it happens.""

The drawbacks of offering such freedoms is that it is entirely possible for employees to exploit such a policy and consistently underperform or fall behind Wendy said.

Not that she's observed such behaviour at her company though she quickly clarified.

Focusing on output & KPIs

In Wendy's view a successful implementation of such a policy requires the company to accurately measure and manage output and KPIs.

Employees need the assurance that their work is done. They also need an understanding of what high quality work looks like based on clear assessment metrics.

Without these indicators of what good performance is it is entirely possible that an employee fuelled by insecurity would feel the need to put in longer hours in an endless pursuit to prove their worth.

Having a work culture oriented towards the number of hours put in rather than valuing output and quality of work also means that staff may not feel adequately empowered to take breaks when required.

Learning how to recharge properly — regardless of the policy

So is unlimited leave an actual benefit or not?

It may be useful to go back to the intended benefit of why unlimited vacation days were even offered in the first place.

The policy is intended to give people greater autonomy. Without the ""distraction of stifling rules"" the leadership can focus on performance and results rather than micromanaging how the job gets done.

Kronos CEO Aaron Ain was quoted saying:

""In an era when so many employees are plugged in around the clock official policies that depend on clearly delineating when they’re 'at work' or 'on vacation' strike me as antiquated or even foolish.""

However as Ben pointed out:

""Unlimited leave is a double edged sword. The policy needs to be executed well in order for it to benefit employees.""

For instance it should not be too difficult for staff to go on breaks when required. And breaks should also be treated as such — employees should not be expected to be constantly available even when they're on leave.

Perhaps it's not so much about the number of days of vacation that one takes but rather whether they can use their leave days to properly recharge with much-needed time off.

After all it is important to remember that unlimited annual leave is not an actual staff benefit if staff can't benefit from it.

THIS Cork villa home called Simla has only known two family owners in the past century — and even though the current owners have only been here for a mere three of those 100 years they’ve made as indelible a mark on the period property as previous occupants setting it up for decades more of rude good health to come.

One of two formal reception rooms at Simla Glenbrook with hand-crafted bookshelves

The Irish/American couple with teenage son were the perfect buyers for Simla when they bought it in 2018: they have professional backgrounds in architecture industrial design and construction as well as having an utterly practical hands-on ability to roll up their sleeves and to get stuck in.

Sash windows all conserved and drum-tight at Simla

They now know every square centimetre of their fully-conserved home and are only leaving with very mixed feelings.

When Ohio US-born Luke Mandle and Dublin native Lorna Ross bought Simla it had been four generations in the ownership of the Roberts family since 1919: like the Glenbrook area itself the Roberts surname is synonymous with the harbour the sea and the broad Atlantic ocean.

Ship-shape and bone dry: bathroom with wetroom area where there's a rainfall shower over a restored cast iron roll top bath

An ancestor of the previous owner Susan Roberts was Richard Roberts the Passage West-born captain of the SS Sirius the first steamship to cross the Atlantic going from Cork to New York in 18 days back in 1838 a year after the vessel was built in Scotland.

Capt. Richard Roberts captain of the Sirius which made the first steam powered crossing of the Atlantic in 1838

With a figurehead of a dog to mark the ship’s naming after Sirius the Dog Star the brightest star in the sky the history-making 178-foot ship later plyed more pedestrian routes and eventually sunk off the Cork coast at Ballycotton while carrying passengers and cargo from Glasgow to Cork via Dublin with the loss of 20 lives.

Passage West Maritime Heritage & Museum Centre has a scale model of the ship 'Sirius' the first ship to cross the Atlantic entirely under steam and captained by Passage West man Richard Roberts.

Harbour ahoy Atlantic downriver

Today it is still fondly remembered in Cork and even though post-Simla’s sale some of the Roberts family’s Sirius memorabilia (such as a sea captain’s coffer chest) went to auction in 2018 the owners of Simla have an empathy for that Roberts’ nautical link.

Simla's subtle tribute to the SS Sirius named after the Dog Star and to the house's previous owners the Roberts family descendants of Sirius' Captain Richard Roberts. It was 3D printed by Luke Mandle

They have a ship painting on a reception room wall very similar to the Sirius and in a more lateral thinking connection the multi-talented Luke Mandle even 3-D printed small Labrador dog’s heads to crown columns at the property’s entrance support wrought iron gates (pic left) they put in commemorating the Dog Star that other Sirius in the sky. (The gates came from a friend Kilkenny-based artist and conserver Shem Caulfield.)

Happy landings

With their own trans-Atlantic connection the Mandle/Ross family with their 16-year-old son Oscar bought Simla in 2018 when they relocated from Thomastown Kilkenny. Now for family/education reasons they’re set to relocate to Sligo continuing peripatetic careers from the west coast.

Working at the intersection of technology science and design Dún Laoghaire-born Lorna Ross returned to Ireland after three decades working at the highest design levels with the likes of MIT the Mayo Clinic US defence agency DARPA and Motorola as well as lecturing in Rhode Island School of Design.

Keen aesthetic eye at work at home

She came home to head up global consulting company Accenture’s Fjord Design Studio in The Dock Dublin as Design Director and now after an Irish jobs move is Chief Innovation Officer with VHI.

Lorna’s work will see her switch between Sligo and Dublin instead of Cork and Dublin while Luke Mendle’s next challenge is as-yet unclear as he wraps up a two/three year stint of house renovations upgrades and super-sensitive conservation of historic building fabric here at Simla.

He restored each and every original sash window by hand scarfing in new hardwood sections and coping with the nuances and weight impacts of old vs newer 3mm vs 4mm glass and the panes’ impact on the sashs’ balancing hidden lead weights. He also levelled insulated and refinished pitch pine floors and in conjunction with certified trades fully replumbed and rewired.

Serene

Luke now describes the circa 170-year-old Simla as “an historic house with hidden modern engine.”

That hidden modernity includes a pantry/engine room with CAT Six cabling network patch panel and hub; high-efficiency modulating-condensing boiler with four zones with wireless thermostats and internet phone app control; an aqua box for pressurised shower and tap water; whole house sedimentary water filtration; a six-stage reverse osmosis drinking water filtration.

Full steam ahead? Simla's 'engine room'

Oh and fret not everything is labelled for any new less-engaged owner to take on all pipes and valves identified and clarified with easy-peasy filter change instructions — an historic house with hidden modern parts indeed.

Luke has his own professional-standard workshop in a former back room of this home where he does carpentry and metalwork and just about every other task to a perfectionist level. His handiwork includes making sleek fine-finished steel-framed glazed double doors for the kitchen to match the immaculately restored Crittall-style steel windows in the kitchen’s gable wall.

Man shed envy?

Qualification here: in case other Irish homeowners (or their partners) are feeling a bit inadequate right now Luke’s career trajectory saw him start in DIY at age 12 train as a carpenter cabinet and joinery maker work in auto repairs and commercial roofing before going into property development and restoration in San Francisco.

Detached Simla is part of Glenbrook's rich collection of late Georgian and Victorian homes

Oh and then he did a Masters in Architecture in University of Virginia under its dean William McDonough the global guru of sustainable design. Entirely coincidentally McDonough also featured online here this week with an early 1970s example of an eco-aware house at Shanagarry.

Back to black: kitchen is from IKEA dressed up..

When starting out on their Glenbrook Cork harbour home renovations at Simla a steady and painstaking three-year programme done with quiet pride as it turns out Lorna and Luke outlined the few spatial changes they’d make taking down perhaps a bit of a wall to integrate a dead space into a bedroom or making a new access to the kitchen so that it was no longer hidden away behind a back stairs in 19th-century style.

Hand-crafted new steel doors at a new openng in the hall into the brand-new kitchen

So the improved room flow upstairs has changed a tad as has the kitchen access below but the vast bulk of the house is as-was such as the twin ground floor reception rooms each with original now-restored sliding sash windows and matching facing white marble chimney-pieces.

Large sliding pocket doors connect/divide rooms as needs and uses suggest and Luke made a wall of book shelving painted a beautiful light shade of blue which also frames the door to the hall (all original door locks have been rebuilt).

Other rooms at ground level include a back hall study/breakfast room and workshop/multi-use room while behind outdoors is a private courtyard garden with lofted old stone garage/boathouse. This is about the only part of the impressive period property still with unrealised potential: guest suite/Airbnb anyone?

Get Sirius: float your own boat(house) from Cork harbour home Simla

Back inside the robustly healthy Simla the first floor’s slight reconfiguration now sees four bedrooms instead of the previous five with two superb quality period-appropriate bathrooms cleverly reworked.

Sinks for example sit on repurposed examples of old crafted antique hardwood furniture such as sideboards with polyurethane/lacquer finishes making them impervious to water splashes.

Sink or swim?

A really clever insertion is a large wetroom section now home to a rainfall shower head above an immaculate re-enamelled roll-top cast iron bath.

This whole section is tanked and tiled in dark green tiles with an almost theatrical set of waterproof curtains to contain splashes: everything has been diligently thought through and then aesthetically delivered upon with tactile finishes fabrics framed art and heated mirrors facing it.

Side/main entrance with lofted stone shed visible behind

Gable and double fronted Simla has its access point to the side with an original entrance porch with old encaustic floor tiles while its twin reception rooms run off the hall to the left for east-facing views over the harbour waters room after room.

The views are towards Carrigaloe so there’s always something to see — the road to Cobh the commuter rail line to and fro fringing Great Island and shipping and pleasure craft traffic on the tidal stretch between Monkstown and Lough Mahon with the city further upriver and the Atlantic a few miles away past the harbour mouth.

The regular back-and-forth of the Cross River ferry is witnessed day-in day-out from the heart of this Glenbrook home and especially from the steel kitchen windows and the family can time their arrival at the ferry when they want to go to Cobh to the second at this stage with marine almost metronomic precision.

Gable window in steel with secure access beyond to the courtyard

Kitchen window is early C20th steel Crittall-style with brass handles all also conserved and gleaming

There’s been a precision too in the quality of work the couple have done here at Simla. Teenage son Oscar’s input too is pointed out: he’s been working in Luke’s workshop/man caves from an early age too and gets credit for much of the external painting with only the front left unpainted as the couple loved the render’s patina of age and quality is abundantly evident in the joinery cabinet-making and metal work.

Insulation has gone in under floor and former damp issues have been addressed with attention to drainage and levels and the villa’s roof with its six lead valleys got the once-over for safety’s sake but thankfully most of the roof had been in excellent order in any case.

Herded on the grapevine

The side entrance/old porch has a slate roof now in place of the glass that had been there and this side access courtyard is also home to a reskinned lean-to glasshouse home to a productive vine with currently ripening grapes: the girth of the vine is such as to suggest that it dates back to early Roberts’ family times here decades ago if not almost the full century. The grounds too have plants which go back decades rooting the home to the spot and the generations of tending occupants.

High and dry: clothes airer by the Aga

The original twin-oven Aga in the kitchen has been refurbished looking right at home with more contemporary black units (from IKEAlooking completely high-end with now-matching handles black tiles and black metro tiling): it works sitting at ease with the upgraded surfaces plumbing and electrics. The vast bulk of the work was done by themselves: Luke made it a full-time project so perhaps 60 hours a week went into it finishing only in recent weeks with a move to Sligo now beckoning.

Well-connected

It’s exemplified by the superb work done on the rebuilt conserved and rattle-free window sashes (with original glass slumps and bumps in places) and underfloor insulation with door saddles looking as if they’ve never budged but in fact made from old oak and teak leftovers from other works in this home: sustainability again.

When they needed specialist certified work done Lorna and Luke were lucky to find the likes of plumber John Horgan and electrician Karl Herron both happy to come and go with the flow of work as it progressed done piecemeal sort of room to room bit by bit.

(For family peace during a time of upheaval son Oscar’s bedrooms was the first to be tackled and finished: his folks made their own temporary bedroom up in one of the bathrooms whilst doing their own!)

Revealing too perhaps just how consuming the project was for them Luke was in a local dentist’s surgery a few years back when he admired the work done there by the electrician making contact with Karl Herron as a result. Spotting electrical conduit work while in the dentist’s? That’s either avoidance or obsession.

Knowing the drill as it were the selling agents now for the c 2500 sq ft Simla are Jackie Cohalan and Malcolm Tyrrell of Cohalan Downing guiding at €600000 (it last sold for €425k in 2018 according to the Price Register).

The agents completely appreciate the property period villa’s transformation as they also sold it back in 2018 when it was still lovely but admittedly needed a deal of work by then.

Jackie Cohalan says all those who looked at it back then were prepared to spend a considerable sum on Simla but notes “you could sort of predict how it would be done and who’d do the work and the windows and the kitchen and all that.”

Tassel-free?

But what they didn’t expect would be that it would be a one-man one-woman one family delivery to such a high and respectful level painstaking precise and quite simply serene and beautiful.

Droga5 was acquired by Accenture in 2019 in what was one of the highest profile ad industry acquisitions at that time. It sparked a wave of industry speculation on the future of the famed ad shop as it prepared to mesh its culture with that of a management consultancy.

Founder Droga took on the role of creative chairman in what was seen as an attempt to preserve the creative spark of the agency.

He worked directly with Whipple on the integration – a familiar process for the latter who had at the time overseen no less than 30 acquisitions to create a so-called ‘culture of cultures’ including bringing fellow ad shops Karmarama and The Monkeys into the Interactive division.

In his new global role Droga will “drive creative excellence customer experience and business innovation” said the company.

“Accenture Interactive has rapidly become the leading digital powerhouse at the intersection of data creativity and technology” said Droga on the promotion.

“As the world seeks to build back better Interactive will continue to play a critical role in creating 360° value for our clients. I look forward to putting further emphasis on our creative excellence coupling it with our world-class ingenuity and proven expertise in interactive and experiences.”

In tandem with Droga’s appointment Accenture said Whipple would retire. Under his leadership Accenture Interactive grew to $10.6bn in revenue last year.

“At a time when our clients are led by purpose brand and the transformation of experience David’s global perspective and unmatched creative track record allows us to help clients unlock business and human outcomes in unprecedented ways” said Julie Sweet chief executive of Accenture.

“I would like to thank and recognize Brian Whipple for his foundational role in building Accenture Interactive’s strong business driving its rapid growth and for pioneering a disruptive business model that will continue redefining the industry” she added."

With the latest update to Photoshop Adobe offers you 55 free skies to download. Here's how to get them.

Whether you're a fan of the ever-increasing presence of AI in photography or not the reality is that it's here to stay and will only get bigger and more feature-laden as we move into the future. When AI first started becoming more ubiquitous in Photoshop and other software platforms I was both skeptical and hesitant mostly because I felt somehow cheated after spending years and years perfecting certain editing techniques. But the dam has burst and now I just shrug my shoulders and embrace everything. As the old saying goes 'if you can't beat 'em join 'em"".

In its most recent August update Adobe Photoshop has added 55 new skies to its sky replacement feature. They are grouped into five categories including but not limited to Sunsets Storms and Spectacular. However if you go into Photoshop and try to access them you won't see these new editions automatically even if you've updated to the latest version. In this helpful video by The Photoshop Training Channel Jesus Ramirez runs you through exactly what you need to do in order to get your creative hands on all these new skies.

So much so that “to photoshop something” means any form of image editing. Working in Photoshop especially if you are a beginner requires English language proficiency. Every tool and option is in English by default and there are many of these.

Luckily and as you might have presumed it’s now possible to change the language in Photoshop.

Why Change the Language?

Changing the language in a photo editing software tool seems fairly trivial. You mostly deal in images and you are probably familiar with the English language to the extent of knowing the tool names right? Not if you put yourself in the shoes of Adobe. They want as many people to use their software as possible. For instance a native speaker is a lot more likely to pick Photoshop over a local editing tool if there’s a Photoshop language option for it don’t you think?

On the flipside someone may be an English speaker who bought a foreign version of Photoshop and want to switch to English.

All in all there are many reasons why a user would want to know how to change the language in Photoshop. Unfortunately this isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. For some reason the language settings in Photoshop are much more complicated than you’d think.

The Hitches

You can change Photoshop language by installing different language packs available on the official Adobe website. The process isn’t overly complicated. However if you bought the program from a source other than Adobe’s website you won’t be able to switch language. Of course you can always purchase another copy of Photoshop officially but that’s assuming that you’re filthy rich.

Fortunately for our second scenario there is a workaround here that will help you change the menus from a foreign language to English. But let’s deal with language pack installation first.

Installing and Setting Language Preferences Using the Cloud Creative Desktop App

If you have and use you Adobe Cloud Creative account then this option is the best and easiest solution for you.

To start open up your Cloud Creative desktop app. Now click on the Account icon in the top-right corner and select Preferences. Then click on Apps. Next click on the Default install language drop-down men and select your desired language. Select Done when you’re finished. You’ll now need to uninstall and reinstall Photoshop for the changes to take effect all this option does is set the language you selected to default to that on installation.

Installing a New Language Pack

First of all you can stop looking for language pack downloading options in Photoshop’s menu. You won’t find this option there.

Close Photoshop and find the latest version of Adobe Application Manager on Google. Download and install it. Once installed start Adobe Application Manager where you’ll be prompted to sign in. Use your Adobe ID (the one used for purchasing your copy of Photoshop) and enter all the required credentials. Next go to the Apps tab. Here you’ll be able to see a list of purchases that you’ve made. If you’ve ordered your Photoshop from the Adobe website it should be on the list next to Installed . If there is nothing on the list restart Adobe Application Manager. If you still can’t see your Photoshop version on the list then you must’ve bought it from an alternate source and won’t be able to install the language pack. Now navigate to the gear icon and open the Preferences window by clicking on Settings . Then select the Apps tab click on App Language  and find your preferred language on the list. Once you’re done you can close this window and you should see an Install option next to your purchased Photoshop version. Again restart Adobe Application Manager if you don’t see this. Click Install to download and install the new language pack. Next launch the Photoshop app which will be in the default language still. Go to Edit  then Preferences  and access the appearance settings. Now change the UI Language to the one from the downloaded language pack and hit OK  and that’s it! You’ve changed your Photoshop language.

Changing the Menu Language to English

The only possible operation for those who didn’t buy their Photoshop on Adobe’s official website is changing the menus to English.

To do this close Photoshop and go to C:\Program\Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop\CS5Locales. If you’ve installed the app in another path locate and navigate there. Find the installed language subdirectory (it_IT format) and select Support Files. Find the tw10428.dat file and rename it to tw10428.dat.bak. This should change the Photoshop menu language to English.

Changing Language in Photoshop

Changing Photoshop language is a lot less straightforward than you might think unless you purchased your copy from the official Adobe website. If you bought it from anywhere else even if it’s completely legitimately you won’t be able to change the language except in the menu.

Have you ever experienced any issues with changing the language in Photoshop? Do you know of another way to do it in all Photoshop versions regardless if they’re downloaded from the official website?

There are no more updates for it nor is the flash player available for download anymore. One can’t even run it on a browser as support for it has been discontinued entirely.

That said there are some workaround and backdoor ways by which you can still use the flash player on your favorite browser. Here’s everything you need to know about raising Adobe’s flash player from the grave or at least using an alternative to access flash content.

Why don’t browsers support Adobe flash anymore?

Support for Adobe’s flash player ended on new year’s eve and twelve days later Adobe began actively blocking the Flash player from running on browsers. In fact Adobe recommends that users uninstall Flash Player from their devices at the earliest for security purposes.

The Adobe Flash player was riddled with security issues right till the very end — one of the many reasons why the browsers of the world have ditched it in favor of HTML 5. Even if you have an old version of the Flash player as soon as it gets updated a built-in kill switch will render the player useless.

Fortunately reverting back to old versions of the browser and making slight adjustments can bypass this killswitch. On top of that there are also a few third-party browser extensions that you can use to enable Flash. Let’s take a look at all these ways and see how you can start using Adobe flash again.

How to unblock Adobe Flash Player on Chrome

There are a couple of ways of accessing flash content on Chrome still. Let’s take a look at them individually.

Method #01: Using Ruffle Chrome Extension

On Chrome you can use the Ruffle browser extension straight from the Chrome store (yes there’s official support for it now). Here’s how to go about it:

Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for ‘ruffle’. Click on the first result.

Then on the next page click on Add to Chrome towards the top right.

Click on Add extension when prompted.

Once Ruffle is added to Chrome you’ll get a message confirming the same.

And that’s it! You can start using flash on Chrome again. Though not an Adobe service per se the Ruffle extension still gets the job done and is a simpler alternative to access flash content.

Related: How to Install Fonts on Windows 11

If using the Ruffle extension doesn’t float your boat and you really only want the Adobe flash player you can still get it but the process is rather longwinded and cumbersome for beginners. But the steps given below will ensure you’re able to unblock Adobe flash player if you follow it to the T.

Note: This process will require you to uninstall your current Chrome version and use an older version that supports Flash. So move on with this only if you don’t mind getting downgraded a little.

The first thing that you need to do is to download an older version of Chrome.

Download: Chrome old versions

Here look within your respective computer architecture — 32-bit or 64-bit — and select version 79.0.3945.88.

Next up download the Adobe Flash player (preferably 32.0.0.101 or earlier) that doesn’t have an in-built killswitch enabled. You can make use of the following link to do the same.

Download: Adobe Flash

Now that we have downloaded all the required files close Chrome and uninstall it. To uninstall press Win + I to open Settings then click on Apps in the left panel.

Then choose Apps & Features

Now scroll down and find Chrome then click on the vertical ellipsis to its right.

Select Uninstall.

Select Uninstall again.

When prompted click on Uninstall.

Now turn off your internet by clicking on the action center (to the right of the taskbar)…

… and clicking on the Wi-Fi icon to disable the connection.

You can also simply press the Airplane Mode button on your keyboard if you have it. Now go to the folder where you previously downloaded the old version of Chrome right-click on the setup file and choose Run as administrator.

Because the internet is turned off you may see a window pop-up telling you that SmartScreen can’t be reached. Ignore this and click on Run.

The older version of Chrome will install.

But before we turn the internet back on let’s make sure that the newly installed Chrome can’t update itself. For this go to the following folder address:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Update

In this folder you will see a GoogleUpdate.exe file. Right-click on it and select the ‘Rename’ option.

Then rename it to something else. In our example we’re simply adding a ‘1’ to it. It doesn’t really matter what your rename it to as long as it’s not ‘GoogleUpdate’.

You can safely turn your internet back on (the same way you turned it off) without worrying about Chrome updating automatically and ruining all the progress thus far.

Now extract the contents of the previously downloaded Adobe Flash zip file with an archive tool such as WinRAR or 7-zip. The extracted files will include executable for the Flash Player for Chrome and Firefox and an uninstaller.

First make sure that there are no remnants of an existing Adobe Flash Player on your system and run the uninstaller as administrator.

Click on Uninstall.

Once the uninstallation is complete right-click on the Adobe Flash installer for Google Chrome and select Run as administrator.

The installation window will appear. Accept the terms and conditions and click Install.

Then – and this is the important bit – select Never check for updates and then click on Done.

Once the installation finishes open a flash site such as Miniclip. If you see a jigsaw puzzle with a red cross to the right of the address bar (image below) this means that the method has worked and Adobe flash is indeed supported on this Chrome version. You only need a little tweak to make sure the flash player is unblocked. Click on this jigsaw puzzle.

Select Manage.

Here you will see an option that says Block sites from running Flash. Once you toggle it on it will turn to Ask first.

Refresh the flash page and flash will be enabled. To allow flash to run without it asking you every time click on the padlock towards the extreme left of the address bar.

Next to ‘Flash’ click on the drop-down menu.

Select Allow.

Then click on Reload for the changes to take effect.

When prompted click on Run this time. Do not click on ‘Update plugin’.

And there you have it! Adobe flash player is fully unblocked on Chrome.

For this we need to use the Ruffle extension as an alternative.

Microsoft Edge like other browsers doesn’t officially support Adobe flash player anymore. There’s really no getting around that fact. But that has left opportunity enough for other parties to fill in the gap.

Take for example Ruffle a flash player emulator that will help you run flash content on Microsoft Edge. Though still in development which is also why you won’t find official support for it just yet you can easily download the Ruffle extension for Microsoft Edge and then add it as an extension manually. Here’s how to go about it:

Download: Ruffle browser extension

Follow the aforementioned link and download the latest Ruffle browser extension for Edge.

Once downloaded right-click on the .zip file and select Extract all.

It doesn’t matter where you extract as long as you know where you’re extracting. Then click Extract.

Alternatively you can use an archiving tool like WinRAR or 7-zip to achieve the same. Now open Microsoft Edge and type the following in the address bar:

edge://extensions

Press Enter. This will open up Microsoft Edge’s extensions page. Go full screen to make sure that you can see the extension options on the left. Alternatively click on the hamburger icon towards the top left of the page.

Towards the bottom left turn on Developer mode.

Now click on Load unpacked.

Browse for the extracted folder and click on Select Folder.

Microsoft Edge will now install the Ruffle extension and enable it automatically.

You will now be able to run flash content on Microsoft Edge.

How to unblock Adobe Flash Player on Firefox

On Firefox as well there are a couple of ways of accessing flash content. Here they are:

Method #01: Using Ruffle browser extension

Again you can turn to a flash player alternative like Ruffle to access flash content. However just like Microsoft Edge it isn’t officially available as a Firefox Add-On. You will have to download it from the following link:

Download: Ruffle browser extension

On the Ruffle website make sure to select Firefox when downloading.

Now open Firefox and type the following in the address bar:

about:debugging

Press Enter. Then select This Firefox in the left panel.

Click on Load Temporary Add-on…

Locate and select the ruffle file downloaded before and click Open.

Once the extension is loaded you will see it in the Firefox extensions list.

You can now open flash content on Firefox.

Method #02: Using portable Firefox

For those looking for nothing but the Adobe Flash player there is a portable version of Firefox created by Reddit user u/Cifra85 (link below) that already contains an older Adobe flash player and comes without a kill switch or any update checker. So for all intents and purposes you can use this portable version of Firefox indefinitely.

Download: Firefox portable with Adobe flash player

After downloading right-click the .zip file and select Extract all.

Click on Extract.

Once extracted double-click on the FirefoxPortable.exe file.

The first page that you see will be a flash test. By default the flash plugin won’t be enabled. To rectify that click on the plugin icon next to the padlock towards the left of the address bar.

Select Allow.

Adobe flash player is unblocked when you see the animation appear on the page.

You can use this portable version along with the latest official Firefox version without uninstalling the latter.

Getting around Flash player EOL

There’s been much debate on Adobe’s community forums and elsewhere concerning the Flash player’s End-of-Life and how to go about bypassing the kill switch built into Adobe flash player at least on the later versions.

Adobe has been actively time-bombing any flash player that has its updates on. Since its EOL many of the older versions of the flash player are made unavailable from Adobe’s website while web pages that host older versions of flash are made inaccessible. So the methods that worked soon after Flash player’s EOL announcement was made do not work anymore.

Fortunately the denizens of the web haven’t given up on the flash player yet and the methods mentioned in this guide are surefire ways (at least at the time of writing) of accessing flash content.

FAQs

Unblocking Adobe flash player isn’t a straightforward task and there are bound to be a few queries about it. Here we look to answer a few of the most common ones.

Can I still use Flash after EOL?

Officially no. Adobe has ensured that support for its flash player is withdrawn from all platforms. The only two ways by which you can access flash content are as mentioned in the guide above using an older portable version of a browser or installing a browser extension for flash such as Ruffle.

Is there a current browser that still supports Adobe Flash player?

Sadly no. There aren’t any mainstream browsers that support Adobe Flash player and most of them have already transitioned to HTML5. You will invariably have to use an extension or an older version of a browser (with flash and browser updates turned off).

If you’re using an older Adobe flash player it would be wise to never update the Adobe flash player as long as you want to continue using it. As soon as it gets updated the killswitch will be introduced and the player will be blocked again.

We hope you were able to use the flash player on Windows 11 again. Though the general advice is against using a flash player or playing flash content because of the security issues inherent in them if you desperately need to do so the methods mentioned in the guide above should serve you well.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjY0NDA5LzIwMjEwODIxL2FtZHMtcmRuYS00LXJ4LTgwMDAtc2VyaWVzLW1hZGUtM25tLTVubS1ub2Rlcy5odG3SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNjQ0MDkvMjAyMTA4MjEvYW1kcy1yZG5hLTQtcngtODAwMC1zZXJpZXMtbWFkZS0zbm0tNW5tLW5vZGVzLmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD's RDNA 4 'RX 8000' Series Could Be Made on 3nm 5nm Nodes,"AMD hasn't even released RDNA 3 yet but there are already rumors about RDNA 4 it seems.

A prominent industry leaker named Greymon55 on Twitter said that the next-gen RDNA 4 graphics cards from AMD would also be made on two different process nodes reports WCCFTech. These would be the 3nm and 5nm nodes respectively.

Here is the tweet:

Next I bet 5nm refresh lmao. 😈 — rdkmy3002 (@rdkmy3002) August 17 2021

This could mean that AMD will be building RDNA 4 almost similar to RDNA 3 which is made using MCMs (multi-chip modules) and two different process nodes. Furthermore the RDNA 4 rumors also alleged that it will power the upcoming Navi 4X series which has the flagship Navi 41 chip.

It could also mean that while Team Red still wants to milk their RDNA architecture for all its worth they're not doing any refreshes of older ones such as RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. The 3nm node is expected to be used for the GCD (graphics core die) while the 5nm node is going to be for the MCD (multi-cache die). A planned launch is set sometime in 2024 though there's no confirmation yet.

This release window means that AMD's RDNA 4 will be going up against the successor to the Lovelace GPUs from NVIDIA and the ARC Battle Mage or Celestial chips from Intel.

This is still an obviously long wait for now so fans can look forward to the impending launch of RDNA 3 which Forbes reports would be released by AMD alongside Zen 4 CPUs in late 2022.

AMD RDNA 4: What To Expect?

AMD is close to ending the current-gen RX 6000 series with the recent release of the Radeon RX 6600 XT which did deliver on its performance promise despite its iffy price-performance balance. Team Red might even launch a lower-end card (an RX 6500 XT perhaps like the 5500 XT?) but as for now there's not even a shadow of the GPU so don't get your hopes up. This sets things up now for both RDNA 3 and RDNA 4.

The purported launch window for RDNA 4 is still four long years away so it's impossible to make accurate predictions. But maybe fans could take some clues from the upcoming Radeon chips based on RDNA 3.

MCMs are the main selling proposition of these chips according to the most recent bits of information about them. According to WCCFTech MCMs are designed to bump up the cores (and by extension the real-world performance) of the RX 7000 graphics cards to a massive 15360 total cores in the flagship part: the next-gen RX 7900 XT.

There is already an insane performance jump from RX 6000 to RX 7000 simply because of AMD's new architecture so it could be safe to assume that the jump to RX 8000 would be way more insane.

A total of five different tiers will classify the new RDNA 4 Radeon cards with the flagship part being the Navi 41 chip high-end being the Navi 42 mid-tier would be Navi 43 and the entry-level would be Navi 44.

In Hot Chips 33 presentation AMD outlines the future of 3D stacking technology also sharing first details on its 3D V-Cache stacking.

AMD presentation showcases existing and future 3D stacking technologies. As the TSV (Through Silicon Via) a vertical inter-wafer or inter-die connection sees an increase in bonds the technology will be focusing on more complex 3D stacking designs. At this point in time stacking allows full die-to-die stacking allowing DRAM on CPUs or CPUs on CPUs. The technology is progressing towards putting separate modules on themselves such as cores on cores only to allow macroblocks to be stacked.

Eventually the TSV pitch will be so dense that module splitting folding or even circuit splitting will be possible which will completely revamp the future of processors as we know them today. AMD listed all existing stacking technologies including Intel’s Foveros/EMIB techniques implying that AMD considered using this technology for their processors:

AMD had opted for a micro bump pitch of 9 microns which is a bit denser than future Intel Foveros Direct technology at 10 microns.

AMD expects its 3D Chiplet technology to offer 3x higher interconnect energy efficiency and 15x higher interconnect density.

The manufacturer had already announced its plans for 3D chipsets based on AMD Zen3 CPU featuring silicon to silicon TSV. The technology will increase the Level3 cache by 64MB. AMD already demonstrated the potential of its 3D V-Cache technology on AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU with 32+64MB L3 cache. Such a configuration increases the framerate by 15% AMD revealed.

Back at Computex 2021 where the technology was first shown AMD announced that Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache are to be mass-produced by the end of this year.

This weekend Ari in her great and wonderful wisdom shared a photo dump on IG and it included a few very rare very intimate glimpses of her home life with Dalton. Nothing keeps a straight-up photo dump mysterious and strangely low-key like posting it sans caption which is probably why that’s exactly what Ariana did.

When the top comment on your post comes courtesy of Nicki Minaj you know you’re doing something right in life (full disclosure: by this metric I have never done anything right in life…which feels pretty accurate all in all).

Nicki dropped into the post’s comments to write “Sissy what u cookin? Send me 🤭”—a reference to the first post in the series which features a very old-timey Polaroid-vibed picture of Ariana chopping onions in the kitchen with her mom Joan (and we imagine belting out notes most of us can’t even imagine let alone create with our mouths…throats?…diaphragms? Clearly I’m classically trained in music. It shows right?).

Other pictures in the series included shots of Ariana and Dalton’s pets snaps with friends and yes even some K-I-S-S-I-N-G pictures for us to collectively fawn over (along with Dove Cameron who commented the following long string of spot-on emojis: “🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺”).

Ariana and Dalton (who works as a real estate agent) tied the knot in May in a very small private ceremony at their home in Montecito California (if it sounds familiar it’s probably because it’s the same swank Santa Barbara–area neighborhood that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle call home).

“They got married” the singer’s rep confirmed to People at the time. “It was tiny and intimate—less than 20 people. The room was so happy and full of love. The couple and both families couldn’t be happier.”

And we couldn’t be happier to feast our eyes on the couple’s love. *COUGH COUGH* *HINT HINT* *WINK WINK* *ETC.*

His preferred strategy – of going in and cleaning up the mess – has built his firm into a $17 billion-plus asset management behemoth with both hands in the US and international equity and credit securities markets.

In the current environment as we’re getting buffeted about by epoch-making public health crises economic disruptions and now foreign policy political disasters Loeb sees a combination of risk and volatility as the key factors.

“In Q2 market volatility increased materially with wild swings in sentiment and factors which we expect to continue throughout Q3. The backdrop for risk assets remains constructive – financial conditions are loose fund flows are healthy savings rates are high and policy is broadly supportive” Loeb wrote.

Loeb added “While valuation always matters our analysis is more focused today on business quality differentiation innovation disruption and market structure. This contrasts with our previous focus as an event-driven fund on using ‘events’ (spinoffs recaps mergers etc.) as opportunities to find ‘cheap’ stocks.”

It’s an interesting background to keep in mind as we look at two of Loeb’s recent stock buys. According to the TipRanks database these are Strong Buy choices with unanimous approval from the Wall Street analyst corps. Let’s find out what else makes them so compelling.

Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH)

We’ll start in the medical industry where Zimmer Biomet first established in 1927 is a med tech provider with a portfolio of digital and robotic technologies used in diagnostics joint replacements data gathering and analytics and more. The company has rebounded quickly from the COVID-low of 2Q20 based on revenues and earnings.

In the most recent quarterly report for 2Q21 the company showed $2.03 billion at the top line well above the $1.86 billion average of the last 8 quarters. Revenue in Q2 was up 12.9% sequentially and 69% year-over-year. EPS which came in at 67 cents was down 28% sequentially – but was up dramatically from the $1 per-share loss reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenue and EPS both came in above the analyst consensus for the quarter.

Loeb was clearly impressed by Zimmer as his firm took a new position in the stock – to the tune of 800000 shares. This holding is worth over $116.36 million in current levels – hardly chump change even for a $17 billion hedge.

Wall Street’s analysts have also been showing the stock some love. Among the bulls is Needham analyst Mike Matson who rates ZBH a Strong Buy along with a $202 price target. The analyst therefore expects the stock to climb ~40% over the coming months. (To watch Matson’s track record click here)

“We believe that ZBH had been gaining recon share in recent quarters so at this point we attribute the weaker 2Q21 results to market turbulence and variability by geography and product subcategory as opposed to a change in competitive dynamics. Management continues to believe the procedure volume backlog remains large but now expects this to take longer to work through. We still believe that ZBH can reach and sustain mid-single digit revenue growth and drive increased margin improvement” Matson wrote.

Matson’s view on ZBH is hardly an outlier as the stock has no fewer than 13 positive reviews set in recent weeks – for a Strong Buy analyst consensus. The shares have an average price target of $192.69 and trading price of $145.46 suggesting an upside of ~32% for the next 12 months. (See ZBH stock analysis on TipRanks)

AES Corporation (AES)

The second Loeb pick we’ll look at here is AES a major generator and distributor of electrical power. This company based in Arlington Virginia has a world-wide footprint with power generation facilities and distribution in 15 countries. Electricity is a vital commodity and even with the pandemic-induced recession last year the company saw $9.66 billion in total revenues. Along with solid revenues the company’s stock is up 38% in the last 12 months.

AES reported earnings in-line with estimates for 2Q21 at 4 cents per share. While low this was up from the 22-cent per share net loss reported in Q1 and the 13-cent per share loss reported in the year-ago quarter. At the top line revenue was reported at $2.7 billion for a 21% yoy gain and beating the estimates by over 11%.

Looking ahead to coming quarter AES reported that it has retired 1.1 GW of coal-powered generation in Chile and has contracted to replace that power with 2.3 GW was renewable energy. In addition the company has signed 1.8 GW worth of new power purchase agreements. This puts the 2021 total of PPAs at 2.9 GW year-to-date. The company’s PPA backlog now stands at 8.5 GW. Finally AES has received regulatory approval at its Ohio and Indiana utilities a step that will allow progress on planned new investments worth over $2 billion – and will grow the company’s rate base by 9% annually into 2025.

AES pays out a dividend to shareholders and while the yield is modest at just 2.4% the payment is reliable – and has a 9-year history of regular dividend increases.

And now we get to the interesting point: During the second-quarter Loeb’s Third Point saw fit to boost its holding in the stock by 49%. The fund bought 900000 shares of AES worth $21888000 at current prices. The purchase brings Third Point’s stake in the company to 2750000 shares valued over $66 million.

Wall Street is also upbeat about AES prospects. Evercore’s 5-star analyst Durgesh Chopra reiterates his decision to make AES a ‘premier pick’ writing: “We view AES as a leading renewable energy provider offering a unique battery storage solution in Fluence. Despite these elite attributes and industry high 7-9% EPS growth the stock as of todays close is trading at ~13x 23 earnings at a material discount to US utility peers at ~18x and domestic/international renewable peers at ~25x. We continue to view the risk/reward as very attractive and see bull/bear valuation of $38/$23 respectively. AES remains our top diversified pick.”

In line with these bullish comments Chopra rates AES an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $30 price target indicates room for a 23% upside in the coming months. (To watch Chopra’s track record click here)

Overall it’s clear that Wall Street agrees with this bullish outlook. This stock has 6 positive reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $24.32 and their $30.33 average price target implies ~25% upside from that level. (See AES stock analysis on TipRanks)

People who visit the Santa Rosa park on a regular basis to watch and feed the waterfowl learned Friday that two large white geese they’ve come to love were gone.

The geese whom volunteer caretaker Ray Lutman said were an American Heritage breed had died or been killed. Some people who were acquainted with the longtime park occupants cried when they learned of their demise he said.

“People have been asking ‘Where’s Aflac where’s Aflac?’” he said referring to the name given one of the birds.

The cause of their deaths is not known.

Lutman blames an unleashed dog or dogs for their deaths after seeing paw prints by the lake but he admitted “it’s all speculation.”

The volunteer who works as a newspaper carrier for The Press Democrat said he realized the two geese — the other was named Gunther — were missing after he arrived at the city park Thursday. He drives there regularly twice a day to give the geese and other birds at Lake Ralphine a special mix of pellets sunflower seeds corn and oats that he buys at Western Farm Center in Santa Rosa.

“Those birds were so famous” Lutman lamented. “People came from all over to see them. They were special. They weren’t just birds on a lake they were family.”

Lutman searched and found Aflac’s carcass tossed up a hill at the park. On Friday evening Gunther’s body was still floating in the water as Lutman waited for someone to bring a boat to pull the bird out “and give him some respect” he said.

No one from the Santa Rosa Department of Recreation and Parks could be reached for comment Saturday.

A group of 15-20 people coming and going held a little memorial service with pizza on Friday he said. They mourned together some crying and remembered the good times with the geese. Some told stories. They discussed naming the boat dock “Aflac Pier.”

“I’ve been coming here for about two years and tonight it just feels very cold without Aflac and Gunther” said Sharon Silva a friend of Lutman’s and part of the group that has found peace at the park feeding birds. “I’m going to miss them and I know a lot of other people will too. I know the kids come on weekends and feed them.”

These two were not just any geese Lutman said especially Aflac. “Aflac had paparazzi. He was all over Facebook. People from Switzerland came here and said their friends told them ‘You gotta go to California and see Aflac.’”

Gunther was the quieter one of the two and Aflac could sometimes be aggressive. In addition the big goose had “a shoe fetish” Lutman said. “Especially pink ones. But I had calmed him down.”

Lutman said he didn’t know exactly how old the geese were but said Gunther was older than Aflac who he said was at least 5. Neither of them could fly he said.

“I’ve rescued them many times” he said. “Sometimes they get fishhooks in their mouths.“

There are of course other geese at the park. There is Mr. Gray a gray goose of English descent Lutman said (“He hasn’t been knighted so I call him Mr. Gray”) and another with a wide wingspan named Abigail Silva said.

“Geese have their own personalities” she said. “They get to know people and they follow you around. They’re quite entertaining.”

As the family drove toward the lakefront city in B.C.'s Interior they were met by what Quinlan describes as a wall of smoke in the Osoyoos area prompting concerns about the health of their young children both under the age of four.

The Nk'Mip Creek fire burning about 40 kilometres south of Penticton was growing fast and the B.C. government was being pressured to declare a provincial state of emergency.

Fearing the smoke's impact on the health of their children the Nelson B.C. parents cancelled their reservation one day before they were supposed to check in.

Quinlan received a refund from Airbnb of only about one-third what he'd paid for three nights accommodation in Penticton.

""It made us feel that Airbnb cares more about profits than it does about their clients' health. We were shocked and surprised frustrated of course"" said Quinlan.

Vacation hopefuls like Quinlan who shifted home rental plans due to wildfire hazards in British Columbia are voicing frustrations about the lack of complete refunds with the home rental company. However Airbnb says a policy is in place for penalty-free cancellations.

The Extenuating Circumstances Policy  which accounts for unforeseen events after booking was activated for wildfire-affected areas in B.C. for bookings made before July 23 and check-ins between July 23 and August 21 Airbnb said in an email.

When CBC News asked why the Quinlan family did not qualify for a refund Airbnb said ""Unfortunately the reservation ... had a check-in date of July 20 and the policy activation began on July 23.""

Airbnb defines affected areas as ""where fires are burning as well as the immediate surrounding areas along with anywhere else where mandatory evacuation orders are in place.""

The policy further states that guests can receive depending on the circumstances ""a cash refund travel credit and/or other consideration.""

The partial refund the Quinlan family got was part of the standard cancellation policy for the property they had booked rather than because of specific concerns over wildfires with the Extenuating Circumstances Policy. Airbnb hosts can choose which cancellation options to offer guests.

Considering the area was blanketed in thick smoke and a massive fire was burning 40 kilometres from Penticton Quinlan said not qualifying for the policy felt like a betrayal.

""I think in a perfect world everybody would do the right thing and recognize ... the danger of being approximate to wildfires"" he said.

Cleaning fees refunded only

Squamish resident Greg Kelly found himself in a similar situation after booking a trip to Kelowna months in advance of the August long weekend for his dad's 60th birthday.

Kelly and his parents travelled to the Interior city planning to go ahead with the vacation but changed their minds upon arrival because the smoke was thick and potentially dangerous.

He cancelled the booking and received a small refund that covered the cleaning fees only.

When CBC News asked why Kelly's reservation didn't qualify for an ""extenuating circumstances"" refund Airbnb said it was because it fell outside the policy's ""activation areas."" The area is determined by fire perimeters and evacuation orders in the area and is updated regularly they said.

Despite frustrations with the financial loss Kelly recognizes he could have found a listing with a different cancellation policy. He does not blame the hosts.

""I knew what I booked. The host is doing their job. They're running a business but you kind of hope that the corporation would have some policy for things like this.""

For reservations that qualify for the Extenuating Circumstances Policy Airbnb says it facilitates the penalty-free cancellation automatically not the hosts. The policy takes precedence over the host's cancellation policy

When the Extenuating Circumstances Policy is applied ""the host does not keep the money it is refunded to the guest"" Airbnb wrote to CBC News.

For hosts like Cathy Finley cancellations can create a loss on a significant source of income however she says compassion is important.

""Hosts always set their own parameters for refunds. And we do that to protect ourselves. And I think that's a great thing to do. I do think the circumstances in B.C. ... allow us to be more creative and more understanding"" said Finley.

Finley fully reimbursed her guests when they couldn't make it to her cabin in Creston B.C. due to wildfire hazards on the way.

She says the circumstances require understanding both ways.

""I would ask that guests who are cancelling are reasonable with the host they have to understand that Airbnb is taking a cut'' she said. ""Just bringing back a little bit of common decency would go a long way.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9zbWFydC1saXZpbmcvbG92ZS1pc2xhbmQtaW5zcGlyZWQtYWlyYm5iLTQ4NDcxNzEz0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9wc3VnYXIuY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvc21hcnQtbGl2aW5nL2xvdmUtaXNsYW5kLWluc3BpcmVkLWFpcmJuYi00ODQ3MTcxMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Love Island-Inspired Airbnb Is Like Real-Life Casa Amor,"If you can't make it to Love Island make Love Island come to you! The reality show and all of its couples have become well known for the drama the banter and oh yeah the famous villa (or Casa Amor if you're feeling spicy). The official villa is exclusive to the contestants looking for love but lo and behold there's an Airbnb in Arizona inspired by the series for fans to enjoy.

Scottsdale Beach Club and Royce Vacation Rentals teamed up to create a ""Love Oasis"" in Scottsdale with amenities similar to those you see on TV.

Compton Navigating refunds for cancelled travel plans in the era of the coronavirus has been an ongoing headache since March 2020. Last week one frustrated traveller took to social media to share his recent Airbnb issue unearthing a policy most users are likely to overlook.

In the Reddit discussion group r/travel user u/markvauxhall posted about his experience struggling to get a full refund from a cancelled reservation. Here's the gist: Mark needed to cancel a September 2021 Airbnb booking he made for his family in April. He had chosen a listing that promised a full refund if he cancelled before 4pm on September 13 but when he went to cancel it said he could get a full refund minus a $200 service fee. Because so many other travellers are probably booking and later cancelling reservations because of the pandemic - especially now with the delta surge - we wanted to dig into what happened here.

Mark was familiar with the platform's fees. He his wife and his newborn baby had been travelling back and forth from the UK to the United States to see family. But ever-evolving travel restrictions kept complicating their plans. Their first cancellation a November 2020 booking in southwest Florida yielded only a 50% refund. ""We just swallowed that on the basis of we're trying to travel during a pandemic and these things happen"" Mark who wasn't comfortable sharing his last name told The Washington Post. After learning their lesson the couple made sure their future reservations were more flexible. In the following months they had no problem getting refunds from two other bookings for June and July 2021. When they had to cancel the fourth reservation because of rapid changes with British travel restrictions Mark was confused to see that Airbnb was going to withhold the service fee.

Mark looked back at his original email and saw the confirmation clearly stated he would get a full refund if he cancelled by the 4pm Sept. 13 deadline - no other caveats no mention of service fees (which are set by Airbnb not the host). What he didn't realize was in the fine print. According to the Terms of Service found in Airbnb's Help Center ""if the cancelled reservation overlaps with another of your reservations or if you've already received 3 service fee refunds in the last 12 months [the service fee] won't be refunded."" There is no risk of getting your account banned for cancelling too much or cancelling an overlapping reservation; you will just stop getting the service fee back. Airbnb says these rules have been around well before the pandemic. Normally if a customer had already reached the limit of three cancellations in 12 months that person would see they were ineligible for a service fee refund when browsing for listings. Airbnb customer service told Mark that because he'd cancelled three reservations in nine months he was no longer eligible for the cancellation policy he confirmed back in April. He assumed he just hadn't been aware of or alerted about the change because he had made the reservation before his cancellations.

But Mark said he didn't get three service fee refunds just the two from his June and July bookings. What he had done it turned out was trigger the other part of the service fee policy by cancelling an overlapping reservation. ""Everyone knows that their travel plans are at risk"" Mark said. ""People are trying to protect themselves paying a premium for the better cancellation policy. So it feels like when people are trying to do the right thing ... hidden terms feel unreasonable."" After a 25-minute-long phone call with customer service Mark got the full refund.

We asked Airbnb about Mark's situation and a spokesperson said in a statement: ""While we recognize that this guest was not fully aware of the terms impacting his cancellation we were able to ensure that he received a full refund. We encourage consumers to review the terms of the cancellation policy prior to booking their stay."" The moral of the story: Always read the terms of service. Unless you read the terms or keep track of your cancellations and service fee refunds from the past 12 months you might not know that you aren't getting your service fee refunded until you go to make that fourth cancellation even if the booking was fully refundable. (Also service fees can vary greatly.)

Don't forget the other factors that could impact a refund amount. One is the cleaning fee which Airbnb says customers will always get back if they cancel before check-in. The other is their on-site property fee policy that states: ""If a hotel or other professional Host collects property fees on-site any refund of those fees is at the discretion of the Host."" As of late Airbnb fees have been incurring the wrath of customer complaints on the Internet - not just service fees (which usually cost a customer about 14 percent of the booking subtotal) but occupancy taxes and cleaning fees. After a handful of angry tweets went viral Airbnb has said a team will review the company's fees and make recommendations ""with the objective of making pricing even more transparent and easy for hosts and guests to navigate."" Mark's story is a warning to travellers to read terms of service and book with scrutiny particularly while the coronavirus keeps our day-to-day lives in flux. It's a reminder to double-check your reservation to make sure you're getting what you paid for - or can get what you paid for back.

""My philosophy is that you have to be ready for changes"" Mark said after his experience. ""Whenever you're booking a trip right now the pandemic can throw out a surprise. Your travel plans have to be flexible."" *Please note that policies may differ from country to country.",,,,,,

ALGN,Align Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9iZWF1dHktaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9iZWF1dHktZmVhdHVyZXMvc3VyZ2UtdGVldGgtc3RyYWlnaHRlbmluZy0xMjM0ODk4NDQ2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Behind the Boom in Teeth Alignment,"The Zoom effect is real. When consumers stare back at themselves for hours on end it’s easy to find something to focus in on. Teeth being one of them. More specifically their alignment.

That is driving a boom in the teeth-straightening market — from direct-to-consumer at-home make-your-own-mold iterations to new versions of lingual braces and innovative ways to accelerate Invisalign treatment.

“We have seen a boom in all cosmetic dentistry especially teeth straightening” said cosmetic dentist Dr. Brian Kantor of Lowenberg Lituchy & Kantor. “This is for a few reasons everyone is on Zoom looking at their teeth and people are upset that they have crooked or dark teeth.”

The numbers bear out the anecdotal evidence: the World Health Organization reports malocclusion or crooked teeth is the third most prevalent dental disease after cavities and periodontal disease globally. According to Fortune Business Insights U.S. Clear Aligners market size is said to reach $4.55 billion by 2028.

Search data also reflects the booming trend. “We’re seeing more searches for teeth aligners than neck lift and anti-aging facial combined” said Sarah Barnes Trendalytics content marketing manager.

Invisalign parent company Align Technology pioneered the invisible orthodontics market 24 years ago and new evolutions of that technology are covered by hundreds of patents today. In April Align Technology reported its first-quarter clear aligner revenue was $753.3 million up 7 percent sequentially and an increase of 56.4 percent year-over-year.

Grand View Research reported the teenage segment dominated the clear aligners market and held the largest revenue share of 73 percent in 2020. Teenagers prefer avoiding discomfort caused by metal braces and want something aesthetically appealing.

The growth of clear teeth aligners is also giving rise to a slew of new treatments in dental offices. New York City-based cosmetic dentist and founder of Les Belles NYC Sharon Huang has created a procedure called Propel to speed up Invisalign treatment time. “The aligner is the same” Huang said. “We go in and create micro-perforations in the gums similar to microneedling to increase cellular activity so that the bone cells turn over faster.” Instead of wearing each Invisalign tray for 14 days the patient wears each for about four. Propel $1600 which is not associated with Align Technology is a one-time treatment.

“According to research we’re able to increase teeth movement by 72 percent” added Huang who added her Invisalign cases are finished between one and a half to six months. The cosmetic dentist can also speed up the treatment further using high frequency which increases teeth movement by 66 percent.

Huang also created a program called the Smile Preview to physically show her patients what their teeth will look like post-treatment. The Smile Preview $300 to 3000 is for those seeking veneers and looking for straighter and/or bigger teeth. “I utilize AI technology to incorporate each patient’s unique facial features to ensure the teeth fit their smile and face” she said. “It’s a pain-free procedure requires no anesthesia and is 100 percent reversible.”

Another company innovating in the category is Spark $3500 to $8000 for aligners which primarily works with orthodontists. The company’s proprietary material is said to grip the teeth so that a patient won’t have as many refinements. “We recently introduced a new material called TrueGen XR which is extra rigid” said Sheila Tan vice president of global marketing and clinical education at Ormco. “The minor movements at the end of treatment are hard to achieve and this takes care of those minute details.”

But certain brands don’t require a visit to a dentist or orthodontist. Candid an at-home clear aligners company was created as a more accessible model. “I was charging fees that most can’t afford” said Dr. Lynn Hurst cofounder and chief clinical officer. “It became an exclusive club of people who would come to my practice.”

Accessibility has become an important pillar of this new teeth aligners market with other direct-to-consumer players like Byte which was acquired this year by Dentsply Sirona Inc. for $1 billion SmileDirectClub and Alignerco among others.

Candid aligners are $79 a month or $2400. Candid clients can either order a kit to create their impressions at-home or visit one of 35 Candid studios the brand’s retail locations owned by orthodontists who will monitor treatment remotely after the initial appointment. The company also has an app where patients can do a virtual office consultation. Candid’s average treatment plan takes about seven months.

Most dentists aren’t a fan of at-home solutions that forgo a dental expert. “We do a lot of corrections” Huang said. “The biggest issue is there’s no dentist to call. No one is supervising it. My certified dental assistants when they start it takes them about a week or two to get a really good Invisalign mold to capture all the details.”

Kantor agrees. “It’s great that these d-to-c aligners are cheaper and can reach more people but when patients are doing this on their own without a dentist overseeing it there are a lot of problems that can occur” he said. “If you aren’t a good candidate to have teeth moving for instance if you have a lot of bone loss decay or implants there is a chance you won’t get them perfectly straight.”

Clear aligners aren’t the only invisible solution for straightening teeth. InBrace $5000 to $7000 is a treatment that uses a personalized Smartwire worn on the inside of the mouth for example. “The Smartwire is made out of space-age memory wire” said John Pham chief executive officer and cofounder. “There are no monthly tightenings and you don’t have to switch out trays.”

And more are on the horizon. “Invisalign used to be the only company able to correct crowded teeth but now there are so many advancements such as opening up the bite closing bites fixing class two or class three it’s almost taking the place of braces” Kantor said. “The future is endless.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvaHlkZXJhYmFkL291LWpudHVoLW1vdmUtdG8tYWxpZ24tY291cnNlcy13aXRoLW5lcC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTUyMjc1Ny5jbXPSAXdodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC9vdS1qbnR1aC1tb3ZlLXRvLWFsaWduLWNvdXJzZXMtd2l0aC1uZXAvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NTIyNzU3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyderabad: Osmania University & Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University move to align courses with NEP,HYDERABAD: State universities such as Osmania University ( OU ) and Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTUH) are moving forward to align their programmes with the National Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) by not only introducing new courses but also by planning to revise the curriculum for a few courses.The central government had announced NEP-2020 in order to bring in more flexibility uniformity and holistic learning at primary and higher education level.Following this the state universities have constituted a committee in their board of studies to not only review the existing curriculum but also to recommend revisions.OU vice-chancellor professor D Ravinder has constituted a committee that is looking into the revision of the curriculum to introduce more specialisations from the next academic year.

Over the years there have been title-winning pops surprise return pops glass-shattering pops and Road Warrior pops. If you happened to be anywhere in the Chicago area on the 20th of August 2021 you probably heard a familiar chant and a sustained roar getting louder and louder around the United Center and beyond. Don’t be alarmed however it was just a hometown crowd welcoming their prodigal son CM Punk back to wrestling after a seven-year absence.

With that in mind here at Inside The Ropes we take a special look at the 5 Loudest Hometown Pops In Wrestling History.

Before we begin there are honourable mentions a plenty – Edge and Trish Stratus in Toronto Kevin Owens in Montreal Daniel Bryan bidding farewell to WWE in his home state of Washington Shawn Michaels in San Antonio Britt Baker and Kurt Angle both in Pittsburgh the list could surely go on but here’s the five that make our list.

5. CM Punk – Chicago Illinois – Money In The Bank 2011 – 17/7/11

Chicago clearly is CM Punk’s kind of town and kind of people too as AEW Rampage was not the first time The Windy City has raised the roof for their straight edge son. The Allstate Arena was home to Money In The Bank in 2011 with just shy of 15000 fans crammed in to see the main event of CM Punk challenging John Cena for the WWE Championship. The one caveat – Punk’s WWE contract ended at midnight and if he won he was leaving and taking the belt with him.

The ‘pipebomb’ promo had rejuvenated Punk’s WWE career and the entire company in the summer of 2011. Even in the height of the Monday Night Wars nobody had ever openly threatened to take the richest prize in the company and leave with it – at least not on screen. But Punk was and he took great pleasure in holding WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to ransom as he desperately tried to protect the title.

While Cult Of Personality wasn’t quite part of Punk’s repertoire at Money In The Bank it wouldn’t have mattered what music was played as the Chicago crowd gave him an incredible ovation. With the tension building and a ‘Chicago Screwjob’ on the cards as McMahon and his personal stooge for the evening John Laurinaitis attempted to relive Montreal again the crowd exploded even more vociferously when Punk covered Cena for the win the title and the kiss goodbye. The Summer Of Punk had begun.

4. Sami Zayn – Montreal Quebec Canada – Raw – 4/5/15

It didn’t matter if you parlez-vous francais or not in Montreal in 2015 as even a non-native could work out exactly how the partisan crowd felt about their very own Underdog From The Underground when he answered John Cena’s US Title Open Challenge in 2015.

Cena had thrown the doors open to all and sundry when he won the US Title from Rusev at WrestleMania 31 and now a hometown boy was answering the challenge and he hadn’t come alone. Wrestling legend and Canadian icon Bret ‘Hitman’ Hart made his way to the ring to introduce Zayn. The crowd grew louder as he mentioned that they were in the challenger’s hometown and he was a star of NXT. The fever pitch reached a crescendo when Zayn’s music hit and the 10000-plus fans inside the Bell Centre gave Zayn a raucous reception.

Unfortunately Zayn didn’t claim the US Title north of the border and even worse he suffered a shoulder injury that saw him out of action for seven months.

3. Taz – New York City New York – Royal Rumble 2000 – 23/1/00

“Win if you can survive if I let you” was the mantra known to fans of Taz as the Human Suplex Machine ran roughshod over everyone in ECW throughout the nineties. As the Millennium came a change of scenery so to came for Taz and he joined the WWF making his debut at the 2000 Royal Rumble in the hallowed halls of Madison Square Garden.

Like another entry that may or may not be on this list it wasn’t announced that Taz was to compete but somehow the New York crowd knew their man from the Red Hook section of Brooklyn New York was there and ready to go.

Kurt Angle himself a relative newcomer to the company at that point issued an open challenge to the wrestling world and as the lights went out and that beat hit New York knew Taz had come home. With the crowd in raptures and bathed in black and orange Taz stormed his way to the ring where he conspired to contort and catapult the Olympic gold medallist around the ring. As he locked in the Tazmission and the New York crowd again rose to their feet Angle passed out and couldn’t win. Thankfully Taz let the hold go to soak in the adulation of his hometown letting Angle survive for another day.

2. The Hart Foundation – Calgary Alberta Canada – Canadian Stampede – 6/7/97

Texas has the Von Erichs Florida had the Grahams New York had Bruno Sammartino and Canada belongs to the Harts. It is no exaggeration to say that Bret Hart is a huge star in his home country. Even more so in his and his family’s hometown of Calgary Alberta Canada.

Wherever the Harts go in Canada an incredible reception was sure to await them. However in 1997 when the family and Stampede Wrestling alumni Brian Pillman came together as The Hart Foundation there was magic ready to be made. While the group became hated in the USA for their anti-American rhetoric they were as beloved as ever across the rest of the world especially in Canada. So when they came to Calgary for In Your House: Canadian Stampede in 1997 to face a gang of the USA’s finest there was sure to be electricity in the air.

Over 12000 fans packed into Calgary’s Saddledome but given the noise that was made there could easily have been twice as many people there. Once Ken Shamrock Goldust the Legion Of Doom and Stone Cold Steve Austin made their way to the ring it was time for The Hart Foundation – hold on to your hat.

The Hart Foundation made their way to the stage one at a time before walking to the ring together. Pillman was out first followed by Jim ‘The Anvil’ Neidhart as the crowd grew louder and louder. The British Bulldog with wife Diana Hart was out next and by now if you’re watching this and you don’t have goosebumps please pinch yourself to make sure you’re still alive.

‘The King Of Harts’ Owen Hart emerged next and the youngest Hart son felt like Calgary’s own baby boy as the roof was raised again but the best was yet to come. Bret Hart made his entrance and Calgary rose as one to welcome Canada’s first family to the ring.

1. CM Punk – Chicago Illinois – AEW Rampage – 20/8/21

Talk about a perfect storm – a beloved hero a hometown a huge return a massive surprise [well sort of] and a huge amount of expectations came together to give CM Punk an ovation like no other as the former WWE Champion returned to wrestling after a seven-year exile.

There was never any doubt that Chicago loved Punk and Punk loved Chicago but after such a long absence from the ring when CM Punk emerged in front of the United Center in his hometown it was proved that absence really does make the heart grow fonder.

As the show went on the air the 15000-plus Chicagoans were already chanting their hero’s name but in reality since Punk walked out of WWE in 2014 they had never really stopped. After the commentary team had welcomed viewers to the show it was time to see if the rumours had been true and when the first strains of Cult Of Personality hit there was no doubt left CM Punk was home and CM Punk was All Elite.

A deafening roar accompanied Punk’s protracted entrance that took Rampage up to its first commercial break. As The Voice Of The Voiceless made himself heard every fan in the arena was eating out of the palm of his hand.

Punk won’t have to wait long for his next rousing ovation in his home city as he challenged Darby Allin to a match at All Out in Chicago on September 5th.

Russia's media authority has ordered Google and Apple to take down Alexei Navalny's app.

Navalny who is currently in prison in Russia is President Vladimir Putin's biggest opponent.

The move appears to be the latest attempt by the Russian government to silence Navalny.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Russia's media authority Roskomnadzor has ordered Apple and Alphabet Google's parent company to take the app of the biggest opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin off of their platforms according to a report.

Roskomnadzor said the app dedicated to publishing stories about Alexei Navalny should be taken off of Google and Apple's app stores because Russian courts have labeled Navalny's anti-corruption foundation as extremist the Russian news agency Interfax reported on Friday.

Neither Apple or Alphabet were immediately available for comment Saturday about the request.

The development marks the latest attempt by the Russian government to silence Navalny. Navalny is currently in a Russian prison after returning to the country from Germany where he recovered from being poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok during a flight within Russia last August. The Russian government says he is guilty of embezzlement.

Putin and the Russian government's treatment of Navalny continues to draw criticism from abroad. During a Friday meeting with Putin German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Navalny's imprisonment unacceptable and called for his release.

The team of US President Joe Biden has warned Russia of ""consequences"" if Navalny dies while in custody.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzU2ODkwNC1pdHMtdGltZS10by1icmVhay11cC1iaWctdGVjaHMtbWVkaWEtbW9ub3BvbHkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvNTY4OTA0LWl0cy10aW1lLXRvLWJyZWFrLXVwLWJpZy10ZWNocy1tZWRpYS1tb25vcG9seS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s time to break up Big Tech’s media monopoly,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/568904-its-time-to-break-up-big-techs-media-monopoly/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzU2ODkwNC1pdHMtdGltZS10by1icmVhay11cC1iaWctdGVjaHMtbWVkaWEtbW9ub3BvbHkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvNTY4OTA0LWl0cy10aW1lLXRvLWJyZWFrLXVwLWJpZy10ZWNocy1tZWRpYS1tb25vcG9seS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL3dheW1vLWlzLTk5LW9mLXRoZS13YXktdG8tc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWNhcnMtdGhlLWxhc3QtMS1pcy10aGUtaGFyZGVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waymo Is 99% of the way to self-driving cars. The last 1% is the hardest,"Joel Johnson laughs nervously from the backseat when his self-driving taxi stops in the middle of a busy road in suburban Phoenix. The car operated by autonomous vehicle pioneer Waymo has encountered a row of traffic cones in a construction zone and won’t move. “Go around man” Johnson says as he gestures to the drivers honking behind him.

After the vehicle has spent 14 mostly motionless minutes obstructing traffic a Waymo technician tries to approach — but the car unexpectedly rolls forward away from him. “It definitely seemed like a dangerous situation” Johnson recalls.

Incidents like this one which Johnson posted to his YouTube channel in May are embarrassing for Waymo — a company that’s having its own problems moving forward. A unit of Alphabet Inc. Waymo hasn’t expanded its robo-taxi service beyond Phoenix after years of careful testing. The company has floated moves into other areas — trucking logistics personal vehicles — but the businesses are in early stages. And its production process for adding cars to its driverless fleet has been painfully slow.

This spring Waymo saw a mass exodus of top talent. That included its chief executive officer chief financial officer and the heads of trucking product manufacturing and automotive partnerships. People familiar with the departures say some executives felt frustrated about the sluggish pace of progress at the enterprise.

Despite years of research and billions of dollars invested the technology behind self-driving cars still has flaws. Not long ago a glorious future of autonomous vehicles from Waymo and its many competitors seemed close at hand. Now “what people are realizing is that the work ahead is really hard” says Tim Papandreou a former employee and transit consultant.

The leader

Waymo by most measures is still the leader of the world’s autonomous vehicle effort. Development of its technology began at Google more than a decade ago and the company hit a historic milestone last year when it started its completely driverless taxi program in Arizona. During the pandemic many rivals gave up on self-driving (Uber Technologies Inc.) or sold themselves to rivals (Zoox which was acquired by Amazon.com Inc.). Waymo kept going raising $5.7 billion from outside investors since last summer adding to the untold billions Alphabet has already spent.

Waymo points to its remarkable track record vs. those of its rivals. Since last fall the company says it’s provided “tens of thousands” of rides without a driver present in Arizona. “We consider that to be a huge accomplishment” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement. “In fact the absence of any other such fully autonomous commercial offering is a demonstration of how hard it is to achieve this feat.”

Small disturbances like construction crews bicyclists left turns and pedestrians remain headaches. Each city poses new unique challenges and right now no driverless car from any company can gracefully handle rain sleet or snow.

But the company’s remaining competitors have also started to hit milestones. Argo AI backed by Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG will start charging for robot rides in Miami and Austin later this year — albeit with a human minder behind the wheel. Zoox and Cruise which is funded by General Motors Honda and SoftBank have begun testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in California. While none of these companies has yet turned a profit on self-driving tech they’re all directing billions of dollars toward erasing Waymo’s early lead.

Waymo separated from Google’s research lab in 2016 to become the latest subsidiary of Alphabet and went on a hiring spree recruiting personnel to cut business deals with automakers draft financial models lobby state houses and market its technology. At the time many Waymonauts — as employees call themselves — believed the machinery was in place for fully driverless cars to hit public roads imminently.

In 2017 the year Waymo launched self-driving rides with a backup human driver in Phoenix one person hired at the company was told its robot fleets would expand to nine cities within 18 months. Staff often discussed having solved “99% of the problem” of driverless cars. “We all assumed it was ready” says another ex-Waymonaut. “We’d just flip a switch and turn it on.”

But it turns out that last 1% has been a killer. Small disturbances like construction crews bicyclists left turns and pedestrians remain headaches for computer drivers. Each city poses new unique challenges and right now no driverless car from any company can gracefully handle rain sleet or snow. Until these last few details are worked out widespread commercialization of fully autonomous vehicles is all but impossible.

“We got to the moon and it’s like now what?” says Mike Ramsey a Gartner analyst in Detroit and longtime industry spectator. “We stick a flag in it grab some rocks but now what? We can’t do anything with this moon.”

Some assembly required

At first it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018 Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its “Driver” — a suite of cameras sensors and proprietary computer gear.

“There’s not a lot in assembly” then-CEO John Krafcik a former auto executive declared at an event that year.

In reality skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is according to a person familiar with the operations who describes the system as cumbersome and prone to quality problems. Like others who spoke candidly about the company the former employee asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation.

Skilled disassembly is required. Waymo engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. Argo and Cruise plan to build their driverless cars from the ground up.

The painstaking nature of the process has left Waymo without a viable path to mass production the person says. Waymo has slashed parts orders on the Chrysler minivan project and has had far fewer Jaguars delivered than initially expected according to people familiar with the automakers’ plans.

The Waymo spokesperson says the company is not supply-constrained in Detroit and that it’s on track to hit all its internal production targets with Jaguar but declines to share details. The company also disputes that it’s fallen behind schedule on constructing its Chrysler vehicles noting that these agreements are “fluid and subject to change.”

Waymo’s competitors in Detroit already have vast manufacturing capabilities. Argo and Cruise for example plan to build their driverless cars from the ground up. Insiders generally believe that Waymo is the leader on technology but manufacturing capacity could give Detroiters the advantage when it comes to rolling out fleets according to Ramsey the Gartner analyst. “I don’t know what their current number is” he says of Waymo’s production. “But it hasn’t moved much.”

In 2019 Waymo rented a warehouse in Detroit to be as Krafcik said at the time “the world’s first dedicated autonomous plant.” Michigan officials agreed to give the company an $8 million grant partly in exchange for creating at least 100 jobs in the state. As of last fall Waymo had hired 22 people to work at the facility according to state filings. The company says it’s exceeded the 100-person job-creation pledge in the state and would not comment on the headcount of specific offices.

Earlier this year Waymo was trying to produce 5 to 10 vehicles a day at the factory says one former employee. The company disputes this claim.

Changes at the top

After years of publicly touting the wonders of self-driving Waymo personnel started talking in recent years about managing people’s expectations of what their cars could do and when. Several people who worked at Waymo describe parent company Alphabet as extremely cautious particularly after an Uber self-driving test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018.

For example Waymo’s ad hoc board shot down a splashy marketing pitch from Krafcik according to three people familiar with the decision. In 2018 he wanted to stage a multicity demonstration of the company’s technology with pop-up marketing installations showcasing what Waymo could do. Tesla Inc. had carried out something similar with its early models. But the company’s board — which consisted of Google’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin along with Alphabet honchos and a few outside investors — worried about repeating the failures of Google Glass the flopped augmented-reality spectacles by introducing a product before it was ready. A Waymo spokesperson said that the company simply went in a different direction.

Krafcik left the company in April. The new co-CEOs are Tekedra Mawakana formerly Waymo’s chief operating officer and Dmitri Dolgov who had been its chief technology officer. The pair met with backers and partners this spring as Waymo closed its financing round. According to one investor the new chiefs were upbeat in a recent meeting saying that with the pandemic fading the company was gearing up to make “huge headway” on its goals.

Russia's media authority has ordered Google and Apple to take down Alexei Navalny's app.

Navalny who is currently in prison in Russia is President Vladimir Putin's biggest opponent.

The move appears to be the latest attempt by the Russian government to silence Navalny.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Russia's media authority Roskomnadzor has ordered Apple and Alphabet Google's parent company to take the app of the biggest opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin off of their platforms according to a report.

Roskomnadzor said the app dedicated to publishing stories about Alexei Navalny should be taken off of Google and Apple's app stores because Russian courts have labeled Navalny's anti-corruption foundation as extremist the Russian news agency Interfax reported on Friday.

Neither Apple or Alphabet were immediately available for comment Saturday about the request.

The development marks the latest attempt by the Russian government to silence Navalny. Navalny is currently in a Russian prison after returning to the country from Germany where he recovered from being poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok during a flight within Russia last August. The Russian government says he is guilty of embezzlement.

Putin and the Russian government's treatment of Navalny continues to draw criticism from abroad. During a Friday meeting with Putin German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Navalny's imprisonment unacceptable and called for his release.

The team of US President Joe Biden has warned Russia of ""consequences"" if Navalny dies while in custody.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzU2ODkwNC1pdHMtdGltZS10by1icmVhay11cC1iaWctdGVjaHMtbWVkaWEtbW9ub3BvbHkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvNTY4OTA0LWl0cy10aW1lLXRvLWJyZWFrLXVwLWJpZy10ZWNocy1tZWRpYS1tb25vcG9seS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s time to break up Big Tech’s media monopoly,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/568904-its-time-to-break-up-big-techs-media-monopoly/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzU2ODkwNC1pdHMtdGltZS10by1icmVhay11cC1iaWctdGVjaHMtbWVkaWEtbW9ub3BvbHkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvNTY4OTA0LWl0cy10aW1lLXRvLWJyZWFrLXVwLWJpZy10ZWNocy1tZWRpYS1tb25vcG9seS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL3dheW1vLWlzLTk5LW9mLXRoZS13YXktdG8tc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWNhcnMtdGhlLWxhc3QtMS1pcy10aGUtaGFyZGVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waymo Is 99% of the way to self-driving cars. The last 1% is the hardest,"Joel Johnson laughs nervously from the backseat when his self-driving taxi stops in the middle of a busy road in suburban Phoenix. The car operated by autonomous vehicle pioneer Waymo has encountered a row of traffic cones in a construction zone and won’t move. “Go around man” Johnson says as he gestures to the drivers honking behind him.

After the vehicle has spent 14 mostly motionless minutes obstructing traffic a Waymo technician tries to approach — but the car unexpectedly rolls forward away from him. “It definitely seemed like a dangerous situation” Johnson recalls.

Incidents like this one which Johnson posted to his YouTube channel in May are embarrassing for Waymo — a company that’s having its own problems moving forward. A unit of Alphabet Inc. Waymo hasn’t expanded its robo-taxi service beyond Phoenix after years of careful testing. The company has floated moves into other areas — trucking logistics personal vehicles — but the businesses are in early stages. And its production process for adding cars to its driverless fleet has been painfully slow.

This spring Waymo saw a mass exodus of top talent. That included its chief executive officer chief financial officer and the heads of trucking product manufacturing and automotive partnerships. People familiar with the departures say some executives felt frustrated about the sluggish pace of progress at the enterprise.

Despite years of research and billions of dollars invested the technology behind self-driving cars still has flaws. Not long ago a glorious future of autonomous vehicles from Waymo and its many competitors seemed close at hand. Now “what people are realizing is that the work ahead is really hard” says Tim Papandreou a former employee and transit consultant.

The leader

Waymo by most measures is still the leader of the world’s autonomous vehicle effort. Development of its technology began at Google more than a decade ago and the company hit a historic milestone last year when it started its completely driverless taxi program in Arizona.

Pascal Rossignol/Reuters



A former Amazon warehouse employee said she was fired after taking too many bathroom breaks.

Maria Iris Jennitte Olivero filed a lawsuit which said she suffered from irritable bowel syndrome.

In the lawsuit Olivero accused her manager of firing her before she could get a doctor's note.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

An Amazon warehouse employee who said she had irritable bowel syndrome said the company fired her as retaliation after she took too many bathroom breaks.

Maria Iris Jennitte Olivero filed a case in June in New Jersey Superior Court seeking damages. Earlier this month Amazon responded in US District Court attempting to escalate the case to federal court.

Olivero's lawyer and Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment.

Olivero's filing in New Jersey included a timeline of her employment at the company. She started in July 2020.

According to the filing when she told a manager in November about her IBS and that she needed to use the bathroom up to six times a day the manager told her to get a doctor's note. It appeared from the filing that Olivero didn't get the note.

Olivero then said in the filing that in January her manager said she was going to be written up and that she'd need to get a doctor's note within five days. But the first available appointment at her doctor was six days later according to her complaint.

Five days after she was written up she was fired according to her complaint.

""At that time [Olivero] was informed by [her manager] that it was 'too late' to provide a doctor's note and that she was being terminated by Defendants"" the complaint read.

She's suing the company for discriminating against someone with a disability and failure to accommodate under New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination.

Olivero didn't specify in her lawsuit how much she'd seek in damages. But Amazon said she was expected to be seeking more than $75000 one of the reasons it sought to move the case to federal court.

As part of its argument as to why the case should be moved to federal court the company also detailed Olivero's wages.

""Plaintiff earned $15.25 per hour or $31720.00 annualized and received a $0.60 per hour shift differential or $1248.00 annualized. Therefore at the time of this filing plaintiff's purported gross lost wages to date are $17251.75"" the company's lawyers wrote.

Block Club obtained the Park District’s contract with Amazon through a public records request after several lockers were installed on sidewalks partially blocking them in parks earlier this month.

The contract shows Amazon pays the Park District $50 a month for each of the smallest of the steel lockers which are 6 feet wide. The contract calls for $125-a-month payments for the largest lockers which are 15 feet wide.

A total of 49 lockers have been installed in city parks. The majority of those lockers are the 6- or 9-foot versions according to figures provided by the Park District.

Another 53 lockers are scheduled to be installed in parks around the city this year. If all of those lockers are 6 feet wide the Park District would make $69900 for a full 12 months of rent. It would also get a one-time $20000 payment for allowing at least 100 lockers.

That means the park district could get as little as $89900 in the first full year.

If each of the next 53 lockers installed are the largest possible — 15 feet — that would net the Park District $117600 in the first year plus the $20000 bonus.

That means the most the Park District could get in the first full year of rent on all 102 lockers is $137600.

For comparison the Park District’s budget this year is $481.8 million.

Critics who earlier this month slammed Amazon — and the Park District — for putting for-profit lockers on public parkland were again fired up after learning how much revenue the lockers will generate for the Park District.

“It is not enough to justify having branding in our parks. It is absolutely not enough” Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) said. “I think this is a slap in the face.”

The lockers grabbed attention a little more than a week ago. Rodriguez-Sanchez and Ald. Samantha Nugent (39th) spoke out against lockers in their respective wards — one in Brands Park and another in the Forest Park Playlot — for partially blocking the sidewalk and preventing people from easily passing through the public spaces.

Photos of the lockers went viral and social media erupted with criticism. Many had more sweeping concerns about Amazon’s presence in public parks. The company and its founder Jeff Bezos have faced widespread criticism for the poor treatment of Amazon workers and grueling workplace conditions.

After a social media firestorm the Park District quickly removed the two lockers targeted by Nugent and Rodriguez-Sanchez.

The city agency also launched a review of Amazon’s plans and put future installations on hold until that review is complete.

A Park District spokeswoman initially rejected a request for the contract as the news was unfolding instead asking for a Freedom of Information Act public records request. She later provided the contract.

While some critics are outraged over the figures others are less concerned with the contract itself and are more troubled by the propriety of using public space for private profit and by the Park District’s handling of the situation.

Juanita Irizarry executive director of Friends of the Parks is among them.

“Regardless of how much it is the Chicago Park District needs to stay on mission and not pursue income streams that disrupt the purpose of public parks” Irizarry said in a statement.

Asked for her reaction to the contract Irizarry slammed the Park District for what she described as a “lack of transparency” surrounding the plan. She said the lockers represent a trend of opaqueness in the city agency.

“Friends of the Parks is concerned about patterns of lack of transparency that we observe at the Chicago Park District under the leadership of Mike Kelly” she said. “We imagine that the Park District has moved this business with Amazon lockers forward in small bits so as to avoid the public scrutiny of vetting a larger contract in the full light of day at its Board of Commissioners meetings.”

The Park District is also catching heat from the city’s small business community for partnering with Amazon when mom-and-pop shops across the city have struggled to survive the pandemic.

Rudy Flores executive director of the Lincoln Square Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce said his organization has heard from many small business owners looking to use the city’s public outdoor spaces to conduct business as indoor service was halted or limited for more than a year. But Flores said the Park District has not opened up those spaces to small business owners outside of the food industry.

“Our small businesses invest in our communities by preventing commercial vacancies contribute to local property taxes employee neighborhood residents fundraise for our local schools and so much more” Flores said in a written statement. “If any opportunity is available for commerce in the park district it should be given to those entrepreneurs that put their sweat and equity into making our communities thrive.”

The livery features the classic white with blue and red stripes and American Eagle logo on the tail and was painted on their 2nd Embraer E170 registered N760MQ. The brand which operates under the American Airlines Group will take on at least seven Embraer E170s and will limit the cabin configuration to 65 seats in order to pass as a small regional jet under American Airlines’ scope clause agreement.

“We’re just as excited about the heritage livery as anyone else” said Envoy Senior Vice President of Air Operations Dee Temples. “We like that people take an interest in Envoy and its history and that they’re enthusiastic about aviation.”

The aircraft is currently with the Eagle Aviation Services Incorporated (EASI) team in Abilene (ABI) for conformity checks and to prepare the aircraft for revenue service in the coming weeks. N760MQ previously flew for BA Cityflyer as G-LCYD and it is expected that six of the seven E170s coming to Envoy will come from Cityflyer. Besides the E170s Envoy operates 57 Embraer ERJ-145s and 98 Embraer E175s.

Here are a few photos of the heritage livery and you can check out the full gallery here.

The latest mobilization means CRAF has now been activated for the third time since it was created after World War II. The CRAF was established in 1951 as an emergency authorization to use commercial and charter planes to augment airlift and resupply missions. It was previously used during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990 and again in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Defense Department and U.S. Transportation Command are the activating authority for CRAF. The airlines volunteer for the program which also involves the Department of Transportation.

But as its supply dwindles a crisis looms. Published August 21 2021

For farmers in the deserts of central Arizona success and failure is defined by who has water and who does not. At the moment Dan Thelander is still among the haves.

Inside a municipal building in Pinal County Thelander rolls a map out across the board room table.

On the patchwork of brown desert and green farmland in front of us Thelander points out the parcels of land where he and his brother son and nephew grow cotton alfalfa and several other crops.

About half the water he uses to irrigate his land is pumped out of ancient aquifers deep beneath the desert floor. The other half however originates hundreds of miles away at the headwaters of the Colorado River.

As winter fades and the snowpack melts water drains into the mountain streams and tributaries that feed the Colorado River. The river’s vast drainage area is divided into two regions: the Upper and Lower Basin. Around 90% of the river’s flow originates in the Upper Basin. After flowing down from the Upper Basin the river snakes its way across the Southwest eventually reaching Lake Mead near Las Vegas. From there a system of dams canals and pipelines channel it into the irrigation ditches that water Thelander’s thirsty fields in Pinal County.

Today this river system supplies 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico and irrigates more than 5 million acres of farmland on its way into Mexico and the Gulf of California.

Las Vegas relies on the river for 90% of its water supply Tucson for 82% and San Diego for around 66%. Large portions of the water used in Los Angeles Phoenix and Denver also come from the river and experts say these booming metropolises would not have been possible without its supply.

But a crisis is unfolding and farmers scientists water managers and policy makers across the Southwest are increasingly alarmed.

Water managers have long recognized that the river is plagued by overuse. But over the last two decades demand for the river’s water has often outstripped its supply. Since 2000 the river’s flows have shrunk by roughly 20% compared to the 20th century average due in large part to the human-caused climate crisis. At the same time its two main reservoirs — the savings account for the entire system in times of drought — have drained rapidly.

Lake Mead — the largest manmade reservoir in the US which is fed by the Colorado River — recently sunk to its lowest levels since the lake was filled in the 1930s. Its water levels have fallen more than 146 feet since their peak in January of 2000 and the lake is now just 35% full. Lake Powell the river’s second largest reservoir sits at 32% of its capacity. As water levels drop billions of kilowatt hours of hydroelectricity that power homes from Nebraska to Arizona are also at risk.

“We’re in uncharted territory for this system” says Jeff Lukas an independent consultant and former research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder where he focused on water issues for 20 years.

On Monday the US Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever official shortage which will trigger the largest mandatory water cuts to date in the Colorado River Basin. And after decades of receiving water from the Colorado River the spigot could soon be turned off on many farms here including Thelander’s.

While the farmers knew this day would come a harsh reality is setting in: To stay in business they’ll need to pull more water from below ground.

Back on the table Thelander points to the diamonds and circles that dot the map. Those mark the locations of new groundwater wells that his irrigation district is considering — the first new ones they have drilled in decades Thelander says.

For much of the last century Colorado River management has focused on choosing who will be allowed to stick their straw into the river next and how much water they can take. At times that process has sparked major disputes — with some leading all the way to the US Supreme Court.

Now many of the basin states are having a more painful discussion: deciding who will receive less water — and how much. Experts say the next phase in the river’s history could be even more contentious.

The current Colorado River guidelines expire in 2026 and early negotiations are already getting underway for a new framework to determine how to divvy up its water. But by the time officials from the states Mexico Native American tribes and the federal government convene it is likely that the river’s water supply will be even more tenuous than it is today.

Scientists and water policy experts say that the science is clear: The Colorado River’s supply will likely shrink further as the planet warms. Given what we know many say we will have to use even less water in the future.

But will the states be able to agree to new guidelines that reflect this reality? And with the Southwest’s growing urban centers and farms both reliant on the river’s supply who will be willing to take less water?

How elected officials and water managers answer those questions will decide the fate of the most important water resource in the American West — and the millions of people who rely on it.

Who stands to lose water first — and why Bryce Urbany CNN

The roots of this current water crisis can be traced back nearly 100 years to the signing of the Colorado River Compact.

In November of 1922 with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover overseeing the deliberations delegates from all seven Colorado River Basin states convened in Santa Fe New Mexico to hammer out the guidelines.

From the start the compact negotiations were contentious. Squabbles erupted over details big and small from how to measure the river’s flow to how to portion out its supply.

Efforts to reach a deal began in January of 1922 and resumed in November when delegates from the states gathered in Santa Fe New Mexico. After two weeks of deliberations they finally reached an agreement on November 24 1922.

From the Southwest’s cities to its farms that feed the world water managers say much of what we see today would not exist without the dams canals and pipelines that the compact paved the way for.

“[The Colorado River] is the lifeblood of the American Southwest” says Jeff Kightlinger who led Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District for 15 years before his recent retirement. “None of these cities would be possible but for the Colorado River and the development of it for all of these regions.”

Over the course of the 20th century new agreements and court decisions further divided up the river’s supply among the seven basin states Mexico and the region’s Native American tribes. But there was a serious flaw in the original compact — one that in part explains why the river is facing its first-ever shortage today.

When the delegates met they agreed to give the Upper Basin (made up of Colorado Wyoming Utah and New Mexico) and the Lower Basin (California Arizona and Nevada) each 7.5 million acre-feet of water to use on an annual basis.

Those portions were based on estimates that the river’s flow totaled roughly 16.4 million acre-feet each year. That was more than enough to meet the demands of the states. However data shows those estimates exceed the amount of water the river actually provides in most years.

Analysis of US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) data shows that between 1906 and 2019 annual flows on the river actually averaged just under 14.8 million acre-feet. Over the last two decades flows have been even lower — just an estimated 12.3 million acre-feet on average each year.

Up until the 1990s the Lower Basin states were not using all the water they were entitled to on paper. This allowed officials to let the river’s water accounting problem persist for decades experts say.

“Through the 20th century it was easy for political actors to ignore that reality …” says John Fleck a professor at the University of New Mexico who has written several books on the Colorado River and water issues in the West. “There was slack in the system because it took us a century to build all the dams and diversions that people dreamed about in the 1920s.”

A river stretched beyond its limits US Bureau of Reclamation

As water rights were granted and new canals were built that slack has gradually disappeared.

Data shows that the over-allocation problem became more apparent in the years after one of the last big straws was inserted into the river.

The Central Arizona Project (CAP) — a massive 336-mile canal and pipeline system that carries Colorado River water across the desert to Phoenix Tucson and farms and towns in between — was authorized by Congress in 1968.

Before the CAP was completed in the 1990s heavy groundwater pumping in central Arizona was sucking aquifers dry at an alarming rate. The CAP promised a renewable reliable source of water.

With no infrastructure to deliver Colorado River water to cities in the middle of the state Arizona was also only using about half of its Colorado River allocation before the CAP was completed according to Ted Cooke the general manager of the CAP.

California had long opposed the project so to gain support from the state’s congressional delegation Arizona made a key concession: That in the event of a shortage fulfilling California’s water deliveries would take priority over meeting the needs of CAP water users.

Now with water cuts looming next year the CAP’s status in the Colorado River’s pecking order is proving significant.

As Lake Mead's levels have fallen Arizona Nevada and Mexico are already receiving less than their full allocations of water. And with the lake projected to be even lower next year deeper cuts will take effect in 2022. Arizona faces the most severe reductions. In Arizona the water cuts will have the greatest impact on lower-priority water users served by the CAP like farmers in Pinal County. But if water levels in Lake Mead continue to sink in the years to come California could also face cuts to its water supply. Some cities and tribes in central Arizona could also face reductions if the lake drops to critical levels. If the lake drops below 1025 feet above sea level Arizona would receive less than 75% of its full Colorado River water supply.

Arizona farmers like Dan Thelander have known for years that their supply of Colorado River water would eventually be phased out. They just didn’t expect it to happen so soon.

A drought that began more than two decades ago along with the effects of higher temperatures due to global warming have rapidly sapped the river’s flow. And in the long-term scientists and water policy experts say those problems pose a threat to users far beyond the farms of Pinal County.

Droughts are temporary. The drying up of the river may not be

The Colorado River’s drainage basin spans some 246000 square miles but most of its flow originates in a handful of snow-capped mountain ranges in southern Wyoming western Colorado and northeastern Utah according to Jeff Lukas the research scientist and water consultant.

The river flows through some of the country’s most arid land so the snow that accumulates in those areas is critical. In most years snowmelt is responsible for about 80% of the river’s water supply Lukas says.

Many scientific studies have examined why there is less water flowing into the river. Nearly all have found the fingerprints of human-caused climate change.

The first and perhaps most cited explanation is the ongoing “megadrought” which began in the year 2000.

A study published in the journal Science in 2020 found that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest stretch the Southwest has experienced since the 1500s and that nearly half of the drought’s severity could be attributed to global warming.

""When you have more evaporation you have less water left over to come down the river."" Chris Milly US Geological Survey

As dry as it has been the study found that this may only be the beginning. Past megadroughts have lasted longer than the current one.

But a lack of snow and rain doesn’t fully explain what is happening to the Colorado River. And droughts after all are temporary. Some scientists say the evidence shows the river’s shrinking supply is likely not so fleeting.

Brad Udall a climate scientist at Colorado State University argues the river’s plight is best summed up by another term: aridification.

Broadly speaking aridification is a shift to a new climate state dominated by water scarcity and driven by the effects of hotter temperatures. Temperatures across the basin have risen by an average of 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over the last century.

“[Warmer temperatures] are just this constant year in and year out force on the system” Udall says.

As temperatures warm the amount of precipitation that falls as snow decreases and the snow that does fall melts earlier according to Chris Milly a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey who co-authored a study last year examining the river’s decline.

""Evaporation is how the river basin cools itself"" Milly says. “When you have more evaporation you have less water left over to come down the river.""

Over the last year Udall says we’ve seen how some of these processes can lead to alarmingly low runoff and stream flows.

However the water contained in snowpack that fell last winter was not as poor with supplies peaking at between 70% and 85% of normal. Still even with decent snowpack streamflows across the region this year have been alarmingly low with some sites in Utah and Colorado reporting flows that are among the lowest on record.

All of this points to an unpleasant conclusion Udall says: As long as humans fail to halt global warming it’s likely that there will be even less water in the river in the future.

A 2020 study in the journal Science co-authored by Milly tried to approximate how much less. The authors found that further decreases in the river’s flow are likely no matter what actions are taken. But without any significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions the study found the river's flows could shrink by as much as 31% by the middle of this century.

“It's possible you might have a wet year but the long-term trend is in completely the wrong direction” Udall says. “Every passing year that becomes clearer and it’s getting harder for anyone who thinks otherwise to be taken seriously.”

A new hunt for water below ground Bryce Urbany CNN

Beneath a drill rig towering high above the desert floor two men in yellow hard hats pull levers to drive a massive metal pipe into the ground.

Feet away a deafening machine called a shaker vibrates violently separating muddy drilling fluid from chunks of earth pulled loose by the drill bit as it punctures layers of clay sand and gravel on its way down.

It’s a scene you might expect to see in the vast oil fields of the Permian Basin.

But here surrounded by acres of alfalfa and dairy pens on the outskirts of Maricopa Arizona the men are looking for something more valuable to the local economy: water.

To pump water up from the aquifer below the men will have to drill down between 1200 and 1300 feet according to Marty Weber the CEO of Weber Water Resources the company responsible for drilling this well.

This one is being paid for by the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District with money given to the farmers by the state of Arizona and the CAP as part of their agreement under the state’s drought contingency plan. Drilling these wells is part of the farmers’ strategy to survive the cuts that are coming to their Colorado River water supply.

Next year farmers in Thelander’s district will only get about 1/3 of the water supply they’ve received in past years. But in 2023 Pinal County’s farms will likely see their Colorado River supply dry up completely according to the state’s drought plans.

""... any way you cut it our farm will be less profitable."" Dan Thelander Tempe Farming Company

Before the cuts take effect on January 1 2022 Thelander hopes they will have nine to 10 new wells to make up some of the water they stand to lose. The new wells are just one sign of the changes coming soon to the county. Soon there will be fallow fields too.

Right now Thelander’s crops are doing well. But next year he expects to leave 30% to 40% of his land unsown.

“Like anybody in business when you're faced with adversity you just knuckle down and do the best you can” he says. “But any way you cut it our farm will be less profitable.”

'We’ll try to hang on and farm as long as we can' Bryce Urbany CNN

While the desert heat is ideal for growing cotton the county is also a dairy powerhouse. At one point Pinal County ranked in the top 1% of all US counties for both cotton and milk sales according to a 2018 study by economists at the University of Arizona.

Many farms here like Thelander’s specialize in growing alfalfa corn and other crops to feed the thousands of dairy cattle on local farms.

Consumers in Phoenix likely won’t notice a difference when the water cuts kick in says George Frisvold a professor at the University of Arizona and a co-author of the 2018 study. But in the local farming economy he expects there will be significant pain when the cutbacks take effect.

""You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy and jobs go away."" George Frisvold University of Arizona

The same 2018 University of Arizona study found that under a scenario where farms here lose all of the Colorado River water allocated to them it could cost the county between $31.7 and $35 million and as many as 480 jobs.

“You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy and jobs go away” Frisvold says. “In smaller rural areas in Pinal County it’s going to be more noticeable.”

Jim Boyle a dairy farmer who milks around 3500 cows on his farm near Casa Grande Arizona says that he too will likely have to fallow some of the land where he grows feed for his cattle.

And while he says he is fortunate to have deep productive groundwater wells on his property he is concerned about how others whose livelihoods are tied to farming will fare.

“There are a lot of ag-related businesses in our county — the tractor sales guys the machinery guys the fertilizer and chemicals guys” Boyle says. “It will have a roll-on effect throughout the county … and I think there’s some worry out there.”

There is also concern from some in the state about the farmers’ return to heavy groundwater pumping.

Before the CAP began delivering water to Pinal County’s farms in the late 1980s farms here were totally reliant on groundwater to irrigate their crops. But pumping was depleting the aquifers faster than they could be replenished causing huge fissures to form across the county as the ground sank.

Already projections show there is not enough groundwater available to meet future demands in the Pinal County Active Management Area (AMA) — which includes much of Pinal County as well as parts of Maricopa and Pima counties — according to an Arizona Department of Water Resources spokesperson. Last month Tom Buschatzke the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (AZDWR) told leaders in the AMA that “the days of utilizing native groundwater for development in Pinal are over it’s done.”

Still with their Colorado River water on the verge of disappearing farmers here are planning to pump even more groundwater to irrigate their fields.

“I am concerned about Pinal turning to groundwater because that means there won’t be resources for future use” says Sarah Porter the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “It’s like spending your long-term savings — you want to do that very advisedly.”

Whether the loss of Colorado River water will accelerate other trends in the county remains to be seen.

Nancy Caywood’s farm near Casa Grande used to get water from the San Carlos reservoir in Eastern Arizona part of the Gila River system. The reservoir ran dry in April and she says her farm hasn’t received water since.

To make ends meet Caywood and her son Travis Hartman are growing corn on leased land that has access to Colorado River water. The money Hartman makes from that crop should help him keep the family farm he says.

But next year farming there may no longer be an option as cuts to Colorado River water hit the county.

Already Caywood’s 255-acre farm is flanked to the East by a large solar installation and she says the farmland across the street could soon have panels installed.

She says that they too have been approached before about leasing their land to solar developers but ultimately decided against it.

As the drought continues she admits it is getting harder to tell them “no.”

“We've just decided we’ll try to hang on and farm as long as we can” she says.

This round of negotiating could be the ‘hardest one yet’ Bryce Urbany CNN

Nearly a century has passed since Herbert Hoover led the first attempt to divide up the Colorado River’s supply.

But as the first mandatory water cuts loom authorities in states across the basin say that they are preparing for a future with less water.

For years states like Arizona have been “banking” water from the Colorado River in aquifers. Las Vegas will phase out “nonfunctional grass” by 2027 in an effort to save precious water. And across the Southwest cities are investing in wastewater treatment and reuse. All of this they say will allow their economies to thrive even if the river’s supply shrinks.

But what the next 100 years look like hinges on negotiations that are beginning to take shape now.

Kightlinger the recently retired general manager of California’s Metropolitan Water District and a veteran of past river negotiations says he expects the 2026 process will be painful.

“We had very intense difficult negotiations in 2003 and 2007 and again in 2019. But this is going to be the hardest one yet.”

A failure to reach an agreement could usher in an era of uncertainty for the basin’s 40 million water users and increase the likelihood of legal conflicts says John Entsminger the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority which provides water from the Colorado River to nearly 2.3 million people in Las Vegas and across the state.

The drought contingency plans that were inked in 2019 between the federal government the states Native American tribes and other water users have so far staved off a worst-case scenario — like an emptied Lake Mead or Lake Powell. Entsminger and others pointed to those past negotiating successes and expressed confidence that they could reach a new deal.

“The Colorado [River] has been described as the most litigated river in the world and I think that’s true if you're talking about the 60s and 70s” Entsminger says. “But since the mid-’90s this has been the most successful river basin in the world in terms of seven states and the country next to it coming together and … figuring out how to make this river work for everyone.”

The water battles that lie ahead Bryce Urbany CNN

One of the biggest challenges experts say negotiators must face is how to handle the large amount of water used by agriculture which is responsible for around 70% of water use across the basin.

Pinal County’s farmers are bearing the brunt of the first round of water cuts because of their low position in the state’s water priority system. But there are other farming centers in Arizona and elsewhere which possess some of the highest priority water rights in the entire basin.

One of those places is Yuma Arizona the river’s last stop in the US before it flows into Mexico. Part of “America’s Salad Bowl” around 90% of the leafy greens produced in the US in winter are grown on Yuma’s farms according to the county’s chamber of commerce.

Under current law the entire Central Arizona Project could go dry before Yuma’s farms lose a drop of water due to their high priority water rights according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke.

Buschatzke said that the US and the world need the healthy high-value crops that they grow in Yuma but acknowledged that the river’s shrinking supply may force difficult tradeoffs.

“Certainly the community of Yuma does not want to see any of the water that goes to those farms go to non-agricultural purposes but that is something that is certainly on the radar screen” Buschatzke says.

Tom Davis the general manager of the Yuma County Water Users Association says that with less water to go around he expects there will be new pressure to shift agricultural water supplies to the Southwest’s growing cities.

He says he and the farmers he represents will fight to “the bitter end” to protect their water rights but recognizes that they are not untouchable.

The water rights of many Native American tribes whose ancestors have farmed across the region for thousands of years are also among the highest priority in the entire basin. Today 22 of the 30 federally recognized tribes in the region have rights to an estimated 22 to 26% of the river’s water supply according to recent analysis from the Water and Tribes Initiative an alliance dedicated to tribal water issues.

But despite holding a sizeable portion of the pie many tribes have been left out of these types of negotiations in the past. However there are signs that this is changing in parts of the basin.

The Gila River Indian Community located south of Phoenix in Maricopa and Pinal counties now holds the single largest water allotment in the entire Central Arizona Project system thanks to a 2004 settlement brokered with the federal government.

The Gila River Indian Community’s governor Stephen Roe Lewis says he had to fight for a seat at the table in the negotiations over the 2019 drought contingency plan. But once there he played a key role in helping push the deal across the finish line in Arizona.

Now as talks for the new 2026 guidelines begin he says he plans to vigorously defend his community’s water.

“If we’re treated as sovereign tribal entities and with respect towards our individual water histories then I’m looking forward to being a part of the process.”

As stakeholders prepare to protect their water supplies plans to use even more river water are also forging ahead in some corners.

""The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic unsustainable water policy of the 20th century."" Zachary Frankel Utah Rivers Council

The most controversial new diversion is Utah’s proposed Lake Powell pipeline which would pump Colorado River water from near Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona roughly 140 miles to the city of St. George Utah and surrounding towns. Critics say the project represents a denial of the realities of climate change that could imperil the water supplies of millions.

“The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic unsustainable water policy of the 20th century” says Zachary Frankel executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “… Utah is still in this fantasy pretending that climate change isn't impacting our water supply and it's more than crazy — it's irresponsible and reckless.”

The project appeared to be on a fast track to approval under the Trump administration last year but after the six other basin states sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt opposing the pipeline Utah requested an extension to consider their views and other public comments.

Despite their pushback Utah’s new Colorado River commissioner Gene Shawcroft says he believes the project is important to the state’s growth and intends to push for its approval.

A potential new (and expensive) source of water

Meanwhile as water levels in Lake Mead plummet states are exploring opportunities to develop new sources of water — in addition to what they receive from the Colorado River.

Arizona is weighing the possibility of building desalination plants on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico to augment its water supplies.

""... when the supply that we're depending on is dwindling what else are you going to do?"" Ted Cooke Central Arizona Project

If built the plants would use reverse osmosis or thermal distillation to transform salt water into fresh. That water could be used in Mexico and in exchange Arizona would potentially receive a portion of Mexico’s Colorado River water supply according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke. While legal and diplomatic hurdles remain Buschatzke said the rapidly deteriorating situation on the river has added new urgency to the effort.

Earlier this year Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and Governor Claudia Pavlovich of Mexico’s Sonora state signed an agreement to study potential desalination sites. Last year a feasibility study found the plants could cost in excess of $3 billion to build and cost between $71 million and $119 million annually to operate not to mention the huge amounts of energy required to pull salt from water.

Still with Arizona more vulnerable to water cuts than other states Central Arizona Project General Manager Ted Cooke says everything must be on the table.

“It's expensive but when the supply that we're depending on is dwindling what else are you going to do?” he says.

But new water sources are still years and billions of dollars away from becoming reality. As central Arizona prepares for painful water reductions and the possibility of deeper cuts in the next few years the clock is ticking to conserve the supply millions rely on today.

With each passing month new projections offer a glimpse further into the river’s future. The picture they paint is not pretty.

In June new modeling showed there is a 17% chance that Lake Powell could sink so low by 2024 that hydroelectric generation at Glen Canyon Dam would become impossible. At full capacity the dam can produce enough power for some 5.8 million homes. The loss of that electricity would add more stress to power sources in the West which have shown vulnerability to blackouts in extreme heat amplified by global warming.

To keep the generators running the Bureau of Reclamation recently announced that smaller reservoirs in the Upper basin would release water to help prop up Lake Powell. The influx they’ll provide will raise water levels by around 3 feet. But for a lake that now routinely drops 4 feet or more in a month it may not buy much time.

The future of Lake Mead also looks precarious.

The same models show a 1-in-5 chance that the lake could fall to 1000 feet above sea level by 2025. That’s only 50 feet above the bare minimum needed to allow Hoover Dam to generate electricity and just 105 feet above “dead pool.” At dead pool what little water is left behind cannot flow through Hoover Dam. Instead it would have to be pumped out.

As water levels drop new layers of the lake’s now-trademark “bathtub rings” are revealed. Today the white mineral deposits left behind on the shoreline’s sandstone walls tower more than 140 feet above the boats below.

They are a reminder of wetter times ones that occurred not so long ago.

They are also the most obvious sign of a river system largely conceived in the 20th century that is struggling to adapt to the harsh realities of climate change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvdXMvYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tdXNhLXdpdGhkcmF3YWwuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Afghanistan Collapses a Lament for 'Repeating the Same Mistakes' (Published 2021),Two decades after invading Afghanistan the United States is withdrawing leaving chaos in its wake and the country much as it found it 20 years ago. “The Taliban don’t just control Kabul but the whole country.” How did a war that began in response to the 9/11 attacks become the longest in American history? “If somebody had told me in 2001 that we were going to be there for another 20 years I would not have believed them.” And what lessons can be learned for the future? “We were doing the same thing year after year after year expecting a different result.” “Nearly 2400 Americans have died in Afghanistan.” “More than 43000 Afghan civilians lost their lives.” “You can’t remake a country on the American image. You can’t win if you’re fighting people who are fighting for their own villages and their own territory. Those were lessons we thought we learned in Vietnam. And yet 30 40 years later we end up in Afghanistan repeating the same mistakes.” On the morning of Sept. 11 2001 President George W. Bush was visiting an elementary school in Sarasota Fla. when he received word of an attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. “We’re looking at a live picture of the of the building right now. And uh what would you say? That would be about the 90th floor or so?” The president joined his staff in an empty classroom where his C.I.A. intelligence briefer Michael Morell had been watching the attack unfold. “There was a TV there and the second plane hit.” “Oh my goodness.” “Oh God.” “There’s another one.” “Oh.” “Oh my goodness there’s another one.” “God.” “And when that happened I knew that this was an act of terrorism.” At the Capitol in Washington Representative Barbara Lee’s meeting was interrupted. “I heard a lot of noise saying ‘Evacuate. Leave. Get out of here. Run fast.’ So I ran up Independence Avenue. As I turned around I was able to see a heck of a lot of smoke.” “Another aircraft unbelievably has crashed into the Pentagon.” “What you have to understand is this is the largest attack ever in the entire history of the country.” At 9:59 a.m. the second World Trade Center tower to be struck collapsed. Twenty-nine minutes later the other tower followed. “The president he asked to see me in his office on Air Force One. The president looked me in the eye and he said ‘Michael who did this?’ I told the president that I would bet my children’s future that Al Qaeda was responsible for this attack.” Within hours evidence surfaced that Al Qaeda a multinational terrorist organization headed by the Islamic fundamentalist Osama Bin Laden had committed the attacks. The group was being given safe haven in Afghanistan by the Taliban regime. “The president’s inclination was to hit back and hit back hard.” “I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people — ” “So the president decided to go to war.” “ — And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” “We had to go to Afghanistan. There’s no question in any of our minds it’s a war of necessity. We had to go after Al Qaeda we had to kill them we had to get them out and we had to pursue them to the ends of the earth.” “The word on the street was everyone’s got to be united with the president. You know the country is in mourning.” Three days after the attacks Lee was under pressure to vote yes on a resolution in Congress to authorize going to war against Al Qaeda and its allies when she heard a eulogy at a memorial service. “That as we act we not become the evil we deplore.” “It was at that point I said We need to think through our military response our national security response and the possible impact on civilians.” “Mr. Speaker members I rise today really with a very heavy heart. One that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States.” “Got back to the office and all hell was breaking loose.” “The only dissenting voice was Democrat Barbara Lee of California voting no.” “Phone calls threats. People were calling me a traitor. She’s got to go. But I knew then it was going to set the stage for perpetual war.” Within weeks of 9/11 the U.S. struck back in Afghanistan. “The United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime.” Soon after U.S. ground troops arrived in the country. “The invasion was a success very quickly.” “At the gates of Kabul news of a Taliban collapse had already reached these thousands.” “The Taliban retreat has turned into a rout.” “By the end of the year the Taliban had been driven from power. A large number of Al Qaeda operatives had either been killed or captured.” And although Osama Bin Laden had managed to escape the U.S. had accomplished its main goal. “Al Qaeda could not operate out of Afghanistan anymore.” President Bush knew there was a history of failed military campaigns in Afghanistan. “We know this from not only intelligence but from the history of military conflict in Afghanistan. It’s been one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We’re not going to repeat that mistake.” [Applause] But after his initial success Bush expanded the mission to nation-building. To prevent further Al Qaeda attacks his administration said it wanted to transform the poor war-torn country into a stable democracy with a strong central government and U.S.-trained military. “The idea was it would be impossible for the Taliban to ever return to power and impossible for Afghanistan to ever be used as a safe haven again.” “There were girls starting to go to school there were clinics and hospitals being set up there were vaccinations there were elections planned. Everything was kind of humming along and we all thought OK this is going to be fine.” But by the mid-2000s after the Bush administration expanded the war on terror to Iraq Richard Boucher realized that the U.S.-backed Afghan government was plagued by corruption and mismanagement. “I used to say to my guys on the Afghan desk ‘If we’re winning how come it don’t look like we’re winning?’” “The Taliban have staged a major comeback seizing control of large swaths of the country.” “The people were not rejecting the Taliban. And that was in the end because the government couldn’t deliver much for the people. Everybody had this idea in their heads that government works the way it does in Washington. But Afghanistan hasn’t worked that way in the past. I think that was a moment we should’ve at least asked ourselves whether it wasn’t really time for us to leave and to say to the Afghans ‘It’s your place you run it as best you can.’” Instead by 2011 President Bush’s successor Barack Obama had sent nearly 50000 more troops to Afghanistan hoping to reverse the Taliban’s gains. “I think one of the biggest mistakes we made strategically after 9/11 was to fail to finish the job here focus our attention here. We got distracted by Iraq.” One of those troops was Marine Captain Timothy Kudo. Part of his job was to shore up support for the government by digging wells and building schools. He soon lost faith in that mission after he says his company killed two Afghan teenagers they mistakenly believed were firing on them. “And their family saw this happen. The mothers the grandmothers they came out. It was the first time I’d ever seen an Afghan woman without wearing a burqa. They were sobbing and crying uncontrollably. I mean how can you kill two innocent people and expect anything that you say to matter at that point?” “People here have little faith in U.S. forces anymore. More Afghans now blame the violence here on the U.S. than on the Taliban.” Weeks after Kudo returned home from Afghanistan there was a monumental development. “I started getting all these texts like ‘You’ve got to check out the TV.’ My roommate calls me from the other room. ‘Turn on CNN.’” “The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin Laden the leader of Al Qaeda.” “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” “In that moment people are celebrating in front of the White House. They’re celebrating by Ground Zero.” “This is where it happened. We’re back. It’s justice!” “And to my mind there’s no more reason to go through this madness. And of course we then did it for another decade.” “I think the military and the national security apparatus thought they could win. And I think that they also wanted to believe that because they had invested so much. People had died and they didn’t want them to die in vain.” “2011 Bin Laden is now dead. Why was it so hard to de-escalate?” Jeffrey Eggers was on President Obama’s National Security Council. He says that the goal since 9/11 to make sure Afghanistan would never again be a safe haven for terrorists had become a recipe for endless war. “We will forever prevent the conditions that led to such an attack.” “Danger close!” [Gunfire] “And if you define it that way when are you finished?” [Gunfire] “Go! Come on come on come on!” Though the surge failed to push back the Taliban the U.S. drew down troop levels even as doubts were growing that Afghan forces would be able to defend the country. In 2021 President Biden the fourth president to preside over the war announced that he would withdraw U.S. troops a plan set in motion by his predecessor Donald Trump. “Nobody should have any doubts. We lost the war in Afghanistan.” “And we’re clear to cross?” “It wasn’t a peace agreement; it was a withdrawal agreement. The agreement was essentially As we withdraw don’t attack us.” As the U.S. leaves Afghanistan the Taliban is taking over again having quickly overrun the Afghan Army which the U.S. spent more than $80 billion to train and equip. “The Taliban are out in full force. And their Islamist rule is already coming back.” “They can use this as a recruiting tool. They are now the champions of the jihadi movement because they pushed out the United States.” And U.S. officials are reflecting on the beginning of the war 20 years after 9/11. “More people should have thought about endless war not just in Congress but in the State Department in the Defense Department C.I.A. and elsewhere in the White House. That the recipe of using military means to go after terrorism was just going to get us into one fight after another after another. One can only hope that Americans of the new generation will think about this.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0b2luc2lkZXIuY29tLzI4NDc1LWZlcmMtc2Vla3MtZXZpZGVuY2UtaW4tcGptLXRvcy1iaWQtdG8tcmF0ZS1iYXNlLW5ldHdvcmstdXBncmFkZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FERC Seeks Evidence in PJM TOs' Bid to Rate-base Network Upgrades,"Looking to read the full article?

FERC Seeks Evidence in PJM TOs’ Bid to Rate-base Network Upgrades

PJM transmission zones | PJM

FERC directed PJM’s transmission owners to provide evidence that they are being squeezed financially by their inability to earn a return on network upgrades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zZWVrLWxvdy1jb3N0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWV0aG9kcy82MDA3MTM3Lmh0bWzSAWxodHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zZWVrLWxvdy1jb3N0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWV0aG9kcy82MDA3MTM3Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Car Companies Seek Low-Cost Production Methods,"

Electric vehicle companies are racing to become the next Tesla but want to avoid Elon Musk's early problems with production.

So companies like Arrival and Fisker are taking very different roads to overcome such issues.

A few have found investors who are willing to spend billions to finance their startups. Rivian has raised around $10.5 billion from Amazon.com and Ford Motor Company. It is set to begin production on electric vans trucks and SUVs.

Startup companies without enough investment money need less costly ways to produce a lot of vehicles in a short time. If they cannot they risk having the problems Tesla had in its early years.

The remarkable thing is that Tesla was not ruined financially in reaching mass production Musk told Reuters news agency.

The traditional method of many carmakers has been to spend above $2 billion on a big factory to build 240000 or more vehicles each year.

Arrival has chosen instead to build electric van and bus ""microfactories.” They are small factories that cost $50 million and have fewer pieces of expensive equipment. Arrival does not need special equipment to paint its vehicles because they are made of lightweight colored plastic. Painting equipment can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Arrival plans microfactories close to major markets around the world. This will let them hire local workers and lessen shipping costs.

The money a company must raise ""to do this the traditional way…keeps startups from coming forward with new ideas"" said Mike Abelson. He is the North American head of Arrival.

The company raised about $660 million from selling shares of its company in its March public offering. Now it is building two U.S. plants. One is in North Carolina and will make vans. The other is in South Carolina and will make buses. In addition it is building a factory in Spain. Abelson said Arrival will announce more factories later this year.

Production in microfactories

Arrival's first microfactory in Bicester England will serve as the model for other plants. The lack of painting equipment is just one way the company will avoid the costs of traditional vehicle making.

The startup's engineers have built molds for plastic vehicle parts costing thousands of dollars. That is far less than the millions of dollars needed for traditional metal equipment. Arrival's engineers have also designed their own molding machines.

Abelson said Arrival needs around 70 robots for each microfactory. And it is buying only commonly used basic robots from long-time car industry suppliers.

Going small means that Arrival can produce 10000 vans each year in each microfactory rather than 100000 Abelson says. Also each microfactory will create around 250 jobs. That is not close to the many thousands of jobs created by larger plants in the past.

""That means if a plant doesn't work out it's not a disaster for a local economy"" Abelson said. ""A major car plant closing is a big hole to fill.""

‘Work our way backwards’

Electric vehicle maker Canoo has taken a similar path. But leader Tony Aquila said Canoo will build a larger microfactory to serve as a center for smaller future factories.

Electric Last Mile Solutions plans to launch a small electric van in the United States later this year. At first it will reassemble prefinished vehicles made in China at an old General Motors plant in Indiana. There it will add new safety features to meet U.S. regulations.

Company head James Taylor said this will at first save hundreds of millions of dollars on equipment. As profits grow it will add in more American parts over time. ""We'll work our way backwards"" Taylor said.

Other startups are doing production overseas to cut costs.

Israel-based REE is looking at agreements with American Axle and Mitsubishi to help build its electric platforms.

Both REE and Fisker have also teamed up with Canadian car supplier Magna International to build their electric vehicles. Fisker has a similar agreement with Taiwan's Foxconn Technology.

Sadly the remedies advocated in these sessions ignore basic principles of economics and equality. If AmEx truly embraced them it would upend its business model and ultimately collapse.

The Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo obtained whistleblower documents about the trainings and has viewed statements made at the company's anti-racism events. His conclusion : AmEx employees and executives are being asked to disregard their real-world experience and virtually everything they’ve been taught about economics. They're also being asked to ignore equal opportunity laws. Instead employees are urged to base their business actions on a warped definition of ""justice.""

Rufo describes the remarks of one of the company’s invited speakers professor Khalil Muhammad at a recent ""anti-racism"" event:

""After establishing the company’s participation in racist oppression Muhammad then encouraged AmEx executives to begin 'the deep redistributive and reparative work…' Muhammad argues further that the company should reduce credit standards for black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparation.""

Presumably AmEx has sought to provide a service that makes credit available on a colorblind basis while also generating revenues to pay its workers and give shareholders a reasonable return on their investment.

The problem for AmEx (and other credit card companies) is that its actions actually do produce ""racially unjust"" outcomes. For example only 72% of black people hold credit cards compared to 87% of white people.

Moreover AmEx is almost certainly charging black people higher prices for the exact same service. The company’s annual percentage rate or APR ranges from 13.99% to 29.99% and lower credit scores translate into higher interest rates. The average credit score among white people is 725 compared to 612 among black people. If two cardholders each charge a $5000 car repair to a credit card and the white cardholder with a better credit score pays a 15% APR while the black cardholder pays 20% the latter winds up paying $250 more in interest.

Is this done with a racist intent? Almost certainly not. But the result definitely has a ""disparate impact."" If AmEx follows Muhammad’s advice it wouldn’t base prices on individuals' creditworthiness but rather on a subjectively assigned level of ""privilege"" or ""oppression"" based on factors such as race sex and gender identity.

Set aside the fact that what Muhammad proposes is almost certainly illegal under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act which prohibits creditors from regarding race color religion national origin sex marital status or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract) when allocating credit.

The problem with putting ""social justice"" above profits is that it would quickly cause AmEx to go out of business. The only customers left would be those that cost the company money. Ultimately not caring about your bottom line means not caring about your existence or the ultimate welfare of your employees or the customers and businesses you serve.

Proponents of critical race theory and ""anti-racism"" claim their teachings will create a more ""just"" society but how does manufactured oppression by tearing down facets of society that contain unequal outcomes leave anyone better off?

This is where many racial justice advocates have failed to see past the immediate consequences of their calls to action. The good news is that the free market isn’t a fan of discrimination so if companies such as AmEx choose to pursue discriminatory practices other companies come out ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vc291cmNpbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS90b3BpY3MvcmV0YWlsL2FtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3Mtc3RyZWV0d2Vhci1tZWxvZHktZWhzYW5pLWZvb3QtbG9ja2VyLXJodWRlLXRlbHNoYS1hbmRlcnNvbi0yOTcwNDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Matches Streetwear Designers With Small Businesses,"American Express has tapped three streetwear designers to shine a light on local small businesses.

As part of its “Let’s Go Shop Small” summer campaign the financial services company matched the designers with a favorite small business of theirs and tasked them with creating a unique item “to inspire consumers to shop small this summer.”

Among these designers was Melody Ehsani the new women’s business creative director at Foot Locker and the founder of ME. a women’s streetwear brand specializing in clothing footwear and accessories. For her limited-edition drop the designer paired off with Bloom & Plume a Los Angeles-based floral studio and coffee shop to create a “vibrant and earthy” collection that includes a canvas tote bandana hiking socks and fleece set.

“To be working alongside my lifelong friend Maurice Harris owner of Bloom and Plume and American Express is an absolute thrill” Ehsani said in a statement. “We collaborated to create this limited-edition collection called Rec Set with items that encourage our appreciation for getting outdoors and creating a relationship with the earth something that is meaningful to the both of us.”

Completing the trio of designers are Rhuigi Villaseñor the founder of the streetwear label Rhude and Telsha Anderson founder and buyer at the New York City shop T.A. The former teamed up with the Los Angeles restaurant Petit Trois le Valley to create a limited-edition hat while the latter paired off with a creative studio and lifestyle boutique in Philadelphia called Yowie to craft a sculpture of a woman’s hand holding grapes.

All three duos’ items drop this weekend debuting first exclusively on the mobile-first video shopping platform NTWRK for 24 hours before becoming available at the small business location. Anderson’s arrived first Friday with Ehsani and Villaseñor’s to follow Saturday and Sunday respectively.

American Express’s “Let’s Go Shop Small” summer campaign is part of its $100 million commitment to inspire consumers to support small businesses globally through its year-round Shop Small Campaign.

“As a small business owner myself I understand the power that small businesses have on the country and they need our support now more than ever” Ehsani said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYWlybGluZXMvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMvc2F2dnktc2F0dXJkYXktYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtbG91bmdlLWFjY2Vzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savvy Saturday: Easiest way to get American Airlines Admirals Club airport lounge access (and share it too),"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

Visiting airport lounges when you travel can make your journey much more enjoyable and productive. That's why many frequent travelers carry at least one of the best credit cards for airport lounge access.

You've almost certainly meandered past the sliding glass doors of an American Airlines Admirals Club airport lounge during your travels. They're great for getting away from the hustle and bustle of the terminal and unwinding before (or between) flights. During typical times you'll usually find light snacks and free beverages (including alcohol) plus complimentary Wi-Fi and dedicated work zones. Some locations have showers and made-to-order food like guacamole (they're famous for it).

Unlike Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership offered by many credit cards getting into Admirals Club lounges isn't as easy. You'll generally need to pay for access unless you are flying in a premium cabin on a qualifying flight.

There's one other great way to get into Admirals Clubs though that you might not be aware of: Carrying the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard®. The card confers American Airlines Admirals Club membership for the primary cardholder as one of its main perks. There's something else really cool about the card -- a unique perk that probably makes it the best American Airlines credit card. It can save you hundreds if you're a frequent American Airlines flyer – especially if you travel with others or have a large family.

The secret: the Citi / AAdvantage Executive can amplify Admirals Club access

American Airlines Admirals Club access rules

Normally American Airlines Admirals Club lounge access requires you to meet one of the following conditions:

You're a paid Admirals Club lounge member (yearly memberships are as high as $650 for individuals depending on elite status $1250 for household memberships)

You're flying the same day on a qualifying international or transcontinental first or business class flight marketed or operated by American Airlines or a oneworld airline

For a limited time starting Apr. 1 2021 qualifying international flights will also include flights between the U.S. and Canada the Caribbean and Mexico

You're an AAdvantage Platinum Platinum Pro or Executive Platinum member flying the same day on a qualifying international flight marketed or operated by American Airlines or a oneworld airline (in any cabin)

You're a oneworld Emerald or Sapphire elite customer flying the same day on flights marketed and operated by American or a oneworld airline in any cabin (American Airlines Executive Platinum Platinum Pro and Platinum customers traveling only on North American itineraries don't qualify)

You purchase an Admirals Club day pass ($59 per day) holders

You're U.S. military personnel traveling in uniform

The credit card workaround

As you can see paying cash for an Admirals Club membership is expensive -- especially if you purchase a household membership for $1100-$1250 depending on your elite status and if your membership is new or renewed. However you can obtain Admirals Club membership much more cheaply by opening the Citi /AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard instead. Its annual fee is just $450 and it comes with Admirals Club membership for the primary cardholder which means they can get in and bring immediate family or up to two guests on visits.

But the real value proposition of this card lies in the ability to add authorized users so that they can access Admirals Clubs when traveling too. Cardholders can add up to 10 authorized users for free -- and all of them will also enjoy Admirals Club access for themselves and two guests or immediate family (defined as a spouse/domestic partner and children under age 18). That means you could get 11 cards including the primary one and 10 additional ones for the single $450 annual fee and get up to 33 people (the cardholder plus two guests per card) into Admirals Clubs...granted with a lot of flight and schedule coordination involved.

That's an incredible deal. Most other cards that offer airport lounge access charge an additional fee to add authorized users such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and The Platinum Card® from American Express. Other airline cobranded credit cards that include lounge access among their benefits also limit that perk much more stringently.

For example the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card charges a $550 annual fee (see rates and fees) with additional cards costing $175 apiece (see rates and fees). For that only the primary and additional cardmembers get access to Delta Sky Clubs when traveling on a same-day Delta-marketed or Delta-operated flight. Cardmembers can bring up to two guests or immediate family but at a cost $50 per person per location.

Adding users

Although Admirals Club membership at a discount is probably reason enough to pick up this card if you are a regular lounge visitor it can pay to strategize about adding authorized users and sharing the gift of lounge access with a wider circle of friends and family.

For instance suppose you and your partner fly American Airlines frequently but not always together. If one of you were to open the Citi / AAdvantage Executive and add the other as authorized user you could both have access to Admirals Club lounges for the cost of one annual fee. The same principle applies if you have a friend parent child or coworker who'd like to share the benefits of Admirals Club access with you. Just keep in mind you're responsible for any charges they make to the card so be sure to only add folks you trust completely.

One other important note: Only the primary cardholder gets a full Admirals Club membership which also includes access to certain partner lounges (you can see the list of lounges here). Authorized users get Admirals Club access but aren't able to enter partner lounges or get discounts on meeting rooms or other promotions like full membership confers.

I've got a friend who has the Citi / AAdvantage Executive because he flies on American Airlines for work a couple of times a month so the perks are more than worth it for him. He's added a few (trusted) coworkers who travel similarly to his account as authorized users and they all enjoy the benefits of Admirals Club access without having to pay for a membership beyond the card's annual fee.

Bottom line

The fact that the Citi / AAdvantage Executive doesn't charge a fee for up to 10 authorized users is wildly generous. The card can potentially save you several thousand dollars on Admirals Club lounge access depending on how many authorized users you add. This is one of the biggest credit card benefit sweet spots in the game.

From setting your own schedule to avoiding crowded airports there’s a lot to like about flying private. If you’re looking for ways to get the most out of your private jet flight bookings we’ve got you covered.

Here’s how to use credit card points to cut the cost of private jets how to earn points and miles from flying private and how to score the most points and miles from your flight.

While there are a lot of perks to flying private scoring free flights using points and miles isn’t one of them. Private jet service providers seemingly have enough demand that none have gone to the trouble to launch and operate a loyalty program.

At least so far. Wheels Up—one of the largest private jet providers—has teased that it’s working on a loyalty program that it expects to launch in summer 2021.

Until then there’s one primary way to use points and miles for private jets: redeeming points for cash back you can then apply toward your travels. Several credit cards let travelers redeem points earned through spending to cover purchases—either as a statement credit or to “erase” eligible purchases.

That said you still have a number of options to maximize your private jet experience using your credit card perks.

American Express is the clear leader in the points-for-private-jets race. For example you can jet around Africa on an ultra-luxury private jet safari with Micato Safari. Or you can book all-inclusive around-the-world trips on private jets through TCS World Travel.

Eligible American Express cardholders can book through the Gold Card Destinations or Platinum Destinations programs for additional travel perks. By doing so you could earn bonus Membership Rewards and get a $100 shipboard credit or instant savings for bookings costing $3000 or more. Plus you can redeem American Express Membership Rewards to offset the trip.

Although there are limited options to redeem miles for private jet flights there are a number of ways to earn points and miles from flying private.

As mentioned above Wheels Up is the wild card here. The company has a partnership with Delta Airlines and is expected to allow reciprocal benefits including the ability to redeem Delta Skymiles for Wheels Up flights in mid-2021. This news is particularly interesting because Delta is an American Express Membership Rewards program partner meaning that you could potentially use Membership Rewards points for Wheels Up flights soon.

Delta used to offer travelers its own fleet of private jets through a service called Delta Private Jets. For years SkyMiles members could redeem 2.5 million SkyMiles for $25000 in credits toward booking travel on Delta’s fleet of private jets.

That came to an end in January 2020 when Delta Private Jets merged into Wheels Up. This merger ended the ability to redeem SkyMiles for private jet flights—at least for now. But you can still score Delta benefits for purchasing Wheels Up flights.

You can earn up to 50000 SkyMiles for joining Wheels Up and up to 25000 SkyMiles each year you renew. The number of miles you get depends on the level of membership tier you choose.

JSX (formerly known as JetSuiteX) is a public charter airline that offers many of the benefits of flying private. You’ll avoid the crowded airport terminals and depart out of a private terminal. Onboard you’ll get business class legroom free snacks and drinks and two checked bags.

Unlike arranging for your own private charter flights JSX flights operate on a set schedule and you may have to share the ride with other passengers. With that said there’s one massive advantage to JSX: the cost. Depending on the route and how far out you book flights can cost as little as $99 each way. That makes a luxury experience competitive with prices on low-cost airlines.

JSX doesn’t have its own loyalty program. Instead it partners with JetBlue to offer TrueBlue points to frequent flyers. The earning chart is simple. You’ll earn 150 TrueBlue points from cheaper “Hop On” fares and 250 TrueBlue points for “All In” fares. But unfortunately you can’t redeem TrueBlue points for JSX flights.

Carrying the right credit card is important no matter how you travel. However it’s especially important if you plan to fly private. By carrying the right credit card you can score discounts and perks on private jet bookings. Plus you can rack up plenty of points and miles from spending.

One of the perks American Express offers to some premium cardholders is access to their Premium Private Jet Program. This program offers a 3 percent promotional discount on flight charges in-flight catering credits and car service transfer credits on Delta Private Jets charter flights booked through Platinum Travel Services.

If you opt to purchase a Jet Card you can pay a reduced entry purchase of $50000—instead of the standard $150000—and you’ll get a 3 percent bonus added to your Jet Card.

In addition to booking private jets you can use this Jet Card to book select fares on Delta commercial flights with a 20 percent discount. Plus you’ll get Delta SkyMiles Diamond Medallion elite status for all Jet Card purchases of $100000 as long as your Jet Card remains active and carries a balance.

Although Delta Private Jets merged into Wheels Up in January 2020 this discount is still available to eligible cardholders that book through Amex’s Platinum Travel Services.

Credit card rewards can help you offset the high cost of flying private through statement credits. Plus you can use some premium credit cards to score special perks and discounts on private jet bookings.

Women running their own companies? We love to see it. In our monthly series Small Business Spotlight we chat with independent fashion beauty and lifestyle entrepreneurs about their journey to be-your-own-boss status. Here tips for raising funds developing a marketing strategy navigating social media and more—straight from women who have done it themselves.



Yowie was a “nights and weekends” project Shannon Maldonado started while working as a designer for American Eagle and later at Urban Outfitters after she returned to her hometown of Philadelphia. Then came the moment when she “hit a wall creatively” and left her corporate job to focus on her creative studio and lifestyle boutique. Five years later she has big plans for keeping her business small and local while expanding the space. No matter what she'll stay true to her core as a Philly-centric platform for small businesses and creatives as well as a light source in the local community.

Beyond the store Maldonado is also in her stride taking on other design and consulting projects and collaborating with fellow creatives like Telsha Anderson owner of the fashion concept store t.a. Today the two are launching a resin sculpture in partnership with American Express and NTWRK a mobile-first video shopping platform. Maldonado and Anderson met on Instagram swapping stories and sharing advice on being female business owners; they say they were thrilled to come together on a special project in support of small minority-owned businesses. That is the energy Maldonado continues to generate with Yowie.

On Going Back Home

I quit my job like a month into Yowie without a real plan to be totally honest. I had saved some money but I wasn’t quite sure where I'd land. I moved back to Philly and was ready to do it here. I knew at the time [that there wasn't]—and there still isn’t—anything like us here and it would be really fun to challenge myself to go back to my hometown re-learn the city and also open a really interesting space that doesn’t exist yet. It’s been awesome I’m so happy we did it here.

On Turning the Side Hustle into the Main Hustle

I was freelancing at Urban Outfitters and I felt like I was living a double life. At that point I had a storefront and people would come into my store on the weekends and say ‘Wait don’t you work at Urban? What are you doing here?’ And I would say ‘This is my store.’ And they were like ‘Well then what are you doing there?’ And I was like ‘I don’t really know! I got to figure this out!’ So I was trying to straddle both fences. I wasn’t quite ready to leave fashion it was something I wanted to do my whole life. I went to FIT and it was my dream to be a fashion designer. But [working at Urban Outfitters] I couldn’t really devote enough energy to growing Yowie. I was about 18 to 20 months in and I remember talking my one of my best friends and he was like ‘Did you move to Philly to work at Urban Outfitters or did you move to Philly to start a brand?’ And I was like ‘I moved to Philly to start a brand.’ And he said ‘Then get out of there! Go focus on your brand and you’ll figure it out.’ I was still juggling other freelance [jobs] to make it work and I still do other projects outside of the shop.

On Putting Yourself Out There

It was super scary. Being a designer is all I know. I wasn’t trained as a curator art designer or interior designer all things [Yowie does] now so I mean it’s still scary putting ourselves out there. I was so used to being an anonymous designer working for bigger brands so now I feel like I’m standing out there naked in front of everyone like ‘These are things I like…I hope you like them too.’ Taking a bet on yourself is scary but also exhilarating at the same time. I have an amazing community of friends and my family is super supportive and everyone is rooting for me [on] the sidelines and even on the days when I’m maybe not sure myself of what’s going to happen next.

On What She’s Learned

I think my greatest lesson during this time is that we can never be static. I’ve always thought of my brand as being in this constant beta mode. We test things all the time and some were really successful and others that were mmm...not so great. But we learn something from it or it was fun to do. So I think more than ever—since the pandemic started—always be ready to evolve. We pivoted back to being online and did workshops and online coffee meetings with customers who were looking for advice. We just tried to keep it really personal and keep that connection since we weren’t able to have those in-person visits. I feel like within two months our sales kind of stabilized. Vulnerability has always been a really big part of my brand and just being really open about my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way.

On Standing Out

I try to lead with some kind of humility [with regards to] what’s happening and am always sharing our platform with other people. We constantly try to raise money for local organizations and causes that we care about. And just being really human in a sea of DTC brands and huge big box stores; we want to feel really small. Being small and being niche is our strength instead of trying to be something for everyone.

On Collaborating

I got connected to the project through Telsha Anderson [the owner of t.a.]. Before Yowie most of my friends were childhood friends or friends I met through friends or ex-boyfriends and now it’s expanded my friend group through the internet and social media; I have so many social media friends. So Telsha was someone I quickly bonded with being female business owners kind of figuring it out. I love that her brand is so youthful and playful but still elevated and we connected on a personal level. So when she called me for [the American Express] project I was like ‘Yeah I’m totally in that sounds really interesting.’ I loved that American Express was trying to really support small businesses at a very important time. We’re very very fortunate that we were able to pivot to survive and even grow last year.

On the Future of Yowie

In the short term we are in the procress purchasing a building in our neighborhood and becoming a mixed-use space. So we’ll have an expanded Yowie store a cafe of some kind and 10 to 12 hotel rooms that are Yowie-designed and branded above our store. I’ve fallen in love with hospitality through some of the design projects we’ve worked on with other people so the idea of a Yowie hotel is so exciting. Long term I want us to be woven into the culture of Philadelphia. I want people to be really proud that the brand grew here and we’re not expanding outside of Philadelphia. We do pop-up’s here and there but our feet are cemented in Philly.

But US intervention in Afghanistan far predates the 21st century stretching back decades.

In the weeks and months ahead there are going to be a lot of questions about what’s next for Afghanistan including how the US approaches it. But contemplating what happens going forward also means looking at the past including the ways American involvement has shaped Afghan politics and life for more than 50 years.

During the Cold War both the US and the Soviet Union sought to gain footholds in Afghanistan first through infrastructure investments and then military intervention. Once they withdrew in the late 1980s the country entered a civil war — a backdrop to the rise of the Taliban. And while the US took a back seat in Afghanistan during much of the ’90s it invaded after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and undertook a two-decade project for which the underlying mission would evolve. Now President Joe Biden has finally pulled American troops out of Afghanistan but the two nations are still intertwined.

I recently spoke with Ali A. Olomi a historian of the Middle East and Islam at Penn State Abington about the long storied history of US meddling in Afghanistan and how it has shaped the country and people’s lives there. Olomi who is the host of the podcast Head on History discussed the US’s funding of some factions of the mujahedeen or Afghan guerrilla fighters during the 1970s and ’80s; America’s rolling reasoning for its involvement in Afghanistan post-2001; and whether the US even without soldiers present is really gone.

Our conversation edited for length and clarity is below.

A lot of people date US intervention in Afghanistan to 2001. But is that the right place to start?

The actuality is that the United States was involved all the way back in the 1950s. Afghanistan was going through a series of modernizing projects and it attempted to really build into a modern nation-state under two subsequent leaders: first King Zahir Shah and then followed by his cousin who overthrew him President Mohammad Daoud Khan. And it was right in the midst of the Cold War.

Both the Soviet Union and the United States were involved in Afghanistan namely through infrastructure building. The Soviet Union really built what’s known as the Salang Tunnel which connected northern Afghanistan to Kabul. The United States was involved in what was known as the Helmand Valley project which was an irrigation project and agricultural project about building dams in southern Afghanistan. It had been funneling a significant amount of money from the ’50s and ’60s on.

There was a lot of money coming from both of these big great powers in Afghanistan. And that really sets the stage for what eventually becomes a more formal military relationship to the country.

And where does the military relationship start? The 1970s?

Yes. In the ’70s the United States is at first quite hesitant to support any type of military expansion.

Daoud Khan starts to ally himself more and more with the Soviet Union. He tries to establish a friendly relationship. He has a very famous phrase that he uses: “I feel happiest when I light my American cigarette with Soviet matches.” That really speaks to his attempt to leverage his really weird uncomfortable Cold War relationship. But his allying with the Soviet Union makes the United States very very nervous.

Things get even worse in 1978 when Daoud Khan is formally overthrown in what’s known as the Saur Revolution and a Marxist-Leninist government is established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Here the United States starts to slowly funnel money toward some resistance groups. It doesn’t have a unified policy. It’s not like okay we need to start a resistance movement to overthrow this communist government. It has a little bit of a muddled approach.

There were some in the [US] government like former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski who was very interested in getting involved. There were other military leaders that thought if we get involved that’s going to force the Soviet Union to get involved. And so they have a bit of a mixed bag approach. But they do start to agitate quite early on in 1978 and in 1979 they are funneling money to Pakistan’s intelligence services who are then funneling it into the hands of the resistance. That does eventually induce a Soviet invasion.

The US was actually involved a little before the Soviets invaded. Once they got invaded then the United States throws its full backing. It goes from meddling and funneling and agitating to outright saying “Okay we need to support the mujahedeen” and allying themselves with the anti-communist resistance movement.

In the Cold War the US backs Afghan reactionaries to fight a Soviet-friendly regime

And just to be clear what is the mujahedeen?

The mujahedeen is a sort of resistance movement that emerges in response to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The People’s Democratic Republic party is wildly wildly repressive which as a result produces a good deal of resistance.

Now we should note that it’s also a really progressive government. This is a government that expands women’s rights it extends literacy it builds agricultural reforms in the economy. But at the same time they’re also disappearing people. There are people who are like hey I can finally find a job and other people who are like wait a minute we have health care. But if you spoke up against the government there were chances that you’d be thrown in jail arrested disappeared. As a result of that repressive component there were pockets of resistance that have been growing.

The mujahedeen are not a single group. We often talk about the mujahedeen as one group but [they were] actually four different kinds of groups that roughly align as resisting this new oppressive repressive government.

The first is the more organized. There is the Islamist faction led by people like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who is trained in the sort of jihadist ideology; he’d like to see an Islamic government. He’s a really regressive retrograde reactionary figure. In fact even before the Soviet invasion he carried out a series of horrific acid attacks against women.

This is a very unsavory character. And he happens to be one of the more organized groups allied with the more moderate Ahmad Shah Massoud who’s not carrying out acid attacks. He’s not regressive. He is much more interested in a sort of egalitarian vision of an Islamic republic one with representative rather than this kind of autocratic rule. And yet despite these ideological differences these two people ally themselves or at least align in opposition to communist government.

There’s also leftists as part of the mujahedeen; Maoists and leftists who have been disaffected by this government who felt that they weren’t being heard or being repressed. And the mujahedeen is also made up of the Communist Party’s own military commanders a group of young military commanders who defect from the government.

Then the fourth and final group are just ordinary people — people that just pick up arms and fight and resist. They don’t have an ideology. They don’t have any particular vision of what the government is supposed to look like or what the government is supposed to do. They just realize that wait a minute this government is oppressive or they’re changing things in a way that they’re not happy with and they resist. This movement is a little slower. Once the Soviets invade this group of ordinary people will grow dramatically and this is the bulk of the mujahedeen.

We’re talking about a coalition of groups with different aims different goals that only align when the Soviets are there. Once the Soviets are gone this group will turn amongst itself and we will see the civil war of the ’90s.

What was the US’s involvement with those different groups?

The US involvement is uneven. The US isn’t just funding mujahedeen. There’s an oversimplification that happens sometimes in this discourse partly as a result of the US’s own claims. Brzezinski very proudly pats himself on the back and says “We created the mujahedeen.” But he says this after the fact. In reality when we look at the archives that’s not true. [The US] exploits the mujahedeen. They definitely use the mujahedeen to their advantage. And they do funnel money through Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). But that money is mostly going into the hands of the more organized groups of the mujahedeen.

Ordinary people aren’t receiving training from the CIA or Pakistan’s ISI. They’re just ordinary people who have guns in their houses pick up their guns and fight. But unfortunately the more organized groups are those reactionary elements. It’s people like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who is an Islamist who is quite dangerous who does receive funds who does receive some form of training.

You even have CIA documents that complain that the Afghans are very hard to train because they operate on a different sense of time that they won’t organize in the same way that the US military will organize. Anyone who’s familiar with Middle Eastern culture Central Asian culture or Indian culture knows that if you go to a wedding that says it starts at 7 pm it’ll start at 9 pm. There’s a similar experience with the mujahedeen: They tell mujahedeen hey we’re going to start at 0800 and they’ll do it on their own time.

But it is to these more reactionary elements that the US allies itself. And in fact it makes some really horrific blunders. One of the things that the US ends up doing is that it pressures Egypt to release a group of Islamists that it had arrested. And one of the Islamists that was arrested in Egypt and then is released is Ayman al-Zawahiri who happens to be the second-in-command of al-Qaeda.

The US inadvertently imports him — and we don’t have the full picture so it could very easily have been intentional as an attempt to bolster the mujahedeen by bringing in foreign fighters. But they start to bring in what are known as the Arab Afghans or the Arab mujahedeen and these are people from Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood these are people from Yemen people from Saudi Arabia who then go on to form al-Qaeda.

There is a relationship here in which the US through funneling money to ISI Pakistan’s intelligence services either inadvertently or intentionally ends up funding a group of foreign fighters who ally with the more organized elements of the mujahedeen. The consequence of that will be that once the US and the Soviet Union withdraw their influence Afghanistan falls into a civil war. And in that civil war both al-Qaeda will be born and the Taliban.

The unintended consequence of that meddling is chaos. And that chaos will give us al-Qaeda and the Taliban both of whom have American training manuals some American funds and American guns all that they received funneled through Pakistan’s ISI. And now the CIA says “Oops. We’ve just allowed these groups to take form because we took our eye off of Afghanistan.”

After the Cold War a civil war brings the Taliban to power

Once the Soviet Union withdraws and there’s a civil war in Afghanistan is the US still present during that time? Like during the ’90s?

The Soviet Union and the United States both sign an agreement or at least they are the guarantors of this agreement known as the Geneva Accords. It’s technically between Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the United States agrees that we will no longer fund the mujahedeen or at least that one group of the mujahedeen and the Soviet Union agrees that they will withdraw. The Soviet Union does formally withdraw. It leaves no real support for its former allies the government. And the United States continues to funnel some money but it mostly turns away.

The result is that within three years the government collapses and the civil war emerges between these old and mujahedeen factions who again like I mentioned are completely different with very different visions. It’s in that moment that the United States is not involved the Soviet Union’s not involved. In fact the former Soviet Union ambassador will actually blast the United States and the Soviet Union and say “We meddled in Afghanistan and then we stopped paying attention.”

It is hidden in that language of “stopped paying attention” that really speaks to what ends up happening. A power vacuum is created and into that vacuum will step the civil war. From that civil war will be born the Taliban who emerged as a completely new actor. They’re the second generation that grew up in refugee camps in Pakistan — Afghans were born in refugee camps raised in refugee camps. They arrived fresh onto the scene. They intervene into this civil war are able to exploit it and therefore establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in 1996-’97.

The US invades after 9/11 without clear goals. The Taliban wait out the long war.

How long were the Taliban in control? Until 2001?

The Taliban exerts its authority through most of Afghanistan not all of it. Unlike now where they seem to have extended their control to everywhere other than the Panjshir Valley. In the ’90s they only controlled from Kandahar to Kabul both Herat and the North did resist quite a bit.

Herat will eventually fall but the North — led again by the Panjshir Valley and Ahmad Shah Massoud and what would eventually become known as the United Front or the Northern Alliance — they will have their own autonomous territory that the Taliban will never conquer. So Afghanistan will kind of be split between the Northern Alliance in the North and the Taliban who establish the Islamic Emirate. And only a few countries will recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan — Pakistan Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But they fall in 2001 relatively quickly.

And that’s after the US invades?

The US starts actually through a bombing campaign and the Taliban really collapses there. The Taliban doesn’t have air support there’s no Taliban air force. And so they actually pursued peace quite early on.

In October 2001 they offer to hand over Osama bin Laden in return for an end to the bombing campaign. The Bush administration at the time didn’t accept it and a formal invasion is undertaken. The offer was rejected because the Taliban wanted to hand him over to a third party and for a trial. The US also viewed their mission as “ending a safe haven for terror” so invasion was explicitly part of the plans.

The Taliban just completely vanish and become a small insurgency group that lives mostly in mountains. Some of them try to escape into hiding in Pakistan some of them end up in pockets in Kandahar some of them are in safe houses. But they’re no longer a sort of organized unified group. They’re no longer in government.

They’re just pockets of insurgency allied with al-Qaeda. They won’t really emerge until the mid-2010s where they are much more organized and seem to have received more money than they ever had. There’s some estimates that we’re looking at billions of dollars. Somehow in the process they were defeated they went away and hid and kind of built a spate of an economic base through extortion and drug trafficking. They were reorganized in the 2010s and emerged as once more a sort of unified political movement.

To back up a bit and I feel odd asking this but why did the US even go to Afghanistan in 2001? Because of al-Qaeda? Because of bin Laden? I feel like we all sort of know this and we don’t.

Ostensibly the reason was first some form of justice against Osama bin Laden some form of revenge that we need to get him for what he did for 9/11. But there was also a language of liberation that was woven into it. And that was more of an addition a post-hoc after-the-fact justification. The main justification was to go after Osama bin Laden. Once the Taliban collapses and they say “Hey we’ll hand over Osama bin Laden” a sort of new justification had to be invented. And that was we need to nation-build we need to build Afghanistan up.

What we can see of the internal discussions between former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former Vice President Cheney and former President George W. Bush the argument or justification for why they want to nation-build is one so that they can create a pro-American government a foothold in the region and therefore are able to extend American bases. And two so that they can therefore create a nation-state that’s favorable to the United States and would not allow terror bases to ever take root there again.

The justification was that it was to prevent future attacks but it was also about extending American military bases and allowing more bases to be built there and therefore extending American military might.

Part of the strength of the American military has always been the ability to deploy quickly. If you have to deploy from the United States that’s going to take time. This is one of the reasons we have aircraft carriers in various parts of the ocean; it’s why we build the bases in places like Djibouti. And the United States thinks in those terms. So the ability to build bases is a very important aspect of invading Afghanistan — build American bases make an American-friendly government or at least allow it to take root there.

Technically the US could have accepted the surrender accepted Osama bin Laden and that’s it. Justice is served right? Put Osama bin Laden on trial or execute him or whatever. But going further by invading was an attempt to extend American influence in that region.

That’s where the United States got involved in I think a bit of a quagmire because not only did it not know how to build the infrastructure or the democratic institutions but more importantly it flooded Afghanistan with money that often went into the hands of military contractors and advisers and all these different segments — even warlords — who all got really rich off of American dollars.

Afghan society never really got any of those benefits. The economic disparity was still real. There was no real social mobility; jobs were incredibly hard to come by. So yeah you develop Kabul with new skyscrapers and maybe you have a couple KFCs there but the rural parts of Afghanistan remain neglected. And that in many ways is the great failure of the United States’ invasion.

A failed rebuilding and the US withdraws once more. But is this the end?

How has the United States’ involvement in Afghanistan shaped life for the people there?

I think that in one instance it did offer an opportunity to think of the future in a different way. There was a sense of hopelessness with the Taliban. I think post-2001 there is a great sense of energy and excitement and opportunity that does open up when we’re talking about people who are thinking about becoming engineers or journalists or going into government. So there is a great activity of optimism and an attempt to really reform society.

Also it is coupled with a very real contradiction of that that the United States was a major aggressor still. The United States wasn’t just in Afghanistan it was carrying out a droning campaign. And so young Afghans would grow up with the experience of okay I can go to school today something I may not have been able to do under the Taliban. But that also means that if the skies are blue I might get droned.

So they had to live in this really precarious frustrated environment where yes there was some really great progress some really great strides things opening up. But simultaneously they were recognizing and acknowledging the fact that the US was still at war carrying out bombing campaigns. The government that was set up was precarious at best corrupt at worst. And so there was a real complicated feeling.

I speak to Afghans I have family there and they’ll tell you that there’s a lot of great and beautiful things jobs and opportunities. But there’s also the real sense that an American tank is just going to roll down your street that if you unfortunately move in a certain way nervous troops are going to fire on you because they think you have a bomb they think that you are part of al-Qaeda.

That anxiety was real. Afghans felt occupied while simultaneously also seeing that there were these different changes in society that there was a transformation taking place. And that tension was very real for them — the experience of occupation and the experience of change and transformation.

How do you describe the situation now? I mean I don’t know how to describe the situation now.

Nobody does; you’re not alone. Experts don’t know how to describe this situation. It’s a bizarre moment. We don’t know what the formal policy toward Afghanistan will be. There is obviously a military withdrawal but will the United States normalize the relationship with the Taliban? Will the former enemies suddenly become a government?

We know that they’re thinking of blocking the money so there’s that element of it. But what happens if most of the countries in the world recognize the Taliban as the rightful leaders of Afghanistan even if Afghans themselves don’t? The majority of Afghans despise the Taliban; they’re universally hated across ethnic groups and political spectrums. But what happens with the de facto relationship that’s going to be? The United States allied itself with all sorts of unsavory governments — Saudi Arabia right? What is that relationship going to be? Nobody knows.

It seems that the military engagement at least in terms of troops is going to end but it doesn’t necessarily mean that droning is going to end. So the Afghan experience of death from above is going to continue. In fact President Joe Biden made it very openly clear that he will continue to use America’s Air Force to “degrade the terrorists” which is a code for drone warfare. The continuation of drones in Afghanistan means that while US troops might be gone US presence might be gone the threat of US military is still there.

We also don’t know what the US’s commitments are to ordinary Afghans. Will they now be willing to take more refugees? The answer is yes so far but there’s no real talk about really raising the cap of dealing with things like the visa process which is a complete quagmire a labyrinthine process that is impossible to navigate. An Afghan who’s been cut off from the internet how are they supposed to navigate that process?

There are no answers just questions that have been raised by what is going on. There’s also the real anxiety that Afghanistan may fall into an outright civil war within a matter of years. What happens there? Do we stand by and watch a humanitarian crisis unfold? I think the universal feeling among most Afghans — and I should be careful not to speak for every Afghan — but there is a sort of acceptance that US withdrawal is a good thing. But what is the US going to do after is a crucial question that needs to be answered. And it is not being answered yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC11cy1jYW5hZGEtNTgyNzMzMjLSATVodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtdXMtY2FuYWRhLTU4MjczMzIyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wuhan lab leak theory: How Fort Detrick became a centre for Chinese conspiracies,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzgvMjEvYWZnaGFuLWFtZXJpY2Fucy13b3JrLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtdGhlaXItZGlhc3BvcmEtY29tbXVuaXR50gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzgvMjEvYWZnaGFuLWFtZXJpY2Fucy13b3JrLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtdGhlaXItZGlhc3BvcmEtY29tbXVuaXR5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Afghan Americans scramble to support diaspora,"Sayed* has not slept in days. His nights are filled with frantic messages from friends and family and his days are filled speaking to the media and lobbying California’s congresspeople by phone email and trips to their offices.

“This is a very dark day not only for Afghanistan but for the international community” said Sayed the organiser of an Afghan community group in Sacramento California.

Across the United States Afghan Americans like Sayed are going through much of the same as they watch their country crumble from afar.

“All of their achievements and sacrifices whether it was human life sacrifices or humanitarian assistance all of the lives and money cost within 20 years of the struggle to build a country from scratch it’s all gone in the middle of one night. It’s incredible and shocking and embarrassing for the international community” says Sayed whose mother brother and other relatives are still in Afghanistan after his resettlement in the US in 2015 thanks to his work with USAID. “People are desperate fleeing in the middle of the night with bags full of cash.”

Arash Azizzada – a co-founder of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow a group of progressive Afghan diaspora organisers working for peace in Afghanistan – predicted the country’s current events months ago when he co-wrote an opinion piece for Newsweek in April.

“We knew that Afghan folks would find themselves in a predicament because we knew the US was not acting in good faith and was looking for ways out – they’ve been doing this across administrations” he told Al Jazeera. “Now the diaspora community here in the US and across the globe are creating ad hoc networks of support trying to triage and focus on evacuations first and foremost advocating for keeping the airport running.”

Azizzada emphasises the wide array of people – from members of the LGBTQ community to those who fought for women’s rights and spoke out against the Taliban crimes – who are at risk amid the US forces’ withdrawal.

“The US and the international community spent roughly 20 years saying ‘Hey break barriers be bold and daring take a risk. Don’t worry this is democracy this is how it works’ and now they’ve totally abandoned every single person they promised not to leave behind” he says.

Azizzada says he and fellow members of the diaspora community are spending more than 20 hours a day speaking to the media to highlight the plight of those back home. “We’re on WhatsApp Slack Signal sharing as much information as possible about possible evacuation routes about how to get cash out at banks and figuring out the refugee process. Everyone is getting a crash course in becoming an immigration expert because that’s currently what it takes.”

Azizzada wants the US and the international community to drop visa requirements and other regulations that prevent people from resettling outside of Afghanistan and to “deal with the humanitarian crisis that is slowly unravelling which will cost countless lives of everyday Afghans”.

He wants the US government to establish a crisis hotline but does not feel optimistic because “they’re unable to even facilitate the safety of the airport” he says.

Sara Noorzay is the former operations director of the Afghan American Community Organization and current organiser with the Afghan American Coalition an alliance of groups advocating for assistance for Afghans both within Afghanistan and those seeking refuge in the US in response to the current crisis.

“We need the power of coming together with one single unified voice of what our stance is and what our demands are of the Biden administration” she says. “As the diaspora community mobilised and we saw people across the US taking a more active role we thought it was necessary for us to create a hub of information.”

Noorzay’s coalition has developed a script for people to use when calling their local congress members and a list of four specific calls to action for the US government: prioritising emergency evacuations for Afghans; expanding and expediting the visa process for P-1 P-2 and special immigrant visas (SIVs); immediately delivering humanitarian aid; and increasing the annual refugee allocation by 100000 and reassessing the number based on need in the future.

The central problem with the P-2 visa is that applicants have to be in a country outside of Afghanistan to apply which is not safe or feasible. Plus as embassies have been closing in the country it is nearly impossible for Afghans to acquire the paperwork they need to apply.

“Over the last few days we’ve seen reports of flights that are leaving nearly empty because there’s not safe passage to the airport” she says. “[Kabul] is chaos and outside of that the Taliban are intimidating and terrorising people who have been approved to leave to the US along the route to the airport. We’re hearing reports of men women and children being physically assaulted on the way to the airport. There aren’t nearly enough flights and it’s not safe or logistically possible for people to get to them.”

Noorzay says the majority of the requests that her group receives from members of the diaspora community are related to how to help get loved ones out of Afghanistan and how they can be most useful to aid efforts which is why they created the script for contacting government representatives.

She tells people asking how they can help to contact their congresspeople and other representatives by phone or email. “You’re a constituent of these people. Make sure they know what we’re asking for and what our demands are” she says.

In the meantime many Afghans remain worried and desperate.

It’s a picture that went viral and stunned people around the world earlier this week: Approximately 820 Afghan refugees packed aboard a US military C-17 plane. Men women and children all huddled together as they escape Taliban rule for a new life in the United States.

As Americans watch Afghans desperately flee their country groups that provide services for refugees are scrambling to help them.

Since President Joe Biden announced in April that the US would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan refugee advocates have urged the federal government to speed up the immigration process to ensure as many Afghan evacuees as possible can get out safely and quickly.

Getting visas for Afghans trying to leave the country will likely be a lengthy procedure one that in this case will mostly require Special Immigrant Visas or SIVs.

It’s unclear how many Afghans will arrive in the US. The International Refugee Assistance Project estimated on Wednesday that some 100000 Afghan SIV applicants and their families are eligible to relocate to the US.

Roughly 2000 Afghan refugees have relocated so far a majority to Fort Lee Virginia. Additionally there are 20000 SIV applicants in the pipeline with about 10000 of those at the beginning stages of the process according to the State Department.

The influx of Afghans comes after years of record low admittance caps in the US which some experts say leaves the system unprepared for this expected wave of evacuees.

Now refugee support groups dealing with what they say is a weak immigration system health advisories and a slow visas process are working around the clock to prepare for a traumatized population that will need help adjusting to their new home.

Refugee support groups working around the clock

Lutheran Social Services National Capital Area (LSSNCA) a refugee and immigrant resettlement group that serves the Washington DC Maryland and Virginia area has already welcomed 68 Afghan families about 300 people according to CEO Kristyn Peck. The group is expecting roughly 160 more people in the next 10 days.

Peck believes that most Afghan evacuees will filter in through Fort Lee for SIV-completion purposes. She says they will ultimately settle in the DC metro area because many of them helped the US government with their missions abroad and have a connection to the country’s capital.

“We’ve been serving Afghan refugees with SIVs since 2002” Peck said. “Last year we served 500 in a year this year we will have served 500 in the month of August alone.”

The group scaled down their operation significantly during the Trump administration Peck says and has had to scale it back up very quickly.

While the work has proved challenging Peck says the LSSNCA has welcomed the help of more than 1500 volunteers. It has also received 200 boxes of donations.

Many organizations told CNN that they too have received an overwhelming number of volunteers in the last two weeks.

“The interest has completely spiked in the last few days” said Holly Taines White a senior director at Jewish Family & Community Services East Bay (JFCS) which serves people in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Several hundred people have filled out our volunteer form and there is an explosion of people donating furniture and household items.”

Housing one of top priorities

One of Taines White’s biggest concerns is the pace of family arrivals. Finding them affordable housing she says is another problem. While JFCS has built relationships with property owners Taines White says available affordable housing is very limited.

In some instances the group will temporarily get families an Airbnb. Smaller groups are housed with volunteers she says.

Welcome Home a community group in Jersey City New Jersey has also found it difficult securing housing for Afghan families.

“It’s very chaotic” said Alain Mehta executive director of Welcome Home. “It’s a tough housing market to begin with and rent is high but we’ve been trying to capitalize on uninhabited religious spaces like parsonages.”

The organization has been in talks with partner resettlement organizations about Afghan evacuees since January and its members have been calling US senators to issue more SIVs.

“Months passed nothing changed and now you can turn on the news and see what’s going on in Kabul” said Mentha.

Welcome Home is relying on donations and volunteers to ramp up its operations ahead of receiving Afghan evacuees according to Mentha.

Housing is important but it’s not the only priority.

Helping Afghan refugees adjust to their new environment by providing English classes job training and placement and teaching them how to ride public transport are all essential.

Many come in family units and may be reunited with already settled family. But others have no connections says Russel Smith CEO of Refugee Services of Texas.

“We do anything to get them acclimated” Smith said. That includes access to government services healthcare and employment services.

RST saw seven families arrive last weekend and it expects at least 100 more families once travel arrangements are figured out.

Taines White emphasized that many refugees are deeply traumatized and need mental health care as they’ve “literally feared for their lives for years.”

“I’ve heard stories from some of these people saying that they’ve kept kids indoor for a couple of years” she said. “And for a very good reason. All of them have had threats on their lives. They’ve seen their friends and families killed.”

‘They need to be here because of the actions our country took’

Michael Breen CEO of advocacy group Human Rights First said the US has a responsibility to its Afghan allies.

“As a veteran I can say I owe my life to our Afghan allies” he said Wednesday during a press call. “It’s not just interpreters. There are so many people who risked their lives – children families – to keep us safe. And for 20 years American veterans looked our allies in the eyes and made those promises wearing the cloth of the nation.”

Taines White echoed this notion. She also expressed concern over anti-immigrant sentiment in the US.

“Our country has an obligation to help these people be safe. They are in danger because they worked along our military or embassy” she said. “We have a moral obligation to take care of them. They need to be here because of actions our country took.”

Austin population is booming but

can we sustain our quality of life?

Re: Aug. 13 article ""Austin's population slides in under 1M after another decade of remarkable growth census data shows.""

Economists and developers are probably cheering at the current growth rate of the population in Central Texas. At the current growth rate the population of Austin would double in 22 years.

If one projects this growth forward the implications can be truly frightening. Our quality of life is already suffering and sustainability will continue to be an elusive goal unless this trend can be slowed.

What if true sustainability requires a stable population? We are so far from that goal. All the technology in the world won’t save us unless we can solve this ultimate challenge to mankind.

Twenty years of loss in Afghanistan

has ended. U.S. should be pleased.

President Biden has been criticized for pulling U.S. Forces from Afghanistan as he promised to do. A number of presidents have said they would pull out of Afghanistan but failed to deliver.

History has proven that several world powers met with failure trying to control Afghanistan prior to the U.S. attempt. After 20 years of loss of American lives and spending billions of dollars there was no end in sight for the U.S. Our efforts to build an Afghanistan military to protect the country from the Taliban was a complete failure. Our Afghan-trained military surrendered their arms without a fight after U.S. troops left the country.

The U.S. tried to save Afghanistan and failed. We should be pleased that this 20-year loss of life and money in Afghanistan has finally ended.

Abandoning Afghanistan sets

the stage for deaths loss of trust

It's Monday about 3:30 p.m. and I have just heard our brave and patriotic Joe Biden read another heroic speech explaining his actions in Afghanistan. This guy doesn't know ""come here"" from ""sic 'em!""

Our 20-year presence was too long but our leaving is throwing many Afghani helpers under the bus. We abandoned these poor souls left billions of dollars of weapons and equipment behind and have set the stage for many deaths. So much for loyalty.

Biden hasn't a clue of what he has created. Our allies will wonder about our loyalties and commitments. Our security here at home is facing outside challenges to go along with our homeland challenges and our current political division.

Joe Biden is about as presidential as I am capable of winning the U.S. Open golf tournament!

Calling on his fellow teens to get the

vaccine for a safer return to school

Younger people need to be vaccinated if Americans want to look forward to a future with any resemblance of pre-pandemic life.

As most teens are hopeful to return back to school the rise of the delta variant spoils these dreams.

Teens are missing their social lives and their mental health is declining over the course of the pandemic. By being vaccinated it will be safer to return to school and to give all students an opportunity to receive a quality education.

I am calling on my fellow teens to get their vaccines right now. Our future depends on us and with new variants of the coronavirus emerging the call has never been more desperate.

Isle of Capri Casino has been renamed Horseshoe Casino Lake Charles following Thursday’s approval by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. The new identity brings with it a series of improvements to revamp the hurricane-battered riverboat casino property into a state-of-the-art land-based facility that is expected to open by the fall of 2022.

Officials with Caesars Entertainment Isle of Capri’s parent company said in a news release that the plans subject to gaming control board approval call for more than 60000 square feet of casino space; nearly 1000 slot machines and table games; a World Series of Poker Room with 10 poker tables; a Sportsbook location for sports betting; a renovated 250-plus room tower hotel; and new restaurants.

The gaming board heard an update on the project from Dan Real Caesars south regional president and Jeff Favre Isle of Capri general manager. Real spoke of the long 18 months that included the COVID-19 pandemic followed by the destructive Hurricane Laura last August and Hurricane Delta last October. The hurricanes essentially put any renovation work on hold for months.

“It’s been very difficult” he said. “Seeing our team members back in Lake Charles gives us a lot of hope to get this property up and running again. We’re very proud of the project we’re putting together.”

Act 469 approved by the state Legislature in the 2018 session allowed riverboat licenses to relocate within 1200 feet of their berth to a land-based space. The gaming board in December 2019 approved the Isle relocating its riverboat casino to land the first to get state approval. At that time the casino was set to be rebranded as Eldorado Resorts. Eldorado completed its $17.3 billion purchase of Caesars in July 2020 and took the Caesars name.

The gaming board’s approval allows for demolition of the Inn – the older hotel on the Isle property that sustained severe damage from Hurricane Laura. Favre said it’s a smarter financial move to use the money set aside to renovate the Inn on upgrading the tower hotel rooms.

The board approved the old Isle of Capri riverboat to be sold. Hurricane Laura’s 150-mile-per-hour winds pushed the riverboat and wedged it underneath the Interstate 10-Calcasieu River bridge. Favre said there is a contract to sell the riverboat to a licensed gaming supplier.

Ronnie Johns gaming board chairman said the updated plans for the Horseshoe Casino is good news for Southwest Louisiana. The Thursday meeting was Johns’ first as board chairman since being appointed by Gov. John Bel Edwards in July. Johns resigned his District 27 Senate seat to serve on the board.

“We’re very excited about what they’re building there” he said Friday. “It’s going to be a much nicer property than what we envisioned.”

Favre said the roof is 85 percent replaced. The property also includes a new lift station a chilled water plant to provide the entire facility with air conditioning and heating and a new 14000-square-foot warehouse.

In addition to the Horseshoe Casino approval the board also approved emergency rules to allow casinos and four racetracks to move forward with temporary facilities for sports betting off the gaming floor. Johns said some of the casinos could take in-person bets by mid- to late-September. The emergency rules are in effect for 180 days and can be renewed for another 180-day period.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY2lvLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtbmV3cy90aHJlZS11cy1naWFudHMtdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLXVwLzg1NTA3MDE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three US giants to invest in UP,"Advt

You can’t win if you’re fighting people who are fighting for their own villages and their own territory. Those were lessons we thought we learned in Vietnam. And yet 30 40 years later we end up in Afghanistan repeating the same mistakes.” On the morning of Sept. 11 2001 President George W. Bush was visiting an elementary school in Sarasota Fla. when he received word of an attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. “We’re looking at a live picture of the of the building right now. And uh what would you say? That would be about the 90th floor or so?” The president joined his staff in an empty classroom where his C.I.A. intelligence briefer Michael Morell had been watching the attack unfold. “There was a TV there and the second plane hit.” “Oh my goodness.” “Oh God.” “There’s another one.” “Oh.” “Oh my goodness there’s another one.” “God.” “And when that happened I knew that this was an act of terrorism.” At the Capitol in Washington Representative Barbara Lee’s meeting was interrupted. “I heard a lot of noise saying ‘Evacuate. Leave. Get out of here. Run fast.’ So I ran up Independence Avenue. As I turned around I was able to see a heck of a lot of smoke.” “Another aircraft unbelievably has crashed into the Pentagon.” “What you have to understand is this is the largest attack ever in the entire history of the country.” At 9:59 a.m. the second World Trade Center tower to be struck collapsed. Twenty-nine minutes later the other tower followed. “The president he asked to see me in his office on Air Force One. The president looked me in the eye and he said ‘Michael who did this?’ I told the president that I would bet my children’s future that Al Qaeda was responsible for this attack.” Within hours evidence surfaced that Al Qaeda a multinational terrorist organization headed by the Islamic fundamentalist Osama Bin Laden had committed the attacks. The group was being given safe haven in Afghanistan by the Taliban regime. “The president’s inclination was to hit back and hit back hard.” “I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people — ” “So the president decided to go to war.” “ — And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” “We had to go to Afghanistan. There’s no question in any of our minds it’s a war of necessity. We had to go after Al Qaeda we had to kill them we had to get them out and we had to pursue them to the ends of the earth.” “The word on the street was everyone’s got to be united with the president. You know the country is in mourning.” Three days after the attacks Lee was under pressure to vote yes on a resolution in Congress to authorize going to war against Al Qaeda and its allies when she heard a eulogy at a memorial service. “That as we act we not become the evil we deplore.” “It was at that point I said We need to think through our military response our national security response and the possible impact on civilians.” “Mr. Speaker members I rise today really with a very heavy heart. One that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States.” “Got back to the office and all hell was breaking loose.” “The only dissenting voice was Democrat Barbara Lee of California voting no.” “Phone calls threats. People were calling me a traitor. She’s got to go. But I knew then it was going to set the stage for perpetual war.” Within weeks of 9/11 the U.S. struck back in Afghanistan. “The United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime.” Soon after U.S. ground troops arrived in the country. “The invasion was a success very quickly.” “At the gates of Kabul news of a Taliban collapse had already reached these thousands.” “The Taliban retreat has turned into a rout.” “By the end of the year the Taliban had been driven from power. A large number of Al Qaeda operatives had either been killed or captured.” And although Osama Bin Laden had managed to escape the U.S. had accomplished its main goal. “Al Qaeda could not operate out of Afghanistan anymore.” President Bush knew there was a history of failed military campaigns in Afghanistan. “We know this from not only intelligence but from the history of military conflict in Afghanistan. It’s been one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We’re not going to repeat that mistake.” [Applause] But after his initial success Bush expanded the mission to nation-building. To prevent further Al Qaeda attacks his administration said it wanted to transform the poor war-torn country into a stable democracy with a strong central government and U.S.-trained military. “The idea was it would be impossible for the Taliban to ever return to power and impossible for Afghanistan to ever be used as a safe haven again.” “There were girls starting to go to school there were clinics and hospitals being set up there were vaccinations there were elections planned. Everything was kind of humming along and we all thought OK this is going to be fine.” But by the mid-2000s after the Bush administration expanded the war on terror to Iraq Richard Boucher realized that the U.S.-backed Afghan government was plagued by corruption and mismanagement. “I used to say to my guys on the Afghan desk ‘If we’re winning how come it don’t look like we’re winning?’” “The Taliban have staged a major comeback seizing control of large swaths of the country.” “The people were not rejecting the Taliban. And that was in the end because the government couldn’t deliver much for the people. Everybody had this idea in their heads that government works the way it does in Washington. But Afghanistan hasn’t worked that way in the past. I think that was a moment we should’ve at least asked ourselves whether it wasn’t really time for us to leave and to say to the Afghans ‘It’s your place you run it as best you can.’” Instead by 2011 President Bush’s successor Barack Obama had sent nearly 50000 more troops to Afghanistan hoping to reverse the Taliban’s gains. “I think one of the biggest mistakes we made strategically after 9/11 was to fail to finish the job here focus our attention here. We got distracted by Iraq.” One of those troops was Marine Captain Timothy Kudo. Part of his job was to shore up support for the government by digging wells and building schools. He soon lost faith in that mission after he says his company killed two Afghan teenagers they mistakenly believed were firing on them. “And their family saw this happen. The mothers the grandmothers they came out. It was the first time I’d ever seen an Afghan woman without wearing a burqa. They were sobbing and crying uncontrollably. I mean how can you kill two innocent people and expect anything that you say to matter at that point?” “People here have little faith in U.S. forces anymore. More Afghans now blame the violence here on the U.S. than on the Taliban.” Weeks after Kudo returned home from Afghanistan there was a monumental development. “I started getting all these texts like ‘You’ve got to check out the TV.’ My roommate calls me from the other room. ‘Turn on CNN.’” “The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin Laden the leader of Al Qaeda.” “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” “In that moment people are celebrating in front of the White House. They’re celebrating by Ground Zero.” “This is where it happened. We’re back. It’s justice!” “And to my mind there’s no more reason to go through this madness. And of course we then did it for another decade.” “I think the military and the national security apparatus thought they could win. And I think that they also wanted to believe that because they had invested so much. People had died and they didn’t want them to die in vain.” “2011 Bin Laden is now dead. Why was it so hard to de-escalate?” Jeffrey Eggers was on President Obama’s National Security Council. He says that the goal since 9/11 to make sure Afghanistan would never again be a safe haven for terrorists had become a recipe for endless war. “We will forever prevent the conditions that led to such an attack.” “Danger close!” [Gunfire] “And if you define it that way when are you finished?” [Gunfire] “Go! Come on come on come on!” Though the surge failed to push back the Taliban the U.S. drew down troop levels even as doubts were growing that Afghan forces would be able to defend the country. In 2021 President Biden the fourth president to preside over the war announced that he would withdraw U.S. troops a plan set in motion by his predecessor Donald Trump. “Nobody should have any doubts. We lost the war in Afghanistan.” “And we’re clear to cross?” “It wasn’t a peace agreement; it was a withdrawal agreement. The agreement was essentially As we withdraw don’t attack us.” As the U.S. leaves Afghanistan the Taliban is taking over again having quickly overrun the Afghan Army which the U.S. spent more than $80 billion to train and equip. “The Taliban are out in full force. And their Islamist rule is already coming back.” “They can use this as a recruiting tool. They are now the champions of the jihadi movement because they pushed out the United States.” And U.S. officials are reflecting on the beginning of the war 20 years after 9/11. “More people should have thought about endless war not just in Congress but in the State Department in the Defense Department C.I.A. and elsewhere in the White House. That the recipe of using military means to go after terrorism was just going to get us into one fight after another after another. One can only hope that Americans of the new generation will think about this.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlmaW5kcy5vcmcvZ3Jvd2luZy1vd24tZnJ1aXQtdmVnZXRhYmxlcy1nYXJkZW5zLWZvb2QtYmlsbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garden nation: 80% of people are growing their own fruits and veggies to cut food bills -,"NEW YORK — Things are looking very green in the land of red white and blue. A new study finds eight in 10 Americans have grown their own produce over the past year.

Researchers asked 2000 people about their thoughts on gardening and 65 percent say they’ve tried it themselves at some point over the past year. Of those respondents who’ve dabbled in gardening 76 percent claim it’s their new hobby and 86 percent have eaten the fruits of their labor.

Six in 10 say that witnessing panic buying at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic inspired them to get their shovels out. In fact two in three respondents believe more people should consider taking up gardening to have greater control over their food.

Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Tower Garden the survey also finds that half of all garden-curious respondents have considered finding a community garden to join so they don’t have to rely on supermarkets as much.

Look how much you’ve grown!

Of those who’ve tried gardening over the past year 65 percent made room in their backyard and 41 percent found nooks and crannies in their homes to grow a small herb garden. Some of the top thoughts around growing produce at home include saving money on produce (39%) reducing food waste (32%) and adding a new life skill (22%).

Tomatoes top the list of produce items on people’s “to grow” lists (71%) with herbs (52%) flowers (49%) and cucumbers (47%) following far behind. Thirty-two percent of these respondents have also tried a gardening cheat code by trying to grow more produce from what they’ve purchased at a grocery store.

Nearly four in 10 (39%) want to grow greens to save money as the average American currently spends $45.25 per person on fruits and veggies each month. In addition 62 percent believe a garden would help improve their overall diet and wellness while 71 percent feel it would benefit their mental health.

“Given the past year it’s not surprising that 65 percent of those surveyed have turned to gardening as we’ve seen more consumers purchase gardening products” says David Henard Senior Director/GM of Global Tower Garden in a statement. “We’re discovering that more people are finding ways to take control of their own food supply and one way of doing so is by growing your own food at home.”

Taking gardening to new heights

Of those who haven’t attempted to garden 55 percent wish they could learn how but 42 percent worry they won’t know what to do. Furthermore seven in 10 (72%) see a lack of space in their home as a barrier to starting or expanding their gardening hobby.

“A common misconception is that gardening requires plenty of space and soil or having a full backyard” Henard says. “Growing flowers or produce is more accessible than people think and by growing vertically you can save both the space water time and energy that traditional garden growing requires.”"

But as its supply dwindles a crisis looms. Published August 21 2021

For farmers in the deserts of central Arizona success and failure is defined by who has water and who does not. At the moment Dan Thelander is still among the haves.

Inside a municipal building in Pinal County Thelander rolls a map out across the board room table.

On the patchwork of brown desert and green farmland in front of us Thelander points out the parcels of land where he and his brother son and nephew grow cotton alfalfa and several other crops.

About half the water he uses to irrigate his land is pumped out of ancient aquifers deep beneath the desert floor. The other half however originates hundreds of miles away at the headwaters of the Colorado River.

As winter fades and the snowpack melts water drains into the mountain streams and tributaries that feed the Colorado River. The river’s vast drainage area is divided into two regions: the Upper and Lower Basin. Around 90% of the river’s flow originates in the Upper Basin. After flowing down from the Upper Basin the river snakes its way across the Southwest eventually reaching Lake Mead near Las Vegas. From there a system of dams canals and pipelines channel it into the irrigation ditches that water Thelander’s thirsty fields in Pinal County.

Today this river system supplies 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico and irrigates more than 5 million acres of farmland on its way into Mexico and the Gulf of California.

Las Vegas relies on the river for 90% of its water supply Tucson for 82% and San Diego for around 66%. Large portions of the water used in Los Angeles Phoenix and Denver also come from the river and experts say these booming metropolises would not have been possible without its supply.

But a crisis is unfolding and farmers scientists water managers and policy makers across the Southwest are increasingly alarmed.

Water managers have long recognized that the river is plagued by overuse. But over the last two decades demand for the river’s water has often outstripped its supply. Since 2000 the river’s flows have shrunk by roughly 20% compared to the 20th century average due in large part to the human-caused climate crisis. At the same time its two main reservoirs — the savings account for the entire system in times of drought — have drained rapidly.

Lake Mead — the largest manmade reservoir in the US which is fed by the Colorado River — recently sunk to its lowest levels since the lake was filled in the 1930s. Its water levels have fallen more than 146 feet since their peak in January of 2000 and the lake is now just 35% full. Lake Powell the river’s second largest reservoir sits at 32% of its capacity. As water levels drop billions of kilowatt hours of hydroelectricity that power homes from Nebraska to Arizona are also at risk.

“We’re in uncharted territory for this system” says Jeff Lukas an independent consultant and former research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder where he focused on water issues for 20 years.

On Monday the US Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever official shortage which will trigger the largest mandatory water cuts to date in the Colorado River Basin. And after decades of receiving water from the Colorado River the spigot could soon be turned off on many farms here including Thelander’s.

While the farmers knew this day would come a harsh reality is setting in: To stay in business they’ll need to pull more water from below ground.

Back on the table Thelander points to the diamonds and circles that dot the map. Those mark the locations of new groundwater wells that his irrigation district is considering — the first new ones they have drilled in decades Thelander says.

For much of the last century Colorado River management has focused on choosing who will be allowed to stick their straw into the river next and how much water they can take. At times that process has sparked major disputes — with some leading all the way to the US Supreme Court.

Now many of the basin states are having a more painful discussion: deciding who will receive less water — and how much. Experts say the next phase in the river’s history could be even more contentious.

The current Colorado River guidelines expire in 2026 and early negotiations are already getting underway for a new framework to determine how to divvy up its water. But by the time officials from the states Mexico Native American tribes and the federal government convene it is likely that the river’s water supply will be even more tenuous than it is today.

Scientists and water policy experts say that the science is clear: The Colorado River’s supply will likely shrink further as the planet warms. Given what we know many say we will have to use even less water in the future.

But will the states be able to agree to new guidelines that reflect this reality? And with the Southwest’s growing urban centers and farms both reliant on the river’s supply who will be willing to take less water?

How elected officials and water managers answer those questions will decide the fate of the most important water resource in the American West — and the millions of people who rely on it.

Who stands to lose water first — and why Bryce Urbany CNN

The roots of this current water crisis can be traced back nearly 100 years to the signing of the Colorado River Compact.

In November of 1922 with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover overseeing the deliberations delegates from all seven Colorado River Basin states convened in Santa Fe New Mexico to hammer out the guidelines.

From the start the compact negotiations were contentious. Squabbles erupted over details big and small from how to measure the river’s flow to how to portion out its supply.

Efforts to reach a deal began in January of 1922 and resumed in November when delegates from the states gathered in Santa Fe New Mexico. After two weeks of deliberations they finally reached an agreement on November 24 1922.

From the Southwest’s cities to its farms that feed the world water managers say much of what we see today would not exist without the dams canals and pipelines that the compact paved the way for.

“[The Colorado River] is the lifeblood of the American Southwest” says Jeff Kightlinger who led Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District for 15 years before his recent retirement. “None of these cities would be possible but for the Colorado River and the development of it for all of these regions.”

Over the course of the 20th century new agreements and court decisions further divided up the river’s supply among the seven basin states Mexico and the region’s Native American tribes. But there was a serious flaw in the original compact — one that in part explains why the river is facing its first-ever shortage today.

When the delegates met they agreed to give the Upper Basin (made up of Colorado Wyoming Utah and New Mexico) and the Lower Basin (California Arizona and Nevada) each 7.5 million acre-feet of water to use on an annual basis.

Those portions were based on estimates that the river’s flow totaled roughly 16.4 million acre-feet each year. That was more than enough to meet the demands of the states. However data shows those estimates exceed the amount of water the river actually provides in most years.

Analysis of US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) data shows that between 1906 and 2019 annual flows on the river actually averaged just under 14.8 million acre-feet. Over the last two decades flows have been even lower — just an estimated 12.3 million acre-feet on average each year.

Up until the 1990s the Lower Basin states were not using all the water they were entitled to on paper. This allowed officials to let the river’s water accounting problem persist for decades experts say.

“Through the 20th century it was easy for political actors to ignore that reality …” says John Fleck a professor at the University of New Mexico who has written several books on the Colorado River and water issues in the West. “There was slack in the system because it took us a century to build all the dams and diversions that people dreamed about in the 1920s.”

A river stretched beyond its limits US Bureau of Reclamation

As water rights were granted and new canals were built that slack has gradually disappeared.

Data shows that the over-allocation problem became more apparent in the years after one of the last big straws was inserted into the river.

The Central Arizona Project (CAP) — a massive 336-mile canal and pipeline system that carries Colorado River water across the desert to Phoenix Tucson and farms and towns in between — was authorized by Congress in 1968.

Before the CAP was completed in the 1990s heavy groundwater pumping in central Arizona was sucking aquifers dry at an alarming rate. The CAP promised a renewable reliable source of water.

With no infrastructure to deliver Colorado River water to cities in the middle of the state Arizona was also only using about half of its Colorado River allocation before the CAP was completed according to Ted Cooke the general manager of the CAP.

California had long opposed the project so to gain support from the state’s congressional delegation Arizona made a key concession: That in the event of a shortage fulfilling California’s water deliveries would take priority over meeting the needs of CAP water users.

Now with water cuts looming next year the CAP’s status in the Colorado River’s pecking order is proving significant.

As Lake Mead's levels have fallen Arizona Nevada and Mexico are already receiving less than their full allocations of water. And with the lake projected to be even lower next year deeper cuts will take effect in 2022. Arizona faces the most severe reductions. In Arizona the water cuts will have the greatest impact on lower-priority water users served by the CAP like farmers in Pinal County. But if water levels in Lake Mead continue to sink in the years to come California could also face cuts to its water supply. Some cities and tribes in central Arizona could also face reductions if the lake drops to critical levels. If the lake drops below 1025 feet above sea level Arizona would receive less than 75% of its full Colorado River water supply.

Arizona farmers like Dan Thelander have known for years that their supply of Colorado River water would eventually be phased out. They just didn’t expect it to happen so soon.

A drought that began more than two decades ago along with the effects of higher temperatures due to global warming have rapidly sapped the river’s flow. And in the long-term scientists and water policy experts say those problems pose a threat to users far beyond the farms of Pinal County.

Droughts are temporary. The drying up of the river may not be

The Colorado River’s drainage basin spans some 246000 square miles but most of its flow originates in a handful of snow-capped mountain ranges in southern Wyoming western Colorado and northeastern Utah according to Jeff Lukas the research scientist and water consultant.

The river flows through some of the country’s most arid land so the snow that accumulates in those areas is critical. In most years snowmelt is responsible for about 80% of the river’s water supply Lukas says.

Many scientific studies have examined why there is less water flowing into the river. Nearly all have found the fingerprints of human-caused climate change.

The first and perhaps most cited explanation is the ongoing “megadrought” which began in the year 2000.

A study published in the journal Science in 2020 found that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest stretch the Southwest has experienced since the 1500s and that nearly half of the drought’s severity could be attributed to global warming.

""When you have more evaporation you have less water left over to come down the river."" Chris Milly US Geological Survey

As dry as it has been the study found that this may only be the beginning. Past megadroughts have lasted longer than the current one.

But a lack of snow and rain doesn’t fully explain what is happening to the Colorado River. And droughts after all are temporary. Some scientists say the evidence shows the river’s shrinking supply is likely not so fleeting.

Brad Udall a climate scientist at Colorado State University argues the river’s plight is best summed up by another term: aridification.

Broadly speaking aridification is a shift to a new climate state dominated by water scarcity and driven by the effects of hotter temperatures. Temperatures across the basin have risen by an average of 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over the last century.

“[Warmer temperatures] are just this constant year in and year out force on the system” Udall says.

As temperatures warm the amount of precipitation that falls as snow decreases and the snow that does fall melts earlier according to Chris Milly a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey who co-authored a study last year examining the river’s decline.

""Evaporation is how the river basin cools itself"" Milly says. “When you have more evaporation you have less water left over to come down the river.""

Over the last year Udall says we’ve seen how some of these processes can lead to alarmingly low runoff and stream flows.

However the water contained in snowpack that fell last winter was not as poor with supplies peaking at between 70% and 85% of normal. Still even with decent snowpack streamflows across the region this year have been alarmingly low with some sites in Utah and Colorado reporting flows that are among the lowest on record.

All of this points to an unpleasant conclusion Udall says: As long as humans fail to halt global warming it’s likely that there will be even less water in the river in the future.

A 2020 study in the journal Science co-authored by Milly tried to approximate how much less. The authors found that further decreases in the river’s flow are likely no matter what actions are taken. But without any significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions the study found the river's flows could shrink by as much as 31% by the middle of this century.

“It's possible you might have a wet year but the long-term trend is in completely the wrong direction” Udall says. “Every passing year that becomes clearer and it’s getting harder for anyone who thinks otherwise to be taken seriously.”

A new hunt for water below ground Bryce Urbany CNN

Beneath a drill rig towering high above the desert floor two men in yellow hard hats pull levers to drive a massive metal pipe into the ground.

Feet away a deafening machine called a shaker vibrates violently separating muddy drilling fluid from chunks of earth pulled loose by the drill bit as it punctures layers of clay sand and gravel on its way down.

It’s a scene you might expect to see in the vast oil fields of the Permian Basin.

But here surrounded by acres of alfalfa and dairy pens on the outskirts of Maricopa Arizona the men are looking for something more valuable to the local economy: water.

To pump water up from the aquifer below the men will have to drill down between 1200 and 1300 feet according to Marty Weber the CEO of Weber Water Resources the company responsible for drilling this well.

This one is being paid for by the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District with money given to the farmers by the state of Arizona and the CAP as part of their agreement under the state’s drought contingency plan. Drilling these wells is part of the farmers’ strategy to survive the cuts that are coming to their Colorado River water supply.

Next year farmers in Thelander’s district will only get about 1/3 of the water supply they’ve received in past years. But in 2023 Pinal County’s farms will likely see their Colorado River supply dry up completely according to the state’s drought plans.

""... any way you cut it our farm will be less profitable."" Dan Thelander Tempe Farming Company

Before the cuts take effect on January 1 2022 Thelander hopes they will have nine to 10 new wells to make up some of the water they stand to lose. The new wells are just one sign of the changes coming soon to the county. Soon there will be fallow fields too.

Right now Thelander’s crops are doing well. But next year he expects to leave 30% to 40% of his land unsown.

“Like anybody in business when you're faced with adversity you just knuckle down and do the best you can” he says. “But any way you cut it our farm will be less profitable.”

'We’ll try to hang on and farm as long as we can' Bryce Urbany CNN

While the desert heat is ideal for growing cotton the county is also a dairy powerhouse. At one point Pinal County ranked in the top 1% of all US counties for both cotton and milk sales according to a 2018 study by economists at the University of Arizona.

Many farms here like Thelander’s specialize in growing alfalfa corn and other crops to feed the thousands of dairy cattle on local farms.

Consumers in Phoenix likely won’t notice a difference when the water cuts kick in says George Frisvold a professor at the University of Arizona and a co-author of the 2018 study. But in the local farming economy he expects there will be significant pain when the cutbacks take effect.

""You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy and jobs go away."" George Frisvold University of Arizona

The same 2018 University of Arizona study found that under a scenario where farms here lose all of the Colorado River water allocated to them it could cost the county between $31.7 and $35 million and as many as 480 jobs.

“You’ll have these ripple effects through the economy and jobs go away” Frisvold says. “In smaller rural areas in Pinal County it’s going to be more noticeable.”

Jim Boyle a dairy farmer who milks around 3500 cows on his farm near Casa Grande Arizona says that he too will likely have to fallow some of the land where he grows feed for his cattle.

And while he says he is fortunate to have deep productive groundwater wells on his property he is concerned about how others whose livelihoods are tied to farming will fare.

“There are a lot of ag-related businesses in our county — the tractor sales guys the machinery guys the fertilizer and chemicals guys” Boyle says. “It will have a roll-on effect throughout the county … and I think there’s some worry out there.”

There is also concern from some in the state about the farmers’ return to heavy groundwater pumping.

Before the CAP began delivering water to Pinal County’s farms in the late 1980s farms here were totally reliant on groundwater to irrigate their crops. But pumping was depleting the aquifers faster than they could be replenished causing huge fissures to form across the county as the ground sank.

Already projections show there is not enough groundwater available to meet future demands in the Pinal County Active Management Area (AMA) — which includes much of Pinal County as well as parts of Maricopa and Pima counties — according to an Arizona Department of Water Resources spokesperson. Last month Tom Buschatzke the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (AZDWR) told leaders in the AMA that “the days of utilizing native groundwater for development in Pinal are over it’s done.”

Still with their Colorado River water on the verge of disappearing farmers here are planning to pump even more groundwater to irrigate their fields.

“I am concerned about Pinal turning to groundwater because that means there won’t be resources for future use” says Sarah Porter the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “It’s like spending your long-term savings — you want to do that very advisedly.”

Whether the loss of Colorado River water will accelerate other trends in the county remains to be seen.

Nancy Caywood’s farm near Casa Grande used to get water from the San Carlos reservoir in Eastern Arizona part of the Gila River system. The reservoir ran dry in April and she says her farm hasn’t received water since.

To make ends meet Caywood and her son Travis Hartman are growing corn on leased land that has access to Colorado River water. The money Hartman makes from that crop should help him keep the family farm he says.

But next year farming there may no longer be an option as cuts to Colorado River water hit the county.

Already Caywood’s 255-acre farm is flanked to the East by a large solar installation and she says the farmland across the street could soon have panels installed.

She says that they too have been approached before about leasing their land to solar developers but ultimately decided against it.

As the drought continues she admits it is getting harder to tell them “no.”

“We've just decided we’ll try to hang on and farm as long as we can” she says.

This round of negotiating could be the ‘hardest one yet’ Bryce Urbany CNN

Nearly a century has passed since Herbert Hoover led the first attempt to divide up the Colorado River’s supply.

But as the first mandatory water cuts loom authorities in states across the basin say that they are preparing for a future with less water.

For years states like Arizona have been “banking” water from the Colorado River in aquifers. Las Vegas will phase out “nonfunctional grass” by 2027 in an effort to save precious water. And across the Southwest cities are investing in wastewater treatment and reuse. All of this they say will allow their economies to thrive even if the river’s supply shrinks.

But what the next 100 years look like hinges on negotiations that are beginning to take shape now.

Kightlinger the recently retired general manager of California’s Metropolitan Water District and a veteran of past river negotiations says he expects the 2026 process will be painful.

“We had very intense difficult negotiations in 2003 and 2007 and again in 2019. But this is going to be the hardest one yet.”

A failure to reach an agreement could usher in an era of uncertainty for the basin’s 40 million water users and increase the likelihood of legal conflicts says John Entsminger the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority which provides water from the Colorado River to nearly 2.3 million people in Las Vegas and across the state.

The drought contingency plans that were inked in 2019 between the federal government the states Native American tribes and other water users have so far staved off a worst-case scenario — like an emptied Lake Mead or Lake Powell. Entsminger and others pointed to those past negotiating successes and expressed confidence that they could reach a new deal.

“The Colorado [River] has been described as the most litigated river in the world and I think that’s true if you're talking about the 60s and 70s” Entsminger says. “But since the mid-’90s this has been the most successful river basin in the world in terms of seven states and the country next to it coming together and … figuring out how to make this river work for everyone.”

The water battles that lie ahead Bryce Urbany CNN

One of the biggest challenges experts say negotiators must face is how to handle the large amount of water used by agriculture which is responsible for around 70% of water use across the basin.

Pinal County’s farmers are bearing the brunt of the first round of water cuts because of their low position in the state’s water priority system. But there are other farming centers in Arizona and elsewhere which possess some of the highest priority water rights in the entire basin.

One of those places is Yuma Arizona the river’s last stop in the US before it flows into Mexico. Part of “America’s Salad Bowl” around 90% of the leafy greens produced in the US in winter are grown on Yuma’s farms according to the county’s chamber of commerce.

Under current law the entire Central Arizona Project could go dry before Yuma’s farms lose a drop of water due to their high priority water rights according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke.

Buschatzke said that the US and the world need the healthy high-value crops that they grow in Yuma but acknowledged that the river’s shrinking supply may force difficult tradeoffs.

“Certainly the community of Yuma does not want to see any of the water that goes to those farms go to non-agricultural purposes but that is something that is certainly on the radar screen” Buschatzke says.

Tom Davis the general manager of the Yuma County Water Users Association says that with less water to go around he expects there will be new pressure to shift agricultural water supplies to the Southwest’s growing cities.

He says he and the farmers he represents will fight to “the bitter end” to protect their water rights but recognizes that they are not untouchable.

The water rights of many Native American tribes whose ancestors have farmed across the region for thousands of years are also among the highest priority in the entire basin. Today 22 of the 30 federally recognized tribes in the region have rights to an estimated 22 to 26% of the river’s water supply according to recent analysis from the Water and Tribes Initiative an alliance dedicated to tribal water issues.

But despite holding a sizeable portion of the pie many tribes have been left out of these types of negotiations in the past. However there are signs that this is changing in parts of the basin.

The Gila River Indian Community located south of Phoenix in Maricopa and Pinal counties now holds the single largest water allotment in the entire Central Arizona Project system thanks to a 2004 settlement brokered with the federal government.

The Gila River Indian Community’s governor Stephen Roe Lewis says he had to fight for a seat at the table in the negotiations over the 2019 drought contingency plan. But once there he played a key role in helping push the deal across the finish line in Arizona.

Now as talks for the new 2026 guidelines begin he says he plans to vigorously defend his community’s water.

“If we’re treated as sovereign tribal entities and with respect towards our individual water histories then I’m looking forward to being a part of the process.”

As stakeholders prepare to protect their water supplies plans to use even more river water are also forging ahead in some corners.

""The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic unsustainable water policy of the 20th century."" Zachary Frankel Utah Rivers Council

The most controversial new diversion is Utah’s proposed Lake Powell pipeline which would pump Colorado River water from near Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona roughly 140 miles to the city of St. George Utah and surrounding towns. Critics say the project represents a denial of the realities of climate change that could imperil the water supplies of millions.

“The Lake Powell pipeline is a symbol of our archaic unsustainable water policy of the 20th century” says Zachary Frankel executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “… Utah is still in this fantasy pretending that climate change isn't impacting our water supply and it's more than crazy — it's irresponsible and reckless.”

The project appeared to be on a fast track to approval under the Trump administration last year but after the six other basin states sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt opposing the pipeline Utah requested an extension to consider their views and other public comments.

Despite their pushback Utah’s new Colorado River commissioner Gene Shawcroft says he believes the project is important to the state’s growth and intends to push for its approval.

A potential new (and expensive) source of water

Meanwhile as water levels in Lake Mead plummet states are exploring opportunities to develop new sources of water — in addition to what they receive from the Colorado River.

Arizona is weighing the possibility of building desalination plants on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico to augment its water supplies.

""... when the supply that we're depending on is dwindling what else are you going to do?"" Ted Cooke Central Arizona Project

If built the plants would use reverse osmosis or thermal distillation to transform salt water into fresh. That water could be used in Mexico and in exchange Arizona would potentially receive a portion of Mexico’s Colorado River water supply according to AZDWR director Tom Buschatzke. While legal and diplomatic hurdles remain Buschatzke said the rapidly deteriorating situation on the river has added new urgency to the effort.

Earlier this year Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and Governor Claudia Pavlovich of Mexico’s Sonora state signed an agreement to study potential desalination sites. Last year a feasibility study found the plants could cost in excess of $3 billion to build and cost between $71 million and $119 million annually to operate not to mention the huge amounts of energy required to pull salt from water.

Still with Arizona more vulnerable to water cuts than other states Central Arizona Project General Manager Ted Cooke says everything must be on the table.

“It's expensive but when the supply that we're depending on is dwindling what else are you going to do?” he says.

But new water sources are still years and billions of dollars away from becoming reality. As central Arizona prepares for painful water reductions and the possibility of deeper cuts in the next few years the clock is ticking to conserve the supply millions rely on today.

With each passing month new projections offer a glimpse further into the river’s future. The picture they paint is not pretty.

In June new modeling showed there is a 17% chance that Lake Powell could sink so low by 2024 that hydroelectric generation at Glen Canyon Dam would become impossible. At full capacity the dam can produce enough power for some 5.8 million homes. The loss of that electricity would add more stress to power sources in the West which have shown vulnerability to blackouts in extreme heat amplified by global warming.

To keep the generators running the Bureau of Reclamation recently announced that smaller reservoirs in the Upper basin would release water to help prop up Lake Powell. The influx they’ll provide will raise water levels by around 3 feet. But for a lake that now routinely drops 4 feet or more in a month it may not buy much time.

The future of Lake Mead also looks precarious.

The same models show a 1-in-5 chance that the lake could fall to 1000 feet above sea level by 2025. That’s only 50 feet above the bare minimum needed to allow Hoover Dam to generate electricity and just 105 feet above “dead pool.” At dead pool what little water is left behind cannot flow through Hoover Dam. Instead it would have to be pumped out.

As water levels drop new layers of the lake’s now-trademark “bathtub rings” are revealed. Today the white mineral deposits left behind on the shoreline’s sandstone walls tower more than 140 feet above the boats below.

They are a reminder of wetter times ones that occurred not so long ago.

They are also the most obvious sign of a river system largely conceived in the 20th century that is struggling to adapt to the harsh realities of climate change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL3RoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi13ZXN0LWlzLWRyeWluZy11cNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The American West is drying up,"L OCALS CALL it the “bathtub ring”.

The canyons that were drowned when Lake Powell was filled in the 1960s are slowly revealing themselves again.

Not much talking is happening here -- it's all body language and the kiddos get the drill ... opening up and letting the guy waterfall for a couple seconds each. It's both heartwarming but also sad ... presumably there isn't much fresh water to go around at the moment.

It's just an example of U.S. forces there still doing the hard work of trying to get people out ASAP ... while also maintaining a good attitude and trying to keep things light especially with the little ones. Different photos have emerged showing exactly that within the walls of the Kabul Airport where different military personnel are interacting with locals.

The record-breaking attempt is part of Roll-Royce’s Accelerating the Electrification of Flight (ACCEL) initiative.

To develop a state-of-the-art battery and propulsion system for the ACCEL initiative Rolls-Royce turned to Gloucestershire UK based start-up Electroflight which develops energy storage solutions for aerospace electrification applications and Oxford-based manufacturer of lightweight electric motors and controllers YASA. Electroflight joined the ACCEL programme in February 2020 and announced its partnership with engineering simulation and 3D design software firm Ansys in October.

According to Rob Watson Director Rolls-Royce Electrical “The characteristics that ‘air-taxis’ require from batteries are very similar to what is being developed for the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ so that it can reach record-breaking speeds.” Rolls-Royce completed the first taxiing of the Spirit of Innovation in March when the aircraft propelled itself forward using power from its advanced 500hp (400kw) battery and propulsion system.

Partnering for success

Electroflight used multiphysics simulations via Ansys to gain additional insights into its challenges during its battery design for the ACCEL programme. These simulations played a vital role in accelerating Electroflight’s battery development and verification processes allowing the firm to meet tight deadlines set for the record-breaking project.

One of the primary challenges faced by Electroflight was optimising the 475 kg battery pack it developed for structural strength thermal management and other critical performance criteria said Douglas Campbell Technical Director Electroflight in a recent article in Ansys Advantage Magazine.

Engineering simulation helped the Electroflight team address three critical issues: materials selection structural integrity and balanced cooling. In addition to cater to the battery pack’s size relative to the aircraft itself Rolls-Royce and Electroflight are also designed to be integrated as a critical structural element for the one-seater aircraft.

While a lightweight engine is often considered the holy grail for high-performance IC engines it is battery pack design that is most crucial for all-electric propulsion. This is because even the most power-dense lithium-ion batteries impose a significant weight penalty. Electroflight took a novel engineering approach to deliver the energy-storage performance required at this level and its 475 kg battery pack features more than 6000 battery cells delivering an energy efficiency of 90%.

Three separate battery assemblies are used in the lithium-ion battery pack which also features an innovative cooling system that pumps a water and glycol liquid coolant mixture through plates between the batteries offsetting the battery packs’ natural propensity to generate heat. The three separate battery assemblies provide electricity to three high-power electric motors developed by YASA. The electric motors use a proprietary axial-flux design to deliver a small and lightweight engine configuration producing more than 500 hp. With safety as the top priority the Electroflight team engineered the aircraft to land safely even with just a single battery pack in operation.

Modelling a new reality

Electroflight relied on Ansys simulation solutions such as Mechanical Discovery Fluent and Granta Materials Selector to model and solve several challenges involved in the battery assembly’s design while dealing with significant time and cost pressures due to tight programme deadlines. It also utilised these solutions to understand the challenges related to sustainability and manufacturability operating limitations and hence were able to optimise the battery design accordingly.

Another challenging situation related to the material used for the battery cells was solved using Ansys Mechanical and Granta. Electroflight had originally designed the individual battery cells to be mounted in a compact back-to-back arrangement located on a polymer mounting plate. But it found that the 3D printed frame material originally selected for use displayed reduced stiffness properties as temperatures increased. Electroflight was now faced with a difficult challenge where it needed to identify a material with a glass transition temperature greater than the battery operating temperature. A 30% glass fibre-filled polycarbonate was identified to be the optimal material using Ansys Mechanical and Granta.

The Electroflight team used Ansys Mechanical to obtain a complete structural and frequency analysis of the battery assembly allowing it to adjust the assembly design. Amongst the notable changes made by Electroflight following the analysis was to design new clamps that avoided the resonant frequencies aligned with the propellor operating frequencies by adjusting the stiffness of the entire assembly.

Based on the WHO (World Health Organisation) data in 2011 traffic accidents have caused 1.3 million people to suffer fractures. In Indonesia fracture fixation devices commonly used are imported fixation devices made of non-biodegradable metal materials and often require a second operation. It causes expensive health care costs and increases the chances of infection and complications.

Therefore three students of Biomedical Engineering of the Faculty of Science and Technology Universitas Airlangga Edric Hernando Dhea Saphira Salsabila and Salwa Almas Shalihah under the guidance of Dr. Prihartini Widyanti drg. M.Kes S.Bio conducted research to make one of the fracture fixation devices Biodegradable Bone Screw using a biocomposite material Poly(Octanediol-co-Citrate)-Hydroxyapatite (POC-HA).

The research succeeded in obtaining funding in the 2021 Student Creativity Program (PKM) organized by the Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education (KEMENRISTEK DIKTI).

The result of 3D modeling of femoral fracture fixation will be used in finite element analysis (Private Doc).

“The idea for this research emerged after we conducted research and saw the potential for developing bone fixation devices in June 2021. Even though we had difficulty conducting experimental activities we still try to innovate by conducting online research using finite element software in the research data collection” said Edric Hernando as the team leader.

The finite element analysis software ANSYS 2021 was chosen because it can predict the application of POC-HA polymer materials to human bone tissue. The prediction process begins with creating a 3D Bone Screw model using CAD software Inventor 2020.

After that the input of secondary data related to the materials used and the incorporation of models is carried out in the ANSYS 2021 software. Then mathematical calculations and simulations are processed to produce the material’s mechanical characteristics one of the most important factors in fracture fixation.

Simulation results of finite element analysis of POC-HA biodegradable bone screw fixation device (Private Doc).

Salwa one of the group members explained that the mechanical characterization results through simulations on software showed characterization results close to the reference literature carried out experimentally. Furthermore it has the advantage of seeing the simulation results of the deformation of the POC-HA material which is quite good in repairing fractures.

As predicted it can be said that POC-HA biocomposite material can be studied using the finite element analysis method and has good potential as a candidate for a biodegradable bone screw for fracture repair. It proves that the pandemic condition is not a barrier to innovation as we can utilize technology that facilitates research. Furthermore it shows the potential of software such as finite element analysis in future research to accelerate research in analyzing other materials for bone repair effectively and efficiently.

That is until the Cupertino tech giant allegedly stole intellectual property developed by Irvine’s Masimo Corp. the medical technology firm he co-founded in 1989.



Now Orange County’s fourth-most valuable public company (Nasdaq: MASI) is taking on the world’s most valuable publicly traded company (Nasdaq: AAPL) in court.



Hundreds of millions of dollars and perhaps more are at stake in the case which was initially filed last year.



“They seem to have no shame in taking IP trade secrets or patents” Kiani said.



“Apple is thought of as this innovative company. Yet when you pull back the curtain every innovation that they have supposedly created they’ve seemed to have taken from somebody else and not rightfully most of the time. We’re just one example.”

Smoking Gun?



The legal quarrel is centered on Masimo’s pulse oximetry products devices that can precisely monitor a person’s blood for oxygen saturation levels which is useful for tracking a variety of health issues.



Kiani contends that Apple’s technology for the smartwatches—which uses light transmitted through the body to gauge blood oxygen levels—was stolen from his company.



Furthermore Masimo believes they have found a smoking gun only recently unearthed to back up their claims of intellectual property theft by Apple whose Apple Watch 6 has apps that measure pulse rates and blood and oxygen levels.



Marcelo Lamego a former employee who Kiani says was being groomed to become Masimo’s chief technical officer sent a letter in 2013 to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook seeking a senior level executive position.



“I have developed several medical devices in the last 10 years and I am positively sure I could add a significant value to the Apple team if I was given the chance of becoming part of it” Lamego wrote while he was still employed by Masimo. “If you agree feel free to contact me anytime.”



A top executive recruiter for Apple within hours contacted Lamego who then worked at Apple for six months. His name eventually appeared on Apple patents.



Kiani said he was stunned when he found out about the letter earlier this year.



“What’s crazy is that he wrote that letter to the CEO of Apple Tim Cook offering our secrets” Kiani told the Business Journal.



“The fact that Apple hired him—I don’t get it” Kiani said. “If I got a letter like that from anybody in any company I’d not only not hire him I would send a warning to my team to be careful not to hire this guy.”

Injunction Sought



Masimo is fighting Apple on several legal fronts.



In a separate legal action Masimo in June filed a complaint asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to halt imports from China of the Apple Watch 6.



While Federal District Judge James V. Selna last September denied Masimo’s request for a preliminary injunction against Apple in the initial case he wrote that “the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.”



The recently unearthed email from the former Masimo executive would appear to only boost the chance of $15.2-billion valued Masimo’s success in court against Apple which has a $2.5 trillion market cap.



Masimo is not the only business that’s been hurt in a similar manner by Apple Kiani contends.



“One of the things that Apple does as the most powerful and richest company when they like something they don’t work with the company they take it” Kiani said.

Big Dividends?



Masimo is spending tens of millions of dollars on these two cases as well as defending itself from Apple challenges of its existing patents.



The investment could pay big dividends.



A potential settlement if reached could result in Masimo receiving between $50 million and $300 million a year in royalties according to estimates cited in a late June Bloomberg report.



Masimo last year topped $1.1 billion in revenue an all-time high for the company.



There’s been no indication that either party is looking to settle the case for the time being; Masimo’s position is that it wants Apple’s watches pulled from the U.S. market.

Winning Precedent



Kiani has won big legal battles before.



In 2016 Royal Philips Electronics NV agreed to a $300 million partnership after a lawsuit filed by Masimo regarding Philips’ fingertip blood oxygen monitors.



Masimo also obtained $1 billion in damages and royalties from Medtronic PLC and predecessors in a lengthy legal fight that included an injunction against the sale of their product. The original settlement in 2006 helped paved the way for the Irvine firm to go public in 2007 at $17 a share. Its stock now trades around $280 a share.



Irvine-based Knobbe Martens which represented Masimo in its prior legal victories is also the law firm in this case against Apple.



A trial is scheduled for later next year while the ITC case may take 18 months.



“I never enjoy litigation” Kiani said last week.



“It’s nerve-wracking. It’s expensive. It’s not what we do. But our whole company is here because of our patents. If we allow people to just take them we could be hurt. We have no choice. We’re ready for this fight.”



An Apple spokesman didn’t return a phone message nor an email seeking comment.

Revered Company



Kiani who started his company in his Mission Viejo garage in 1989 now has 200 million patients annually using its monitoring technology primarily in hospital settings. Masimo employs 885 of its more than 6000 employees in Irvine.



The case began around 2013 when Apple executives called Masimo to inquire about its technology being applied to the tech giant’s products.



“We got excited” Kiani recalled last week during an interview at the company’s headquarters. “I revered them. I thought they were a great company and was eager to work with them.”



A few weeks after Kiani made a presentation at Apple his chief medical officer Michael O’Reilly called to say Apple made him an offer he couldn’t refuse where his salary bonuses and stock options were significantly increased.



O’Reilly’s LinkedIn page says he now works for Apple’s Health Special Projects division; neither Apple nor Stanford University where he says he is a professor of anesthesiology made O’Reilly available for comment.



Kiani said he then discovered Apple was making offers to other Masimo employees whose LinkedIn pages showed they had engineering degrees. Apple promised to stop poaching employees but didn’t eventually hiring 20 Masimo employees Kiani said.



He believes Apple uses a strategy called “efficient infringement” where it’s cheaper to infringe rather than buy companies they like Kiani said.



“When most companies see something they like they either license it or acquire it. What [Apple does] instead is use their image to attract their employees and pay them a lot more money than what the market normally pays.”



Masimo in court filings said it didn’t discover its trade secrets were being used until 2019 because Apple kept the patents hidden until they were approved.

Future Focus



Both companies’ CEOs have ambitious goals in delivering their health-focused products to more consumers.



Apple’s Cook has stated that the Cupertino’s company’s greatest contribution to the world will ultimately be in health and the company’s health-related features in its smartwatch are among the most visible examples of its focus there.



Masimo’s products have largely been used in hospital settings but last year it rolled out products to monitor COVID-19 patients remotely. Kiani expects a similar at-home monitoring offering for opioid users to be well-received in the market.



Court documents indicate that Masimo has its own wireless wearable devices for the consumer market in development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yMi91cy9zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLWF1dG9ncmFwaC1tYW51YWwtdHJuZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wOC8yMi91cy9zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLWF1dG9ncmFwaC1tYW51YWwtdHJuZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs just sold for nearly $800000,"CNN —

If you thought Apple computers were expensive you haven’t seen what their manuals go for.

Boston-based RR Auction on Thursday sold an Apple II manual signed by the company’s late co-founder Steve Jobs for a whopping $787484.

The computer’s 196-page manual is signed and inscribed opposite the Table of Contents: “Julian Your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! steven jobs 1980.”

It’s also signed by Mike Markkula an early investor in Apple and the company’s second CEO.

The manual was signed while Jobs and Markkula were in the United Kingdom promoting Apple RR Auction said in a statement announcing the sale. The recipient was Julian Brewer the son of an entrepreneur who worked with Apple to distribute their products in the UK.

“I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests” Brewer said. “To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad so I feel the inscription was made with care.”

Launched in 1977 the Apple II was the company’s first successful product and is generally regarded as one of the first computers made for the mass market. The first computer spreadsheet VisiCalc was written for the Apple II in 1979 and expanded the computer’s popularity to the business market.

The manual detailed the Apple II's technical architecture and even featured a fold-out schematic of its main logic board. Courtesy RR Auction

“Whereas the Apple I was primarily for hobbyists with less than 200 units made the Apple II truly ‘changed the world’ by giving around 6 million homes and businesses their first taste of personal computing. Apple II’s revenues supported Apple’s successful floatation the biggest tech IPO of the time” RR Auction said.

Jim Irsay owner of the Indianapolis Colts placed the winning bid for the manual.

“When we think of the greatest most innovative minds of the past two centuries Steve Jobs must certainly be included among them” Irsay said in a statement provided to the auction house. “Jobs was a truly transformative figure who changed the way in which human beings think do business and interact on a daily basis.”

RR Auction also sold other items related to Jobs and Apple including a signed letter from Jobs in which he ironically states: “I’m afraid I don’t sign autographs.”

This is a great starting point for investors who want to learn about these companies before investing in them.

GAFAM stocks is an acronym referring to the technology giants: Google LLC (NYSE: GOOGL) Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Facebook Inc (NYSE: FB) Amazon.com Inc (NYSE: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NYSE: MSFT). GAFAM was a term used for years in the financial sector by insiders and analysts when attempting to gauge the performance of these five companies against one another. The acronym resulted from their growing presence in the information technology sector. GAFAM group has been extremely successful since its inception. However they also have different business models and structures making it difficult to compare them using conventional methods.

GAFAM benchmarking is gaining popularity amongst portfolio managers as well as hedge fund managers because it eliminates many risks associated with investing based on company-specific news stories or macroeconomic factors outside the control of both.

How to Invest in GAFAM Stocks

Investors seeking exposure to GAFAM stocks can consider GAFAM ETFs GAFAM mutual funds and GAFAM index funds. GAFAM ETFs track an index of GAFAM Stocks. GAFAM mutual funds and GAFAM index funds are actively managed so their portfolios will differ from the GAFAM stock indexes that they aim to track. Other options include investing in individual GAFAM stocks directly or through exchange-traded notes (ETNs). Investors who want to invest in more than one GAFAM company can create a basket of stocks by buying a fund that invests in all five companies.

Google

Google is a web search engine that allows people to use its technology to find information on the Internet. Serving more than 1 billion unique users per month and indexing billions of web pages Google remains one of the most important sources of data on the world wide web. Its co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin initially coined its name as “googol” (which means one followed by 100 zeros) that has become synonymous with incredible amounts of digital information.

Google is one of the most dominating search engines in the world and it’s not difficult to see why. With a market share of over 90% Google generates its revenue on advertisements posted on its site. It also makes money from sponsored links that appear alongside normal results. Google has also invested heavily in future technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality. And this could be where Google will get its income from in coming years.

Google’s performance in the stock exchange has been excellent over the past two decades as it has grown to be worth over $600 billion as of August 2021.

Apple

Apple Inc. is one of the largest technology companies in the world with a variety of products including laptops iPhones iPods and iPads.

The company was officially incorporated on January 3 1977 by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Its first product was the Apple I motherboard in 1985. For more than three decades Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers including the Apple II Macintosh and Power Mac lines. However it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s.

As of 2021 Apple is one of the top tech companies in the world. It sells its products worldwide through its retail stores online stores direct sales force and third-party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value-added resellers to the consumer and also sells third-party iPhone iPad Mac and iPod compatible products including application software and accessories through its online and retail stores.

Facebook

Facebook holds a significant audience to target with advertisements which have taken over from traditional modes. Its large user base and sizable viewership provide ample opportunities for business on the platform.

Facebook’s stock price has been climbing drastically over the last couple of years with its market capitalization increasing significantly during that time. The company reported a Market Capitalization of $985.92 billion for its second fiscal quarter in 2021. The uptrend is expected to continue. Facebook stocks are in the surge as of August 2021 making it a good asset to invest in as there is a likelihood of the investor gaining significant profits through this investment.

Amazon

Amazon appeared as a web-based quality assurance tool in 1994. The company now serves consumers sellers developers enterprises such as the content creators of movies and books. Amazon provides advertising services for publishers of products like phone chargers books etc.

What Is the Difference between FAANG and GAFAM Stocks?

When comparing the terms GAFAM and FAANG Netflix Inc (NYSE: NFLX) is swapped with Microsoft in the GAFAM. Only four of the firms in FAANG are in the technology industry. Meanwhile Netflix is an entertainment corporation that provides clients with a wide variety of programs web series and movies. It is a wholly different industry from IT and is mainly associated with media. If you haven’t noticed the acronym GAFAM includes all of those firms that were previously in FAANG (the exception being Netflix).

You might be wondering why Amazon is included in the list considering that it happens to be a consumer services company. Amazon does provide cloud-hosting for companies so they contribute to the technology sector with this in mind. For instance AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a hosting service that allows online publishing tools and website providers.

GAFAM Stocks in the COVID-19 Pandemic

The coronavirus pandemic not only caused many deaths but also provoked the decline of the world’s economy. Many businesses also recorded massive losses as a result of the deadly disease.

However things are different for the tech giants (GAFAM). As the pandemic worsened people started to work from home. People were forced to employ technology for this to happen. In particular people used Google services to attend interviews and also when there was a need to communicate with customers. People also opted to buy goods through online platforms like Amazon. At the same time many idle people flooded social media platforms like Facebook. All this increased the revenue of the tech companies.

Conclusion

Stocks of companies like Google Apple Facebook Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM) have been growing with significant values. Market analysts believe that the digital world would not be possible without these high-priced tech giants. Each company has a market value that ranges from $500 billion to around $1 as of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTkxNjkxMy8xOTgwLUFwcGxlLUlJLW1hbnVhbC1zaWduZWQtU3RldmUtSm9icy1zZWxscy1uZWFybHktODAwLTAwMC1Db2x0cy1vd25lci5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTkxNjkxMy9hbXAvMTk4MC1BcHBsZS1JSS1tYW51YWwtc2lnbmVkLVN0ZXZlLUpvYnMtc2VsbHMtbmVhcmx5LTgwMC0wMDAtQ29sdHMtb3duZXIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1980 Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs sells for nearly $800000 to Colts owner,"A 41-year-old Apple II computer manual signed by late Apple founder Steve Jobs himself fetched a whopping $800000 at an auction last week and the buyer happened to be Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay.

Capacitive deionization as a novel water treatment technology has aroused great concern due to unique and high ion selectivity compared with traditional methods (reverse osmosis adsorption etc.). The results was published on ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces.

Recently researchers at the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed a pseudo-capacitive electrode with high absorption capacity selectivity and stability for electro-sorption of hardness ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+).

They prepared manganese spinel ferrite (MFO) nanospheres as pseudocapacitive cathode to assemble hybrid capacitive deionization system with commercial activated carbon for water softening.

Then superb electro-affinity and corresponding high hardness selectivity of hardness ions in multi-cation solution (Na+ Ca2+ and Mg2+) were found in which cyclic voltammetry tests in multi-ion electrolyte and molecular dynamics simulations also support this experimental result.

This research work is of great significance for exploring capacitive deionization pseudo-capacitive electrode materials with high efficiency and selective electrosorption of target ions and hard water softening.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Mais qui était l’inventeur de la photo couleur ? Cet été le Petit Bleu vous raconte sa vie son œuvre et tout l’héritage de cet illustre Agenais.

En 1874 Louis Ducos du Hauron avait fait breveter un appareil équipé d’un seul objectif et de miroirs semi-transparents au sein duquel la lumière est décomposée par trois filtres de couleurs primaires. Le physicien Étienne Wallon en présente une version plus élaborée le 3 décembre 1987 à la Société Française de Photographie nommant l’étrange appareil ""chromographoscope"" tel que l’avait baptisé son concepteur Louis Ducos du Hauron. Ce dernier l’avait fabriqué avec l’aide de l’habile constructeur Hermann Joseph Hubert Mackenstein (1). Une révolution car l’appareil est le premier à proposer une opération unique de pose grâce à une glace sensible unique dans l’obtention des trois épreuves négatives.

En fait il s’agit d’un habile montage de miroirs et lames transparentes disposées à 45° qui divise ainsi le faisceau lumineux en trois parties afin d’impressionner la glace sensible. En outre comme la lumière est décomposée en parties d’inégales quantités puisqu’elles sont soumises au même temps de pose l’appareil permet de régler la quantité de lumière pour chacune d’elles. Enfin pour réduire la problématique de l’assemblage des trois monochromes l’appareil dispose d’un dispositif permettant de générer un repérage automatique et précis assurant une superposition optimum.

L’association des Amis de Louis Ducos du Hauron a longuement cherché un exemplaire de cet appareil très rare. Vainement. En dépit de cause Louis Sentis éminent membre de l’association et spécialiste de la photographie 3D a décidé d’en fabriquer un. Il en résulte une chambre photographique relativement massive qui limitait son utilisation en studio.

Le 14 décembre 1885 Louis Ducos du Hauron avait pris à la préfecture d’Alger un nouveau brevet d’invention (N° 173101) pour un nouvel appareil produisant trois images simultanées engendrées par un même faisceau lumineux qui prendra plus tard le nom de ""mélanochromoscope"". Il ne s’agit ni plus ni moins d’une amélioration du ""chromographoscope"" et qui par ses dimensions permettait de réaliser des photographies en extérieur. Un exemplaire de cet appareil sera exposé dans une des salles que le musée d’art d’Agen consacrera à Louis Ducos du Hauron l’automne prochain.

(1) Né en Allemagne il s’installe à Paris comme menuisier alors qu’il n’a que 25 ans. Petit à petit il va réaliser de la sous-traitance d’ébénisterie photographique avant de développer sa propre gamme d’appareils qui deviendront une référence en la matière lui permettant d’ouvrir un magasin avenue de l’Opéra à Paris.

Pour l’avant-dernier concert de cette 46e saison c’est le célèbre titulaire de la cathédrale de Monaco Olivier Vernet qui tiendra les commandes du grand orgue de Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges ce samedi 21 août à 20 h 30. Et ce à la demande de son confrère et ami Jean-Patrice Brosse souffrant.

Olivier Vernet est l’un des tout premiers représentants de réputation mondiale de la grande école d’orgue française. Disciple de Gaston Litaize de Marie-Claire Alain et Michel Chapuis au conservatoire de Paris il est nommé en 2006 sur concours titulaire du prestigieux orgue de la cathédrale de Monaco assurant tout à la fois l’enseignement à l’Académie de musique Rainier III et au conservatoire de Nice et la direction artistique des festivals d’orgue de Monaco et Mougins. Son répertoire est considérable mais il a voulu rester fidèle pour ce concert de samedi au programme initialement consacré à Jean-Sébastien Bach avec : des œuvres célèbres du cantor comme la Toccata dorienne ou la Fantaisie et fugue en sol ; des œuvres plus contemplatives choisies parmi les chorales s’inscrivant dans le thème de l’année ""l’Europe romantique"". Petite nouveauté cette saison et pour la troisième fois le public pourra voir et entendre car il bénéficiera à nouveau d’une projection vidéo sur grand écran où chacun aura le plaisir de voir l’organiste Olivier Vernet au travail.

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At a Dinner Trump Assailed Climate Rules and Asked $1 Billion From Big Oil,"Former President Donald J.

About 20 people attended an April 11 event billed as an “energy round table” at Mr. Trump’s private club according to those people who asked not to be identified in order to discuss the private event. Attendees included executives from ExxonMobil EQT Corporation and the American Petroleum Institute which lobbies for the oil industry.

The event was organized by the oil billionaire Harold Hamm who has for years helped to shape Republican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post.

Mr. Trump has publicly railed for months against President Biden’s energy and environmental agenda as Mr. Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Mr. Trump had weakened or erased while in office. In particular Mr. Trump has promised to eliminate Mr. Biden’s new climate rules intended to accelerate the nation’s transition to electric vehicles and to push a “drill baby drill” agenda aimed at opening up more public lands to oil and gas exploration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"A Boeing 737 skidded off a runway at an airport in Senegal’s capital injuring at least 11 people and grounding all operations while crew assisted with an evacuation of the aircraft.

The plane skidded into the grass that flanked the runway where crew were able to deploy the side exit ramps and ferry passengers off the plane as it started to burn.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

Click the links for the other installments: Part One (published May 30) Part Two (published June 12) and Part Three (published June 30).

The state of Colorado has implemented significant regulatory goals to reduce pollution and safety risks associated with oil and gas production but industry professionals say they’ve been working on this for several years.

Companies across the globe have developed and implemented new technology primarily over two decades including horizontal drilling leak detection and repair more efficient machinery and digital monitoring.

Colorado producers including Chevron and PDC Energy have deployed these new techniques in an effort to reduce their impact on the environment and surrounding communities.

“I think it’s really important to continue to decrease our footprint and increase the speed in which potential issues are resolved” PDC senior asset engineer Brian Cocchiere said. “We want a full line of sight into our potential operational impacts. It’s really amazing to see how far we’ve come in these areas within the last decade.”

Noteworthy operational and mechanical upgrades

Cocchiere was initially drawn to the industry because of its technology and has worked to make the process cleaner and more efficient. He works on regulatory policy implementation and developing plans to reduce the company’s impact.

The first significant change Cocchiere saw within the industry was the move to horizontal drilling. He said sites used to feature multiple vertical drills in a small area. Now the company can drill up to 3 miles horizontally developing 4 or 5 miles worth of minerals with one surface location.

PDC reduced oil and gas land use by 85% in some locations. Cocchiere said horizontal drilling and the fewer number of wells helps the company with land reclamation the process by which operators restore sites after production as well.

Chevron’s Mustang Comprehensive Drilling Plan approved by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission includes development on 64000 acres in southeast Weld County. The ability to drill horizontally allows the company to combine facilities and reduce surface impact and emissions.

Paula Beasley Chevron communications adviser said the plan helps guide long-term development around seasonal crops wildlife patterns and other external forces.

The company also includes the “latest technology” at these facilities Beasley said.

Compression engines and drilling rigs are often powered by electricity. Beasley said using electricity significantly reduces the “ozone precursor emissions” such as nitrous oxides.

Chevron and PDC both use solar panels to help power its facilities and drilling sites.

Additionally both companies improved the design of their facilities and rely on tankless projects which transport processed hydrocarbons through pipelines instead of trucks. This reduces emissions traffic and the risk of leaks.

Beasley said the newest Chevron facilities in Colorado produce 90% less greenhouse gas emissions than older designs. The company can also produce the same volume on 7.5 surface acres as it once did using 400 acres.

Chevron has eliminated more than 152 million miles of truck traffic due to the tankless operations as well Beasley said.

PDC boasts a 26% decrease of greenhouse gas emission intensity from 2019 to 2020 and a 32% decrease in methane emission intensity during the same time period.

Another way PDC reduces its emissions is through improved regular monitoring. PDC inspects the sights sounds and smells of its locations to predict and prevent leaks or other damage. The data obtained helps operators track levels of volatile organic compounds that can cause serious health effects at certain levels.

Infrared cameras and temperature guns detect tank fluid levels and production. These can also be used for leak detection and repair commonly known as LDAR.

One of the largest changes that the average resident might not know about however is the reliance on improved software and digital connectivity.

While many monitoring processes still occur on-site companies have strengthened their remote capabilities.

PDC has 24/7 field monitoring that allows employees to check sites and data from any location. For example some devices are used to detect increased levels of VOCs or noise in real time and actively manage the situation.

Cocchiere said the company is testing a pilot program at one of its new sites that uses infrared cameras and artificial intelligence. The machinery uses algorithms that can supposedly detect gas leaks monitor tank levels and provide security. He said the program is designed to give employees another way to respond immediately to any on-site situations.

Virtually all remote monitoring solutions can be accessed through mobile applications.

Chevron operates a 24/7 control center to monitor its projects across the state.

Other companies use sonar aerial underwater and virtual reality systems in their planning and monitoring. These are expensive and often reserved for major sites.

“These advancements that we’re seeing are focused on reducing any of our potential impacts and protecting public health safety welfare environment and wildlife resources” Cocchiere said. “What we’ve done the last decade I’m really looking forward to what the next decade brings.”

The Tribune contacted Extraction Oil and Gas Occidental and Atmos Energy for this story. None responded to multiple interview requests.

Driving progress forward

As the industry moves forward companies are setting goals to continue making progress.

PDC wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% and reduce its methane emissions 50% by 2025.

Chevron plans to invest $3 billion by 2028 to “advance our energy transition strategy” Beasley said. This means lowering carbon intensity investing in more renewables and investing in low-carbon tech.

“As a company we take actions that drive measurable progress toward our commitments” Beasley said in a statement. “This means reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets increasing the use of renewables and offsets in support of our business and investing in low-carbon technologies that can enable commercial solutions. These actions will make energy and supply chains more sustainable helping industries and our customers realize their own lower-carbon goals.”

The state of Colorado has shared its desire to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and completely transition to “clean” energy by 2040.

Industry professionals previously told the Tribune that this is likely not possible. In fact oil and gas is expected to remain a primary energy industry — even with less carbon — worldwide. The International Energy Agency estimates that roughly 50% of the world’s energy production will come from oil and natural gas.

The Atlantic Council said in a report it’s possible to meet dependency reduction goals but the likelihood of success is predicated more on politics than technology.

“Affordable reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to achieving a more prosperous and sustainable world for all people” Beasley said. “Oil and natural gas have a vital role to play in any global transition of energy by providing scalable lower-carbon solutions that meet growing energy demands.”

Continued development concerns

Even with ongoing discussions about impact mitigation and continued emissions reduction some people maintain concerns about the industry.

Residents in Erie and Greeley spoke to the Tribune in June about their experiences living fewer than 2000 feet from oil and gas developments.

Geoff Winterbourne and Lowell Lewis both said they understand the significance of the industry but knowing the importance doesn’t stop the traffic or pollution.

“Putting mitigation measures into place and adopting new equipment standards is certainly better than doing nothing” League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans Deputy Director Andrew Forkes-Gudmundson said in a statement. “None of that changes the fact that oil and exploration and production is one of the highest sources of dangerous harmful emissions in the state.”

LOGIC represents Coloradans who have been affected by oil and gas developments including the residents in Erie.

Forkes-Gudmundson said the industry is “harmful by nature” and technology won’t change it.

Additionally certain regulations may not apply to projects that have been completed or have received permitting. This was seen when the Biden Administration halted permit distribution on federal lands. It only affected projects requesting permitting not ones that had already been awarded.

“The best and only certain way to clean up our air reduce pollution and cease the harm from oil and gas development is (to) decrease production and begin as soon as possible a transition to a non-fossil fuel economy” Forkes-Gudmundson said.

When asked how they would respond to continued concerns about the industry Cocchiere and Beasley said the employees are also community members. These people are invested in the places they live and work and they’re affected by industry decisions like everyone else.

Cocchiere said PDC is focused on “doing right by the communities” and encourages honest dialogue between stakeholders. Meanwhile Chevron wants to provide cleaner energy continue advancement and be a good neighbor.

“This goes beyond continuously improving our operations. We believe investing in basic human needs education and training and local business development is important to strengthening communities and promoting greater economic and social stability” Beasley said. “Through contributions sponsorships in-kind donations partnerships and volunteerism we seek to make a difference in Colorado and our Weld County communities.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

However the technology is evolving beyond simple monitoring and it’s becoming possible to analyze and predict outcomes based on data inputs from monitoring devices.

The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and data science in the horticulture sector are game-changing technologies that help growers realize the power of data in the greenhouse to increase efficiency quality and yield. AI involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. This means creating algorithms to classify analyze and draw predictions from data. It also involves acting on data learning from new data and improving over time.

How AI and Data Science are Transforming the Industry

There are three key reasons that AI is set to change how greenhouse and indoor farms operate:

AI has a tremendous potential to help greenhouses meet the expanding demand for fresh and sustainable food production while ensuring critical resources such as water and inputs such as phosphorous are conserved. Greenhouses and indoor growing facilities are increasingly important in meeting these demands for food in the future. Big data creates great potential for personal and local solutions. The quality and quantity of data is important for growers to optimize their production but it is tedious to ingest and digest it. The data has many useful applications in greenhouse operations. One such application is forecasting. Grodan’s latest innovation e-Gro for example enables accurate yield prediction up to four weeks. Growers benefit from AI-based predictions and data-driven insights in the greenhouse. Automation will greatly improve efficiency. Manual labor is still required in the greenhouse for planting crop registration harvesting and other activities. It is time consuming and repetitive. The need for automation is not just for efficiency-related reasons but also health and security as we have witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Combining data and plant science has the potential to increase efficiency and sustainability. Cultivation has many sources of usable data including plant growth rootzone climate conditions etc. Collecting all that data can be time-consuming and prone to errors; however high-tech systems can collect all of the data from sensors and images analyze the information and provide insights and KPIs.

Combining Data Science with Plant Science

Plant Science is a classical science involving plant physiology genetics and growing. Data Science is the science of extracting useful and actionable knowledge from raw data. When the grower’s expertise is augmented by rich data and smart algorithms that identify correlations and even causations the result is data-driven cultivation that can give a better crop quality increased yield and more efficiency.

Plant and data science models are unique for every grower because every grower is different and their specific growing conditions must be considered. Each greenhouse location type of greenhouse and growing media is unique. The variety directly affects growth and yield. Personalized data modeling and working with the right program is essential. For example Grodan developed the data platform e-Gro with complex algorithms that account for the variety and analyze your personal greenhouse data in real-time.

Data-driven growing is gradually becoming essential because of the complexity of the issues facing growers. The facilities that get the strongest gains and return on investment from AI and data science understand that predictive analytics such as using data to forecast future harvest and prescriptive analytics using data inputs to help with better decision making requires solid data collection for at least one growing season. These analytical models need to be customized to include the real-life behaviors of plants versus the theoretical plant physiology models as there are many external and unexpected factors in growing such as extreme climate conditions price fluctuations pests and diseases labor issues etc. With good quality data input robust algorithms can be built and the processing of greenhouse data will give very high-value actionable results in all parameters of growth.

AI and Big Data Enable the Upscaling of Greenhouses

Data gives growers more control in the greenhouse. The overwhelming trend today is towards sustainable production. Data-driven cultivation improves the quality of the final yield (e.g. the appearance of the fruit) and enhances the nutritional value of the fruit. The interest in AI and new technologies is increasing. The scale of cultivation companies is increasing and the required upscaling introduces new challenges. Machine learning AI and data science can provide an answer. There is also an increasing number of multi-state and multi-nation operations and data systems that make it possible to run the company remotely while operations are optimized at each greenhouse.

Data-driven cultivation is transforming the greenhouse and indoor growing industry. The challenges the industry faces with food demand resource scarcity changing market conditions and increasing scale creates urgency to gain control over cultivation systems. Growers have a greater degree of control of their production systems and with the adoption of AI and data science they will have the power to truly optimize the performance of their crops. The more data that can be fused from various sources within the greenhouse and indoor farm the more precise the growing process can be. Data-driven software platforms that utilize powerful algorithms based on deep horticulture knowledge combined with data science are important tools to effectively leverage the power of AI in the greenhouse and indoor farm.

""As a derivative of the Israeli high-tech boom we have seen in recent years how QA roles experienced a significant acceleration - with the understanding that the success of product development depends very much on the testing process. Therefore testing processes are an integral part of the development processes"" said Shahar Sheinfeld QA Manager at Noname Security.

According to Yaniv Aroch QA director at Hysolate ""there has been an increase in the demand for QA employees in recent years because companies place more emphasis on quality especially when there is competition for each user.""

Despite a trend in some companies to let go of QA personnel and have the testing done by the developers Daniel Tabin-Rotem Radis' human resources manager said that the need for QA staff is visible.

""The need to look at the product and the system as a whole to understand how the customer thinks and uses the product becomes very important. The work of QA staff as part of the development process varies and includes working with programmers as well as close cooperation with product managers.”

The starting salary for QA staff is about NIS 10000 per month (a little more than $3000) and it can increase based on the employees’ experience and abilities. In some places an academic degree is not required nor is it necessary to have experience. ""What characterizes a suitable candidate is first and foremost a spark in the eye - a desire to learn and explore new things since a worker with desire and passion can learn while on the job. At Noname for example we care about experience in backend testing understanding software interfaces (APIs) and experience in setting up cloud infrastructure those will be an advantage"" said Sheinfeld.

Apart from high motivation and a desire to learn QA staff should also have a technological orientation and according to Arochof the gap between today's testers and programmers in the technological context is getting smaller. In addition software testers should have a 'tester state of mind’. ""A good QA is required to think outside the box how to fail the system how to find the errors and where they are hidden meaning a tester way of thinking is necessary for success.""

Sheinfeld for example has a bachelor's degree in computer science with extensive experience in managing QA teams but others have reached QA positions without any technological background or experience. For example Vered Oria a senior data science analyst at Armis came to the company with no technological background and no experience in QA. ""Ermis decided to take a chance on me. I benefited from being one of the first employees in the company and built the initial infrastructure. I grew with the company and the knowledge I gained in a QA role helped me get where I am at today” she said.

Fred Sharp who nicknamed himself ""Bond"" after the film spy according to court filings is one of six British Columbians charged by the regulator with ""violating anti-fraud provisions"" of the U.S. Securities Act.

Sharp and two of his fellow B.C. defendants are also facing conspiracy and securities fraud charges by the U.S. Justice Department.

""Sharp masterminded ... long-running fraudulent schemes that collectively generated hundreds of millions of dollars from unlawful stock sales"" between 2011 and 2018 the SEC said on Aug. 12 .

Also facing SEC charges are six of Sharp's alleged ""associates"": Zhiying Gasarch of Richmond B.C.; Surrey resident Courtney Kelln; North Vancouver's Mike Veldhuis; Jackson Friesen of Delta; Paul Sexton of Anmore B.C.; and Avtar Singh Dhillon a Canadian living in California.

The U.S. stock market regulator alleges the co-accused ""frequently collaborated with Sharp to dump huge stock positions while hiding their control positions.""

The SEC's move comes after the U.S. Justice Department criminally charged Sharp with securities fraud and conspiracy on Aug. 5 — charges also faced by fellow British Columbians Veldhuis and Kelln.

None of the criminal or securities charges have been proven in court.

""Sharp and his co-conspirators are accused of executing a sophisticated global con that allegedly bilked unsuspecting investors out of tens of millions of dollars"" said Joseph Bonavolonta the FBI Boston's special agent in charge who helped lead the criminal investigation.

In 2016 CBC News was one of only two news outlets in Canada with complete access to all of the financial documents leaked from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca part of a massive international investigative journalism collaboration known as the ""Panama Papers.""

Sharp's company Corporate House was known as the go-to investment firm for wealthy Canadians who wanted to keep assets private and use offshore tax havens to minimize their tax burden according to sources in the wealth management industry CBC News learned.

He created more than 1200 corporate entities linked to Canada making him the most significant Canadian player in the Panama Papers trove. According to documents obtained by CBC News at the time the Sharp-associated companies were instructed not to send any account statements or invoices by mail email or fax but to destroy them.

""Printed invoices or statement of accts [sic] should be destroyed"" the instructions stated.

At the time of the Panama Papers release Sharp told CBC News in an email ""Tax planning is a global reality that results from international competition and inefficient governmental regulation ... and is legal.""

A ""pump-and-dump"" investment scheme is one in which companies' stock prices are artificially inflated allowing some shareholders to sell their stock at artificially high prices to other investors according to the FBI.

Sharp ""used the code name 'Bond' (styling himself after the fictional character James Bond)"" the Securities and Exchange Commission said in court documents and ""was the mastermind and leader"" of a company whose clients included ""individuals seeking fraudulently to sell stock in the markets to retail investors — and with various offshore trading platforms.""

Another James Bond connection appeared in Sharp's company accounting system which the SEC said he named after fictional senior spy ""Q"" in the Bond franchise. The role of ""Q"" according to the court filings was ""to conceal and obscure the actual ownership and control of the stock they were surreptitiously selling.""

Sharp is a former Vancouver lawyer who was suspended in 1995 by the Law Society of British Columbia  which ruled he ""knowingly took instructions from a person who was ... disqualified from acting as an officer or director of a public company because of a criminal record for fraud"" and for delivering a client's nearly $500000 cheque ""knowing that [the client] had no funds in its bank account available.""

BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2NvdmlkLXBwcC1sb2FuLWZvcmdpdmVuZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks Are Opting Out of the Government's PPP Loan Forgiveness Process,"At least three major banks have decided to opt out of a new process for getting Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven directly by the Small Business Administration The Intercept has learned leaving their small business customers with no other recourse if the banks refuse to forgive loans or drag out the process.

Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and PNC have all decided to opt out according to emails shared with The Intercept.

They are major players in the program which Congress created to offer businesses loans to spend on payroll and other qualified expenses to help weather the shutdowns. As of the end of May JPMorgan Chase was the top PPP lender followed by Bank of America in the No. 2 spot; PNC is No. 11. All told lenders representing just half of all outstanding PPP loan forgiveness applications have opted in according to the SBA.

PNC recently sent an email to Jesse Grund owner of personal training studio Unconventional Strength in Orlando Florida saying “Considering we have already built a streamlined end-to-end digital portal and associated review process for your PPP forgiveness application; we will be opting out of using the SBA’s forgiveness portal.”

Grund still hasn’t had his $5000 PPP loan forgiven and was instead told by PNC that his “Correct Maximum Loan Amount” was just $917 leaving him on the hook for the rest. “It’s PNC’s fault I got this money” he said. “Now you guys want to come back at me for it.”

Early in the pandemic small business owners were urged to flock to the Paycheck Protection Program. The loans were made with the promise that they would be forgiven and essentially turned into grants if used properly.

But many small business owners have struggled to get their loans forgiven by the banks that issued them. Banks were incentivized to issue PPP loans through the fees they generated but they don’t receive any fees to push forgiveness through and they’ve dragged their feet. Of the total PPP loans that have been issued less than half have been forgiven thus far.

In response the Small Business Administration the government agency tasked with running the program announced in late July that it would offer small business owners who took out PPP loans of $150000 or less a way to bypass intransigent banks and seek forgiveness directly from the agency. Congress had at one point late last year considered automatically forgiving all loans under $150000 but it never followed through.

But there was fine print in the SBA’s recent announcement that many may have missed: Banks actually have to opt into the direct process for small business owners to access it. And at least three major ones have refused.

“Forcing lenders to opt-in to the process could have been disruptive” said SBA spokesperson Terrence D. Clark in an email. He noted that lenders continue to opt in and that the agency is conducting outreach to encourage them to participate. “[W]e speak to lenders daily” he said. In a statement SBA Associate Administrator for the Office of Capital Access Patrick Kelley said “We encourage all lenders to opt-in to this tested portal.”

When asked for an explanation as to why the bank decided to bar its customers from the SBA’s direct forgiveness option a PNC spokesperson pointed to a statement that said “[L]enders that participate in the SBA’s forgiveness portal are still responsible for reviewing and issuing forgiveness decisions to the SBA. We would therefore still need to ensure borrowers meet loan eligibility and loan forgiveness requirements regardless of whether we chose to use the SBA forgiveness portal or not.”

Chase offered no explanation in its correspondence to its customers. In an email sent to a small business owner it said simply “[W]e’re continuing with our simple process and not participating in the new SBA direct program.” In response to a request for comment a Chase spokesperson said over email “Chase customers should submit their forgiveness applications through our platform” adding “We have a simple process that takes under 10 minutes to complete.”

For some business owners being cut off from the SBA’s direct program could mean they can’t get some or all of their loans forgiven at all. Some banks have been contacting small business owners in recent months and telling them that they shouldn’t have received the original amount they received — which the banks themselves approved — and requiring the owners to pay back the difference. But many told The Intercept that they used the money correctly and had fully expected to have their entire loans forgiven.

That’s what happened to Warren Davis owner of fundraising consultancy Warren Davis Consulting LLC who received his loan from Chase and was recently told the bank won’t let him seek forgiveness directly from the SBA. After the bank originally issued him a $6812 PPP loan he was later told he was only eligible for $1795.53 in forgiveness. Now he must pay Chase $460.01 on the first of every month with two years to pay the remainder of the loan off. “That loan payment is the second highest payment I now have besides my rent which is also due on the 1st” he said in an email. “I have tried trying to get answers numerous times from Chase with no luck over the months.”

In response to situations like Davis’s the Chase spokesperson said “Small businesses must meet the standards to qualify for forgiveness whether they go through their lender or directly through the SBA.”

When asked why Bank of America has opted out spokesperson Bill Halldin said “Because our portal is simplified and has been out there for six months” adding that if the bank opted in “we would have to develop a new interface.” The bank is reviewing whether to join the SBA’s process but “at this point our simplified portal is delivering what people want” he said.

But that portal is not delivering what Amy Yassinger needs. Yassinger owner of a music company that offers party bands for weddings in Illinois was encouraged by Bank of America to apply for a PPP loan early in the pandemic. The bank helped her with the process assuring her its underwriting team “would make sure everything was solid” she said in an email. She used the $38730 to pay employees as if they were working their regular slate of events despite widespread cancellations as well as to cover some nonpayroll expenses.

Yet 11 months after she got her loan the bank told her it would only submit $2436 to the SBA for forgiveness. “It was one thing to have my life completely gutted for over a year as my company was forced to cancel or postpone over 60 events in 2020” she said. “It is another to have Bank of America want $36000 out of $38730 back in the next 5 years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9nYW1lL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTMyNjkyMi9yYXZlbnMtcGFudGhlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ravens 20-3 Panthers (Aug 21 2021) Final Score,"Titans expect WR Treylon Burks to 'carve out a role' in 2024

The scenes of Afghans trying to get onto US planes at the airport to escape seem startlingly familiar to those of us who can remember the last days of Saigon.

But is this a superficial similarity? After allAmerica’s occupation of Vietnam was way more costly as a share of US national output and in terms of the lives of American soldiers than the attempt at ‘regime’ change in Afghanistan. The Vietnam disaster led to the US government running deficits for the first time since WW2. But even more important it meant a diversion of investment into arms rather than productive sectors at a time when the profitability of capital had already begun to fall the Golden Age of investment and profitability having peaked in the mid-1960s.



Source: Penn World Tables 10.0 author’s calculations

Indeed by the end of the 1960s it was clear that the US could never win in Vietnam just as it was clear at least a decade ago (if not from the very beginning) that it could not win in Afghanistan. But the ruling elite continued under Nixon and Kissinger to prosecute the war for several more years spreading it into neighbouring countries like Laos and Cambodia.

But by the official end of the war in Vietnam the economic consequences of this 30-year ‘intervention’ exposed an important turning point – the end of Pax Americana and the outright hegemonic position of American imperialism in the world economy. From then on we can talk about the relative decline (relative to other imperialist powers) of the US with the rise of the European countries Japan East Asia and more recently China. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s the end of the ‘cold war’ did not reverse or even curb that relative decline. The US no longer can rule the world on its own and even with the help of a ‘coalition of the willing’ it cannot dictate a ‘world order’.

Economically it all started before the fall of Saigon. As the profitability of US capital started to fall from the mid-1960s US industry began to lose its competitive advantage in manufacturing and even in various services to rising Franco-German capital and Japan. This eventually meant that the economic world order after WW2 which had established the economic hegemony of the US economy and its currency the dollar started to crumble.

Indeed it is 50 years to the month when officials of President Nixon’s administration met secretly at Camp David to decide on the fate of the international monetary system. For the previous 25 years the US dollar had been fixed to the price of gold ($35/oz) by international agreement. Anybody holding a dollar could convert into a fixed amount of gold from US reserves. But in August 1971 President Nixon took to national television to announce he had asked Treasury Secretary John Connally to “suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets.”

It was the end of the so-called Bretton Woods agreement so painfully negotiated by the Allied powers namely the US and the UK over the heads of all the other countries in the world. Conceived along with the IMF IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.



When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.



As for the World Bank a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 1768% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).



The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (1674%) Japan (623%) Germany (581%) France (429%) and the UK (429%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (657% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (155% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.



http://imf.org  the World Bank World Bank

WB The World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states’ contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.



It consists of several closely associated institutions among which :



1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD 189 members in 2017) which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;



2. The International Development Association (IDA 159 members in 1997) which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;



3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.



As Third World Debt gets worse the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries’ payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF’s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates.



and the UN the agreement established a framework that committed all to fixed exchange rates for their currencies and fixed in terms of the US dollar. The US in turn would fix the value of the dollar in terms of gold. No country could change their rates without IMF agreement.

But with Nixon’s announcement the fixed exchange rate regime was ended; it was the US that had abandoned it and with it the whole post-war Keynesian-style international currency regime. It was no accident that the ending of the Bretton Woods system also coincided with the ending of Keynesian macro management of the US and other economies through the manipulation of government spending and taxation. The post-war economic boom based on high profitability relatively full employment and productive investment was over. Now there was a decline in the profitability of capital and investment growth which eventually culminated in the first post-war international slump of 1974-5; and alongside this was the relative decline of American industry and exports compared to competitors. The US was no longer exporting more manufacturing goods to Europe Latin America or Asia than it was importing commodities Commodities The goods exchanged on the commodities market traditionally raw materials such as metals and fuels and cereals. like oil from the Middle East and manufacturing from Germany and Japan. It was starting to run trade deficits. The dollar was thus seriously overvalued. If US capital particularly manufacturing was to compete the dollar fix to gold must be ended and the currency allowed to depreciate.

As early as 1959 Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin had predicted that the US could not go on running trade deficits with other countries and export capital to invest abroad and maintain a strong dollar: “if the United States continued to run deficits its foreign liabilities Liabilities The part of the balance-sheet that comprises the resources available to a company (equity provided by the partners provisions for risks and charges debts). would come to exceed by far its ability to convert dollars into gold on demand and would bring about a “gold and dollar crisis.”

And that is what happened. Under the dollar-gold standard imbalances in trade and capital flows had to be settled by transfers of gold bullion. Up until 1953 as war reconstruction took place the US had actually gained gold of 12 million troy ounces while Europe and Japan had lost 35 million troy oz (in order to finance their recovery). But after that the US started to leak gold to Europe and Japan. By end-1965 the latter surpassed the former for the first time in the post-war period in terms of gold volumes held in reserve. As a result Europe and Japan began to pile up huge dollar reserves that they could use to buy US assets. The global economy has begun to reverse against the US.

The dollar reserves in Europe and Japan were now so large that if those countries bought gold with their dollars under the gold standard they could exhaust US gold stocks in an instant. Private financial outflows (outbound investment) from the US averaged roughly 1.2% of GDP GDP

Gross Domestic Product Gross Domestic Product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added. The measure is notoriously incomplete; for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange. The GDP takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services. Economic growth is defined as the variation of the GDP from one period to another. throughout the 1960s—long term investment overseas through FDI or portfolio outflows. This served to finance net exports of US investment goods and a current account surplus shown as negative here as an offsetting withdrawal of dollars. Netting these about 0.4% of US GDP in surplus outward investment was made available every year during the 1960s from the US. This surplus was available for current account deficit countries in Europe and Japan to liquidate US gold replenishing their diminished reserve positive or accumulate other financial claims on the US—as shown on the right side.

But throughout the 1960s the US current account surplus was gradually eroded until in the early 1970s the current account was registering a deficit. The US began to leak dollars globally not only through outward investment but also through an excess of spending and imports as domestic manufacturers lost ground.

In other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used; and the liabilities about the origins of those funds. to GDP (%) 1976-2020



The US became reliant for the first time since the 1890s on external finance for the purposes of spending at home and abroad. So US external accounts were driven less by real goods and services and more by global demand for US financial assets and the liquidity Liquidity The facility with which a financial instrument can be bought or sold without a significant change in price. they provided. By the 1980s the US was building up net external liabilities rising to 70% of GDP by 2020.

US net international investment position as % of US GDP



If a country’s current account is permanently in deficit and it depends increasingly on foreign funds its currency is vulnerable to sharp depreciation. This is the experience of just about every country in the world from Argentina to Turkey to Zambia and even the UK.

However it is not the same for the US because what is left from the Bretton Woods regime is that the US is still the main reserve currency internationally. Roughly 90% of global foreign exchange transactions involve a dollar leg; approximately 40% of global trade outside the US is invoiced and settled in dollars; and almost 60% of U.S. dollar banknotes circulate internationally as a global store of value and medium of exchange. Over 60% of global foreign exchange reserves held by foreign central banks and monetary authorities remain denominated in dollars. These ratios have not changed.

Export surplus countries like the European Union Japan China Russia and Middle East oil states pile up surpluses in dollars (mainly) and they buy or hold assets abroad in dollars. And only the US treasury can ‘print’ dollars gaining a profit Profit The positive gain yielded from a company’s activity. Net profit is profit after tax. Distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders. from what is called ‘seignorage’ as a result. So despite the relative economic decline of US imperialism the US dollar remains supreme.

This reserve currency role encouraged US Treasury Secretary John Connally when he announced the end of the dollar-gold standard in 1971 to tell EU finance ministers “the dollar is our currency but it is your problem.” Indeed one of the reasons for the European Union led by Franco-German capital to decide to establish a single currency union in the 1990s was to try and break the dollar hegemony of international trade and finance. That aim has had only limited success with the euro’s share Share A unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock. Its owner (a shareholder) is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed (a dividend) and to attend shareholder meetings. of international reserves stable at about 20% (and nearly all of this due to intra-EU transactions).

International competitors such as Russia and China routinely call for a new international financial order and work aggressively to displace the dollar as the apex of the current regime. The addition of the renminbi in 2016 to the basket of currencies that composes the IMF’s special drawing rights represented an important global acknowledgment of the increasing international use of the Chinese currency. And there is talk of rival countries launching digital currencies to compete with the dollar. But although the dollar-euro share of reserves has declined in favour of the yen and renminbi from 86% in 2014 to 82% now alternative currencies still have a long way to go to displace the dollar.

Having said that the underlying relative decline in US manufacturing and even services competitiveness with first Europe then Japan and East Asia and now China has gradually worn away the strength of the US dollar against other currencies as the supply of dollars outstrips demand internationally. Since Nixon’s momentous announcement the US dollar has declined in value by 20% – maybe a good barometer of the relative decline of the US economy (but an underestimate because of the reserve currency factor).

The dollar’s decline has not been in a straight line. In global slumps the dollar strengthens. That’s because as the international reserve currency in a slump investors look to hold cash rather than invest productively or speculate in financial assets and the safe-haven then is the dollar.

That’s especially the case if US interest rates Interest rates When A lends money to B B repays the amount lent by A (the capital) as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that A has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation. The interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low. To take a very simple example: if A borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5% the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed (10 million dollars) plus 5% of the capital owed i.e. 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars. In the second year he will again repay 10% of the capital borrowed but the 5% now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i.e. 4.5 million dollars or a total of 14.5 million dollars. And so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5% of that remaining 10 million dollars i.e. 0.5 million dollars giving a total of 10.5 million dollars. Over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127.5 million dollars. The repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments.

In the slump investors rushed into high-yielding dollars. Bankers loved it but not US manufacturers and exporters as well as countries with large US dollar debts. The slump was bad enough but Volcker’s action was squeezing the world economy to death.

Finally in 1985 at a meeting at the Plaza Hotel New York of central bankers and finance ministers in the then big 5 economies it was agreed to sell the dollar and buy other currencies to depreciate the dollar. The Plaza accord was another milestone in the relative decline of US imperialism as it could no longer impose its domestic monetary policy on other countries and eventually had to relent and allow the dollar to fall. Nevertheless the dollar continues to dominate and remains the currency to hold in a slump as we saw in dot.com bust and slump of 2001 and in the emerging market commodity slump and euro debt crisis of 2011-14.

The relative decline of the dollar will continue. The Afghanistan debacle is not a tipping point – the dollar actually strengthened on the news of Kabul’s collapse as investors rushed into ‘safe-haven’ dollars. But the monetary explosion and the fiscal stimulus being applied by the US authorities to revive the US economy after the pandemic slump is not going to do the trick. After the ‘sugar rush’ of Bidenomics the profitability of US capital will resume its decline and investment and production will be weak. And if US inflation Inflation The cumulated rise of prices as a whole (e.g. a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc.). Inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items. This is the reason why corporate-driven policies seek to keep inflation down. does not subside as well then the dollar will come under more pressure.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Greenwood – Dr. William H. Riffle

""I have lived a long and wonderful life."" These were the words of 93-year old Dr. Bill Riffle after receiving a sobering diagnosis by the hospitalist. He passed away in hospice care on August 19 2021 at his home.

Bill graduated from Manual High School in 1946 served in the U.S. Army in Japan from 1946 to 1948 and graduated from IU School of Dentistry in 1955.

Married in 1971 Bill and Beverly Bengtson Tunnell Riffle celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary July 24 of this year. The blending of their four children was special particularly when they learned to snow ski and water ski together.

Family was very important to him. This included his children Jennifer Mettler Parks and Andy Riffle who preceded him in death and his stepchildren of 50 years Tamara Tunnell Hornung Davis and Donald Scott Tunnell. His grandchildren were also a great joy in his life: Charles Mettler Allyson Mettler and Will Mettler.

His parents Otho and Daisy Riffle and his twin sister Mary Gladys Bryant preceded him in death. His stepsiblings were Lena Atwood Dorotha Woodard James Paris and Marguerite Lowe. Bill was the last surviving sibling.

Bill was generous to a fault! He loved every workday during his almost 40 years of practicing dentistry in Southport Indiana. He lived a life of meaning that impacted our larger society for good both at work and at home.

After retiring from his practice in 1993 he volunteered at Health Net in Fountain Square providing free dentistry for neighbors there and for many years he volunteered at Second Helpings. He worked out avidly four days a week at the Baxter YMCA for twenty years.

Professionally he contributed to the Indianapolis District Dental Society (IDDS) as President in 1992-1993 and was also Chairman of the Peer Review Committee. In 1994 he was named the Honor Dentist for his faithful service to the profession of dentistry and he taught Crown and Bridge at the Dental School part time for a few years. He belonged to the IU Alumni Association and the International College of Dentists. Along with some friends he started the Perry Dental Study Club on the Southside a group that is still gathering.

Bill was an active and faithful member of University Heights United Methodist Church for 50 years. His church and his personal faith were important to him.

His hobbies were golf and most importantly woodworking. He created a barrister's bookcase a coffee table a china cabinet chess set end tables jewelry boxes and also miniature items such as horses dogs and little old men. Woodworking was the joy of his retirement.

A memorial visitation will be held on Sunday August 29 2021 from 1:00 pm until the time of service at 3:00 pm at G.H. Herrmann Funeral Home 5141 Madison Avenue Indianapolis IN.

In lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be made to University Heights United Methodist Church 4002 Otterbein Ave. Indianapolis IN 46227.

Radebe has made two appearances for the club so far after coming through the club’s youth ranks and MDC team.

He impressed many during the Carling Black Label Cup with many fans asking for Bibo to be a regular in the team this season.

Baxter has explained that the player still has a lot learn but has surprised him in training so far.

“In terms of Bibo… When I first came his training the first day was wretched he was all over the place he was running around like a headless chicken” he told reporters.

“That’s when I took him and spoke to him because he wanted to impress the new coach as much as he could.

“He is a gifted player he does have a lot of talent. We’ve all seen a lot of talent of players in the past that don’t make it for various reasons.

“But Bibo I’ve got to say between that day let’s call that day the Pirates game and now he got down to some work he wanted to play within the structure of the team. He wanted to play with other players and not only be an individualist and his progress has been excellent.

“I don’t like sitting here and say ‘people are going to play 20 or 30 games’ because lots of things can dictate that – injuries form and whatever.

“But Bibo has certainly surprised me with his progress and I hope he continues that progress because if he does then he’ll be a strong candidate.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkaXNraXRpbWVzLmNvLnphL2xvY2FsL21heW8tcmVhZHktdG8tbGVhdmUtaGlzLW93bi1tYXJrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayo Ready To Leave His Own Mark,"New Cape Town City striker Khanyisa Mayo says he does not only want to live up to the Mayo legacy he’s father Patrick built he wants to take it further.

Mayo the reigning Nedbank Cup Most Promising Player of the Season made the move to City from Richards Bay at the end of last season.

The Gqeberha-born forward who started in City’s first two games of the season their 2-1 MTN8 win over AmaZulu and the 0-0 draw with SuperSport United was interviewed by Rob Delport in the latest edition of iDiski Times.

“Like to be honest with you like the pressure is always there because you have to live up to the Mayo surname” Mayo told iDiski Times.

“Look my father put it out there you know we have to live up to that.

“But for me it’s more than like going more further like than my dad because he didn’t manage to play in Europe he managed to get more than 100 caps in the Premier League in the PSL.

“So I wanted to go more further than that.”

Mayo who turns 23 next week has also expressed his hopes of doing enough to earn a Bafana Bafana call-up in the future.

The former junior international is also motivated by new Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos’s intentions of selecting a younger team

“Today’s football most of the national teams are dominated by youngsters you know” he continued.

“Check out the English National Team the likes of (Marcus) Rashford Jadon Sancho Bukayo Saka Declan Rice all these youngsters that are coming up and then putting out the work.

“So it makes it easier for maybe the head coach of Bafana to say okay let’s try build something what some other national teams are doing you know and bringing up the youth the youngsters that have more energy and are willing to work you know.”

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 9 2021

Jason Moser: Boston Omaha. Boston Omaha obviously a business we talked about on the show before one that a lot of listeners are interested in. Matt I love looking down on this earnings report because you see billboard rentals broadband services insurance commissions. It's a fun answer when someone asks you what this company does. How did the quarter look to you?

Matt Frankel: Well in a lot of ways. There's a lot of the same issues we have in evaluating Berkshire Hathaway's earnings. Remember we did that last week. Because they're secretive about a lot of it just like Berkshire is. They release their earnings on random times you never know when their earnings are going to come out. We don't know what's in their stock portfolio which is a lot of their business. They are small enough unlike Berkshire that they don't have to tell us at all what's in it. Berkshire has to report every quarter what their holdings are which we'll actually get later today. But having said that what we do know looks pretty good. You mentioned billboard revenue was up. Billboard's by far the biggest operating business they have it's roughly 56% of the total revenue they make. It's important to pay attention to that number because that's the big chunk of it.

Moser: Sure.

Frankel: Broadband service more than tripled year over year. But take that with a grain of salt because it includes an acquisition they closed in December. One of their two major broadband operations wasn't in their company last year at this time. But that's a business they're planning on building out excellent margins 85% gross margin in the broadband services. Excellent business they'll be building out and I'm curious to see where that goes in the quarters ahead . Bottom line earnings have doubled year over year. But take that also with a grain of salt because it includes unrealized investment gains like Berkshire's the fluctuations in the stock portfolio. But book value which is a measurement that they actually pride themselves on. The CEO's bonus structure is actually based on their ability to grow book value. Book value grew by 28%. Not year over year but from December 31st. In the past six months the book value per share is up 28%.

Moser: Wow.

Frankel: Pretty impressive growth. This was before they announced Yellowstone's (NASDAQ: YSAC.U) SPAC deal that we talked about. Remember that was announced in early August. That has absolutely nothing to do with these numbers. Great numbers all around they have a lot of cash to put to work. We saw that they have about $57 million in cash another $132 million in Treasuries that they can use to invest buy other companies things like that. Stock portfolio has gone up tremendously. A lot of that is the Dream Finders Homes (NASDAQ: DFH) IPO that took place earlier this year. Cash flow their operating cash flow is up from $1.3 million a year ago to $5.3 million now. About quadrupled in their cash flow. Pretty impressive quarter all around. I guess there's a lot that we don't know about their business.

Buffett the world's seventh richest person is courted by politicians economists and most of all investors of all levels for his pearls of (often witty) wisdom.

But what's this? It seems that the Sage may not be the undisputed investment king that many of us had believed. In fact wealth manager AJ Bell has found 186 investment funds and stock market-listed investment trusts of various types and sizes that have returned more than Buffett's investment business Berkshire Hathaway since 2001.

Five fund managers (including one investing duo) who have been at the helm of their respective funds over this entire period have performed better than Buffett.

Toppled: Funds and trusts in the table below have all outperformed Buffett's business Berkshire Hathaway

What is Warren Buffett's secret?

Since 1964 when Buffett became a majority owner Berkshire Hathaway has delivered an extraordinary return of 2810526 per cent to investors.

That means £100 invested at the time would now be worth £5724854 (taking into account the fall in the value of the pound). By comparison £100 invested in an index of the 500 biggest US companies would now be worth £47976.

Buffett's strategy has been remarkably simple. He buys good companies at a fair price and holds on to them over the long term.

Rob Morgan analyst at investment platform Charles Stanley says: 'Hold great companies forever' is the overarching philosophy. That tends to stand investors in very good stead.'

Economic historian John Butler adds that Buffett's investment style is 'very unsexy' but is the only one that has proven to work through multiple economic cycles.

'Famously Buffett has always sought relatively safe industries with steady revenues that generally have high dividend yields that occupy leading positions in what are generally mature and established industries' says Butler.

Although consistent Buffett hasn't been scared to adapt his investing style over the years when necessary.

When he started out he invested in companies that were on the rocks and sold up when their share prices improved. However he now also invests in companies that may not look cheap but could still have a long way to run.

Laith Khalaf analyst at AJ Bell says: 'He now combines growth and value in his approach which he sees as two sides of the same coin. For example recently he's taken a big position in Apple which is hardly a value stock.'

Investment styles that beat Buffett

Most of the 186 funds and trusts that have outstripped Buffett over 20 years invest in small companies emerging markets or specialist themes. You would expect these to produce high returns because they are risky investments and investors need to be compensated for taking a chance. By comparison Buffett's genius is the way he has produced consistently high returns while investing in solid companies that are unlikely to be very volatile. No investment is ever risk-free but the types of blue-chip firms Buffett invests in are likely to perform in all kinds of environments.

The comparison with funds and investment trusts is not perfect as Berkshire Hathaway doesn't quite fit into either category.

Jason Hollands a director of wealth manager Tilney Smith & Williamson explains: 'While Warren Buffett is revered as the world's most famous investor Berkshire Hathaway is a multinational conglomerate with an extensive range of subsidiaries across a variety of industries.

'These range from battery firm Duracell to restaurant group International Dairy Queen and American freight railroad BNSF. It also owns a number of insurance businesses and has significant minority stakes in a portfolio of companies such as Bank of America American Express and Coca-Cola.'

Managers who have eclipsed Buffett

Of the funds and trusts that have outperformed Buffett four have managers who have been at the helm throughout the entire 20-year period and can therefore be said to have gone head-to-head with Buffett and come out on top.

The most successful is Scottish Mortgage Trust which James Anderson has run since 2000 and has built a reputation for picking out the most promising growth companies.

Tech stocks such as Tesla Amazon and Alibaba have been particularly rewarding investments. Anderson will be leaving Scottish Mortgage next year but his fellow managers Tom Slater and Lawrence Burns will continue with the same investment philosophy. An investment of £1000 in 2001 would now be worth £24688.

Next up are investment trusts Lindsell Train Investment Trust and Finsbury Growth & Income trust which are run by Nick Train and Michael Lindsell.

The duo's success is down to investing in durable cash generative businesses. 'Their philosophy is much closer to Buffett's' says Morgan.

'It's about holding great companies forever. They have a lot of consumer staples that are huge companies such as Kraft Foods Heineken and Mondelez. The idea with stalwarts like these is that nobody stops buying beer and sweets in a recession.'

A £1000 investment in Lindsell Train Investment Trust and Finsbury Growth & Income in 2001 would now be worth £18131 and £8519 respectively.

Alexander Darwall has run Devon Equity Management European Opportunities since 2000 and has turned £1000 into £10693 over the past 20 years. He invests in companies across the UK and Europe with strong balance sheets and low levels of debt and which have the resilience to prosper no matter what economic conditions prevail.

Max Ward has been running Independent Investment Trust since 2000 and invests where he sees opportunities in any sector or country. He ran Scottish Mortgage investment trust from 1989 to 2000 before James Anderson took over. Ward has been a long-term backer of UK housebuilding stocks but has also embraced technology. A £1000 investment in 2001 would now be worth £8286.

Khalaf adds that just because these fund managers have performed well over a long period doesn't mean they are guaranteed to continue doing so. However he believes they have to be credited with having excellent skills.

'You have some managers here who have been performing very well for 20 years' he says. 'Inevitably they will have some luck but you have to be a very fanatical disciple of passive investing to suggest that having outperformed for two decades they haven't exercised remarkable skill.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL25vcm1hbmR5cGFya2Jsb2cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvcml2ZXJ0b24tcGFyay11bml0ZWQtbWV0aG9kaXN0LWNodXJjaC1zY2FsZXMtdXAtcmVsaWVmLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8taGVscC10dWt3aWxhLWZpcmUtdmljdGltcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Riverton Park United Methodist Church scales up relief efforts to help Tukwila fire victims - The Normandy Park Blog,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='normandyparkblog.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The customer is always right. Or at least that's what retailers have said for years.

But that adage has never been more true than during the last year and a half when people — many for the first time — tried a host of alternatives to in-store shopping.

""Nothing compares to the last 18 months for retail"" said Kim Sovell a business professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""Nothing.""

The pandemic dramatically set in motion a new age of consumer behavior that many retail experts say will persist.

Stores like Best Buy and Target which posted record sales growth during months of the pandemic are experimenting with store formats technology and experience concepts.

""The customer is really in control of how they want to shop"" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in an interview with the Star Tribune. ""Every customer is going to decide based on what they believe is safe based on what they believe is convenient based on what's right for their schedule and their time.""

Best Buy employee Lizzie Michalak from left helped Cathy and Patrick Peick of Mendota Heights check out in a newly designed customer service checkout and order pickup area at the Best Buy store in Eagan.

Cathy and Patrick Peick a recently-retired couple didn't venture out to stores during the height of the pandemic last year. Instead they relied on Amazon drivers to bring packages to their doorstep.

""It was darn near a daily delivery"" Cathy Peick said. ""It was fun like Christmas every day.""

Last week the pair made a rare trip to a store. They were at Best Buy in Eagan one of four in the metro the electronics retailer remodeled in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak reallocating half of the shopping area as space to fulfill orders. The store installed lockers last week near the entrance for customers to pick up products. It also has a larger Geek Squad help section.

In many ways the pandemic accelerated changes already occurring at retailers.

Before the pandemic a growing percentage of shoppers used online sites and social media. But when COVID-19 forced many people to stay at home digital shopping became more common.

""Along comes COVID and it turbocharges an already raging change in behavior"" said Mark Cohen director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. ""For customers who were partly in on e-commerce they went all in.""

In three months at the onset of the pandemic the country vaulted forward 10 years in e-commerce penetration research firm McKinsey & Co. estimates. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported last week that e-commerce sales accounted for 13.3% of total retail sales in the second quarter this year.

People are often creatures of habit but the pandemic provided a rare disruption and opportunity for retailers. In the United States 75% of consumers have tried a new store brand or different way of shopping during the pandemic according to research by McKinsey.

""Groceries were until recently one area in which many people were reluctant to shop online but COVID-19 has quickly changed that"" said Jill Standish senior managing director for retail at Accenture. ""The findings show how people who haven't been as comfortable with e-commerce and other digital technology have been pushed to overcome their hesitancy — and this shift is huge.""

Target and Best Buy were prepared because of their earlier investment in contactless services technology such as mobile apps and store fulfillment before the crisis. Both companies had been shipping items directly from their stores and offering versions of order pickup for years.

Last March Best Buy temporarily closed stores to in-store shopping and ramped up curbside pickup so it expanded nationwide. Online revenue for Best Buy's total fiscal year grew nearly 145% to about $18.7 billion. As it expanded same-day options it even started having employees deliver items to customers. It plans to continue to test different store prototypes including small 5000-square-foot format stores as it prepares for a more hybrid world.

""Best Buy has always been good at omnichannel. ... I think that one of the things that really served Best Buy very well [at the start of the pandemic] is that they could very quickly ramp up their model"" said Neil Saunders managing director of retail at GlobalData.

Target's online sales skyrocketed last year. Digitally-originated sales went from 8.8% of total sales in 2019 to 17.9% in 2020. Much of Target's digital growth was from its contactless same-day services. It expanded its pickup options to include fresh produce and frozen groceries and more recently alcoholic beverages. It even updated its mobile app so customers could specify exactly where in a car they want their items placed.

""Target in my mind is one of the biggest winners"" said Scott Mushkin retail analyst and founder of R5 Capital. ""They never really shut down. They have done a good job and people are comfortable going to Target.""

Target customers haven't shirked away from stores even as digital and contactless options grew. When it announced quarterly results last week Target revealed that its store and digital-originated sales were relatively similar to the same time last year leaning more to stores. Target will spend $4 billion a year opening new stores remodeling as well as engaging in supply-chain projects such as expansion of its robotics solutions one of which started at a local warehouse.

""Target consumers like many want to be in charge and have the tools at their fingertips"" said Christina Hennington Target's chief growth officer. ""We've seen incredible digital acceleration across our business and our investments in supply chain store operations and technology capabilities ensured we were ready to meet such unprecedented demand last year. But the safety ease and convenience that guests needed last year remains popular.""

This past week Target began to open mini Ulta Beauty sections in select stores complete with trained Target staff who can offer beauty consultations. This month Kohl's is also opening the first of its Sephora sections at different locations.

To Best Buy's Barry there is no going back to pre-pandemic retail practices. Customers have become too accustomed to services like curbside pickup. ""We now have a whole suite of customers who got very used to the convenience of curbside"" she said.

But she added ""The store is pivotal in the customer experience and it's not just in the shopping journey. It's in the fulfillment journey. It's in for us the repair and support part of the journey. It is sometimes the consultative part of the journey.""

Sandra Ocampo of Maplewood with her daughter Sandy 2 got sit down help with her phone from Geek Squad consultation agent Julian Rios Rodriguez at the Best Buy store in Eagan.

In the past week there have been reports that Amazon which also recently launched Amazon Fresh grocery stores will open department stores.

""Amazon is not a stupid retailer"" Saunders said. ""It's really savvy. If Amazon is moving more into physical stores it kind of suggests there is probably a future for physical stores.""

For in-store experiences customers are still concerned about hygiene and cleanings. Most stores during the pandemic adopted more stringent cleaning schedules and retail leaders such as Target have said cleanliness will be key in how remodels are imagined.

A big challenge for retailers will be to make sure the services consumers became accustomed to including curbside pickup are cost-effective in the long term.

The picking of items from shelves has to be done by a store associate who otherwise could be working on other tasks like helping customers so there's a labor cost as well as a cost in the in-store customer experience Mushkin said.

""What you run into is a really bad store experience"" he said in some instances.

There are also costs and inefficiencies in shipping items to people's homes. Traditional mail carriers have only been increasing shipping prices. At the same time the consumer has been conditioned to expect things fast and at the same time free or very cheap.

""One of the things we really learned about ourselves was how convenient we like things"" Sovell said.

Retailers' first test in how to approach a post-COVID world will likely be this back-to-school season. Target executives last week said the season is off to a strong start.

Best Buy's Barry said ""I think you are going to have parents preparing for a variety of outcomes and at the same time likely catching up in some ways on shopping that they haven't done for quite some time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vb3JnYW5pemVkLXJldGFpbC1jcmltZS1vbi10aGUtcmlzZS1sZWdpc2xhdG9ycy1zaG9wcGluZy1vbmxpbmUtMjAyMS040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Organized Retail Crime Is on the Rise.

Professional thieves are scoring big on retailers online and otherwise.

These criminals are often connected to other forms of crime like human-trafficking and gang activity.

Without a crackdown from lawmakers the security of shoppers could be in peril.

Hector Balderas is serving his second term as New Mexico's Attorney General.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Businesses and law enforcement both in New Mexico and across the nation are now battling a new epidemic: organized retail crime.

Today groups of professional thieves are stealing mass quantities of merchandise from retailers and selling the items to consumers particularly on e-commerce platforms. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – at the state and local levels – can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to it.

It's important to recognize that organized retail crime rings aren't made up of neighborhood shoplifters or teenage delinquents – these are violent skilled thieves who seek profit and profit alone. It also shouldn't come as a shock that they can be tied back to other reprehensible schemes such as human trafficking narcotics and gang activity.

Organized retail crime has worsened over the years as online marketplaces became easy anonymous platforms for criminals to fence mass quantities of stolen merchandise. Just as alarming these thieves have become more brazen and violent in their schemes putting retail employees and innocent customers at risk when they carry mace knives and guns into stores to assist in the commission of their crimes.

New Mexico has been plagued by violent retaliation when authorities attempt to detain these thieves. In 2018 an Albuquerque grocery store employee confronted a shoplifter and was stabbed in the chest nearly dying. In June 2020 a Santa Fe man slashed at store personnel with a knife when they attempted to detain him following a theft.

In November 2020 a Dillard's loss-prevention officer at Cottonwood Mall was shot as he attempted to apprehend a shoplifter. And just last month a State Police officer was threatened with a handgun by a felon who had just stolen from a Dollar General in Pecos.

Unfortunately these examples are not uncommon.

There is an urgent need to address this growing problem – we need better resources and smarter laws on our books to protect communities and shut down these criminal networks plaguing local storefronts.

An organized solution to organized crime

Earlier this month our office along with the Albuquerque Police Department announced plans to address the rise of organized retail crime. By coordinating efforts of law enforcement and working hand in hand with local businesses we can stand up to these violent criminal operations and start to shut them down. However addressing a widespread issue like this requires a two-pronged approach. While law enforcement officials will continue to do their job we must also consider policy-based solutions at both the state and federal levels.

New Mexico currently lacks the appropriate laws required to address retail crime in the physical and online spaces. I have called on the New Mexico Legislature to pass the Organized Retail Crime Act which would increase the penalties for serial shoplifters. As the law stands today thefts under $500 only qualify as a misdemeanor allowing savvy crime rings to shoplift from multiple stores without the risk of a more serious charge harming others in the process.

Allow me to present two examples of how our present laws are deficient. First offenders who use violence to retain stolen property immediately after a nonviolent taking – such as when a shoplifter threatens store security personnel when trying to exit the store with stolen merchandise – do not meet the requirements for ""armed robbery"" in New Mexico and can thus only be prosecuted for less-serious crimes with lower penalties.

Secondly no law presently allows prosecutors to punish serial shoplifters for their organized activities; rather these offenders are now punished individually for each less-serious offense not the brazen aggregation of their acts.







We must also counter organized retail crime within the online realm. Our federal laws as they stand don't do enough to ensure the legitimacy of third-party sellers or products. Estimates place the exact loss from organized retail crime to the retail industry to be between $15 to $37 billion annually. Unless we take appropriate action we can only expect to see this number increase and for attacks in community stores to escalate.

Without transparency regulations in place shoplifters can capitalize on the lack of verification mechanisms on online marketplaces selling stolen goods to unwary shoppers. Savvy criminal actors are easily able to create seller accounts and impersonate legitimate businesses.

Federal lawmakers have recognized the need for swift action. The INFORM Consumers Act which sits in both the US House and the Senate is the most comprehensive piece of federal legislation targeting the sale of stolen goods online. It requires e-commerce websites to verify basic information from third-party sellers such as a government-issued ID and necessary business contact information.

The legislation will provide online shoppers the transparency they deserve before making an online purchase while also helping legitimate businesses – a win for all except those looking to profit from stolen goods. A national measure such as the INFORM Consumers Act will support the efforts of law enforcement officials across our state giving them an additional tool to better track and take down dangerous retail theft rings.

While our office will continue to do all that it can to protect New Mexico we call on lawmakers to take the steps necessary to keep consumers and businesses safe. Viable legislative solutions – at both the state and federal levels – will significantly aid our efforts. I urge lawmakers in Santa Fe and Washington to make combating organized retail crime a top priority.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoL3Jldmlld2VkLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvaXJvYm90LXJvb21iYS1pLTctZ2V0LWlyb2JvdC1yb29tYmEtaS03LTE1MC1vZmYvODIzMDQwMTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iRobot Roomba i7+: Get the iRobot Roomba i7+ for $150 off,"Arielle Tschinkel

The PS5 console may be difficult to get a hold of due to its high demand but those looking for the next restock are in luck this week as several major retailers are reportedly selling the console from Aug. 23 to 29.

Here are the retailers that you can check out to get your hands on a PS5:

GameStop PS5 Restock

PowerUp Rewards Pro members have a better chance at getting the PS5 console because GameStop prioritizes them.

The remaining consoles are offered to non-members but it is best to take advantage of the membership system to ensure that you get the console.

If you want to purchase online use Apple Pay for a faster and easier checkout process according to CNET.

Target PS5 Restock

Target goes live every three weeks and drops new stocks of PS5 consoles. The stock may drop before the end of August. You can check your local branch if you wish to purchase the console.

Walmart PS5 Restock

Walmart may restock the console on a weekly basis but its shipping process is very slow. Several customers who ordered through Walmart's website back in July still hasn't gotten their order according to Newsweek.

If you wish to purchase the console through Walmart it is best to go to the physical store instead of purchasing it online.

Amazon PS5 Restock

The retail giant does not have a certain pattern when dropping PS5 stocks. Amazon also removed its PlayStation listings to prevent scalper bots from bulk buying the console according to TechRadar.

Although Amazon has not confirmed if it will restock the PS5 console this week it may join the bandwagon and restock the product like the other retail stores.

Antonline PS5 Restock

Antonline has been restocking the PS5 console for the past two weeks. Due to its pattern it is safe to say that it will restock the console this week as well.

Antonline uses bundles which means the console will cost a bit more compared to other retail stores that sell the console as a stand-alone. The retail store is into pack-in deals because it prevents scalpers from bulk buying the console.

Best Buy PS5 Restock

Best Buy may not have dropped new stocks last week but insiders stated that the retail giant would be dropping them this week.

Best Buy will most likely restock the consoles between Aug. 24 to Aug. 26 so those who are interested can keep an eye out.

PlayStation Direct PS5 Restock

Sony was silent about the PS5 restock for four weeks but Sony's PlayStation Direct made a huge PS5 restock last week. Then on Aug. 20 another batch of stocks was dropped.

Fans are now speculating that Sony is slowly returning to the PS5 drop game while some are thinking that the company is just dropping all of its stocks in one week.

PlayStation Direct gives notice in advance before the PS5 restock so fans can check their inboxes for it so they can get their hands on the console as soon as it is available.

For those looking for a PS5 restock alternative an AMD kit is available and includes a console processor.

As an investor concerned primarily with fundamentals I'm always happy when my prudent due diligence pays off. For Foolish investors that due diligence includes prioritizing the long term. And over the right time frame a deep understanding of factors like a company's balance sheet business model and return on capital can mean the difference between good investments and great ones.

Such is the case with Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO 3.37%) a global life sciences company that to date has largely flown beneath the radar of investors and analysts alike. The investment case for Bio-Rad includes some interesting economic factors -- for example its strategic return on capital. Here's why this undercover agent is set to unlock long-term upside for investors over the coming years.

A quick recap on Bio-Rad and the industry

Bio-Rad Laboratories manufactures products for the clinical diagnostics and life sciences industries. The life sciences label is actually an umbrella term that covers the fields of biotechnology pharmaceuticals medical technology and biomedicine.

In terms of operations Bio-Rad's clinical diagnostics business which sells laboratory devices and instruments contributes about 50% of its revenue. Meanwhile its life sciences arm develops a whole bunch of gene blood and cell tests making up the other 50%.

Bio-Rad has a market capitalization of $23.09 billion placing it at the midpoint of its life-sciences peers; giant Thermo Fisher Scientific for example has a market cap of $214 billion and Compugen is valued at about $550 million.

While tech and cloud-based advancements were taking place in the industry even before the pandemic COVID-19 accelerated the pace. Global corporate funding for digital healthcare reached $21.6 billion in 2020 up 103% from the year prior. Researchers at Expert Market Research and Industry Research have predicted that the industry could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13% until 2030. Both also agree that further technological advancements are imminent in the industry.

Bio-Rad is certainly well-positioned to capitalize on these two market crosscurrents driven primarily by the newfound digitization of healthcare. And that's cool. But there's one key thing most investors and analysts are missing for this little-known biotech ...

The Sartorius secret

Bio-Rad's equity investment in German pharmaceuticals and lab equipment provider Sartorius AG is a unique value proposition for shareholders that also separates the company from its peers.

It began investing in Sartorius back in 2003 with an initial capital outlay of $10.4 million. By the end of 2004 Bio-Rad held an approximate 23% stake in its German counterpart. The pair's interests align as Sartorius and Bio-Rad operate in similar and adjacent markets (mechanical separations for example).

As of 2021 the company's stake in Sartorius has increased to 37% yielding unrealized capital gains of $4.5 billion to Bio-Rad last year. For context that's 177% of Bio-Rad's total sales revenue.

So what does all this mean for Foolish investors?

Whilst Bio-Rad has much that's obvious to recommend it there is a hidden secret here: The gains on its Sartorius investment aren't reflected on the revenue or EBITDA ledgers on its income statement. Rather they're found further down under ""change in fair market value of equity securities"" in the ""pre-tax income"" section in between operating income and net income. This is because according to accounting rules the position is actually ""potential income"" Bio-Rad could receive in the future if it were to sell its Sartorius shares.

That means that as the market capitalization of Sartorius expands so too does the fair value of Bio-Rad's share price. For Foolish investors with a long-term mindset this ties in nicely to the investment case. We can see the correlation between both share prices on the chart below in which Sartorius has taken off in recent weeks -- another positive for Bio-Rad.

In addition the Sartorius position has a positive impact on shareholders' earnings per share (EPS) even though its value is not derived from revenue. That's because one half of the EPS calculation -- net income -- stems from pre-tax income where we just said the Sartorius capital gains tuck in. As a result net income and EPS are disproportionately higher for Bio-Rad when compared to operating income and revenue; whereas its Sartorius equity interest grew by 127% between FY 2019 and FY2020 Bio-Rad's top-line revenue growth has actually been quite flat over the past three years at a CAGR of 5.6%.

Consequently even analysts and investors who are bullish on Bio-Rad can tend to undervalue Sartorius's contributions. That's because bullish commentary tends to bake revenue and EBITDA growth into the mix and may neglect these kinds of items lower down.

But will this position continue to be a long-term compounder for Bio into the future? The answer is yes. The remaining 73% of Sartorius is family-owned and Bio-Rad intends to wholly acquire the company when the family trust expires in 2028. That means the potential for a lot more upside for investors over the long haul.

The valuation equation

Knowing all this let's reexamine Bio-Rad from a valuation perspective. The company's enterprise value (EV) is about 30 times its trailing-12-month (TTM) EBITDA which is an approximate 60% premium to its peer group. But the EV calculation contains the Sartorius holding as an equity holding whereas EBITDA does not. To make an apples-to-apples comparison we need to calibrate from the top down.

Factoring in its market capitalization equity value and debt then subtracting cash and equivalents found on its balance sheet we get a current EV for Bio-Rad of $22.7 billion. Stripping its 37% Sartorius stake out of the equation however gets us to an EV of $14.05 billion meaning that after we adjust our calculations Bio-Rad is trading at just 19 times TTM EBITDA. Far from being overvalued then Bio-Rad actually presents as a value proposition -- that valuation is well in line with peers including Thermo Fisher Scientific with a valuation of about 18 times TTM EBITDA and the industry median of 18.6.

Most investors -- and analysts -- miss this fact as well meaning Bio-Rad tends to fly under the radar. Which is terrific for those investors seeking hidden deep-value propositions with a competitive edge.

Due diligence pays off

Foolish investors know that true investment success comes from prudent due diligence and a long-term mindset. Bio-Rad is a prime example of how these elements can combine to skew the risk/reward calculus in the diligent investor's favor. Knowing what we do now about Sartorius's true value and the historical relationship between the stocks' performance and considering that Bio-Rad's management is calling for 10.5% growth in revenue next year and Sartorius predicts 44% it's easy to conclude that the rewards for Bio-Rad's shareholders are likely to continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYXNpdGVzYW5kdmVjdG9ycy5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMzA3MS0wMjEtMDQ5MjAtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Animal welfare and zoonosis risk: anti-Trichinella antibodies in breeding pigs farmed under controlled housing ...,"As shown in Table 1 serum samples collected from 63 sows and 1 boar before their outdoor access tested negative by ELISA whereas serum samples from 18 sows and 1 boar (29.7%) collected 86 days after their last outdoor access were positive by ELISA. ELISA-positive sera were tested by Wb and 13 breeding sows (20.6% of sows with external access for a period of 2 months; 16.2% of breeding sows present on the farm) and 1 boar were confirmed as positive for anti-Trichinella antibodies (Table 1). All serum samples from control pigs i.e. those without outdoor access in the study period tested negative by ELISA. The Wb pattern with CWE antigens of serum samples from the 14 Wb-positive sera was consistent with the banding pattern of encapsulated species (T. spiralis and T. britovi) which is different from that of the non-encapsulated species (e.g. T. pseudospiralis) (Fig. 4). No larvae of Trichinella sp. were detected by artificial digestion in muscle samples of serologically positive sows and boar and of serologically negative breeding and fattening pigs.

This study shows the successful application of serology for the surveillance of Trichinella sp. infection in pigs with outdoor access. The seroconversion for anti-Trichinella IgG in 21.8% of breeding pigs which had had outdoor access for 2 months suggests that these animals were exposed to Trichinella spp. in the walking fenced area. This assertion is supported by the seronegativity of the control pigs without outdoor access for the entire study period and by the seroconversion of the boar for the control of estrus in sows i.e. the only animal that had access to the walking area with the sows. The previous year (2016) the sows that had access to the walking area had been monitored as in 2017 but with negative results (data not shown).

Furthermore pigs were fed exclusively with certified feed no animals were slaughtered within the farm and breeding pigs at the end of their career and the fattening pigs were sent for slaughter in certified slaughterhouses for the search for Trichinella sp. larvae according to the European legislation [8]. Therefore at the farm level there was no risk that the infection could spread among pigs.

The tail-biting which Zimmermann et al. [13] had hypothesized as a possible route of T. spiralis transmission from infected to uninfected pigs on the farm was never observed among pigs of this farm. Furthermore the very low larval load per gram of muscle tissue of T. britovi compared to that of T. spiralis [567] makes this route of transmission even more unlikely.

The method of Trichinella sp. transmission from wildlife to the sows and boar with outdoor access to the fenced area is unknown. We hypothesize that a Trichinella sp. infected carnivore mammal may have passed through the fence (e.g. stone marten pine marten weasel) or jumped over the pen (e.g. red fox) and was then killed and devoured by the sows and the boar present in the fenced area. Alternatively a poacher may have thrown leftovers from the slaughter of a Trichinella sp. infected animal (wild boar or carnivore) over the fence. The fenced area is only 140 m far from two inter-estate roads used by hunters. The farm is located on the slopes of Apennines a mountain area full of wild animals in which T. britovi and very seldom T. pseudospiralis have been detected [1415161718].

The wild boar greatly expanded their distribution areas because of the progressive adaptation to the most varied ecological and environmental conditions linked in most part to modified biological factors. In the last 30 years the home range of this omnivorous animal has quintupled involving different geographical areas. In Italy wild boars are now diffused from lowlands to hilly and mountainous areas; the presence of wild boar has been observed also in the periphery of urban areas [19]. In the same years the wolf (Canis lupus) one of the main reservoir hosts of T. britovi in Italy [14] increased and expanded its population in most of the country including the Foreste Casentinesi National Park [20] which is lineally only 20 km away from the farm. The environment between the National Park and the pig farm is covered with woods interspersed with cultivated fields and therefore easy to transit for wild animals.

From 2010 to 2013 T. pseudospiralis was detected in four wild boars reared within a fenced area surrounded by a country road in northeastern Italy. The origin of infection of these wild boars was unknown and the authors argued that a carnivore mammal or bird had entered the fenced area or that hunters or poachers had thrown T. pseudospiralis infected scarps or offal of a hunted animal in the fenced area [15 21].

In Italy the most widespread Trichinella species is T. britovi detected in > 97% of approximately 400 isolates of Trichinella spp. from wild and domesticated animals whereas T. pseudospiralis and T. spiralis were detected in only 2.1% and 0.5% of isolates identified at species level respectively [18].

The detection of anti-Trichinella antibodies with the Wb profile of encapsulated species in the absence of larvae in the muscles of pigs which had had access to a walking fenced area from 86 to 146 days earlier suggests that the sows and the boar could have been exposed to T. britovi since: (i) it is the most prevalent species in Italy as above reported and in some countries of southern and central Europe (e.g. Portugal France Belgium The Netherlands Switzerland Austria Slovenia Greece) [22]; (ii) the larvae of this species are known to survive only for a few months in muscles of pigs belonging to the same race (Large White × Duroc) of those of this study and (iii) anti-Trichinella antibodies are detectable for at least 2 years after the infection [7]. We believe that Trichinella sp. exposure could not have been caused by the ingestion of infected rats as the larvae of T. britovi are unable to survive in rat muscles because they quickly undergo a calcification process [23 24].

Even in regions where the zoonotic risk due to the pork consumption is low more muscle samples must be tested to detect Trichinella sp. infections in breeding pigs than in fattening pigs according to the EU legislation [8]. The access of pigs to an open area represents a high risk for the transmission of zoonotic agents including those of parasitic origin such as Trichinella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii.

Controlled housing conditions imply that swine housing must include physical barriers that prevent swine from being exposed to wildlife (including birds). Stepwise exclusion is accomplished by creating barriers external to the buildings such as open spaces which contain no animal harborage and keeping these areas free of vegetation. The creation of space free of any type of vegetation including grass bounded by a second fence at 5–6 m away from the first fence is needed to prevent wild and/or synanthropic animals from entry into the farm and to prevent scarps and offal from hunted animals being thrown over the net. Often gravel is used to line the perimeter of buildings; this enhances other efforts to control rodents [25].

In the present study sows even if infected would not pose a zoonotic risk since they would have been tested for Trichinella spp. at the end of their role as breeding sows according to the European Commission [8]. Furthermore if T. britovi as suspected was the etiological agent the time lapse between outside access and slaughtering which included farrowing suckling and weaning would have been sufficient for the devitalization of larvae present in their muscles as already observed [7].

The risk for humans to acquire trichinellosis by pork consumption is quite low in Italy. Indeed T. spiralis has been rarely detected in susceptible wild animals (only two reports in red foxes [18]) and never in locally raised livestock. In the past 20 years only 26 cases of trichinellosis were documented because of the consumption of T. britovi-infected pork and pork-related products from pigs reared in the wild in the island of Sardinia compared to about 140 cases of trichinellosis acquired through the consumption of T. britovi- or T. pseudospiralis-infected wild boar meat from hunting activities during the same period [26 27] (Gómez-Morales M.A. unpublished data).

Combining three serological tests greatly increases the chance to indirectly acquire epidemiological information on the circulation of Trichinella spp. in swine even for species whose larvae have a short survival in the host muscles. To improve animal welfare food safety and productivity there is a need to put all suitable measures in place to reduce transmission of zoonotic pathogens. In areas with a mild climate like the Mediterranean countries the possibility for pigs and sows in particular to have access to the outside in fenced areas is very frequent and unfortunately sometimes can cause problems regarding animal safety such as the case presented in this study.",,,,,,,,,

While Farooquie’s spinal injection treatment (Spinraza) cost will become Rs 3.2 crore from the second year a one-time gene therapy shot (Zolgensma) costs Rs 16 crore. A daily syrup (Evrysdi) is available in the country since July at a cost of Rs 72 lakh in the first year and Rs 56 lakh thereafter. A lung or liver transplant would in contrast work out to Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh or cutting-edge cancer immunotherapy about Rs 2 lakh a month.Gufran whose husband works in Egypt says she cannot fund her son’s treatment. It has been possible through a compassionate use programme started at BMC-run Nair Hospital Mumbai Central along with the manufacturer Biogen. “My younger son who is 3-years-old has been on the daily syrup for 10 months through Roche’s compassionate use programme” she said.While the government of India recently announced it would help raise funds for the treatment of certain rare diseases through crowdfunding on its portal parents want a more sustainable solution.“When it comes to SMA all of us are BPL families” said Kharghar resident Alpana Sharma who founded the Cure SMA Foundation in 2014 and mother of 9-year-old Aarav who has SMA. She wants the government either at the centre or state to start helping soon. “We lost 48 children in the last six months alone” said Sharma who has about 650 children including 70 from Maharashtra enrolled in the NGO registry.The pharmaceutical companies have been running compassionate use programmes in the country for about a year now. Professor Dr Shefali Gulati who heads the neuromuscular disorders clinic at AIIMS Delhi was the first in the country to use these drugs and says children have improved. She has used Spinraza for 14 children Zolgensma for six and Evrysdi for seven children.“While one cannot expect the children to be cured and start running about it can be said that most children have had some significant improvement in certain motor function” she said. One 3-year-old for instance who could not sit up on his own can now hold his head and sit for a brief moment. “This child’s improvement has occurred within eight months of taking the daily drug” Dr Gulati added.In Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital pediatric neurologist Dr Neelu Desai got approval for the daily therapy on compassionate use for three children including Gufran’s younger son. The parents of one of her SMA patients Teera Kamat were the first to raise Rs 16 crore for the gene therapy.“Children are showing subtle changes. One of the children who would fall down on sitting up can manage to sit for a while” said Dr Desai. The change is slow. “These are children who have never walked or sat before. With the drugs they are better but the changes could take months if not years” she said.She expects that the cost of treatment will come down with time but parents are worried. Zeba Gufran said “The medicines are so expensive that we cannot pay from our pockets and have been at the mercy of pharmaceutical companies. So you are either waiting for your child to get assistance or die.”NGO Cure SMA Foundation has been proactively meeting health ministers and bureaucrats to devise a sustainable programme. Its representatives met Maharashtra’s health secretary P Vyas on Friday who said that the government does not have the funds to support SMA programmes.“The point is that such a programme is not sustainable without government funding” said founder Sharma. Even if the government holds talks with pharmaceutical companies it would help with the costing mechanism. “The government has several unclaimed accounts or cash-rich programmes such as ESIS. Even if the interest from these funds is diverted to SMA treatment it would help a great deal” said Sharma.The bigger problem according to parents and doctors is the lack of awareness about rare diseases. By the time parents reach out to the doctors there has already been a delay; in case of SMA the gene therapy cannot be offered to children beyond two years of age. “Also parents should believe that these medicines offer some magical cure the children will need support therapies such as physiotherapy for a long time” said AIIMS’s Dr Gulati.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYmlrZWh1Yi5jby56YS9uZXdzL2JvdGhhLXNoYXR0ZXJzLWF0dGFrd2FzLXJlY29yZC10by1jbGFpbS1tYWlkZW4td2luLXI4MzA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Botha shatters Attakwas record to claim maiden win,"South Africa’s Wessel Botha confirmed his status as a new marathon-racing star when he won the 2021 Momentum Medical Scheme Attakwas Extreme presented by Biogen in a new record time on Saturday. The Team Type Dev NanoTime racer had to contest a tight three-way sprint to claim his maiden victory in South Africa’s toughest one-day mountain bike race.

South African marathon champion Yolande de Villiers (The Coopetto) took a comfortable victory in the women’s race finishing an impressive 30th overall. It was a day that saw a limited field of riders due to Covid-19 restrictions tackling the 121km race from Oudtshoorn to Groot Brak River in near perfect weather conditions.

Botha who finished third at the 2020 edition was eager to improve on that result and was attentive throughout the demanding race which included 2900 metres of climbing. The 22-year-old professional racer from Pretoria outlasted most of the field and eventually outsprinted his final two rivals to claim the win in a time of 04 hours 46 minutes 22 seconds. Second place went to Nambia’s Alex Miller (Trek Vaude) and third to South African Marco Joubert (Imbuko Giant) both also beating the previous record.

Botha’s winning time was 01:34 quicker than the previous record of 4:47:56 set by Swiss ace Urs Huber in 2014. But the course for the 2021 edition was around 1500 metres longer as the organisers needed to create a detour near the finish because of damage to the route caused by recent rain.



As is usually the case the rugged terrain and steep gradients of the section through the Attakwas Reserve after Water Point 2 was the most decisive. Pieter du Toit (Pyga EuroSteel) claimed the King of the Mountain prize at the 56km point but he punctured on the descent. That left a group of five in the lead comprising two-time winner and pre-race favourite Matthys Beukes (Pyga EuroSteel) Tristan Nortje (Imbuko Giant) Miller Joubert and Botha.

Beukes then also punctured on the descent putting paid to his hopes of contesting the win and Nortje was distanced on the climb with 87km completed leaving Miller Joubert and Botha to tackle the finale at the front.



“Initially Alex tried some attacks but he couldn’t drop us so we decided to work together and ensure we kept our lead” explained Botha. “We worked well together but I knew from last year that those last two climbs were crucial. I attacked on the second one and Marco got dropped. But he managed to claw his way back to us and I then realised that it would come down to a sprint and I knew the first rider onto the last descent would be in the best position for the win.

“Alex managed to get in front on the last downhill but he went a bit wide on a turn and I managed to pass him on the inside. From there it’s quite twisty and narrow to the finish and so I just kept the pressure on and was able to cross the finish line first” explained an elated Botha.



Perennial Attakwas podium contender Gert Heyns (Pyga EuroSteel) paced himself well to finish fourth with Beukes rounding out the top five.



“This is definitely one of the highlights of my career” smiled Botha. “Attakwas is the toughest one-day race in South Africa and riders have a lot of respect for it. To win it for my team and to break the course record is something I’m very proud of. With about 30km to go I noticed our time and thought that we would be close to the record but I was more concerned about trying for the win. The weather conditions were really perfect which definitely helped with the fast time.”

Unlike the men’s race the women’s race saw De Villiers lead from start to finish. It was the 48-year-old’s ninth participation in the iconic race and her third victory. She claimed her first win in the first edition of the race in 2007. Her second win came from thrilling a sprint finish at the 2019 edition and her third a somewhat ‘social distanced’ one in 2021.



De Villiers clocked a winning time of 05:59:23. Second place went to Amy Beth McDougall in a time of 06:04:55 with Sarah Hill rounding out the podium in a time of 06:18:49.



“I attacked from the start and was on my own at the front for the whole race. My strategy was to race my own race and basically ‘go til you blow’!” said a satisfied De Villiers.

“This was a special victory for me because I lost my previous sponsor at the end of July as a result of the lockdown restrictions due to Covid-19. And today I raced for the first time for my new sponsor The Coopetto which is a cycling coaching company owned by my coach Timo Cooper.”



The first ten finishers at the Attakwas Extreme get gold medals and all finishers under six hours get silver medals with bronze medals going to the remainder of the finishers. This year there were only 30 riders that broke the six-hour silver-medal cut-off.

Some of BlackRock's hedge funds have seen stronger performance so far in 2021 than earlier this year but four of its five strategies are still underperforming the average fund.

The world's largest asset manager's $601 million Emerging Companies hedge fund led by Dan Whitestone grew 11.5% year to date as of Aug. 6 according to HSBC's latest Hedge Weekly report.

Blackrock Pre-School was delighted to spend their Thursday afternoon unboxing a special surprise for their little ones.

Christmas came early this year for the little ones at Blackrock Pre-School where the pupils received a pile of brand new toys.

The kids were over the moon to receive a range of new balls train sets sand pit toys construction blocks alphabet and number wooden block sets large sea animals jumbo wild and farm animals mobile double sets poster paints and much more which they wasted no time in putting to good use straight away.

Principal Stephanie Forbes said the toys were purchased by the school’s parents after some careful budgeting with a total of $4500 spent.

“We want to really acknowledge our parents and thank them for what they’ve done” she said.

The excited kids were all called to sit down and witness the unboxing of their new play equipment on Thursday and were ecstatic even at the unboxing of a rubber ball – the first toy that was revealed.

At school the next day the novelty of the new toys was still as strong as ever with many kids no doubt excited for the beginning of the new school week on Monday where they could return to school to play with the new toys.

With the school’s roll chock-a-block currently the toys have come at a perfect time to keep the little ones entertained and to encourage their creativity and brain development through play.

Forbes says this is an important part of the school’s values as they are “passionate about play-based learning whereby the children are given the freedom to play where they want and with whatever they want as that is how they learn and develop”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNocnVnYnkuaWUvMjAyMS8wOC8yMS9sZWluc3Rlci11bmRlci0xOXMtcHJvdmUtdG9vLXN0cm9uZy1mb3ItbXVuc3Rlci_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaHJ1Z2J5LmllLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvbGVpbnN0ZXItdW5kZXItMTlzLXByb3ZlLXRvby1zdHJvbmctZm9yLW11bnN0ZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leinster Under-19s Prove Too Strong For Munster,"In a game played in all four seasons at Energia Park the Leinster Under-19s beat Munster 27-7 to begin their PwC IRFU U-19 Men’s Interprovincial campaign in impressive fashion.

Round 1: Ulster U-19s Outlast Connacht To Make Winning Start

Prop Evan O’Riordan’s try on the stroke of half-time edged Munster into a 7-5 lead responding to an earlier effort from Leinster lock Jim Peters.

The wet weather gave way to sunshine on the restart with Leinster captain Sam Prendergast taking advantage to kick his side in front from a penalty.

Andy Wood’s charges went 15-7 up when out-half Prendergast kicked through for winger James Nicholson to touch down.

They added two more tries in a rain-lashed final ten minutes to seal their bonus point. Diarmuid Mangan via a lovely George Hadden pass and replacement Gus McCarthy both crossed.

This first round clash got off to a scrappy start with the ball being spilled everywhere in very poor handling conditions. However both sides gradually made their mark.

Newbridge College’s Prendergast missed a fifth-minute penalty but at the afternoon’s first scrum on a Munster put-in Leinster put their arch rivals under severe pressure.

Indeed the set piece gave the Blues the platform for the opening score. From a five-metre scrum Leinster went through the phases and Portlaoise forward Peters drove over for an unconverted try.

Both defences were on top in the wet conditions which made try-scoring opportunities a rare occurrence. Leinster missed out on another try when losing the ball forward over the line.

Munster hit back with a great turnover won by blindside Rudhan Quinn in the 28th minute and took their chance well just before the break.

Cork Constitution youngster O’Riordan went in under the posts for a well-taken try converted by Munster captain Jack Oliver whose kick split the teams at the turnaround.

Three minutes into the second half Leinster retook the lead with Prendergast’s only successful penalty. It was all to play for with some evenly-matched phases.

It took a great dink from Prendergast to open up the Munster defence setting up Nicholson from St. Michael’s College to notch Leinster’s second seven-pointer.

As the half wore on Leinster looked to be in control of proceedings and scored again at a crucial stage. Newbridge’s Mangan went over in the corner to make it 20-7.

Barely moments later Blackrock College’s McCarthy burrowed his way over as the torrential rain hit Donnybrook again. Prendergast’s conversion completed his seven-point haul.

The tigerish Leinster defence did not give Munster an inch during the final minutes. On a challenging day weather-wise the aggression and physicality of the victors’ forwards made the difference.

Fall II is behind us. Fall the real article is ahead. There’s nothing like the original.

With that as we wind down August and build toward Labor Day here is a look at the top six returning Daily News All-Stars from Fall II 2021. All are ready to make even more of an impact this coming fall – you know the real one.

JOHNNY BENNETT Dover-Sherborn

The total package for the Raiders this senior two-year captain was a Swiss-army knife in Fall II. At running back he racked up six touchdowns and 850 total yards of offense. On the other side of the ball he collected 21 tackles two interceptions and a fumble recovery at defensive back.

“He is a tough competitor with a motor that does not quit” D-S head coach Steve Ryan said. “He is the player on our team that other teams needed to prepare for.” Bennett the D-S Team MVP was named the Tri-Valley League Offensive Player of the Year as a junior.

GAVIN ELDER Bellingham

This lefthanded senior quarterback does it all for the Blackhawks. This cerebral QB went 63-for-93 for 1136 passing yards and tossed 12 TDs and zero interceptions en route to being named MVP of the Tri-Valley League Small in Fall II. Elder also helped Bellingham claim a league title for the first time in 20 years.

“Gavin is an incredible athlete and even a better leader” Bellingham head coach Dan Haddad said. “He is incredibly humble off the field but on the field he is an assassin.”

JOHN FURNO Blackstone Valley Tech

A disruptive force up the middle this 6-foot-3 263-pound lineman was a menace for BVT opponents in Fall II. Furno now a senior registered 26.5 tackles and four sacks on defense and opened up holes on the offensive line for a team that averaged 38 points a game.

“John was our leader in the trenches this year” BVT coach Jim Archibald said. “He controlled both sides of the ball and paved the way for our ground game this year.” Furno also dedicated the Fall II season to his friend Tony Pena a former BVT football player who died from cancer in 2020.

MACK GULLA Franklin

With a fitting first name for a running back this senior can truck over would-be tacklers. Gulla at 5-foot-11 and 200 pounds averaged 5.74 yards per carry and 106.5 yards rushing per game on his way to Hockomock League All-Star honors in Fall II. He finished with 130 carries for 746 yards and seven touchdowns for the Panthers.

“Mack’s toughness and physical style helped our offense tremendously in Fall II” Franklin head coach Eian Bain said. “He blended those traits with deceptive speed and pass-catching ability and really made our offense go.”

NOLAN O’BRIEN Lincoln-Sudbury

O’Brien has dipped his toes in almost everything on the gridiron. The two-time first-team Dual County League All-Star can catch (20 receptions 352 yards 3 TDs) run (17 carries 177 yards 2 TDs) and return punts (10 returns 265 yards 3 TDs) compiling 794 total yards and eight touchdowns during an undefeated Fall II season for L-S.

“A complete football player exceptional hands fast and physical high energy” is how L-S head coach Jim Girard described O’Brien. As he enters his senior year O’Brien holds the single season and career record for punt returns and also plays strong safety on defense.

RILEY O’CONNELL Lincoln-Sudbury

A season removed from breaking his collarbone O’Connell returned to take snaps as the Warriors’ No. 1 signal-caller in Fall II. This quarterback went 54-for-96 passing for 1087 yards and 11 touchdowns on his way to Dual County League Large Co-offensive Player of the Year honors. A dual threat at QB O’Connell also rushed 32 times for 188 yards and five TDs.

“High football IQ coach on the field and strong and accurate arm” L-S head coach Jim Girard said. O’Connell whose older brother Braden was a two-time Daily News All-Star for football before heading to Williams College enters senior year ready to lead L-S back to Gillette Stadium.

It’s an odd question but it’s one that commentators keep asking as housing crises of various types continue to take shape across the world. In a recent series of articles economist Brett Christophers analysed the workings of Blackstone a New York-based asset management firm which has become a phenomenally successful (and deeply harmful) institutional player in American housing markets. At the moment the picture in the UK is very different—small-scale individuals vastly outnumber institutions in the buy-to-let market—but there are signs that this is starting to change.

Last week Lloyds Bank announced its plans to become one of the UK’s biggest landlords by buying 50000 homes over the next four years – roughly equivalent to buying every dwelling in Exeter. The month before department store chain John Lewis said that it intends to build and rent out 10000 flats. Academics in the UK have been writing about the small rise in US-style institutional landlordism in the UK for several years now but this phenomenon seems to have built up a head of steam since the pandemic.

Landlordism must have been an easy pitch to Lloyds’ directors: ‘What if I told you that there was a market where the very act of ownership generates more wealth than the average income? What if I told you that the sector is almost totally unregulated and has seen strong and consistent growth since the 1990s?’ If Lloyds thinks it can also emulate Blackstone’s activities in the US it is looking at a very good investment indeed.

But when we talk about this emerging form of landlordism it is important not to be moralistic. We shouldn’t fall into the trap of making the case for the ‘small business owner’ landlord standing in contrast to takeovers by heartless capital (or as one friend put it to me when the Lloyds story broke ‘critical support for authentic working-class landlords’). We should look instead at whether there are qualitative differences between institutional and individual landlords and the effects that large-scale buyouts can have.

We could spill a lot of ink discussing whether institutions provide a better ‘service’ than small-scale landlords. Is a heartless but image-conscious corporation less likely to evict me than a capricious amateur? Is my penny-pinching landlord’s handyman really worse than the large repairs department of professional social landlords like Clarion? In my work representing tenants I’ve seen good and bad practices in both camps. The individual experiences of tenants matters far less than the systemic effects of Blackstone-style takeovers of the housing system more broadly.

There are arguments on both sides too about whether it’s easier for the tenants’ movement to exert pressure on large or small-scale landlords. On the one hand individuals can be easier to startle but on the other institutions are often precious about their reputations. Case in point: Cardiff lettings agent Horizon Properties recently ran crying to the High Court to try to stop ACORN members from protesting at their offices. The movement will find tactics that are appropriate to the problem.

So what are the systemic effects of large-scale investment in rented housing? Blackstone is credited with changing the landscape of housing in the US. Around the time of the global financial crisis it bought swathes of homes in ‘distressed’ areas while rents were low made repairs and improvements while the economy settled and sold or re-let the buildings at much higher prices. The UN special rapporteur for housing has criticised Blackstone’s policy of ‘aggressive evictions’. This model of rent-hiking is thought to have made the company $3.5 billion in profit.

In other words this is gentrification – but a concerted project of gentrification rather than the piecemeal landlord-by-landlord or estate-by-estate approach that we are used to seeing in the UK. Blackstone—quite rightly—has become the real bogeyman of the US housing crisis.

As Blackstone’s own prospectus acknowledges its successful ‘buy it fix it sell it’ model only works where rental markets are buoyant. This puts Lloyds in an interesting position because rental markets thrive where homeownership is difficult to achieve and Lloyds (as a major mortgage lender) has some influence there. On one view Lloyds has hedged its bets (it does well whether renting or ownership prevails). On another and particularly if other banks build up rental portfolios of their own the gatekeepers of homeownership would have a strong interest in keeping it exclusive. A large-scale landlord will want to see the housing crisis worsen.

This is perhaps the most important thing we learn from Lloyds’ and John Lewis’s announcements: capital has no faith in the government’s response to the housing crisis. The Conservatives’ focus has been on expanding home ownership (generally through generous but still unaffordable state-backed mortgage schemes on new builds) but these companies have just backed a different horse. They see profits in the private rented sector.

This is not a decision that Lloyds would have taken lightly: as Christophers notes about Blackstone: ‘any substantive flagging […] of demand for rental housing or of the purchasing power required to monetise that demand at higher rent levels would have been ruinous for Blackstone’. Lloyds which knows the property market as well as anyone must think that the demand for expensive private rents will remain robust. In other words the housing crisis is here to stay.

What we really need though is for this endless churn of gentrification and rent-raising to stop and for housing prices to fall. The expensive and inadequate private rented sector needs to shrink through processes of decommodification dispossession and replacement with social homes. Next month’s referendum in Berlin is an exciting step: the proposal is to force sales of homes to the state and it appears to be driven by Berliners’ concerns about exactly the sort of industrial-scale capital-driven mechanisms that Lloyds is proposing to adopt (the Berlin proposal is aimed at the largest landlords).

On one view the only way to stop Blackstone and Lloyds is through massive government and policy interventions. A recent Jacobin piece in response to the US evictions crisis called for a new project of Red Vienna-style social housing to replace private landlordism (and this is a project in which the UK has its own impressive history). The counterpoint though is that capital is flighty and needs conditions to be just right. Blackstone stopped investing in Berlin in 2019 because the city had introduced rent controls. While we need huge amounts of decent affordable secure housing to makes things better even fairly small policy measures can slow down the processes of making things worse.

In a memorable passage in The Grapes of Wrath Steinbeck describes exasperated tenants talking to the landowner’s agents about the irrational thinking behind their imminent eviction: ‘A bank isn’t like a man. Or an owner with fifty thousand acres he isn’t like a man either. That’s the monster.’ This is a good observation. It is not the impersonal nature of the relationship but the scale of the operation—the necessity for big capital investment projects to succeed—which turbo-charges the systemic problems and individual misery of housing crises. One of the Left’s rallying cries in recent years has been that there is no such thing as a good landlord but our landlord adversaries might be about to level up from ‘not good’ to ‘monsters’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWNsby1tYW5hZ2Vycy1iYW5rZXJzLXRyYWRlcnMtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LWJhYy1ibGFja3N0b25lLTIwMjEtONIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWNsby1tYW5hZ2Vycy1iYW5rZXJzLXRyYWRlcnMtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LWJhYy1ibGFja3N0b25lLTIwMjEtOD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of top CLO managers bankers traders and investors,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9saW5kYS1sLW1jY2FsZS1hdXN0aW50b3duLW9oaW8v0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tibi5jb20vbXktdmFsbGV5LXRyaWJ1dGVzL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2xpbmRhLWwtbWNjYWxlLWF1c3RpbnRvd24tb2hpby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Linda L.

Despite significant advances in our understanding of the underlying ætiology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s and Huntington’s and intense efforts targeting the development of disease-modifying therapies for these disorders for the majority of people living with neurodegenerative conditions the prognosis remains poor [234]. Improving our knowledge of the underlying causes of neuronal loss in these disorders with the goal of developing novel disease-modifying therapies is thus a top priority for research patient and care-giver communities.

An area of cell biology that has emerged over the past two decades as a key contributor to the events that lead to neuronal cell death across the whole spectrum of neurodegenerative disease is that of vesicle trafficking [5]. Regulating the formation and degradation of vesicles what goes in to them where they go and what happens to them is a fundamental function required for cell viability [6] and so it is perhaps not surprising that dysfunction of these dynamic systems can result in disease. Driven in part by rapid advances in human genetics it has become very clear that neuronal cells are exquisitely sensitive to disruption of vesicle trafficking – with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases caused by specific mutations in genes that contribute to the regulation of vesicle trafficking.

To capitalise on the rapid increase in research on vesicle biology in neurodegeneration a three-day virtual meeting on “Vesicle trafficking and pathways to neurodegeneration” was hosted by Wellcome Connecting Science from May 17th to 19th 2021 (Fig. 1). The goal of this meeting was to bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders research including students early career researchers and established scientists spanning clinical genetic cellular in vivo translational biology and industry in order to break down some of the barriers between these various groups – searching for areas of common interest and opportunities to accelerate the progress of research.

Like many conferences scheduled over the past 18 months the original aim was for the meeting to be held in person (in this case at the Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton). Circumstances related to the covid-19 pandemic however did not allow this and so the meeting was held as a virtual event – with the positive outcome that this opened up attendance throughout the world in a way that would not have been possible in person. The meeting was attended by over 230 researchers representing 23 different countries and was divided into sessions covering five broadly-defined areas related to vesicle trafficking (Fig. 2) alongside a session focused on the neurogenetics of vesicle trafficking as well as a drug discovery panel discussing how we can drug vesicle trafficking processes within the brain. Fig. 2 The five main cellular sessions held during the meeting.

The conference was bookended by two outstanding keynote lectures the first from Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus) describing with exquisite resolution the trafficking of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum through to the Golgi apparatus [7] and the second by Pietro de Camilli (Yale University School of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute) covering his recent investigations into disruption of vesicle trafficking linked to neurodegenerative disease gene mutations – most notably those linked to VPS13D [8].

The intervening sessions showcased some incredibly exciting published and unpublished research highlighting both the breadth and depth of research into vesicular dysfunction in neurodegeneration. One aspect that became obvious quite quickly was that the somewhat arbitrary dividing lines between different domains of vesicular transport within the cell that was used to demarcate the five biology sessions were just that – somewhat arbitrary. Across all of the sessions one could observe common themes and indeed common genetic contributors often acting across multiple different disorders. Making sense of this and in particular the commonalities and contrasting ætiologies between for example vesicular dysfunction contributing to frontal temporal dementia and that found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (frequently with closely-related genetic defects) [9] has the potential to reveal important insights into why individuals develop one form of brain disease rather than another.

Two key challenges emerged from the presentations and discussions during the conference. Neither of these are unique to neurodegeneration but are acutely obvious and – in some respects – perhaps exacerbated by the complexities of studying disorders of the central nervous system. First the sheer volume of genetic and clinical data that is now being generated across neurological diseases presents a huge task for functional biology. As we develop an ever more detailed understanding of population-wide genetic risk through large scale sequencing association studies and expression analyses there is an ever longer list of potential risk genes to investigate and comprehend [10]. With regard to this it was striking that a majority of the presentations at the meeting involved investigating monogenic aspects of neurodegenerative disease whether that be the ultrastructure of Huntington disease intracellular inclusions and how these disrupt endolysosomal function [11] or the function of Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 in responding to lysosomal damage [12] in Parkinson disease (to cite two examples of topics covered by short talks at the meeting). Moving from a monogenic-centric approach to the cell biology of neurodegeneration to making sense of the complexities of common genetic risk for neurodegeneration at a functional level is a gargantuan task and one that is only just beginning to be confronted.

The second major challenge is that of translating advances in our understanding of the cellular processes driving disease into clinical benefits for patients. Despite some notable recent successes for example recent advances in targeting spinal muscular atrophy [13] the development of drugs that modify central nervous system disorders and in particular neurodegenerative diseases has proved extremely challenging [14 15]. Taking dementia as a case study the last two decades have witnessed a number of promising preclinical drug candidates failing in large human trials [16]. Exploiting the increasing body of knowledge relating to vesicle trafficking dysfunction in neurodegeneration presents some major challenges not least determining how to achieve specificity in the central nervous system and how to measure biological activity in a human. The inherent challenges of drugging these pathways may require new approaches in compound screening model development the science of therapeutics and biomarker discovery (the subject of some discussion during the panel held as part of this conference). These challenges however should not distract from the opportunities presented by the increasing diversity of targets for neurodegeneration and the new insights into disease biology provided by research into this area.

The overriding impression from this conference taking into account all of the talks and posters presented at the meeting is a feeling of optimism for the future in particular with regard to the power of technology to drive insights into the fundamental biology of vesicle trafficking and into understanding disease ætiology.

Across the programme we were witness to some outstanding examples of the application of high-content screening [17] and cryoelectron tomography [18] providing a high volume of information and close to atomic resolution. Coupled with deep learning approaches applied to increasingly large genetic and biological datasets [19] this heralds a new era in our understanding of the events regulating vesicle trafficking in the cells of the central nervous system. As novel approaches to in silico imaging allow the refinement of experimental models [20] and proteome-wide investigations begin to achieve a level of comprehensiveness comparable to nucleic acid-based genomic analyses [21] this is clearly an important area of biology to follow closely over the coming years.

Conclusion

If you look at the list of the excluded hotels they are big city ones likely full of at least previously business travelers and they love nothing else more than to charge a ridiculous amount of money for the breakfast buffet (most profitable F&B operation).

Why would you give it for “free” when you can give $5 worth of points and a large number of elite guests will go for the $50 breakfast expensable for most?

Marriott Bonvoy T&Cs are way too convoluted with too many exclusion and ambiguities. They should simplify them to a third from the current length (should not be difficult) and make the benefits UNIVERSAL among all the brands and hotels.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Update (April 26 2022): NYU Grossman School of Medicine is considering hiring David Sabatini Science reports.

Update (April 4 2022): David Sabatini resigned from MIT on Friday (April 1) after the university recommended that his tenure be revoked The Boston Globe reports.

Update (October 21): Sabatini has filed a lawsuit against Ruth Lehmann the Whitehead Institute and a former colleague he claims made false allegations about him after he ended what he calls a consensual relationship The Boston Globe reports.

David Sabatini a cell biologist known for his discovery of mTOR kinase and his work on its associated signaling pathway was fired from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and resigned from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Friday (August 20) Science reports. (Business Insider and The Boston Globe previously reported that Sabatini had been placed on leave.) According to an email posted on Twitter that is purported to be to Whitehead staff from its director Ruth Lehmann an investigation by a law firm “found that Dr. Sabatini violated the Institute’s policies on sexual harassment among other policies unrelated to research misconduct.” She wrote that the institute had hired the law firm to investigate Sabatini after an internal survey “identified issues of particular concern in the Sabatini Lab.”

See “Dealing with Unethical or Illegal Conduct in Higher Education”

In a 2012 interview with The Scientist Sabatini recounted how he had discovered mTOR as a graduate student in the early 1990s while investigating the mechanisms of rapamycin a compound from soil bacteria with various health effects. Sabatini found that the protein rapamycin targets in the body mTOR is a master regulator of protein translation cell growth and proliferation. He started his own lab at MIT’s Whitehead Institute in 1997 where he continued to study mTOR and its pathway. According to HHMI’s website he had been funded by that organization since 2008. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2016. According to Business Insider he was involved in founding several biotech companies including Navitor KSQ Therapeutics and Raze Therapeutics.

An HHMI spokesperson writes to Science that Sabatini violated the institute’s workplace behavior policy. An MIT spokesperson says in an email to Science that Sabatini is still a tenured professor there but that the investigation “found violations of multiple Whitehead policies including its sexual harassment policy. MIT’s senior administration is reviewing the report and determining next steps in response to these findings up to and including revocation of tenure proceedings.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhbGludmVzdG1lbnRhZHZpY2UuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy95b3VyLXRlYW0vam9uYXRoYW4tcGVubi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senior Financial Advisor - Jonathan Penn | RIA Advisors,Jonathan has over 17 years of experience serving the unique financial needs of individuals and families.

The actual number: 461,"According to the state’s own plan  Massachusetts should be converting 100000 homes a year from fossil fuels to electricity for heating and cooling. The reality is much different: Just 461 homes made the switch last year according to data reviewed by the Globe.

But they are woefully behind pace to reach that lofty goal and the more time that passes without an urgent response the further out of reach it gets.

When Massachusetts officials look into the not-so-distant future of 2030 they see 1 million homes across the state comfortably heated and cooled by sleek efficient heat pumps their old oil- and gas-burning systems — and the climate-warming emissions they spewed — relegated to the scrap heap.

“We are nine years from 2030 and we have barely begun to scratch the surface in terms of what we’re doing and where we need to be going” said Eugenia Gibbons Massachusetts climate policy director for Healthcare Without Harm. “We need to be doing more faster. The world is burning — I don’t know how else to say it.”

Nearly one third of Massachusetts’ emissions come from its more than 2 million buildings. The state says eliminating those emissions by shifting to electrical sources — and replacing fossil fuel energy generation with renewable sources such as wind hydro-power and solar — is critical to achieving net zero emissions in time to do the most good. Between 2021 and 2030 the state estimates about 1 million residential heating systems will come to the end of their service lives — each a fossil fuel system that could be replaced by one using electricity.

Heat pumps which use electricity to heat and cool buildings are the best tools for electrifying homes according to the state’s Clean Energy and Climate for 2030 plan. Yet clean energy experts and advocates say there are several roadblocks to widespread adoption including high costs lack of confidence by consumers and ignorance of the technology among many heating contractors.

One of the biggest may be the state’s own energy efficiency program Mass Save. The program which is funded by a surcharge on utility bills and run by utility companies including gas providers offers rebates to homeowners for purchasing certain energy efficient equipment. While Mass Save purports to support the state’s climate goals advocates say it fails to support full home electrification and in some cases appears to even actively discourage it.

As the recent UN climate report made abundantly clear the time for action is running out. The planet has already warmed by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century and as this summer of extreme weather catastrophes has shown even this amount of warming comes with dire consequences. No matter how quickly we ramp up climate measures the planet is going to get even warmer the UN panel said; how much warmer will be determined by the steps taken now to stop greenhouse gas emissions — specifically by quitting fossil fuels.

Unlike many other states and even countries Massachusetts has a law on the books requiring the state to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. But setting a goal and achieving it are two different things and failure to ramp up now could lead to a chaotic rush down the road — or make the goal impossible to reach.

“We’re off by orders of magnitude from where we’re going to need to get to” said Cameron Peterson director of clean energy for the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.





“ ‘The world is burning—I don’t know how else to say it.’ Eugenia Gibbons the Massachusetts climate policy director for Healthcare Without Harm

At Mass Save the reluctance is hiding in plain sight. Some homeowners said contractors affiliated with Mass Save dissuaded them from removing their fossil fuel systems and going all-electric.

Moreover the list of heat pumps that qualify for Mass Save rebates includes equipment that is not specifically designed for cold climates. And even the 2021 form that homeowners must fill out for a rebate on heat pumps includes this note: “The Sponsors of Mass Save do not recommend fully displacing existing central heating system with heat pump equipment.”

Of the 461 full-electric conversions in 2020 fewer than half were facilitated by Mass Save. The rest came from programs sponsored by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center and the Department of Energy Resources. Both departments have offered programs that help homeowners purchase heat pumps. Though there may have been some additional electric conversions that year experts in the field said that number is likely to be small.

Critics who have been watching the slow progress in Massachusetts are coming to the conclusion that in its current form the Mass Save program which for 20 years has been effective at increasing energy efficiency may no longer be the best vehicle now that the program’s directive is shifting to helping fight the climate crisis.

“It’s difficult to build new imperatives onto old programs” said Matt Rusteika who leads the buildings initiative at Acadia Center a clean energy advocacy organization.

While the utilities behind Mass Save say they support the state’s decarbonization plan Chris Porter the director of customer energy management for National Grid in New England stressed that the current 2030 plan is still in draft form and that in National Grid’s opinion the best path forward may not be complete electrification.

“Our perspective is that there are multiple potential pathways to achieving the goal which is decarbonization and achieving the targets laid out in the climate act” said Porter. “There is still work to be done in order to determine what the optimal lowest-cost path to achieving that outcome is.”

Instead Porter said so-called renewable fuels such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas which he said could deliver lower-carbon fuels via existing infrastructure could play a role in the state’s future.

Both of those options are fraught. Critics say that renewable natural gas composed mainly of methane made from recaptured carbon or organic material like compost likely doesn’t exist at the scale needed and studies have found that gas leaks would still contribute to climate warming. Meanwhile hydrogen currently is made from methane and climate-friendlier versions are still in development while also being called out recently in a scientific journal as potentially as bad or worse than fossil fuels.

A state official said the 2030 climate plan remains in draft form mainly to incorporate the more rigorous carbon-cutting goals of the Massachusetts law. As a result any changes would likely step up the ambitions for electrification not reduce them.

The current and proposed incentives in the Mass Save program offer rebates to homeowners heating with oil or propane to purchase heat pumps but not to owners with gas systems. Mass Save says this is for financial reasons: Heat pumps are expensive. While oil and propane customers can expect to experience savings gas customers could see their bills rise slightly and Mass Save has historically functioned first and foremost to save customers money while increasing their energy efficiency.

But converting oil and propane customers alone will not get the state to 1 million electrified homes by 2030. Currently in Massachusetts 750000 homes are heated with oil or propane. To reach the goal that means at least 250000 gas customers must make the switch too.

Some residents said that as they sought to convert their homes off of fossil fuels contractors including those associated with Mass Save’s energy audit program told them that heat pumps alone could not heat a home adequately through a Massachusetts winter.

Rusteika saw this firsthand when he converted his own home to heat pumps. “I had five contractors here and only one advised against a full replacement” of his fossil fuel system he said. “That was the Mass Save partner.”

Across the state homeowners have said that as they sought to convert their homes off of fossil fuels they were told by contractors that it could not be done because of the cold winters in Massachusetts. That’s simply not true according to several experts in the field.

“Certainly we know that whole building electrification can work in Massachusetts” said Jeremy Koo an associate at Cadmus a technical and strategic consulting company that helped the state develop some of its climate plans and which helps implement heat pump programs across the region.

Unlike older models of heat pumps which earned a reputation in the 1990s for failing to adequately heat homes modern cold-climate heat pumps can function in temperatures as low as negative 13 degrees. But while some contractors have embraced the new technology the idea that heat pumps are ineffective lingers.

Ben Butterworth a Melrose homeowner and the senior manager for Climate and Energy Analysis at Acadia Center said that out the five contractors he spoke with only one was comfortable fully converting his oil-burning heating system to heat pumps. Because he works in the field and is well versed in the technology he knew to look around for a more amenable contractor to help him make the switch. But others might be more likely to take the first contractor’s advice and keep a fossil fuel system for backup.

Out in the field Dan Zamagni the director of operations for New England Ductless said his company has installed several whole-home heat pumps and has full confidence that they can do the job.

“I think that with a trained eye and the right situation you can make anything work” said Zamagni. “These systems are becoming more and more efficient.”

For many homeowners the high costs of installation and operation can represent another big hurdle. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for heat pumps so different kinds of equipment are needed depending on the specifics of an individual building. Installation costs can have a huge range. A whole-home heat pump program run by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center found an average project cost of $21479 which was higher than expected the program’s director Meg Howard noted in a blog.

“I am hopeful that this cost premium will shrink as installers become more accustomed to designing whole home heat pump configurations” she wrote.

Once heat pumps are up and running homeowners who were previously on oil or propane can expect their monthly bills to decrease. While homes previously heating with gas might see a slight increase in the cold months the annual bills are likely to even out because of savings from air conditioning Rusteika said.

Of course a lot of this depends on the house according to the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships an energy-efficiency nonprofit. Homeowners who weatherize their homes before getting estimates will find they save on both installation and operating costs while a drafty home is going to end up costing more.

For oil and propane users making the switch to heat pumps Mass Save rebates can add up to as much as $6250 in savings for the average sized home according to the Acadia Center.

By any metric the rate of heat pump installations is behind. The vast majority of heat pumps are installed in homes where they will supplement existing oil gas or propane systems not replace them outright. And in 2020 the Mass Save program helped install just 3300 heat pumps far short even of its own goal of 15000 a year.

Now a state-run board that oversees the program the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council is pushing the utilities behind Mass Save to go further. The council says the program should up its goal to 120000 heat pumps installed between 2021 and 2024 or 40000 a year. But there’s no clear goal around how many buildings would be fully electrified in that process and it remains to be seen whether Mass Save will ultimately adopt the council’s goal.

Installing heat pumps but keeping a fossil fuel system as a backup helps decrease greenhouse emissions and can lead to increased consumer confidence in the technology making homeowners more likely to fully electrify in the future several experts said.

But there’s a downside too. “Keeping in fossil fuel equipment has ramifications not just on how far the state gets towards its emissions targets but also has implications for the infrastructure that’s in place to continue supporting fossil fuel delivery” said Koo of Cadmus.

Recently the perpetually viral robotics company came up with mechanical automatons that could perform marvelous feats of parkour in controlled spaces. They’ve made robots dance open doors and walk around — all for seemingly peaceful purposes.

But Hollywood has trained us too well: seeing these robots shake and shimmy it’s hard not to imagine them hunting down humans. If you’ve got any interest in seeing what that would look like Mark Toia’s 2020 debut offers a pretty clear compelling vision of a future in which our advanced technology has turned on us with deadly results.

Here’s why you need to stream Monsters of Man now that it’s on Amazon Prime.

While the plot of this DIY sci-fi feature revolves around the humans forced to work with and run from killer robots the machines themselves are the stars of the show.

That’s a testament to Australian filmmaker Toia’s background in advertising. A rookie director in the most technical meaning of the word he’s been behind the camera for over 20 years directing high-profile ads for everything from Jeep to the Bank of China. Like Michael Bay before him Toia is now using his experience in advertising to create beautifully framed action sequences and gorgeous striking shots.

Toia also co-wrote the script for Monsters of Man which could use some work. Speaking to JoBlo in late 2020 Toia said that his son told him that his movie “ripped off Rambo Predator and Terminator.” His son is correct. Set in Cambodia the movie focuses on a test run of killer robots by a shady tech company which is vying for a major deal with the American government.

Meant to take out drug traffickers these robots come across a group of do-gooder doctors who become witnesses to their illegal actions. Soon it’s up to an ex-Navy SEAL (Brett Tutor) who just happens to be living in the Cambodian village to save everyone from a robot-facilitated massacre. That’s the jungle setting of Predator the killer robots of Terminator and the lone-wolf operative of Rambo for those keeping score at home.

Shot in Cambodia on a self-financed budget of $1.6 million Toia also handled his film’s cinematography. The country’s hilly jungles come through in beautiful greens with the light often shining in just the right way to illuminate some extraordinary fauna.

Though the movie employed a Cambodian crew slim roles for native Cambodians on-screen in Monsters of Man leave much to be desired. Some elements of ‘80s-tastic action movies didn’t need to be brought back and that includes the casting of people of color as either one-dimensional thugs or one-dimensional angels. Besides most of the Cambodian characters in Monsters of Man end up as cannon fodder. In fact a child from the village Leap (Ly Ty) is the only Cambodian character who stands out in any meaningful way.

A scene from Monsters of Men. 11:11 Entertainment

The movie ping-pongs between three general locations. There’s the jungle itself where the doctors are running around screaming. At another remote location the robots are being controlled by three in-over-their-heads tech nerds being yelled at by a commando meathead (Jose Rosete from The Walking Dead webisodes Red Machete). One of these techies Kroger (David Haverty) comes as close as anyone in the film to having a full-on personality: his pride in his autism demand for energy bars and willingness to sell out others for profit all make him a very believable coder-for-hire.

There’s also a third story wheel taking place in Washington D.C where a shady military official (Neal McDonough from Captain America: The First Avenger) is watching the action. McDonough separated from the rest of the cast spends most of his time staring at a screen yelling “Fuck!” or throwing papers off his desk angrily.

A scene from Monsters of Men. 11:11 Entertainment

But this movie is not called Watch Neal McDonough Cash an Easy Paycheck. It’s called Monsters of Man. And the monsters definitely deliver. Originally the movie was only supposed to have around six visual effects shots Toia told the No Film School podcast.

He set out to mirror movies that hide their monsters for added suspense such as Gareth Edwards’ Monsters or John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place. “But once we started shooting I just stared at these guys walking around in blue suits [for visual effects] thinking ‘Wow imagine if every single shot was a robot’” he told the podcast. Ultimately Toia said he decided “‘Let’s do that.’”

This decision which pushed the post-production process over budget resulted in 2500 VFX shots. It was definitely the right call as the robots are extremely cool with a gritty military look and fun robot voices. They roam the Cambodian jungle looking to hunt down witnesses to their crimes grabbing at them with mechanical hands translating their languages and somehow cancelling several self-destruct orders from techies.

Late in the movie Monsters of Man starts to become philosophical about the differences between robots and soldiers. It doesn’t take these questions seriously as scenes pondering such an existential crisis then transition into scenes of two killer robots whaling on each other. But it’s the latter kind of money shot — bots pulverizing one another as a shootout erupts around them — that satisfies most. When it eases up on the philosophy Monsters of Man can be a blast.

Monsters of Man has emerged as a surprise pandemic hit entering the top 10 in sci-fi/fantasy download charts on iTunes based off its exciting trailer. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald Toia recently said he is getting new scripts “every morning” suggesting he’ll be back. And that’s great news. This director clearly understands the visual language of cinema. It will be fascinating to see what he does with someone else’s story.",,,

FSU researcher leads DOE project on advance quantum information

A Florida State University researcher is leading a $4.4 million Department of Energy project to help create software that can take advantage of supercomputer capabilities and advance quantum information science.

The project is led by FSU Associate Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Eugene DePrince and includes collaborators from Virginia Tech University of Washington and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Quantum science has become a major priority for the U.S. Department of Energy.

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental physics theory that allows for the calculation of properties and behaviors of microscopic systems such as molecules atoms and sub-atomic particles. Computers lasers and scanning technologies are all based off quantum mechanical systems.

DePrince’s initial work will focus on developing capabilities to simulate the dynamics of quantum-mechanical systems that could be used to create spin-based technologies.

Though he will be working on microscopic systems DePrince noted that similar simulations could be applied to everyday objects — a baseball for example — although the math is a little different.

FSU criminology professors earn NSF grant to explore hate crimes

A Florida State University research institute has received funding from the National Science Foundation to explore how hate crimes are reported and underreported.

The Hate Crime Research and Policy Institute at FSU’s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice will receive $236985 from the NSF over the course of two years to fund research by Assistant Professors of Criminology Sylwia Piatkowska and Brendan Lantz.

“It has long been known that hate crimes are underreported” Piatkowska said. “With this National Science Foundation grant we plan to explore the sources causes and extent of the underreporting and hopefully provide ways to address those problems in the future.”

While the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to publicly report hate crime statistics hate crimes are often under-identified Piatkowska said. According to the U.S. Department of Justice there were 8552 victims of hate crimes in the United States in 2019.

Findings from the project will aid scholars policymakers and the public on issues related to hate crimes including variation in hate crime and reporting data-collection strategies better identification of strategies to tend to victims and assessing programs related to hate crime victimization and reporting.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

This report was originally published on August. 1 2015. It is a part of the series ""Risk/Reward.""

Of the four new anticoagulant drugs billed as alternatives to warfarin Eliquis is the only one that can claim it reduces deaths in people with atrial fibrillation.

But is that claim real?

An FDA reviewer doesn't think so.

In the clinical trial of Eliquis patients getting the drug were 11% less likely to die from any cause than those getting warfarin which for decades had been the only anticoagulant used to prevent strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.

But because vital data — primarily involving deaths — was missing from the trial FDA reviewer Thomas Marciniak concluded that if there was one more death among Eliquis patients or one less warfarin death the benefit would no longer be considered statistically significant.

In a December 2012 memo Marciniak noted there were more than 300 Eliquis patients with missing data.

""I like most FDA reviewers would like to conclude that apixaban (Eliquis) is effective in atrial fibrillation — we would like to have alternatives to warfarin"" Marciniak wrote.

But the data problems ""destroy our confidence"" that the drug reduces deaths he concluded.

Marciniak's review also said the Eliquis trial was just one of many other trials — he did not name the others — that had substantial problems with data quality.

""Some of the responsibility for the data quality problems rests with us the FDA: We have approved drugs ignoring similar data quality issues granting superiority claims and not discussing in the labels the data quality issues"" he wrote. ""We must stop doing this.""

Marciniak called for the data problems to be described at length on the drug's label but he was overruled by others at the FDA.

In a response memo two other FDA officials discounted Marciniak's comments and wrote they were ""somewhat unrealistic.""

They said the missing data was not ""especially large"" and it was unclear if the ""missingness"" favored Eliquis actually making the death benefit more significant.

""Perhaps some (patient data) were lost to follow-up because they had a stroke or died which potentially biases the study results"" they wrote. ""However there is no reason to believe that this was more likely in the apixaban (Eliquis) arm than in the warfarin arm. We cannot directly address whether the missing data are biased in one direction.""

In addition they said drug companies should not have to provide a ""cushion"" when it comes to establishing statistical significance.

In an email representatives of Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb which co-market the drug said data compiled in its trial came from more than 1000 sites in 40 countries.

The data was ""thorough and complete despite inherent challenges with following such a large and diverse population"" they said. ""As the FDA ultimately decided the small fraction of patients lost to follow-up did not adversely alter the interpretation of superior results vs. warfarin.""

However F. Perry Wilson an expert in clinical trial design and an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University Medical School said Marciniak makes a valid point.

""I would tend to agree that touting this as a potential (mortality) benefit of the drug is likely very premature"" said Wilson who reviewed the FDA documents for this story.

Carol Miller and Alex Mooney have displaced Rep. David McKinley as the wealthiest members of West Virginia’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation according to their 2020 personal finance disclosures filed earlier this month.

All three are Republicans. Miller 3rd District is tops with an estimated net worth of $75.21 million. Mooney 2nd District is second at $14.7 million. McKinley 1st District is third at $10.4 million.

As we reported last week Sen. Joe Manchin’s estimated 2020 net worth was $8.6 million and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s was $2.53 million.

As we stated last week The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probable range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

Here’s a look at each member of Congress.

Carol Miller

Miller has an asset range of $15186062 to $340390006. Her liabilities range from $4365006 to $200800004.

Using the formula that puts her range of worth at -$185613942 to $336025000. From that her estimated net worth comes to $75205529.

Members of Congress are required to report their own and their spouse’s assets. The bulk of Miller’s assets come from her husband’s (Matt Miller) ownership of five Dutch Miller auto dealerships all valued at more than $1 million. In addition he has ownership interest through MFM Realty of the five dealership properties with four of those valued at more than $1 million and one valued at $100001-$250000.

Open Secrets notes the challenge of estimating spousal assets valued at more than $1 million because House reporting rules don’t require a maximum range. For those assets Open Secrets sets a cap of $50 million for its formula and we used the same figure.

Out of curiosity we also calculated an estimated net worth by setting that cap at $5 million. Even with that lower cap Miller still comes in at the wealthiest of West Virginia’s five with an estimated net worth of $30.2 million.

Miller and her husband also hold a variety of stock assets. They have pharmaceutical stock: Abbott AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb CVS Health Johnson & Johnson McKesson Merck Pfizer and Viatris.

Their tech holdings include Apple Microsoft Cisco and Oracle.

Examples of other holdings are: Altria (tobacco products) Coca-Cola Dominion Energy Energizer (batteries) Hormel Foods (Spam) McDonald’s Yum! (KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut) and Proctor & Gamble.

Stock portfolios are subject to frequent trades and updates logged on Periodic Transaction Reports; the companies cited here and for the others are on their annual filings.

Miller’s liabilities include two mortgages a farm loan two loans for the dealerships and a business floor plan loan.

As we reported last week Manchin ranked 67th most wealthy for both houses of Congress in 2018 (the last year for which Open Secrets evaluated and ranked all 535 members) and 19th in the Senate. Capito was 169th and 46th respectively.

Miller wasn’t in the U.S. House in 2018 but plugging her current estimated net worth into the 2018 list would put her at 11th overall and ninth in the House.

Alex Mooney

Virtually all of Mooney’s worth stems from one asset: his wife’s (Grace Mooney) TIAA retirement annuity valued at $5000001-$25000000.

Mooney himself holds nine Maryland Supplemental Retirement Plan 401K funds. All but one of those are valued at $1001-$15000. The ninth is valued at $1-$1000.

His combined asset range is $5009011-$25136000. He reports one liability a home mortgage valued at $250001-$500000.

Using the formula Mooney’s range of worth is $4509011-$24885999. That puts his estimated net worth at $14697505.

In 2018 his wife’s retirement annuity wasn’t factored in and his estimated net worth was just $137005 ranking him 287th in the House and 360th overall.

David McKinley

In 2018 McKinley’s estimated net worth was $6739056 placing him second after Manchin and above Capito Mooney and then-Rep. Evan Jenkins. Jenkins now state Supreme Court chief justice ranked fourth among the five with an estimated net worth of $920023.

For all of Congress in 2018 McKinley ranked 82nd overall for net worth and 59th in the House.

For 2020 McKinley reported assets of $5016118-$15796000. He reported no liabilities.

His estimated net worth came to $10406059.

He and his wife Mary hold a broad array of assets. Stock holdings include Abbott Laboratories Apple Costco Dollar Tree Home Depot Intuit MasterCard Microsoft Starbucks Sysco (food distributor) Tractor Supply and UnitedHealth.

Many of their assets are packaged into IRA accounts and a Black Rock-managed set of exchange-traded funds called iShares.

They own a rental property in Wheeling worth $1000001-$5000000 and co-own with other family members 90 acres of Preston County timber land valued at $15001-$50000.

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYnJvd25iZWFycy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvNy9mb290YmFsbC13ZWxjb21lcy0yOC10by10aGUtaW5jb21pbmctY2xhc3Mtb2YtMjAyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Football Welcomes 28 to the Incoming Class of 2028,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Weather in your inbox

It may lack the outright carrying capacity and quick release mounts commonly found on touring models but these things aside it's well-made reassuringly secure and very waterproof.

For the main bag Craft Cadence has gone the high-frequency welded tarpaulin route reminiscent of UPSO's range. While the IPX5 rating means it isn't waterproof in the submersible sense combined with the 'clam shell' design it shuts the door to heavy rain. I've had no issues throughout the test period whatsoever.

Total capacity is 3.5 litres. The deep main compartment features a mesh pocket for phones wallets and the like while the rest is open plan and lends itself beautifully to the end-of-day 'bung in and get home' school of packing.

At 20cm tall it comfortably swallows tool bags spare tubes gloves arm and leg warmers a micro jacket snacks a USB charger a spare battery and lights – oh and its own detachable shoulder strap – without signs of indigestion. I had no issues with bounce bob or sway. Just make sure there's enough space between your bars and front tyre to accommodate it.

Externally there is a lighting tab and retro-reflective detailing though the tab is the best host to clip-on blinkies rather than chunky torch types. This Moon Nebula Front Light is as big and heavy as I've dared go.

Mounts

These are what I'd describe as 'watch straps on steroids' but Craft Cadence also sells Velcro versions if that's what you're gagging for.

One thing to note is that the tighter you pull the straps the higher the bag sits. In some instances this may require relocation of lights and other accessories to suit. The straps have clearly inscribed increments making it easy to match either side.

There is a third stabiliser strap made from Velcro and designed to wrap around the headtube for added stability. This arrangement is less convenient than the popular KlickFix or other quick release systems and Velcro can leave 'tan lines' in your paintwork so placing 'helicopter' tape around the head tube is a sensible precaution.

Weatherproofing

As a matter of course I subjected this to my close range 3-minute garden hose test and was pleasantly surprised to find the contents remained bone dry. Out on the road torrential thundery rain simply beaded up and rolled away and the inside remained dry even after 2-3 hours. Being tarpaulin the outside is also easily wiped clean.

After 350 miles of use there's scant evidence of wear to any part of it.

Value

The Craft Cadence is competitive given its specification and capacity. The Altura Heritage Bar Bag is pretty similar and although it has a Rixen & Kaul mount that's a double-edged sword – it's very stable but slow to swap between bikes – and the price is a good deal steeper at £60.

You can go significantly cheaper than the Craft Cadence though – 7L 'barrel type' bar bags start under £20 while 8.5-litre tarpaulin versions can be had for under £30. Those on a tight budget and willing to sacrifice some water-repellency may find 3L BTR Water Resistant Handlebar Bag With Phone Navigation Pocket worth a closer look but you get what you pay for – it's let down by the pocket's positioning and so-so fitting kit.

Summary

Minor niggles aside I think Craft Cadence have struck the right balance in terms of pricing design and specification for commuting and general riding. The strap system might not be to everyone's taste but it's infinitely superior to Velcro in my book and more universally accommodating than models employing quick-release brackets.

Verdict

Rugged and strongly water-resistant bar bag with some nice touches but check clearance on smaller framesets",,,,,,,,,,,,

Isle of Capri Casino has been renamed Horseshoe Casino Lake Charles following Thursday’s approval by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. The new identity brings with it a series of improvements to revamp the hurricane-battered riverboat casino property into a state-of-the-art land-based facility that is expected to open by the fall of 2022.

Officials with Caesars Entertainment Isle of Capri’s parent company said in a news release that the plans subject to gaming control board approval call for more than 60000 square feet of casino space; nearly 1000 slot machines and table games; a World Series of Poker Room with 10 poker tables; a Sportsbook location for sports betting; a renovated 250-plus room tower hotel; and new restaurants.

The gaming board heard an update on the project from Dan Real Caesars south regional president and Jeff Favre Isle of Capri general manager. Real spoke of the long 18 months that included the COVID-19 pandemic followed by the destructive Hurricane Laura last August and Hurricane Delta last October. The hurricanes essentially put any renovation work on hold for months.

“It’s been very difficult” he said. “Seeing our team members back in Lake Charles gives us a lot of hope to get this property up and running again. We’re very proud of the project we’re putting together.”

Act 469 approved by the state Legislature in the 2018 session allowed riverboat licenses to relocate within 1200 feet of their berth to a land-based space. The gaming board in December 2019 approved the Isle relocating its riverboat casino to land the first to get state approval. At that time the casino was set to be rebranded as Eldorado Resorts. Eldorado completed its $17.3 billion purchase of Caesars in July 2020 and took the Caesars name.

The gaming board’s approval allows for demolition of the Inn – the older hotel on the Isle property that sustained severe damage from Hurricane Laura. Favre said it’s a smarter financial move to use the money set aside to renovate the Inn on upgrading the tower hotel rooms.

The board approved the old Isle of Capri riverboat to be sold. Hurricane Laura’s 150-mile-per-hour winds pushed the riverboat and wedged it underneath the Interstate 10-Calcasieu River bridge. Favre said there is a contract to sell the riverboat to a licensed gaming supplier.

Ronnie Johns gaming board chairman said the updated plans for the Horseshoe Casino is good news for Southwest Louisiana. The Thursday meeting was Johns’ first as board chairman since being appointed by Gov. John Bel Edwards in July. Johns resigned his District 27 Senate seat to serve on the board.

“We’re very excited about what they’re building there” he said Friday. “It’s going to be a much nicer property than what we envisioned.”

Favre said the roof is 85 percent replaced. The property also includes a new lift station a chilled water plant to provide the entire facility with air conditioning and heating and a new 14000-square-foot warehouse.

In addition to the Horseshoe Casino approval the board also approved emergency rules to allow casinos and four racetracks to move forward with temporary facilities for sports betting off the gaming floor. Johns said some of the casinos could take in-person bets by mid- to late-September. The emergency rules are in effect for 180 days and can be renewed for another 180-day period.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMm5ld3Nub3cuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb21wYW55LXBsYW5zLXRvLWJyaW5nLWlzbGUtb2YtY2FwcmktbGFrZS1jaGFybGVzLWFzaG9yZS81MDItMjEwMDgwMzQtNmY4MS00MDc2LTg0YmQtNWQ5ZGQ4YjdlMWVi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company plans to bring Isle of Capri Lake Charles ashore,"Construction is scheduled to be completed by fall 2022.

As a 15-year-old growing up in Far Hills New Jersey in 1998 Jared Isaacman was ready for something different. He had enough of high school and saw his three older siblings — all at least 10 years older — leading more fun and interesting lives than him.

Boy was that about to change.

As it was Isaacman was more focused on making money with a computer repair and web design company that he and a friend started. Looking to drum up business he got a job at CompUSA thinking a giant computer retailer wasn’t a bad place to find customers. Not too long after one of those clients a credit card processing services firm called Merchant Services Inc. extended the teenager a full-time information technology job.

So at 16 Isaacman left high school got his GED and went to work for MSI. He wasn’t there long but the job gave him exposure to the payments industry showing him how clunky and neglected certain parts of it were especially for businesses simply looking to accept credit card payments. As Isaacman often does he saw opportunity.

That same year in 1999 he left MSI and started United Bank Card in his parents’ basement beginning his journey to transform the payments industry as a teenager who couldn’t yet qualify for his own credit card.

Today United Bank Card through rapid growth many acquisitions and some name changes too is Shift4 Payments a company with 1500 employees including about 500 at its headquarters in a nondescript brick office building at Lehigh Valley Industrial Park III in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

The 38-year-old Isaacman who lives in Palmer Township remains at the helm as CEO leading a company that with 7000 sales partners annually processes more than $200 billion in payments for 200000 businesses.

Jared Isaacman founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments.

And while Shift4 has plenty of Main Street customers the company lives more on the complex end of the spectrum targeting businesses such as large hotel chains ski resorts sports stadiums and casinos. All told more than 21000 hotels and 125000 restaurants in the United States use at least one of Shift4’s products.

“If you can run your entire business on an iPad like a food truck then that’s Square country” Isaacman said. “Our customers need like 20 different types of software to function.”

Payment volume suffered early in the pandemic but Shift4 started to see some recovery in the restaurant space as early as April 2020 which allowed it to proceed with an initial public offering two months later. When the company went public Isaacman became a billionaire via his 38% stake in the company. Today Forbes puts his net worth at about $2.4 billion.

Beyond the world of payments Isaacman is an accomplished pilot rated to fly several types of commercial and military aircraft. That passion led him to build Draken International a defense firm that trains Air Force pilots that Isaacman sold two years ago to Blackstone for nine figures.

And as he runs Shift4 which now has a market capitalization of $6.5 billion Isaacman also is preparing to launch into space next month as the commander of Inspiration4 the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth.

Even for Isaacman accustomed to working day and night since he was 16 he’s having to use all hours of the night and weekends to balance the responsibilities. He told The Morning Call during an interview last month that his Shift4 executive team is getting emails from him at 2 or 3 in the morning as he rotates between the payments business and his space-training schedule. He’s also squeezing in time with his wife Monica and his two daughters ages 5 and 7.

As for what comes next?

“Right now I’m really just focused on this mission because it’s so damn important” Isaacman said. “And really there’s some pretty unbelievable things we’ve been working on at Shift4 too that I think can be pretty transformational over the next year. So those are all top of mind but I’m sure there will always be something that comes next. But we’ve got enough on the plate right now.”

Despite the national attention Isaacman has received over the last year — he was featured in Forbes last fall after taking Shift4 public and the Inspiration4 crew made the cover of TIME magazine — many Lehigh Valley residents may not even know his name or realize he calls this area home. Residents may have however heard the company’s Harbortouch product mentioned on “Bar Rescue” after host Jon Taffer in 2017 endorsed the company’s touchscreen point-of-sale systems.

In the Lehigh Valley Shift4 is a large employer but certainly not as immediately recognizable as PPL Corp. Air Products or Mack Trucks. And while Isaacman spends a good portion of his time here and is building a home in Lower Nazareth Township many Lehigh Valley business nonprofit and economic development leaders have had a hard time getting his ear.

“We’re very glad that he’s chosen the Lehigh Valley for both his business and his home” said Don Cunningham president and CEO of Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. “He’s an exciting guy with a great company. We’re hopeful that someday he’ll become involved in the Lehigh Valley community.”

How Shift4 came here

It wasn’t until 2011 when the fast-growing United Bank Card made the move to the Lehigh Valley from Hunterdon County New Jersey.

In the years prior the company grew rapidly gaining trade publication attention as early as 2003 and launching a pioneering free terminal program a year later.

By 2005 United Bank Card made its debut on the Inc. 5000 — the magazine’s annual list of the country’s fastest-growing private firms — at No. 19 with revenue growth of 2319% between 2001 and ’04.

The company made it to No. 6 in 2006 the year Isaacman was featured on “American Story with Bob Dotson” on NBC. The host told the story per a transcript of the segment of a 23-year-old entrepreneur who employed 125 people bought his dad a Ferrari for Father’s Day and donated $24000 to a homeless shelter.

Things were rolling by the time the company in 2008 launched its Harbortouch point-of-sale system which handled magnetic card swipes and also included software for inventory management and merchandise pricing.

Amid the growth Isaacman said it was an easy natural choice to come to the Lehigh Valley.

For one the company needed to access a talent pool which meant either going east or west. As it was many of the company’s employees already were making the trip from Pennsylvania which also offered lower costs for United Bank Card.

The Lehigh Valley also had another advantage: Lehigh Valley International Airport the place where aviation enthusiast and pilot Isaacman learned to fly.

So the firm set up its headquarters at 2202 N. Irving St. in Hanover Township adjacent to the airport. The state chipped in a $778750 funding package.

In 2012 following the success of the company’s Harbortouch point-of-sale system United Bank Card rebranded as Harbortouch.

“United Bank Card I picked that name in 1999 because it sounded like an established financial institution and I was 16 years old in my parents’ basement so I needed a name like that” Isaacman said. “The moment we started building our own hardware and software and had our point-of-sale capabilities by 2008 that was the last message we wanted to send.

“We didn’t want to sound like an old and crusty financial institution. We wanted to sound like we were fast moving and that we had this killer technology that was also safe” he said.

In fall 2017 the company by then known as Lighthouse Network searched for a new headquarters location in the Lehigh Valley to house its growing workforce. The company looked at locations in Allentown including The Waterfront but early in 2018 decided to expand in place in Hanover Township.

“The reason we’re in our present facilities now and making do is because we didn’t leave ourselves enough time to transition to another facility” Isaacman said.

Shift4 Payments has its headquarters in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

Even before that decision the company continued getting larger.

Harbortouch acquired MSI — Isaacman’s old employer — in 2014 and two years later gained an investment from private-equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners to accelerate its growth plans.

Several acquisitions followed none more transformative than the January 2018 purchase of Shift4 Corp. a Las Vegas payment processing company that served tens of thousands of clients across North America including Choice Hotels Caesars Entertainment and the PGA Tour.

“We went from being able to process payments from four different types of software to 350 types of software in an industry that was moving rapidly toward integrated payments and software” Isaacman said. “It was a very important deal for us.”

With that deal complete Lighthouse Network rebranded as Shift4 Payments — a name Isaacman hopes sticks.

“But yeah 21 years of history we’ve had a couple name changes but it’s all based on just the evolution of the business” he said. “We just didn’t stay still and do the same thing that made us special 20 years ago and hope that would still carry the day five years later. We just evolved.”

Pandemic hits

It was Thursday March 19 2020 when Shift4 sent its office employees home the day Gov. Tom Wolf ordered the closure of non-life-sustaining businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Isaacman remembers walking down the rows of empty cubicles at the Lehigh Valley office wondering “Am I ever going to see anybody back here again?”

For Shift4 it was a shock. The company had spent the last decade predominately focused on serving restaurants and hotels — some of the hardest-hit industries. As the situation worsened Shift4 delayed its long-planned initial public offering.

“You go from a business that you built in your parents’ basement to something that people are saying ‘Wow this thing could be worth billions and billions of dollars in the public markets’ to ‘Everybody go home payment volume is virtually nonexistent the world is shut down’ ” Isaacman said.

“And you’re like ‘What just happened?’ We went from something to nothing pretty damn fast.”

Business took a major hit by late March 2020 when Shift4’s end-to-end payment volume — the dollar amount of card payments it authorizes and settles on behalf of merchants — tanked 70% according to the company’s annual report.

To bolster its finances Shift4 furloughed about 25% of its employees instituted a hiring freeze and reduced salaries for management.

At the same time the company raced to roll out new solutions for its customers especially restaurants as the world pivoted from dine-in to takeout and delivery.

For three months it waived online ordering mobile payment and gift card fees for restaurants. By the end of April it launched a free solution that enabled restaurants to publish an online ordering website in less than an hour. And by late June it introduced technology that allowed consumers to pay their bill at restaurants retailers and hotels by scanning a QR code on the receipt or terminal and completing the transaction on their phone.

Slowly but surely payment volume started recovering.

“What we saw even starting in the first week of April 2020 is people got to eat” Isaacman said noting the company logged year-over-year volume growth in June 2020 as it won market share from competitors.

And during the third quarter last year Shift4 reinstated “substantially all” of its workforce. It lifted the hiring freeze in August 2020 and fully reinstated management salaries in October.

Those optimistic signs early in the pandemic allowed Shift4 to move forward with its IPO in early June 2020 only a couple of months later than planned.

The company’s IPO was priced at $23 a share. Shift4’s shares opened the next day at $33.10 a 44% jump.

Where is it headed?

Shift4’s stock price has increased since eclipsing $100 in April and now trading around $80.

The company has continued to grow acquiring VenueNext in March for $72 million in cash and stock and bolstering Shift4’s presence in sports stadiums entertainment venues and theme parks. Shift4 also has inked deals this year with the San Diego Padres and the United Center home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks.

Shift4 Payments rings the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on June 3 in celebration of the one-year anniversary of its initial public offering.

And on June 22 Shift4 said it processed $1 billion in weekly end-to-end payment volume for the first time. For reference Isaacman said the company’s first billion-dollar year was 2004 and to hit $1 billion in just one week in 2021 means Shift4 has reached a compound annual growth rate of more than 26% for the last 17 years.

Shift4 also is coming off a second quarter in which it beat Wall Street’s expectations: The company logged gross revenue of $351 million net revenue of about $136 million and reported its first quarter of positive net income at $4.5 million.

Isaacman however is quick to point out the company on an earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or EBITDA basis has been profitable since 2004.

Shift4 also reported record quarterly end-to-end payment volume of $11.8 billion nearly three times the comparable period last year and more than double the same period in 2019.

That growth outpaced the roughly 30% jump in spending during the quarter — as compared to 2019 — from Visa and Mastercard users in the United States pointed out Darrin Peller managing director at Wolfe Research.

It’s even more noteworthy he noted when considering hotels a big business for Shift4 haven’t fully recovered yet.

For 2021 Shift4 is now forecasting end-to-end payment volume of $46 billion-$48 billion.

“In our view they’re doing very well and gaining quite a bit of market share” said Peller who analyzes the payments processing and IT services industries and covers Shift4.

And that growth should continue to funnel into the Lehigh Valley.

Isaacman pointed out he’s in the midst of a home construction process in Lower Nazareth that has been ongoing since before his 7-year-old daughter was born.

“So I’m very committed to my home being in the Lehigh Valley area and that Shift4’s headquarters will be in the Lehigh Valley area” he said.

But Isaacman hinted that it may not always be in its spot at 2202 N. Irving St. The company’s annual report shows that its lease at its 45840-square-foot headquarters expires Aug. 31 2025.

He admits the company’s Lehigh Valley office is “suboptimal” forcing Shift4 to pick up space in the general vicinity as needed. Shift4 he said also is thinking about what the post-pandemic workspace will look like.

“One of our hubs will always be here and I just can’t see us continuing for the long run to do this makeshift setup we have today” Isaacman said. “It’s going to be either some sort of a new build or a consolidation into a more modern fun facility for our employees.”

Thinking about where the company is many expansions later is still difficult for Isaacman to fathom. He reflects constantly going back and reading emails he wrote 15 or 20 years ago to replay a certain decision and think about what he could have done differently.

But there’s still no way the 16-year-old ambitious entrepreneur in his parents’ basement all those years ago could have guessed his future self would be a billionaire or a pilot readying to venture into space.

“I couldn’t have imagined that I would be sitting here in this situation I’m in today a year and a half ago let alone five 10 15 years ago” he said. “But I also would say I wasn’t either driven or motivated in any of those periods of times to be a billionaire or go to space. It was just ‘What is the challenge that we’re undertaking right now and how do we succeed at it?’

“It’s just that as you grow as an organization the challenges become bigger and the results if you do succeed become grander.”

With core values of “excellence” and “do the right thing” Capital One’s mission to change banking for good and help people succeed earned it third place in the large company category in The News Journal’s Top Workplaces competition for 2021.

Capital One prides itself on a building a culture beyond the status quo where people can find purpose and connection in their work and its employees wholeheartedly agree.

“I feel what I do is so cool and I love going to work” one employee said. “I know I am so lucky because after six years I still feel that I hit the jackpot on jobs.”

“Capital One offered me the job opportunity based on my abilities and skills that no one had ever wanted to appreciate before” another submission said.

“Despite the challenges of last year Capital One remained steadfast in our values and commitment to put our people first” said Joe Westcott Capital One Delaware Market President. “Being named a top workplace especially in the state of Delaware reinforces our mission to change banking for good and help our associates customers and communities thrive.”

Aside from cultivating strong work connections other employees stress gratitude for the company’s flexibility and innovation.

“I have the constant ability to continue to learn and grow both personally and professionally” said a Top Workplaces submission.

To cater to diverse needs Capital One offers various types of support for its workers including education assistance adoption or surrogacy reimbursement and gender reassignment coverage.

In the wake of social justice movements the company was vocal about racial equity and inclusion not only in the office but also in real communities.

“I feel very informed about social injustice and how to be an antiracist due to Capital One’s efforts” said an employee.

Throughout the pandemic Capital One expedited relief grants to aid food and hunger relief support small business owners and provide assistance for low-income individuals and families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vMTgtYmFjay1hdC12aWF0b3Itc2F2ZS1vbi1hY3Rpdml0aWVzLXZpYS1jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,18% back at Viator (save on activities) via Capital One,"Capital One offers a public shopping portal (Capital One shopping) and also has non-public shopping offers that cardholders can find within their Capital One accounts called Capital One Offers. Confusingly Capital One Offers also function like a shopping portal but you need to be in your Capital One credit card account to find them.

That could be a fantastic offer if you’re looking to book activities.

Quick Thoughts

Keep in mind that the 18% cash back here is on top of credit card rewards. Assuming you’re booking with a Venture card you’re looking at a return equivalent of 20%.

I recently wrote about booking activities and determined that booking via Viator (and paying yourself back by cashing out points at the grocery store or something like that) could yield a better value than booking through a credit card portal (See: Tours & activities with points: which deal is “best”?). I found that to be the case with an assumption of just 10% back at Viator – getting 18% back would far tip the balance to booking your activities with cash and paying yourself back later.

Keep in mind that Viator has a best price guarantee policy so if you find a better price for the same activity / operator they will refund the difference. I recently took that for a test drive and found it to be quick and painless: I found my chosen activity for 20% less than what Viator was charging and Viator promptly refunded 20% of my money. The problem with a low price guarantee is that I don’t know whether an agent making that modification may invalidate portal cash back (including the cash back from this offer) but I’ll probably give this a shot with a different activity booking.

Keep in mind that these Capital One Offers may take a long time to post (terms say 3 billing cycles). I’ve only made a couple of very small “test” purchases through these offers and I haven’t had success with the offers tracking though I will take a swing at this one and see what happens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL29uZS1uaWdodC1ob3RlbC1zdGF5cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 situations where booking a one-night hotel stay is worth the effort,"One-night hotel stays are a hassle. Even ignoring the late arrivals and early departures that often accompany these stays I lose a lot of time on short stays. After all getting to the hotel checking in unpacking and then repacking takes time.

Even so I often find myself booking one-night hotel stays. So today I'll explain four times when I book one-night hotel stays.

Staying near an airport

Airport hotels often have AvGeek-friendly views. (Photo by Brendan Dorsey/The Points Guy)

When I recently visited Walt Disney World on a budget TPG director of travel content Summer Hull suggested I stay at an airport hotel on my last night to maximize my last day at Disney. I ended up taking a late-night flight instead but a one-night stay near an airport can often save you money. After all hotels near airports often require fewer points or cash to book than hotels in more popular areas.

Booking a hotel near an airport often makes a late-night arrival or early-morning departure easier too. For example when I visited Monrovia Liberia for Peace Jam in 2019 the conference coordinator highly recommended staying at an airport hotel before my early-morning departure to avoid heavy unpredictable traffic.

Additionally I've lived as a location-independent digital nomad for more than four years. And since I continue to chase airline elite status and often can't resist booking flight deals I frequently book back-to-back trips. However I've learned to allow 24 to 36 hours between separate tickets to avoid headaches and potential misconnections. As such I often spend one night at an airport hotel between tickets.

Maximizing perks

Whether you need to work or want to enjoy the property the guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout provided to Marriott Platinum and Titanium elites is extremely valuable. (Photo of the Westin Langkawi by Katie Genter/The Points Guy)

Some hotel elite perks such as breakfast are given on a per-night basis. But other elite benefits such as upgrades are easier to snag on shorter stays. And some benefits such as a welcome amenity or guaranteed late check-out are only given once per stay.

I wouldn't book a one-night stay solely to have better upgrade changes or earn extra welcome amenities. But I have booked a one-night stay at a Marriott Bonvoy hotel as a Platinum Elite at the end of a trip primarily to utilize the guaranteed 4 p.m. check-out perk.

And I sometimes book a one-night stay at the beginning or end of my time at a destination through Amex's Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) program or Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection (LHRC). I have access to the Amex FHR program as a cardholder of The Platinum Card® from American Express. And various Chase credit cards offer access to the LHRC program.

These programs offer some excellent perks that you can maximize on one-night stays. For example if I have an early morning arrival into a city I love booking a one-night stay through Amex FHR to get noon check-in if it's available. Plus Amex FHR bookings also give me the following perks:

Room upgrade upon arrival when available at check-in

Daily breakfast for two people

Guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout

Complimentary Wi-Fi

Experience credit valued at $100 or more (usually consisting of a property dining or spa credit)

Whether I stay for one night or 10 nights I can only use the late checkout and experience credit once. And in some cases the value you'll get from breakfast and the experience credit on a one-night stay can justify a slightly higher room rate than you'd typically book -- especially if you have the new Amex Platinum prepaid hotel credit to use. For example I once got $160 of food and drink included on a $153 Amex FHR stay in Chicago.

Redeeming free night certificates

Many hotel credit cards come with an annual free night. And you can earn extra free night certificates in some hotel loyalty programs through promotions such as Hyatt's brand explorer promotion and IHG's recent InterContinental Ambassador promotion.

These hotel free night certificates can be extremely valuable. For example based on TPG's valuations an up to 50000-point Marriott free night award is worth up to $400. And Hilton's free weekend night certificates are valid at almost every Hilton property worldwide. So as a cost-conscious traveler an extra night at a hotel where I'd use these certificates would usually cost more points or cash than I'm willing to spend.

Of course sometimes my husband and I have two or more certificates we can use to book a stay of more than one night. But over the last few years we've redeemed free night certificates for one-night stays at the following hotels:

Conrad New York Midtown

The Ritz-Carlton Osaka

The St. Regis Osaka

Hyatt Regency JFK International Airport at Resorts World

Crowne Plaza Athens - City Centre

Each of these stays was memorable despite only staying one night. Best of all elite status provided us late checkout on most of these stays. So in some cases we stretched our stay to be about 24 hours long.

Maximizing hotel promotions

Finally travelers can maximize some hotel promotions by staying in one-night increments. For example my husband and I recently booked an inexpensive one-night stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens to earn an up to 40000-point free night certificate through the recent InterContinental Ambassador promotion. However for this particular stay we redeemed points on adjacent nights and asked the hotel to keep us in the same room for the entire stay.

But Choice Privileges frequently offers a promotion where you can earn at least 8000 points after every two stays. So I've stayed in a different Choice hotel each night on several trips to New York City. In each case I took my luggage to work with me each day and earned a little over 16000 points across four nights.

There are several current hotel promotions you could maximize with one-night stays. For example you can get a $20 Best Western gift card each night you stay at a U.S. Canada or Caribbean property (limit five gift cards) when you register and stay by Sept. 6 2021. And targeted members can currently earn 1000 bonus American Airlines miles per eligible Hyatt night.

But many programs have wised up to one-night maximizers and now require stays of two nights or more for promotions.

Bottom line

One-night hotel stays can also be great for staycations. After all especially as the coronavirus pandemic continues to limit travel for some a staycation can let you rest and recharge (or provide a quiet place away from family and roommates). However I haven't needed a staycation as I've spent much of the pandemic traveling full-time in an RV. But now that I'm spending less time in the RV and more time traveling internationally my one-night hotel bookings are increasing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JldmVyYmx1ZXNoaXJ0cy5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmstcmFuZ2Vycy1ncmVhdHMtaGVucmlrLWx1bmRxdmlzdC10by1qb2luLW1pa2UtcmljaHRlci1hbmQtZWQtZ2lhY29taW4tYXRvcC10aGUtbXNnLXJhZnRlcnMv0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmV2ZXJibHVlc2hpcnRzLmNvbS9uZXcteW9yay1yYW5nZXJzLWdyZWF0cy1oZW5yaWstbHVuZHF2aXN0LXRvLWpvaW4tbWlrZS1yaWNodGVyLWFuZC1lZC1naWFjb21pbi1hdG9wLXRoZS1tc2ctcmFmdGVycy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Rangers greats: Henrik Lundqvist to join Mike Richter and Ed Giacomin atop the MSG rafters -,"New York Rangers greats: Henrik Lundqvist to join Mike Richter and Ed Giacomin atop the MSG rafters

When you stop and think of all the great New York Rangers goalies two names often come up and coincidently their numbers are retired in the MSG rafters.

Eddie Giacomin and Mike Richter played over 600 games for the Rangers (608 & 666 respectively). Eddie finished with 289 wins in his career and Richter with 301.

Now that Henrik Lundqvist has officially retired his name and iconic No. 30 will join them in a ceremony this upcoming season.

Let’s take a stroll down memory lane and celebrate these great netminders.

Rangers Great: Mike Richter; slayer of curses

Mike Richter never won a Vezina Trophy or Olympic Gold what he did win was the Stanley Cup. Something only 4 other Ranger goalies in franchise history won before him. In 1928 Lorne Chabot was the man until an eye injury in the finals made Lester Patrick don the pads for the franchise’s first ever Championship. Then Andy Aitkenhead and Dave Kerr won it 1933 and 1940 respectively.

It took 54 years for someone that special to come along and Richter did it in grand fashion. At the age of 27 Richter amassed a record of 42-12-6 with a 2.57 GAA and .910 save percentage. Along the way he would win MVP of the 1994 All-Star game held at MSG. He topped that regular season with a 16-7 record 2.07 GAA and .921 save percentage in the playoffs to win the Stanley Cup. He also notched what may be the greatest moment in NYR history when he stopped Pavel Bure on a penalty shot in game 4.

Mike Richter had just done the impossible and was poised to do more. In 1996 versus the heavily favored Canadians he would backstop Team USA to a World Cup Championship and then an Olympic Silver in 2002. Sadly his career was hampered by a devastating knee injury and a concussion that ended his career after only 13 games in 2002. Yet he finished with 301 wins 2.89 GAA and a .904 save percentage in the regular season. His playoff totals were 41 wins 2.68 GAA and a .909 save percentage but that giant silver Cup looms biggest.

The number 35 was raised high to the rafters on February 4th 2004 almost as high the spirits of Rangers fans on June 14th 1994. That night Richter said “Over this last year any sense of loss has been replaced with feelings of gratitude and joy and the realization that this time spent here was nothing short of an amazing gift.”

Rangers Great: Eddie Giacomin

Eddie Giacomin is still adored by the Rangers’ faithful. His number 1 hangs proudly in the Garden rafters. A Hall of Famer Giacomin finished with a 2.82 GAA and 54 shutouts. Eddie won the Vezina Trophy in 1971 but never captured the Stanley Cup.

The highlight of his career may very well be his tearful return to the Garden as a member of the Detroit Red Wings. Rangers fans rained down boos at their own team while chanting “Ed-die! Ed-die!” Giacomin would win that game for the Red Wings but he never lost the hearts of the Garden Faithful. In a biography video Giacomin looked back on his return and recalled “That was one heck of an experience that will never go away. The New York Rangers crest is buried in Eddie Giacomin’s heart.”

Long Live the King

Henrik Lundqvist belongs high in the Garden’s ceiling. I don’t care to debate if he is the greatest of all New York Rangers goalies he simply is one of the best players to ever pull the sweater over his head. His Gold and Silver medals prove his international greatness. Lundqvist capturing the 2012 Vezina Trophy along with every heart-stopping save in his 15 year NHL playing career is enough for me.

The 39 year-old goalie ends his NHL career with a record of 459-310-96 a .916 SV% and a GAA of 2.43 with 64 shutouts. Simply remarkable numbers. Lundqvist will forever be remembered for carrying the team on numerous occasions in particular the 2014 Stanley Cup run that fell short. He is and always will be one of the best Blueshirts of all-time.

The King finishes his career leading the Rangers in the following categories for goalies:

Most game played 887

Most wins 459

Best GAA (min 325 starts) 2.43

Best SV% (min 100 starts) .918

Shutouts 64

Most points 27

Playoff games 130

Playoff wins 61

Most playoff shutouts 10

Lundqvist was close to a comeback

Now Citadel is taking some of its money back.

Citadel has notified Melvin of its plans to retrieve $500 million of the $2 billion it injected in late January according to two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Under the terms of Citadel’s investment the money will be returned at the end of September the people said as the third quarter draws to a close.

Citadel’s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The cash infusion came in late January as Melvin was grappling with a huge turnaround in its short bet of GameStop. GameStop’s shares flatlined in recent years as it struggled to refashion itself from a brick-and-mortar video-game retailer into a more modern e-commerce company. But the company’s stock skyrocketed in January after new directors from Chewy.com which sells pet products were named and as small investors piled into the stock goaded on by the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit.

Melvin took heavy losses as it scrambled to cover the costs of its wrong-way trade. Some of its other short positions including its bet against the movie-theater company AMC Entertainment were hurting it too."

The week-long trip includes visits to three resort towns in Mexico.

LONG BEACH Calif. — Carnival Cruise Line resumed cruises from California on Saturday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The company is the first cruise operator to restart sailing since the industry-wide pause in operations 17 months ago.

Carnival Panorama departed from the Port at Long Beach on Saturday. The week-long trip includes visits to three resort towns in Mexico.

“Carnival is the leader in West Coast cruising and we’re thrilled that Carnival Panorama is resuming service as the first cruise ship to sail from California” said Carnival President Christine Duffy.

Duffy said they are implementing extensive COVID-19 safety measures to keep guests and crew members safe and healthy.

The company held a celebration and ribbon cutting event in the cruise terminal to officially welcome guests back on board.

“This is the moment all of us on Carnival Panorama have been so patiently waiting for – the return of our beloved guests to this beautiful ship"" said Carnival Panorama Captain Luca Lazzarino ""We are ready to welcome our guests on board – our crew members are so excited that we’re getting Back to Fun.”

The cruise ship's departure on Aug. 21 marks a big economic turn for the company. Back in June Carnival Corp. said it lost more than $2 billion in its latest quarter due to pandemic shut downs.

Carnival Cruise Line has three ships operating cruises to Mexico and Hawaii from the Port of Long Beach. Carnival Miracle is expected to resume the line’s short cruise program starting in September and Carnival Radiance will make its debut from Southern California later this year.

Bacon is in short supply on the menus of the world's biggest cruise company Carnival Cruise.

In a video posted to Facebook Carnival's brand ambassador John Heald said suppliers who service the cruise industry are facing challenges sourcing bacon for their ships.

Due to the shortage Heald said the cruise line will set up a schedule for when bacon is served to passengers. ""We are going to have to temporarily move to an every-other-day schedule for bacon at the Lido buffet"" he said.

He added: ""If you see a sign saying 'Today we're not serving bacon don't worry it's going to be back the next day.""

Bacon – and its potential lack of availability – has made further headlines recently. Earlier this month some restaurant owners raised fears about how a change in animal-welfare rules taking force next year could make bacon difficult to find and more expensive to buy in California.

At the start of next year California will enforce a welfare proposition which was approved by voters in 2018. The Farm Animal Confinement Proposition or Proposition 12 requires more space for breeding pigs egg-laying chickens and veal calves.

The idea is that all of those animals should have sufficient space to stretch out their wings claws and paws as Insider's Hilary Brueck reported. Welfare campaigners have been pushing for the change for years.

Courts or the state could try and intervene between now and January but if they don't California could lose almost all of its pork supply and pork producers will likely face higher costs to regain the market AP reported.

Bacon costs are already rising. Insider's Anna Cooban reported in June that it cost 13% more than last year which is apparently due to supply shortages and rising costs of pig feed.

The cost of bacon rose 1.8% between April and May according to BLS data although this was a slower increase than March to April when bacon prices jumped 3.4%.

Despite a shortage of the popular breakfast item on Carnival's cruise lines Heald made it clear that the company won't be rationing bacon. ""We are not going to ration you and say you can only have one piece. But if we serve it every day we will have run out by the end of the week"" he said.

He also added that the new schedule will not be permanent. ""This is not a cutback this is a genuine problem that we as a company are having.""







The bacon shortage will not impact Carnival's ability to stock other breakfast favorites Heald said. Items such as ham and sausage will still be in good supply.

The cruise industry recently opened its doors to the public following an almost year-long halt in operations due to the pandemic.

Guests were eager to return to the sea and Carnival said that booking volumes skyrocketed as a result.

In a second-quarter business update the company said that booking volumes for future cruises were 45% higher than during the first quarter Insider's Grace Dean reported. Advance bookings for 2022 were already higher than in 2019 according to the report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtc2V0cy1zYWlsLW9uLWZpcnN0LWNydWlzZS1mcm9tLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtMzAxMzYwMjA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Sets Sail on First Cruise from California,"LONG BEACH Calif. August 21 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Cruise Line is the first cruise operator to resume sailing from California since the industry-wide pause in operations 17 months ago. Carnival Panorama will depart on a seven-day cruise from Long Beach today. The week-long voyage includes visits to three popular Mexican resort towns including Puerto Vallarta Mazatlán and Cabo San Lucas.

Like sedans they've fallen victim to the SUV-ing of America. Chrysler which basically invented the market for primo family movers has stuck with its Pacifica while Toyota has the Sienna and Honda the Odyssey. They are the major players.

Kia joined the fray with its boxy Sedona back in 2002 and its van-like appearance inspired few. But now Kia has brought out the noisemakers party hats and kazoos with a major redesign and a rename to the Carnival — a veritable festival on wheels. And it's restyled Carnival looks much more SUV-like.

While it’s hard to disguise the long tubular design of a minivan Kia mostly succeeds with a stylish new nose and some satin aluminum cladding on its C-pillar that got nearly as much attention as any high-end sports car I’ve driven. Flash and sparkle sells!

From nose to tail the Carnival looks high-class.

Mark Savage From nose to tail the Kia Carnival looks high-class. While it’s hard to disguise the long tubular design of a minivan Kia mostly succeeds with a stylish new nose and some satin aluminum cladding on its C-pillar.

It helped that I was driving the SX Prestige model that tops the Carnival lineup with a starting price of $47275 including delivery fees. Don’t swallow your tongue after seeing that price tag — any minivan well loaded will crest $45 grand these days.

This model remains front-drive and is not offered as AWD or hybrid. Toyota and Chrysler offer that.

But from a hauling standpoint the Carnival is a class-leader in power and interior passenger space. While few of us consider sportiness when shopping for minivans it’s good to have a strong powertrain if you have seven or eight passengers aboard.

Carnival obliges with a 3.5-liter V6 that creates 290 horsepower slightly more than Pacifica. The engine is smooth and quiet and well suited to its 8-speed automatic. The upside is a nice mix of power and efficiency. The Kia is rated 19 mpg city and 26 mpg highway a tad more than the former Sedona. I managed 22.6 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving.

Four drive modes allow the driver to go to Sport (on a minivan?) Comfort Eco or Smart which learns how you drive and adjusts shift points and such to fit your driving style.

Handling also is fairly light and easy feeling and while there’s a bit of body lean in turns this Carnival is easy to keep under control. Kia built the van on its fine K5 sedan’s platform that features more ultra high-strength steel to help lesson body roll. The minivan feels stable on the highway and is easy to park too. Thank a 360-degree camera for helping the driver maneuver in tight parking quarters.

Ride is mostly fine. On the highway the Carnival felt well planted and it smoothed out most of our crumbling infrastructure’s roughness. But like trucks and other vans there are some thumps and bumps on sharp cracks and pot holes. Still ride is much as in other minivans or MPVs as Kia wants us to call the Carnival (that stands for Multi-Purpose Vehicle as if all minivans crossovers and SUVs don’t fit that category).

While Carnival’s exterior is festive and its performance top-shelf the MPV’s (OK I said it) interior is a circus tent full of opulence and inspired features at least at this SX Prestige level.

Mark Savage The Carnival's trim is mostly satin chrome with a gloss black console top again trimmed in satiny chrome. The spiff comes in a dimpled satin chrome dash trim that matches that outside C-pillar trim.

The test van a delicious Astra Blue (metallic blue-green) that costs just $495 extra featured a full caramel-colored leather interior with black dash and upper door panels. The seats were a perforated leather and are both heated and cooled in this trim. A heated steering wheel also is standard on the Prestige.

Trim is mostly satin chrome with a gloss black console top again trimmed in satiny chrome. The spiff comes in a dimpled satin chrome dash trim that matches that outside C-pillar trim. I’m sure others will copy this. They should because it looks great giving the interior a Rolex watch kinda pizazz.

Let’s start with the dash. In addition to its good looks there’s a giant flat touchscreen that looks much like the Mercedes GLA’s I just tested. These are two 12.3-inch screens merged as one unit for a smooth look and interface. Adjustments are easy and buttons large enough for simple adjustment. No dial or touchpad here. Bravo!

Mark Savage The Carnival has two 12.3-inch screens merged as one unit on the dash for a smooth look and interface. Adjustments are easy and buttons large enough for simple adjustment.

Below is a wireless phone charger and the transmission’s stick shift is easily found and used atop the console.

Front seats are mildly contoured with power adjustments and two memory settings for the driver on the door but the real fun begins in the back seat.

First there are separate overhead climate controls and vents but many vans have that now. VIP Lounge Seats are the hot stuff here that and oodles of USB ports - nine to be exact.

Those VIP seats are powered captain’s chairs with arm rests but pull a lever on the side and the seats will slide sideways toward the cabin’s middle providing more door-side elbow room. Then play with the buttons on the seat’s side and it will recline and put up a footrest. Although depending on the front-seat occupants you’ll only be able to extend that so far.

Kia also puts two entertainment screens on the front seat backs. These look like iPads and no doubt will enthrall your young charges. The downside in my dad’s mind is that these stick out considerably from the seat backs and I can imagine a youngster bumping these while climbing out the power sliding side doors. Avoiding head cracks and gouges will require some parental watching and nagging.

Likewise the power buttons on the VIP seat sides are somewhat clunky. Two main ones require the buttons be held down until the seats are properly reclined or returned to their full upright positions. Additionally these second row seats can’t be removed since they are powered. They do slide to and fro though.

Also crawling into the rear seats which are fairly roomy if the second row seats aren’t pushed all the way back is a little tight too. But then it’s the wee ones who will likely be sitting back there. That third row easily folds down into the cargo hold inside the power rear hatch much like other vans.

Mark Savage From a hauling standpoint the Carnival is a class-leader in power and interior passenger space. While few of us consider sportiness when shopping for minivans it’s good to have a strong powertrain if you have seven or eight passengers aboard.

There are two sunroofs here too with the one over the second to third-row seats having both a shade and is able to be opened for fresh air. I should also mention how quiet the interior is too! Both the SX and SX Prestige trims feature acoustic glass windows to cut wind noise.

There's plenty of safety equipment here too to protect the family.

Kia’s Drivewise systems include forward collision avoidance that watches out for bikers and pedestrians blind-spot warning and avoidance rear cross-traffic avoidance lane keeping assist smart cruise control rear parking assist and safe exit assist. The later sounds an alarm if cars are whizzing past your open side doors to warn kids to stay inside until the cars have passed.

All worked fine but as with some other makes the lane keeping assist was a bit over aggressive in twitching the wheel and redirecting the van to the center of its lane. This mostly becomes a problem in construction zones. Just be aware so you can keep the van out of barricades and orange barrels.

One warning I didn’t care for occurs every time the ignition is turned off: the van chimes and lights up a message on the instrument panel saying “Check Rear Seat.” It didn’t matter that no one was in those seats and no door had been opened previously to put a package there. So the warning becomes annoying and no doubt will be ignored when there is something in back hopefully it’s not Junior.

Carnival simply is so full of goodies and equipment you’ll need to check out all the trim levels to make sure to get what your family needs.

The base LX starts at $33275 with delivery while the LXS lists at $35275 and the EX at $38775. I think that may be the best dollar-for-dollar trim. There’s also an SX just below the tested Prestige model. SX lists at $42275.

The test van was $47770 with only the paint being an option. For that you get all of the above plus snazzy black wheels to give the Prestige a sportier look. A few other goodies include LED head and taillights a Bose premium audio system the leather seats both heated and cooled for row one and two plus live navigation system to provide traffic updates.

Remember too that Kia still delivers a 10-year 100000-mile powertrain warranty a comfort for the family budget.

She is the first cruise ship to depart California with passengers since the cruise shutdown began in March 2020.

Her departure marks a welcome turnaround for Carnival Cruise Line after a challenging year. Carnival Panorama delivered in late 2019 and deployed to Long Beach making her the first newly-built ship to home port in Southern California in decades. She had just begun her first revenue cruises in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and in March 2020 - like all other North American cruise ships - she had to halt operations.

The following month Carnival used her hotel capacity to carry thousands of Filipino employees back to their home country - an 8000-mile voyage. It represented just a small part of the company's massive crew-repatriation drive which was designed to overcome the near-shutdown of international air travel in the early months of the pandemic.

Now Panorama is back at Long Beach and fulfilling her original mission. After a welcome-back ceremony featuring Carnival President Christine Duffy and the vessel's master Capt. Luca Lazzarino Panorama departed Saturday on a seven-day cruise to the Mexican Riviera including stops in Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas.

Carnival Panorama is operated in compliance with the CDC vaccinated-sailing standard and booking is available for fully-vaccinated passengers (with limited exceptions). All passengers have to obtain a COVID-19 test within three days of embarkation and they must be able to show their vaccination record prior to boarding. Children under 12 are exempt from the vaccination requirement.

The ship's comeback is a welcome development for the City of Long Beach which is looking forward to the return of cruise tourism revenue.

""We get over 600000 passengers that come into Queen Mary Island there at the Carnival Cruise terminal and they visit our attractions and amenities and they stay in our hotels so the impacts of not having tourists means we don't necessarily have [as many] jobs"" said John Keisler the city's economic development director speaking to ABC's L.A. station."

The order from U.S. Transportation Command pulls a total of 18 widebody aircraft into service including planes from two companies that predominantly provide commercial all-cargo service. Atlas Air (NASDAQ: AAWW) and Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) will each provide three aircraft to the mission the Pentagon said.

USTRANSCOM also recruited American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and Delta Air LInes (NYSE: DAL) to provide three aircraft each. Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA) will provide two aircraft and United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) will fly three jets for the evacuation.

None of the activated aircraft will fly into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Rather they will take evacuees from staging bases in Qatar Bahrain and Germany which are becoming overcrowded to other locations in North America and Europe. U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-5 military aircraft are handling the direct airlift out of Kabul.

Truck and trailer builds are hampered by raw material and labor shortages that have dragged on since the U.S. began crawling towards a post-pandemic economic recovery. Commercial vehicle demand medium-duty heavy-duty and trailer backlogs are essentially filled into 2022 according to ACT with backlog-to-build ratios well above traditional ranges and inventories below traditional thresholds.

“Material and component supplies as well as staffing issues continue to generate headwinds for U.S. trailer OEMs” said Frank Maly director of CV Transportation analysis and research at ACT Research. Some indications are that staffing challenges may be easing slightly he added and that the upcoming end of supplemental unemployment benefits could further improve workforce availability. ""That said pricing and availability of components and materials are resulting in higher trailer prices and a build-up of red-tag units with the volume of these units expected to continue growing during the upcoming months.”

Maly said concerns over future availability and pricing are major factors in the trailer OEMs' unwillingness to accept future orders which is causing uncertainty about the timing of the ""official"" opening of the 2022 orders. ""In turn meaningful pent-up demand is occurring due to the reluctance to accept dry van and reefer orders at this time with the average industry backlog-to-build ratio extending to the end of Q1’22 at June 2021 build rates"" he said. “How coordinated the timing of that opening by the OEMs is a second major question. While order volumes have remained low there is no question that negotiations have continued. Once orders are again accepted expect a flood that could consume a significant portion of the remaining 2022 production slots.”

The unknown Maly said is how quickly OEMs will be able to ramp production which will correspondingly impact their pace of order acceptance. ""We already have orderboards that extend into Q2’22 on average"" he said. ""For reference remember the order surge that occurred in late 2018 which immediately pushed commitments through Q3 of the next year. A similar pattern could well be in the offing. Of course pricing which is still under development will also have a major impact on that order pace.”

July net U.S. trailer orders of 8128 units fell nearly 26% from the previous month according to ACT and were almost 58% lower compared to July 2020. Before accounting for cancellations new orders of 9500 units were down more than 27% versus June and 53% lower than the previous July.





Truck builds in the same boat as trailers

The truck business isn't fairing any better and faces similar headwinds despite fervent demand.

“Historically strong orders starting in Q4 the accumulation of large backlogs and growing lead times [called BL/BU ratios] are a recipe for production rising sharply at this point in an industry up-cycle” said ACT Research President and Senior Analyst Kenny Vieth. ""There are growing pains at the start of every cycle as the supply chain lurches unevenly into higher build rates but this pandemic recovery cycle has been beset with extraordinary global issues that have amplified traditional ramp-up challenges from steel supplies to domestic staffing to semiconductors.”

ACT highlighted that there's not been a noteworthy change in trajectory of macro datapoints that influence commercial vehicle demand. Except for the COVID Delta variant asterisk economic strength is broad-based and concentrated in goods-related economic activity. However Class 8 build rates tumbled in July.

“The Class 8 market saw build rates take a big step backward in July as OEMs took down days and weeks to compensate for component shortages especially semiconductors"" Vieth said. ""During the month Class 8 production fell to a 15-month low as build per available day dropped materially below trend.”

Builds of class 5-7 trucks also slid in July but Vieth said that was more in line with expectations. Like Class 8 the medium duty decline was also the lowest since May 2020’s COVID-shutdown-related output. ""Additionally we have heard/read that the heavy-duty OEMs are taking semiconductors away from their medium-duty products to maximize the value of the chips"" he added. ""Some large players in the MD space are doing the same thing using chips that would have been destined for cars and pickups to maintain Classes 5-7 output.”

Vieth said he doesn't expect the semiconductor shortage to be rectified this year adding ""there are reports of supply improvements but those have not yet translated into higher build rates.""

If spot rates are any guide steel supplies also remain tight he added. ""As well keeping and growing staff amidst demographic challenges during a pandemic is no easy feat. Add to these other anecdotes suggesting an entire vehicle worth of parts are in short supply from tires to foams and plastics and more. Added together these points continue to make clear that supply-chain constraints rather than fleet/consumer demand are the primary drivers of vehicle production in 2021.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51c25pLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL25ldy11cy0ybmQtZmxlZXQtaGVhZC1icmluZ3MtY3liZXItdHJhaW5pbmctZW1waGFzaXMtdG8tYXRsYW50aWMtY29tbWFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New US 2nd Fleet Head Brings Cyber Training Emphasis to Atlantic Command - USNI News,"ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS HARRY S. TRUMAN – A new commander has taken charge of the Navy and NATO’s newest Atlantic-based naval commands.

Newly promoted Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer took command of U.S. 2nd Fleet and NATO’s Joint Forces Command Norfolk in a ceremony aboard USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) – the next carrier set to deploy from the East Coast.

Dwyer a career fighter pilot was most recently the director of plans and policies for U.S. Cyber Command since last summer. Prior to the job at Fort Meade Md. he was the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) according to his service biography.

“I plan to bring cyber into all our operational planning … It’s all about readiness and preparing the next deployers because the Atlantic is no longer an uncontested [area of responsibility] and when our ships cast off all lines and our aircraft launch from the deck they need to be ready” Dwyer told USNI News in a brief interview aboard Truman.

“Any opportunity to train with our allies and partners furthers that readiness and we’ll be focusing on exercises interoperability and improving our collective readiness across not only U.S. 2nd Fleet but also Joint Forces Command Norfolk.”

Born in 2018 and led by career fighter pilot Vice Adm. Andrew “Woody” Lewis 2nd Fleet is only loosely a geographic command with an area of responsibility that starts at the East Coast and extends into the Arctic. Driving the creation was the emergence of a more capable Russian Navy submarine force armed with a new generation of sophisticated attack boats that were harder to find and harder to fight several defense officials have told USNI News.

In order for the Russians not to exploit the seam between the old 2nd fleet and 6th fleet – the longitude extending from the southernmost tip of Greenland – the new command was set to operate throughout the region to control forces across the Atlantic for specific operations. Ashore 2nd Fleet took charge of training and readiness responsibilities as a component of U.S. Fleet Forces.

“We have seen an ever-increasing number of Russian submarines deployed in the Atlantic and these submarines are more capable than ever deploying for longer periods of time with more lethal weapons systems” Lewis said in early 2020 at an event hosted by the U.S. Naval Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“As such our ships can no longer expect to operate in a safe haven on the East Coast or merely cross the Atlantic unhindered to operate in another location.”

Following the reestablishment of 2nd Fleet NATO set up the Joint Forces Command as a separate chain of command to the Europe-based Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

Speaking at the change of command Fleet Forces commander Adm. Christopher Grady praised the speed in which Lewis stood up the command with an initial force of 11 officers and four enlisted sailors from the outset. SHAPE commander Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters said Lewis had to endure an “obnoxious” schedule to stand up the NATO portion of the command.

JF Norfolk reached full operational capability last month.

“The mission of this command is to fight the Battle of the Atlantic” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at the July ceremony aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD-3).

Lewis reiterated what he saw as the major threats for the command in his speech at the Friday ceremony.

“The first trend is escalating competition with both Russia and China. The second is the ever-increasing exploitation of information” Lewis said.

“The third is the increasing threat to the national economy causing rising poverty and instability and … the last trend is our changing climate phenomenon that is reopening the waterways in the Arctic where we see increasing interest around the world.”

He called out the 2019 Baltic Operations exercise in Europe and the scramble to deploy USNS Comfort (T-AH-20) and NATO exercise Steadfast Defender as some of the highlights.

“As I pass the torch I’m slowly looking at the past with pride and all that we have done” Lewis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS92b2xnYS1kbmVwci0zMS15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Volga-Dnepr Celebrates Its 31st Birthday,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS92b2xnYS1kbmVwci0zMS15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmNlcy5uZXQvbmV3cy9zZWEtdmVzc2Vscy9obXMtcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLWZsaWdodC1kZWNrLWxpZ2h0LXNob3ctbWFya3Mtc2VyaWVzLWluY2x1c2lvbi1ldmVudHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HMS Queen Elizabeth: Flight Deck Light Show Marks World Pride,"A rainbow light show covered the flight deck of flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth on her global deployment to coincide with World Pride.

Beach joined the coveted winners list for the Super Twins main event for the first time a race where ""King Henry"" Wiles and Chris ""The Prince of Peoria"" Carr became legends for their long win streaks.

Wiles meanwhile moved down into the Singles class and won going away. He also did something else:

""I've joined the Peoria Motorcycle Club"" the Winn Mich. native said of the 90-year-old PMC. ""This is a place with so much history to it and I've been a part of it. Some day when I retire I'm going to bring my kids here and just enjoy this place.""

Wiles club officials believe became the first Peoria Motorcycle Club member to win a grand nationals race here. He won the Super Twins event 14 straight times before missing the 2019 race with an injury.

Saturday marked his first Singles win — and as a club member to boot.

Wiles joined the club after track officials asked him to help design a new course for Minis within the infield.

""I wanted to design a track that wasn't vanilla one that could challenge riders but provide an element of fun"" Wiles said. ""It can appeal to every age and skill level. There is a jump that might be a bit aggressive for the little guys. But anyone who rode motocross is going to love it.

""It's a place where families younger kids can come out and ride.""

Caterpillar saves the day

An isolated storm hit the track Saturday just as the day was down to the final three championship races. Caterpillar came to the rescue with its operators climbing aboard earth movers scraping the track distributing dirt and saving the day.

""What a great look for CAT they are amazing"" PMC president Jake Walker said. ""Caterpillar in here as a partner with these machines they just stepped up and got everything in order. It's a game-changer.""

The races re-started at about 6 p.m. — most of the estimated 3500 in attendance stuck through a delay of about two hours — and the American Flat Track officials altered the format from its usual 25 laps.

The Super Twins final ran for 10 minutes plus two laps after the clock hit zero. The Production Twins and the Singles ran for 8 minutes plus two laps.

On the track

Beach 30 from Philpot Ky. rode his Yamaha MT-07 to victory. The former AMA Amateur National Dirt Track champion returned to AFT racing in 2019 while juggling a full-time MotoAmerica Superbike career.

Briar Bauman who won the race in 2019 finished second on his Indian FTR750. Jared Mees who always seems to be in or around the top three at the TT in Peoria rode his Indian FTR750 to third.

Mossville native Robbie Pearson was fifth.

Dan Bromley a Warrington Pa. native won the Production Twins race.

Wiles celebrated on the podium again with his Singles win with his newly-designed infield track facing him across the way.

""When I was a little kid really little I would play in a sandbox with toy cars"" Wiles said. ""I would build little tracks in there for the cars. I've built more race tracks than I can remember. It's exciting to see it happening.

""I look at some of the man-made TT tracks today and it looks to me like not much thought went into it.""

Always prepared for Peoria

He's older now at 37 and has a family well under construction too with wife Kristen 6-year-old son Henry River Wiles and 1-year-old daughter Winn.

""Make sure there's no E on the end of her name"" Wiles said. ""Because there's no E in winning.""

The Super Twins class is in his past now. His name remains atop the Peoria record books.

""As long as I come here to Peoria and race I'm going to battle to win no matter what class I'm in"" Wiles said. ""I took a solid year getting ready for this race.

""My preparation is driven from something I learned in eighth grade. I still have my fourth-place trophy from the state wrestling championships in Michigan. The three guys who finished ahead of me I beat all of them two weeks earlier in sectionals. I lost in the state finals because I didn't prepare as hard.

""I stare at that trophy and I remember. So yeah I'll keep coming to Peoria and I'll prepare to win.""

The longtime Moorhead Minnesota resident is raising and releasing monarch butterflies.

Last year she raised 27 of the nation's most popular butterfly that has been facing steep declines in their population. This year she's up to 61 with about six or seven more to go.

Some might think nature should simply take care of itself. However one of Erickson's monarch books states that only about 10% of the insects survive the process in nature whereas those raised by humans have a 90% survival rate.

""I think there are bugs who eat the eggs"" she said.

Erickson's success rate has been spectacular.

""I don't think I've lost any"" she said about the process that starts with collecting eggs off of milkweed leaves she grows in a small area of her backyard in south-central Moorhead where she has lived for more than 60 years.

After she takes the entire leaf off the milkweed plant with the tiny eggs on the underside of the leaf she brings it inside and puts it in a glass jar with holes punched through the lid. The jars sit on a table in her living room with lots of natural light from south-facing windows.

Sometimes the table is completely full she said.

After about three to four days the caterpillar emerges from the egg.

Two weeks later the white black and yellow caterpillar goes into a j-shape and forms a chrysalis or a cocoon-looking green or jade bag that hangs off the lid of the jar. If there was another enclosure besides a jar the caterpillar would crawl to the top to form the chrysalis she said.

In another 10 days to two weeks the majestic growing butterfly emerges from the chrysalis that has turned black with the wings visible in the final stages.

Erickson said the newborn monarchs usually just hang upside down on the lid that she likes to remove from the jar when the chrysalis forms.

When the butterflies are ready she lets them loose outdoors and they take off on their first journey with wings flapping.

A few of those she raised can be found flying around her house. In fact she thinks there's one inside her home currently that she can't seem to find.

Almost all wait to take flight until they're released outdoors.

Erickson said they seem to go over to a neighbor's yard where there are more flowers than she grows to drink the nectar and feed.

""I just think the process is fascinating"" she said about the monarchs' hatch.

Erickson was hoping her grandchildren would enjoy it more when she first tried raising the butterflies years ago at their lake.

Instead it's been her she said who finds the pleasure in raising butterflies.

The former secretary for the Moorhead school library has a friend who's also interested in raising the endangered insects. That friend tried it this year and so did Erickson's son who lives in Watertown Minnesota.

Erickson said she usually doesn't like to talk about herself and what she does but she did this time as she hopes others would take up the hobby and help the monarch population rebound.

She and her husband Art who died a few years ago were able to visit the mountains of Mexico where the monarchs migrate and mate in the winter as they hang around on trees.

For this year the egg-laying season in the north is over so Erickson's hobby is winding down.

She's already looking forward to next June though when the process can start all over again. Her goal she said with a smile is to ramp it up even more and raise even more than the 68 this year.

""It's a good hobby and it means something"" she said. ""Plus it gets me outside.""

Gwen Erickson raised 70 monarch butterflies this summer at her home in Moorhead.

This article was published 21/08/2021 (992 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

It begins with a light cracking sound.

A tiny body squirms and twists. A small fissure winds its way around a translucent shell. Gently the body slides through the crack. It sits quietly unsure of its new world.

A white-speckled black-and orange-winged male monarch butterfly is born.

Photo by Adriano Magnifico Patrick a male monarch butterfly spreads his wing on a milkweed plant in Vicki Magnifico’s yard.

His name is Patrick. He joins Moira Johnny David and Alexis born earlier in the week.

Vicki Magnifico names this batch after Schitt’s Creek characters. She is raising monarch butterflies with milkweed plants and specially designed enclosures.

The amateur lepidopterist did her homework connecting with the Manitoba Monarchs Facebook group.

“The Manitoba Monarchs Facebook Group is a great site to learn how to spot the eggs nurture them into caterpillars and shelter them from predators” she said.

Yvonne Sharples administrator of the group created the site “to build a collaborative local community that aligns with Manitoba’s milkweed varieties unique climate and friendly disposition.”

Vicki has also become one of approximately 250 “ranger recruiters” for the David Suzuki Butterflyway Project which is devoted to planting butterfly pollinating stations in neighbourhoods across the country.

The life cycle from tiny egg to adult monarch is extraordinary. When an adult monarch flits into the yard it either pollinates a colourful blossom or lays a tiny white egg on the underside of a milkweed leaf. Vicki ‘adopts’ the eggs keeping them safe until they turn into caterpillars ready to move into butterfly enclosures in the backyard.

In the enclosures each caterpillar grows quickly voraciously devouring milkweed leaves. At some point it climbs and hangs from an enclosure wall or carefully inserted branch forming a chrysalis that turns green with gilded lines.

When the chrysalis turns black and the shell becomes translucent the metamorphosis is almost complete a birth imminent. You have to be lucky to witness this awe-inspiring moment – it happens that fast.

The newly arrived adult wet and tired slowly unfurls a wingspan of up to four inches. Some are ready to leave the coop quickly. Other wait and linger for a long time. Some rest on your hand. Others want nothing to do with you. Each monarch has a different temperament.

From a purely practical perspective we need to preserve these creatures as they’re natural pollinators for plants and crops. Monarch numbers are in serious decline due to habitat loss climate change pesticides and natural predators.

Just as important they also play a prominent role in our collective imagination.

We gaze in wonderment at them and chase them as kids. Goldie Hawn started her career as a butterfly Muhammad Ali floated like one Shakespearean plays are full of them Indigenous cultures honour them in traditions and folk tales.

We even feel ’em in our stomachs when we get the jitters.

Ikechukwu Divine’s other projects includes a working helicopter Keke Excavator aeroplane as well as a tipper.

He also made working caterpillar as well as luxury cars badged with Mercedes-Benz and Lexus logos.

But Ikechukwu Divine Oramife’s dream is to become an Automobile engineer in future.











A talented 15-year-old Nigerian boy named Ikechukwu Divine Oramife has wowed the world with his works after designing working models of luxury cars.

In an interview with BBC Pidgin he Divine he started working on his projects at a tender age of 11. Since he started he has made Helicopter Keke (bicycle) aeroplane Tipper Caterpillar as well as cars badged with Mercedes-Benz and Lexus logos.

Video

According to Divine materials that were used for his projects were sourced from scraps gotten from his surroundings. Some of the materials used includes Aluminum Dunlop (for the tyres) Super Glue Copper Wire and electric motor. He said the electric motor was gotten from condemned DVD player.











During the interview he also showcased what many has termed his best creation — a car he named Lamborghini 2021 which he said it took him one month and two weeks to build.

His Lamborghini 2021 car boasts of many features including a remote control pad. But the most impressive is its automatic turning doors that can help elder or disabled to get in and out of the car.

According to Divine Lamborghini 2021 was the most challenging of all projects due to the impressive automatic turning doors mentioned earlier. In comparison the Excavator took him one month and two days while the Tipper took him two weeks and one day.

But Divine’s dream isn’t all about making the working models of vehicles and aeroplanes as he revealed that he plans making a drivable car. He said his dream is to become an Automobile engineer in future."

Once children reach the “age of majority”—typically 18 21 or 25 depending on the state—they gain control over the account and can use the funds however they see fit. “You can’t control what they ultimately do with the funds” cautions Chris “but if you communicate your values along the way your child may be more likely to follow the path you intended.”

If this route sounds right for you here are three things to know before opening an account:

Gifts are irrevocable: Contributions to a custodial account are considered irrevocable—meaning you can’t get that money back—and funds can be withdrawn by the custodian only to pay for expenses that would directly benefit the child before the age of majority. Note too that contributions that exceed the annual gift tax exclusion—$15000 for individuals or $30000 for married couples—may be subject to gift tax. Investment gains may be subject to the so-called kiddie tax: If any of the investments generate dividends or interest or are sold for a gain while the child is a minor the first $1100 of that income is exempt from tax the next $1100 is taxed at the child’s single-filer rate and anything beyond $2200 is taxed at the parents’ rate. The funds can decrease financial aid eligibility: Federal financial aid formulas—which determine eligibility for federal loans grants and even some scholarships—consider 20% of a student’s assets including the custodial account’s value as available for educational purposes. On the other hand only 5.6% of parental assets (including 529 college savings accounts) are considered in the calculations.

What’s more it’s important to consider your ultimate goals for the money. If you’re hoping to help your child or grandchild save for college or get a head start on retirement for example funding a special-purpose account like a 529 or a Roth IRA may be a better way to go.

“Those accounts provide unique tax advantages that a custodial account doesn’t” Chris says. “But if you’re looking to instill an enthusiasm for and appreciation of investing custodial accounts are a great place to start.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvbWVldC10aGUtbmV3LWNoaWVmLW9mLXNjaHdhYi1jaGFyaXRhYmxlLXRoZS1waGlsYW50aHJvcGljLWFybS10aGF0LWdhdmUtb3V0LTM3LWJpbGxpb24tbGFzdC15ZWFyL9IBpwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvbWVldC10aGUtbmV3LWNoaWVmLW9mLXNjaHdhYi1jaGFyaXRhYmxlLXRoZS1waGlsYW50aHJvcGljLWFybS10aGF0LWdhdmUtb3V0LTM3LWJpbGxpb24tbGFzdC15ZWFyLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the new chief of Schwab Charitable the philanthropic arm that gave out $3.7 billion last year,"Sam Kang is a financial professional who spent 20 years at TD Ameritrade during the day while having close-to-home conversations about philanthropy each night.

“Philanthropy has always been near and dear to my family because my wife has been in nonprofits her entire career and it’s been part of our normal dinner conversation” Kang said.

In 2018 he joined Schwab Charitable — the donor-advised philanthropic arm of Charles Schwab Corp. that has given away $17 billion since it was founded in 1999. That includes a record $3.7 billion last year.

Now three years later Kang 48 heads the San Francisco-based nonprofit from his base in Westlake which Schwab designated as its corporate headquarters last year. He replaced Kim Laughton who retired after nearly a decade at the helm.

Schwab Charitable is among the funds capitalizing on an increasingly popular method for people to direct charitable donations to their favorite charities. Donor-advised funds are charitable savings accounts that provide tax benefits to donors who can direct grants to nonprofits when they choose. Schwab Charitable holds the money until it’s given out prompting prominent philanthropists like Houston billionaire John Arnold to describe it as “wealth warehousing.”

Before becoming president July 1 Kang led the services operations and technology teams at Schwab Charitable. Kang said he’s been focused on building efficiency because speed is most important when it comes to getting money to charities especially during a pandemic. He said 79% of grants are now automated.

And in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic that brought on difficult economic times 2020 saw a record year for giving. Grants awarded by Schwab Charitable rose from $550 million in 2012 to $3.7 billion in 2020. The nonprofit saw a rise in giving to food banks and health and human services essentials during the pandemic.

“As soon as March hit last year there was a huge influx in granting and we’re still seeing that this year” Kang said. “Donors understood charities were in a situation where they needed to support constituents in the community.”

This reflected the broader trend in the U.S. where charitable giving reached a record $471 billion in 2020 an increase of 5.1% from the previous year according to the Giving USA Foundation. Donors recognized the dire situation nonprofits were in.

Schwab Charitable has seen its largest growth in staff in Texas recently but it also has a significant presence in Colorado and California.

In Texas this year over $100 million was given to 5600 organizations. Most donors like to give locally with 90% of the grants staying in the donors’ community.

“We see strong tailwinds for overall philanthropy” Kang said.

Charles Schwab also has a foundation that gave away $12.2 million to nonprofit organizations in 2020. Last year company founder Charles Schwab and his wife Helen donated $65 million to the San Francisco poverty-fighting organization Tipping Point Community making it one of the top 25 largest donations of 2020.

But the purpose of Schwab Charitable is to bring charitable planning to the masses. There’s no minimum account size. The average is $27000.

The number of donor-advised accounts in the U.S. totaled 873228 in 2019 a 19.4% increase from 2018 according to the National Philanthropic Trust’s 14th annual report. The value of donor-advised accounts averaged $162556 nationally. Donations from those accounts hit $8.32 billion last year a 29.8% increase compared to 2019 as people responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Charitable gifting is up substantially even though no one would quite believe that” said Tim McDonald a senior financial consultant at Charles Schwab who works with Schwab Charitable. He has been with the company for about 11 years.

McDonald sits down with clients to figure out their goals. Charitable giving is often part of clients’ goals but they don’t have a strategy he said.

“The hurdles to get in and use a donor-advised fund are extremely low” he said.

As a consultant McDonald looks at a clients’ retirement taxation estate planning asset protection and charitable gifting. There is no overarching rule for how much someone should give to charity he said.

Keeping up with tax laws is one of the most valuable things Schwab advisers do for those looking to maximize their giving he said.

“No one can keep pace with the tax code” he said. “We let people know the consequences good and bad of giving money away and what the best strategy is.”

For example if a client wants to give $10000 a year to a church over five years to build a new organ McDonald may tell them to use a donor-advised fund to take $50000 out this year to get a $12000 deduction. Then they can still give $10000 a year to the church while getting the largest tax deduction.

“The church wins and the client wins” he said.

He’s also advised clients with issues he describes as rewarding — how to give away a $5 million building or how to make sure tax money from taking a company public goes to charity.

“What is better than talking to people about how to help others?” he said.

Since it was created in 1999 Schwab Charitable has directed donations to 183000 charities nationwide.

Critics of donor-advised funds say they are vehicles for investors to park their money in an account to gain immediate tax deductions but then can wait years to give the money away. Kang said his top priority is figuring out how to get money to charities quicker.

Garrett O’Hara wanted to keep his retirement money at Vanguard.

But after a series of technical glitches — trouble accessing the Vanguard website not receiving text messages for log-in authentication and long waits on the phone — the Texas-based long-haul truck driver said he took his money elsewhere at the end of 2020.

O’Hara has lots of company in his irritation with Vanguard.

The firm still ranks at the top of surveys by J.D. Power and others yet complaints about Vanguard’s customer service are growing anecdotally according to online reviews financial advisers and company loyalists.

In part it’s because Vanguard and many of its peers are being slammed with new clients. But Vanguard also has led the race in cutting costs for clients’ funds. And that may mean scrimping on service investors say leading some like O’Hara to make this choice: continuing to buy Vanguard funds while moving their brokerage accounts to a different firm.

Vanguard added to the furor in July when it said it is phasing out secure messaging on its website by the end of August for clients under $1 million in assets. Those with $1 million or more known as Flagship investors will still have secure message access on the company’s website.

The company plans “to introduce new ways to more efficiently and effectively communicate with Vanguard digitally” said spokesperson Charles Kurtz. Some clients like those with accessibility needs and who often write secure messages as well as Flagship clients “will retain access” he said until new ways to communicate are introduced.

The reaction has been mixed: Some fiercely loyal Bogleheads the longtime Vanguard investors who adhere to founder John Bogle’s low-cost investment philosophy took to their website -- www.bogleheads.org/forum/ -- to both support and decry Vanguard’s secure-messaging change.

Some say they rarely use it. Others think Vanguard has fallen behind competitors for complex trust and administrative tasks.

“Why does Fidelity get me my monthly statements sooner than Vanguard?” said Dan Wiener editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter which tracks the performance of Vanguard funds. His clients still like to purchase Vanguard funds but prefer to buy and sell them through a Fidelity account so they can avoid Vanguard’s service problems.

“We don’t want to [maintain] custody at Vanguard because of service issues” Wiener said. “They don’t have enough money invested into the service for clients. We’re not going to do that to clients.”

So “we hold Vanguard funds at Fidelity” he said. “The issue is when I have something that needs to be done I can’t get it done at Vanguard whether settling an estate moving assets making a gift. It’s fine until it’s not.”

“I’m a huge fan of Vanguard” added financial planner Allan S. Roth based in Colorado. However in March he wrote a column about how he experienced Vanguard returning hundred-thousand-dollar-plus checks making mistakes in trust accounts and messing up the distribution in his mother’s inherited IRA account. “They missed the RMD [required minimum distribution for retirees] even though we said to take it out every year.”

Roth still promotes and uses Vanguard mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds for himself and his clients.

“I love that they’re not defensive about improving customer service. But now they have to actually do it” he said in an interview.

Vanguard is justly famous for its low-cost investment funds enabling clients to save more money over time than competitors’ products with higher fees. Like Amazon or Southwest Airlines “Vanguard is still the low-cost provider. But will they be the lowest service provider?” Roth wonders.

Asked about these complaints spokesperson Emily Farrell said Vanguard continues to improve processes and introduce new online resources. “While we are pleased with our progress thus far this is only the beginning” she said. “Vanguard will continue to evolve as we strive to meet the changing needs of our clients.”

Changes for Some Retail Investors

Vanguard’s reach is vast. And whatever the level of complaints they haven’t stopped its juggernaut growth. In 2016 the company had $4 trillion in assets. And those have doubled to $8 trillion as of June 30.

The three largest asset managers —BlackRock Vanguard and State Street — collectively manage $19 trillion for millions of investors with Vanguard accounting for the largest slice: 42% of the total.

In recent years young investors have flocked to open brokerage accounts and are trading meme stocks like GameStop along with such cryptocurrencies as bitcoin. Last fall many firms fueled the influx by offering commission-free stock trades to compete with up-and-coming firms like Robinhood. A rising stock market has also spurred more investors to open trading accounts.

Amid all this Vanguard now boasts 30 million customers globally. The company is at a point where its longtime customers need more services say industry observers. Its older wealthier clients mainly baby boomers are drawing down cashing out assets or leaving money to their heirs. That requires more hand-holding complicated rollovers and transactions and phone calls to Vanguard.

Vanguard doesn’t encourage day trading unlike Robinhood or other newer apps. And yet Vanguard is competing for younger millennial clients who can choose among a bevy of competitors such as Fidelity Schwab Personal Capital Wealthfront or Betterment.

All legacy brokers need to maintain service while pushing down costs said H. Adam Holt CEO of Asset-Map Holdings which makes software for advisers to work with investors.

“When you don’t care about personal advisers or humans you just want speed” Holt said. “But once you have more money the higher-value accounts want a human for comfort. How do you support those people and keep costs down?”

Telephone wait times to reach a human representative at Vanguard during the pandemic can be lengthy pushing clients to the website according to Bogleheads and other customers. Without secure messaging on Vanguard’s website that leaves some Vanguard brokerage customers with no way to reach Vanguard other than by phone.

Vanguard employee reviews on Indeed.com and Glassdoor.com offer a window into the frustration on both sides —- customer-service reps and clients.

“They don’t have nearly enough help so you get back-to-back calls for 7.5+ hours a day with no real training” wrote one former employee on Glassdoor

“You’ll sit through hours of propaganda and lectures just to be thrown on calls that you have no idea how to handle. When the clients catch on that you’re as lost as they are your only option is to look up some Infowave and Standard work articles ... and try and figure out what you need to do. All the while the client is waiting and getting more and more frustrated by the minute.”

“Several experiences of waiting 20+ minutes on hold all the while listening to their self-congratulatory message about their low fees being the reason for the wait combined with the ridiculous pop-up ads for their PAS [Personal Advisor Service charging 0.30% annually] every time I logged onto their laughably outdated website made me throw in the towel and move everything to Schwab” wrote a former customer on Early-Retirement.org.

What’s working

Despite the glitches Vanguard took the top spot in the J.D. Power annual survey of customer satisfaction in 2021.

However the rankings came with a caveat for all the brokerages.

The influx of new investors coupled with rising trades and needier clients “clearly put a strain on the system” said Michael Foy head of wealth intelligence at J.D. Power. “With virtually every firm now offering free trading and new investors showing lower levels of brand loyalty firms that get the customer satisfaction formula right have a chance to set themselves apart.”

The American Customer Service Index survey also confirmed how a flood of new investors in the markets are crushing many brokerage firms — not just Vanguard.

“The challenge of handling an influx of new and often younger investors is playing out in depressed customer satisfaction for internet investment services” according to the latest report by ASCI.

Charles Schwab and Vanguard held the high ground in the 2019-20 ASCI study with top marks but the companies saw their numbers erode. Schwab led in ease of making a transaction while Vanguard was praised for its mobile app.

Access can be an issue especially during a pandemic. At Fidelity and Schwab all customers have 24/7 access via chat email phone and physical branches during open hours. Vanguard offers customer phone service for personal investors weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern time and does not open call centers on the weekends.

In an opinion piece for Financial Planning magazine Roth the Colorado adviser decried the recent customer-service flaps at Vanguard. Roth author of How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street is a financial planner who charges by the hour and is a contributor to AARP.org Financial-Planning.com NextAvenue.org and other sites.

Vanguard doesn’t have other businesses to subsidize its retail brokerage unlike Schwab and Fidelity which have active units trading stocks and bonds. The bare-bones firm Robinhood doesn’t offer any live phone customer service but offers trading in cryptocurrencies.

“For at least a dozen years I’ve been getting a reasonably high feedback [from Vanguard clients] that their systems were way behind competitors” Roth said.

“Can they be the low-cost provider? Yes. But what if it takes hours and hours to deal with something a competitor can do easily?”

Roth’s son has two investment accounts one at Fidelity and one at Vanguard. When his son turned 21 he took Roth’s name off the account. That took about 10 minutes at Fidelity — but hours and hours on the phone over a month at Vanguard.

Susan Webber who writes a financial blog under the name Yves Smith described a Vanguard customer-service experience from August 2020.

The author of the blog Naked Capitalism Webber said she has been a Vanguard customer for herself and her mother for nearly 15 years and was “bullied” by a representative.

Webber said it took more than an hour and a half to have Vanguard identify the form she needed to complete “a non-standard instruction.” She said she got through on the fourth call attempt after “I called on the Flagship [elite customer] line using my mother’s ID to get through to a human being. If my account was not linked to a Flagship account I doubt I ever would have gotten to anyone.”

Another problem arose when Webber clicked on Vanguard as a “favorite” in Safari. Instead of going to the standard address in her browser “www.vanguard.com” she said she was redirected to a site that generated a security warning that the site might be trying to steal her data.

“When I finally got to an IRA agent he was arrogant and incompetent about [these] IT security issues that were clearly Vanguard IT issues of a seriousness that I have never seen on any other financial services website. When I said he needed to report them he told me he wouldn’t.”

Many loyalists still don’t want to leave Vanguard stressing that its low-cost funds remain great deals for the consumer.

“I’m grateful to Vanguard for bringing low-cost diversified investing to me and my clients” said Roth stressing the Vanguard mantra that low costs are critical to getting good returns.

However O’Hara the long-haul truck driver with a master’s degree in theology is happy with the workaround of purchasing Vanguard products through other firms.

“Vanguard funds and ETFs can be purchased and held at non-Vanguard custodians” said O’Hara. That’s what he decided to do after he left Vanguard.

“I went to Fidelity because they have fractional share trading [allowing customers to buy a fraction of a share]. That was the deciding factor. Now for friends and family I recommend going with a brokerage account other than Vanguard because of their IT issues” O’Hara said.

“That may be the best of both worlds for clients” Roth added.

“Just because Vanguard changed the financial services industry for the better doesn’t assure that it will remain dominant or even still in business in a couple of decades.”",,,,,,

GREEN CREEK TOWNSHIP — Sharon Drown has internet service at her home but not her business Drown's Farm Market across the street on Sandusky County Road 185.

Her sweet corn and peaches are big sellers this year.

Full tables of zucchini yellow squash green red and yellow peppers sit front and center in Drown's Farm Market as she hopes to continue what's been a good season at her rural farmer's market.

With a lot of her customers using credit or debit cards Drown has machines to handle transactions that uses a phone dial-up line.

Broadband:Broadband access speed an issue for some rural families teachers

At home she uses the internet for things like streaming her favorite Netflix shows.

""Is it high speed? I don't need high speed"" Drown said Thursday as she took a break from waiting on customers at her market which has been in business since 1960 for customers in Clyde Bellevue Tiffin Sandusky Castalia Bucyrus and Green Springs.

Given her druthers though Drown would like affordable high speed internet available at her home and business at what she describes as ""rural Clyde.""

It would be helpful if she had affordable high speed internet at her business to use it with her credit card machines and up the speed from 30 seconds per transaction.

As she continues running Drown's Farmer Market through Halloween Drown plans to continue doing things the way she's done them for decades.

She knows some of her neighbors and friends on Sandusky County Road 181 about a mile away don't have the internet access she does at her home.

Looking for internet affordability access in the 'pockets'

Drown is hesitant about adding internet to her farmer's market because she concerned about affordability.

""I'm afraid my bill will go up up and up"" Drown said minutes before she closed the market for the day.

More than 700000 households or 65% of the state's populated land mass lack access to the Federal Communications Commission's standard internet speed of 25 megabits per upload over 3 megabits per downloads.

Rep. D.J. Swearingen R-Huron represents the Ohio House 89th House District which encompasses Erie and Ottawa counties.

There are pockets in his district that lack access to high speed internet that ""last mile"" where broadband providers need and want to provide service Swearingen said.

Southern Erie County has one of those pockets.

So does part of Sandusky as well as other parts of Swearingen's district.

""When you move over to Ottawa County it's the same thing"" Swearingen said.

As in Sandusky and Seneca counties internet service affordability is an issue that's come up repeatedly with Swearingen as he's talked to constituents in Erie and Ottawa counties.

Swearingen said the complaints he hears are that rural internet service can be expensive and unreliable.

""Usually you get that complaint in an area with only one provider."" Swearingen said Friday.

State invests $250 million for broadband

Ohio's 2022-2023 state budget includes a $250 million investment to expand access to broadband for Ohio households that lack basic connectivity.

Innovate Ohio estimates more than 300000 households which is close to 1 million Ohioans face a major barrier with access to high-speed internet.

In parts of Ohio there are households that lack the basic connectivity necessary for children to do homework look for a new job or access an online education or training programs.

And most of those part are underserved inner city or rural areas.

Gary Click R-Vickery represents all of Sandusky County and most of Seneca.

Click said Laura Kagy superintendent of Seneca East Local Schools was one of several community leaders who stressed the importance of extending broadband service in Ohio's 88th House District.

""She stressed to me how important it was to her and her students"" Click said.

He said once people get outside of Tiffin the internet speed and reliability varies in Seneca County.

In Bascom Attica and Republic there are issues with reduced internet speed and reliability Click said.

More:Think you can make a better map? Here's how to submit your redistricting plan

He said he had talked to officials at Charter Communications Spectrum's parent company about the state's commitment of funds toward improving broadband service and accessibility and that company's interest is expanding its network.

""I think it's common sense these days. Broadband is a necessity of life"" Click said comparing that service to water and electricity.

Federal infrastructure bill passed Senate still under deliberation

The U.S Senate approved a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill earlier this month which included $65 billion toward expanding broadband internet access.

That issue that has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic as social distancing restrictions forced businesses schools and governments to conduct day-to-day functions online.

How much federal funding is extended toward broadband infrastructure in Ohio and other states is still to be determined as the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House assess the Senate bill.

Fremont Mayor Danny Sanchez said he hoped the city would get federal and/or state funds for broadband infrastructure and internet service.

Future of broadband in Northwest Ohio next state budget

Whether the state or federal dollars allocated in this budget cycle is a question on the minds of a lot of legislators and economic development officials.

Mike Jay director of strategic networks at the Toledo-based regional Growth Partnership said a statewide economic development committee had been looking at how the COVID-19 pandemic had been affecting the state's economy.

Jay said the committee has been looking at broadband internet accessibility and how to reach all parts of the state.

He said a representative from Charter Communications told him recently the company intended to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to deliver high speed gigabit internet service to Northwest Ohio.

Spectrum's service area includes Fremont Port Clinton and numerous cities and villages in the region.

Broadband expansion needed for advanced mobility strategy

Jay said economic development and state officials also are looking at broadband expansion in terms of future transportation like connected autonomous electric vehicles.

He said the state's advanced mobility strategy involves autonomous vehicles and their ability to talk to each other on public roadways.

Ohio wants to eventually expand its roadways with that capability to Northwest Ohio Jay said.

Regional Growth Partnership covers 17 counties in the region including Sandusky Ottawa and Seneca counties.

Jay said Charter is looking to put extensive funding into six regional counties that have underserved broadband communities including Seneca County.

The state's $250 million investment is a good start for improving broadband service Swearingen said.

He acknowledged Ohio needs to keep going if it it wants to keep pace with possibly more funding needed in the next state budget.

Who'll pay to plug them?,"Sticking out like a sore thumb in the otherwise bucolic rolling pastures and fields of hay sit four rusting oil tanks “Out of Service” stenciled on their sides along with a scattering of other weathered and unusable equipment.

For the better part of three years Jon and Susanne Stephens have without success been trying to get Noble Energy to plug four wells the oil company has “temporarily” abandoned and remove the defunct equipment and underground flowlines from their land.

The wells haven’t produced any oil or gas since 2017 and Noble says it will at some point remove the equipment from the fields near Milliken in Weld County and plug the wells. “We will notify you when this activity is eventually scheduled” the company which is now part of Chevron Corp. told the Stephenses’ attorney in an email.

“When I was living in Iran this was around the time of the fall of the shah of Iran they had a saying he’d take the milk and leave the cow” Jon Stephens 83 said. “That’s how I feel about the oil companies. They take what they want and leave us to deal with the rest.”

Low-producing and inactive wells such as those in Stephenses’ fields stipple Colorado and are a major focus of rulemaking to ensure there are enough operator funds to plug and remediate all of the nearly 52000 oil and gas wells in the state.

In 2020 there were 17196 inactive wells – producing less than the equivalent of 1 barrel of oil a day including 9585 wells that produced no oil or gas at all. There were another 8538 low-producing wells with an output of between 1 and 5 barrels a day according to state data.

Together the two categories – which were defined in a draft state rule – account for almost half of all the wells in Colorado.

“This rulemaking is unmasking a problem that has been silently growing for decades” said Kate Merlin an attorney with the environmental group WildEarth Guardians. “Operators have neglected their old wells and left them open and idle rather than pay to clean them up and plug them.”

More wells are being plugged than are being drilled

A prime goal of the rules being developed by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission is to make sure there are adequate bonds posted so that if an operator goes bankrupt or disappears the state has the funds to plug and remediate these “orphan” wells.

Industry representatives caution however that this is a misreading of the situation and that many shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells are closed when oil prices are low for maintenance or for safety when new wells are being drilled in the area.

Companies are now plugging more wells than they are drilling. Between 2015 and 2020 8104 wells were drilled in Colorado and 9902 were plugged according to industry statistics.

“The current situation in Colorado is improving within the existing system” API-Colorado an industry trade group said in comments to the COGCC. “Colorado is well positioned to deal with the orphan wells.”

Even the low-producing wells have economic value yielding a small but steady stream of oil and income year after year according to Sam Bradley a spokesman for the Small Operator Society an industry trade group. “They just keep truckin’ along.”

Still the COGCC was mandated by Senate Bill 181 – the 2019 law that transformed the commission’s mission from promoting oil and gas development to protecting public health safety and welfare – to beef-up the financial assurance rules.

The commission initially drafted a rule that would have required a $78000 plugging and clean-up bond for each well compared to the current $10000 to $20000 per well. The agency has since recalculated the average plugging and clean-up cost at nearly $93000.

Every company would also pay $200 a well into an orphan well fund raising about $10 million a year.

Under lobbying from the industry the draft rules were scrapped and turned into a “strawman” for discussion by oil companies local governments and environmental and community groups.

“The proposal would have created the most expensive financial assurance rules in the country for a state that has among the fewest orphan wells in the country” said Dan Haley president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association an industry trade group.

New draft rules are set to be issued at the end of August with hearings early next year and final adoption in April 2022.

The goal COGCC chairman Jeff Robbins said is “better financial assurance without creating unintended consequences and adding orphan wells … Getting the balance right is really really important.”

The commission has however already identified what may be lurking problems that need to be addressed by increased financial assurance.

A 2018 commission task force said some operators have maintained “active” status for wells through the ploy of “selling past production from leasehold tank inventory or by ‘swabbing’ the well to extract and sell a small amount of fluid product each year.”

The commission also has found transfers of wells to new owners involving a large number of low-producing wells “are likely to result in higher risks to the public of the new operator orphaning the wells.”

Slow clean up keeps owners of Weld County land from selling for development

Traveling the Front Range and Eastern Plains the nature of Colorado oil and gas wells unfolds as a complex pattern that contains derelict drillers bankruptcy and orphan wells the clash of suburban home building and drilling but also robust plugging programs by some companies and profits and royalties being squeezed from even the most modest of wells.

The tale is different in the farm fields out near the Nebraska border than in the quickly rising subdivisions in communities like Broomfield but the new financial assurance rules must encompass them all.

One provision in the draft rules tried to address the Stephenses’ problem by requiring a company to get its shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells back in production within six months or increase the bonds on them or put them on a list to be plugged within three years.

API-Colorado supports the idea of a plugging list. Texas has one said Carrie Hackenberger the group’s associate director although a three-year time frame may be an issue.

Jon Stephens remains vexed by the proposal. “The farmer is left waiting three years maybe more after already waiting years” he said. “We just want the return of our farmland.”

In 1921 Susanne’s grandfather Frank Spomer – one of a wave of German Russian immigrant farmers who spread out across the Midwest and West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – bought the cropland outside Milliken.

The mineral rights on the land however were owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad had sold off the surface but held on to the minerals as is allowed by Colorado’s split-estate system.

It was another 85 years before somebody showed up to tap those minerals. By that time Susanne 84 who had grown up on the farm owned the land but Noble Energy one of the biggest operators in Colorado held the oil and gas rights.

In 2006 Noble started drilling on the property. The Stephenses had no choice. Under Colorado law a landowner cannot deny a mineral owner access.

Noble paid $27500 for surface damage on the 160 acres of irrigated fields as it drilled five wells and laid underground flowlines to carry oil to a four-tank battery that also included a heat separator and two concrete water storage tanks and took up about two acres of the land.

“The wells were drilled over a period of a year” Jon Stephens said. “The fields were torn up for months. We were dealing with erosion problems.”

Then in 2017 Noble pulled some but not all its equipment and listed the wells as temporarily abandoned.

A temporarily abandoned well is one where equipment has been removed and a temporary plug put in place. A shut-in well is one where the valves have merely been shut off. There are about 8100 shut-in wells and 2700 temporarily abandoned wells in the state.

In 2019 Noble plugged one of the Stephenses’ wells but did not clean up the site Jon Stephens said.

Landowner Jon Stephens drives across his property. “We just want the return of our farmland” he said. “We aren’t anti-oil … We’re pro-oil. We just think there should be a fair game.” (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun)

This has left the Stephenses in limbo. The land is currently leased to a neighboring farmer but the option of selling it especially for development is limited because of the unplugged wells and flowlines running through the property.

This is a problem that plagues landowners and developers across Front Range oil country. “They keep (them wells) in place to avoid plugging” said Lance Astrella an attorney who represents property owners in oil and gas cases. “It is an abuse of property rights. It is probably a trespass case but most land owners can’t afford to file a lawsuit.”

Low-producing wells even if uneconomical are also used to hold on to leases which require an operating well Astrella said.

Noble when asked by The Sun about the Stephenses’ wells said they are scheduled to be plugged late this year or early next. “That’s not my information” said Matt Sura the attorney representing the Stephenses.

All this leaves Jon Stephens frustrated. “We aren’t anti-oil” he said. “We’re pro-oil we just think there should be a fair game.”

The economics are fragile but every little pump jack helps

Richard Jefferson 63 is one farmer who is happy to have oil wells – 13 bobbing horse-head pump jacks – on his Eastern Plains’ fields of proso millet and wheat Washington County land his family has tended for 70 years.

They are all stripper wells each one yielding no more than 15 barrels of oil or 90000 cubic feet of natural gas a day. Still there is a steady stream of royalties. “I get $600 to $800 a month depending on oil prices” said Jefferson who unlike the Stephenses owned his mineral rights. “It is not a huge amount of money but it is cash in the pocket. It helps.”

One of the wells on Jefferson’s land is operated by Impetro Resources a company with 100 stripper wells run by Sam Bradley 37.

“I have to hand it to these young guys” Jefferson said. “You have to have balls to buy these stripper wells.”

Bradley followed his father who is a geologist into the “small” oil business. The elder Bradley “has a passion for vertical wells” Bradley said. “He chased these assets for years.”

After getting a degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines Bradley held a string of jobs in the industry including as an operations engineer for the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Co. before starting Impetro – Latin for “to succeed.”

While the focus in Colorado has been on the big new horizontal shale wells – drilled to a depth of 10000 feet running as much as 3 miles underground and producing the equivalent of 5000 barrels of oil a day or more – the majority of wells in the state are stripper wells.

The 29000 stripper wells make up 56% of all the wells in Colorado though they accounted for less than 5% of the oil and about 15% of the natural gas produced in 2018 according to the Colorado Office of State Auditor.

These vertical wells about 4000 feet deep are often decades old. Some of Bradley’s wells have been producing oil for nearly 50 years.

“The wells decline at about 2% a year” Bradley said. “They are bunt singles. You’re not going to get rich but they are cash positive.”

Six days a week a contractor called a “pumper” checks each of Impetro’s wells dropping a tape measure into the collection tanks. (There are two oil tanks an oil-water separator a water settling tank and a produced water pit supporting Impetro’s pump jack).

When the oil in the tank reaches 10 feet the pumper dispatches a tanker truck to collect the contents – about 180 barrels to 230 barrels a load.

Bradley pays the pumper $400 a well each month. A pumper can cover 20 to 30 wells and Bradley said make a decent living. “It’s one of the better employment opportunities out here” he said. Impetro also paid $173000 in county property taxes last year.

Fate of companies running little stripper wells depends on big markets

Yet the economics of strippers remain fragile and their fate is perhaps bound even more tightly to the price of oil on markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange than those of the big oil companies.

Bradley said that out of every barrel of oil sold about $25 goes to basic operating and compliance costs $2 go to local taxes (strippers are exempt from state severance taxes) and another $5 goes to the cost of hiring a workover rig for repairs to the well bore.

Royalty payments to folks like Jefferson take another $5 a barrel while $2.50 goes to debt service and $1.50 to general and administrative costs. The cost of paying trucks and pipelines to deliver the oil is a final $5 a barrel.

“If the NYMEX is below $45 I am bouncing below bottom” Bradley said “and when it is above $50 I can start to make a little money and pay off my debt.”

In the depths of the pandemic the spot price of benchmark U.S. oil dropped as low as $16.94 a barrel. It averaged $39.17 for 2020 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

To make ends meet during the pandemic Bradley laid-off employees lived in a camper and pumped the tanks himself. Still he says he almost lost his business.

Oil prices have rebounded and Aug. 20 spot price on the NYMEX closed at $63.40 a barrel.

“The reason guys like me invest in this business is that you can make money in these upswings” Bradley said. But after last year’s near-death experience Bradley hedged his output selling a large chunk of his 2021 production in fixed contracts at $45 a barrel. “I am far from flush with cash but I am financially secure” he said.

While margins are slim Bradley said an evaluation of his portfolio done for a bank by a third-party auditor found that the low-yielding but long-lived assets will make enough cash flow over the next 13 years to plug his wells.

The draft financial assurance rules would completely upend the economic balance of stripper wells Bradley said.

The draft rules would call for each well to be bonded for the cost of plugging and abandoning at $78000 but they would allow blanket bonds for operators with large numbers of wells.

Bradley and most stripper well operators however would fall into a category called “Tier 3” which was aimed at low-producing wells.

An operator with more than 60% of its wells producing less than five barrels a day would have to start paying into a fund for the next 10 years to cover each well at full-cost bonding.

“Tier 3 operators may have the highest risk of orphaning their wells because they have a higher percentage of low producing wells that generate relatively little revenue and they are plugging a relatively low percentage of their wells” the commission said.

“The rules are a complete disaster” Bradley said. “These draft rules require me to tie up all my working capital in bonding. The rules would drive operators out of business and create a whole lot of orphan wells.”

The commission’s financial assurance task force raised the same prospect saying “Additional regulatory burdens placed on a large number of ‘low flow wells’ could result in a significant short-term increase in the number of orphaned wells.”

The Small Operator Society representing 65 small oil and gas companies lobbied the COGCC to set up a statewide fund into which all the oil and gas companies would pay based on their production and from which all operators big and small could draw to plug wells. The commission did not adopt the idea.

“It was pretty much an admission by the small operators that they don’t have the resources to plug their own wells” Sura the oil and gas attorney said.

It is not that simple said COGA’s Haley. “This is an industry full of small businesses hundreds of mom-and-pop businesses across the state” he said. “There are problems for small businesses when government increases the cost of doing business in Colorado. It may be expensive for large businesses but they can shoulder it more easily.”

Bradley said the commission doesn’t understand the stripper well business and that as long as a well is producing more than two barrels of oil a day there will always be a buyer and operator for it. Below two barrels a day the wells are uneconomical and there will be few takers. There are thousands of wells recording less than two barrels a day.

“Even in the worst year we’ve seen 2020 there was only one operator who went bankrupt and created orphan wells Petroshare” Bradley said. “That should tell you something.”

One bankruptcy had many ripple effects

Englewood-based PetroShare Corp. initially filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 in the hopes of reorganizing but by June 2020 facing the pandemic collapse in oil prices and the economy the company was liquidated.

PetroShare owned as many as 141 oil and gas wells according to COGCC data some dating back to the 1980s and some brand new horizontal wells. At the time of its liquidation the company had 89 wells.

The wells were sold in the bankruptcy proceeding to two companies to whom PetroShare owed money. Those companies however did not take all the wells leaving some orphaned.

At the time of the liquidation three wells had been inactive for more than five years 17 had been inactive for more than two years and 47 likely qualified as stripper wells according to analysis by Carbon Tracker a climate policy think tank.

The state seized $325000 in PetroShare bonds for 53 orphaned wells and 58 orphan well sites. That came to a little more than $6100 for each well leaving the COGCC to make up the difference.

“They become our responsibility for the rest of their lives?” Pam Eaton then an oil and gas commissioner asked at a June 2020 hearing on PetroShare’s bankruptcy. “That’s correct” replied Steven Kirschner a COGCC staffer.

While PetroShare may have been the most recent high-profile bankruptcy liquidation – there have been several other operators who have slipped into and out of bankruptcy reorganization – it is far from the most notorious. That distinction goes to Texas Tea LLC.

Texas Tea whose mailing address was a UPS Store between a nail spa and a juice bar in a Lakewood strip mall on West Colfax Avenue ran up so many violations at least 55 and was so delinquent in paying fines that it was banned from doing business in Colorado.

The City of Brighton took the responsibility for plugging one Texas Tea well within its city limits at a cost of $26000 and in 2016 the COGCC took over about 30 of the company’s wells. Texas Tea had $72000 in bonds — $2400 a well.

There are still eight Texas Tea wells and 11 well sites on the state’s orphan well list to be cleaned up.

A review of COGCC data shows that there are other wells that may be heading toward the orphan well list like the 22 temporarily abandoned wells of Colorado Springs-based FRAM Operating LLC.

FRAM ran as many as 83 wells in Delta and Mesa counties and was last recorded having 25 wells. It posted $345000 in total clean-up bonds including $250000 for plugging.

The company’s last recorded oil production was in 2018 65 barrels of oil and 22 thousand cubic feet of gas for the year. In April 2019 FRAM filed for bankruptcy according to a COGCC inspection report for one of the wells in Mesa County along Kannah Creek.

“Location should be a high priority when assigned to the OWP (Orphan Well Program) due to the proximity to residence and an active stream” the March 2021 report said.

FRAM emerged from bankruptcy in March but has been issued COGCC notices of violation this year for failing to report on well operations and for not performing mechanical integrity tests. The tests are required on wells once every five years. Some of the wells according to a complaint filed with the commission by WildEarth Guardians haven’t had a test since 2012.

The company did not reply to voicemail messages seeking comment. Its email address was no longer functioning.

An analysis done by the COGA of all 579 wells orphaned in Colorado found that almost a third belonged to six former operators who had had formal enforcement actions against them including PetroShare.

“When we looked at those operator traits they had a track record of being unresponsive to compliance issues” said Dave Kulmann a consultant who did the COGA analysis. “If you see this behavior and those 2 BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) wells there is a risk.”

Of the 186 orphaned wells the six companies owned 65% had no production in the previous three years being listed as shut-in or temporarily abandoned and all were classified as stripper wells.

“The true risk of becoming an orphan well is not just the well but more critically if the operator has compliance issues or is unwilling to address well issues” the COGA analysis said.

As it is the bulk of inactive wells are not in the hands of small fly-by-night drillers but some of the largest operators in the state.

Chevron’s Noble Energy in 2020 had according to the COGCC’s data1600 shut-in wells 20% of all the wells in the state in this category and 117 temporarily abandoned wells including the four on the Stephenses’ land 44% of the state total.

Noble’s most recent count puts the total for shut-in and abandoned wells closer to 1900 while it has 2400 producing wells. Noble also has about 700 wells producing 2 BOE a day or less.

The largest operator in the state Occidental Petroleum Corp. had 2112 shut-in wells and 253 temporarily abandoned wells.

Kulmann said that is actually a good thing these wells are in the hands of big operators like Chevron one of the world’s 10 largest oil producers.

“They are a big company that gives me comfort that they are not going to abandon wells to the state of Colorado” he said.

“The state needs to plan for the oil and gas industry not as we have known it in the past”

A 30-year-old Noble well now in the hands of Extraction Oil & Gas Co. part of a $125 million acquisition in 2014 sits in a broad sunflower-filled open space in Lafayette hemmed in here by suburban housing and there by light industry.

And on an early August day the well was in the process of being plugged its life officially ended. A workover rig with its 104-foot tower was already in position. On an open space trail a dog-walker ambled by and a jogger passed at a good clip.

Luke Hinrichs 38 Extraction’s workover supervisor who has overseen pretty much every one of the 435 wells the company has plugged since 2016 surveyed the scene.

“When you first turn up people are worried you are there to drill or frack” Hinrichs said. “You try to explain ‘No we’re plugging a well and we’ll be gone.”

While the drilling of new wells and fracking – which sends fluids down the bore under pressure to fracture rock and release oil and gas – can take several months plugging and remediating an old well site including hauling off old tanks and equipment cleaning soil and grading takes about three weeks Hinrichs said.

The workover rig is mobile and comes collapsed on the back of a truck trailer and pops up with its tower extending like a telescope. The actual plugging of the 7000-foot-deep old Noble well was set to use about 840 gallons of cement and take just about 20 minutes Hinrichs said.

Before that the workover rig has to pull up any piping and debris in the well and slide in tubing so the well can be flushed and pressurized with fresh water.

A large stack of pipe already pulled from the well was now sitting next to the rig and a big white tanker truck filled with water lumbered on to the site.

A gyro survey an instrument used to get an accurate downhole location of the wellbore is lowered into the well. Sometimes heat sensors are dropped in to develop heat logs or a downhole camera is used all aimed at getting a better understanding of the state of the well.

The plugging and abandonment plan has to be filed with and approved by the COGCC and is a public record.

One of his most challenging plugging jobs Hinrichs said was on a Weld County dairy farm where the well had been covered by “cow-pucky pond.” A dike had to be built around the well in the waste lagoon to get to it. “That was some fun” he said

When the crew – Extraction was using oil field service company Ranger Energy Services on this job – is ready to seal the Lafayette well an iron plug capped with cement will be placed at the bottom and cement will be pumped in.

The most expensive part of the process is removing the old tanks and equipment and cleaning up the site. “Taking out the tanks you can find old spills” Hinrichs said. “It’s the legacy stuff you have to contend with.”

Extraction said the cost of plugging and remediating a well like the one in Lafayette ranges between $80000 and $180000.

Similar plugging jobs are taking place across the Front Range. Between 2017 and 2020 Occidental Petroleum spent more than $100 million to plug and abandon 2224 wells while drilling 937 according to a filing with the COGCC.

Noble the second largest producer has plugged and remediated 1700 wells and associated facilities between 2018 and 2020 and has plans to seal 445 more wells in 2021.

Since 2017 the company said in comments to the COGCC that it has plugged six wells for every one it has drilled and spent $200 million on the program.

Most operators including Extraction depend on contracting with oil field service companies for plugging which could create a traffic jam if every company faces the same plugging deadline. Noble has 14 of its own workover crews the company said.

As for its large number of shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells Noble said in an email “We don’t believe low producing or inactive wells are a predictor of orphan-well risk.”

“Many of the company’s shut-in or temporarily abandoned wells are legacy vertical wells on lease positions acquired from other companies” Noble said. “Many of those will be plugged and removed as part of our horizontal development plans. “

That may address some but not all of the problems critics say. “The operators who are plugging the wells aren’t the ones we are most concerned about” Merlin the WildEarth Guardians attorney said. “The problem is the stripper wells.”

“The large companies aren’t plugging out of the goodness of their hearts” Merlin said. “By and large they are required to plug wells that could interfere with the drilling of new wells.”

In many ways the debate over the financial assurance rules is a debate over the financial health and fate of the industry.

“A healthy and growing oil and gas industry in Colorado will voluntarily plug far more older wells than any government program with ZERO cost to taxpayers” a coalition of industry groups said in comments to the COGCC.

But Sura the oil and gas attorney who represents municipalities environmental groups and property owners like the Stephenses said “this is an industry in decline we are never going to see the amount of production we saw in 2019.”

“Since they are an industry in decline they should start considering their asset retirements and the state needs to plan for the oil and gas industry not as we have known it in the past” he said.

In 2019 Colorado posted record production of 19.2 million barrels of oil and 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Production dropped nearly 11% in pandemic-ridden 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 production was down 25% year-over-year though industry representatives say they expect it to increase with the country’s economic rebound.

While not an international oil company like Chevron or Occidental the pending merger of Extraction with Bonanza Creek Energy and Crestone Peak Resources into Civitas Resources will create one of the largest Colorado operators with almost 2400 producing wells and 1000 shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells.

The three companies are also responsible for having plugged more than 1000 wells according to COGCC data. Extraction has plans to plug another 20 to 25 old wells before the end of the year for a total of 50 to 60 in 2021.

From the Extraction plugging job suburban development can be seen creeping over the horizon in neighboring Broomfield. In Lafayette the well plugging was ahead of growing suburbia but sometimes as in the case of Broomfield’s Anthem Highlands suburbia gets there first.

1 leaking well in a subdivision takes $500000 to resolve

A drive along Graham Peak Way in Broomfield’s Anthem Highlands development is a trip down one of the countless new suburban streets spreading across the old farm fields and prairies of the Front Range.

The byway is lined with large buff-colored homes with a basketball hoop in one driveway an American flag flying next door scooters strewn across a front path and one of those little green plastic men parents place on curbs in the hopes that motorists will take heed of their children at play. Maple oak and elm saplings still tethered to posts line the street.

At least that is the scene until the home of Wayne Bott 41 and his wife Bennett. Just beyond their house the land on either side of Graham Peak Way is vacant – a few rubble piles weeds wildflowers and hard packed dirt.

There are placards stuck along the street showing where the developer Richmond American Homes was ready to build one sign announcing: “Richmond America Lot 138 16321 Graham Way.”

New construction paused on these lots in the Anthem Highlands development of Broomfield because of methane leaking from a well capped decades ago. (Andy Colwell Special to The Colorado Sun)

It even had the type of home to be built – Plan D601 – a five- to seven-bedroom house with a three-car garage a formal dining room and a great room. “An entertainer’s dream” a brochure proclaims.

The home building was cut short when it was discovered that an old plugged oil and gas well now covered by Graham Peak Way was leaking methane and that the gas had saturated the soil in the area.

“The fact there was an old well may have been buried in all the real estate papers” Bott said. “But we didn’t know about it.”

The city found out about the problem well when it decided to have all the existing wells mainly old and many plugged tested after Extraction announced plans in 2017 to drill 139 new wells in Broomfield.

That is how in May 2019 ERO Resources the city’s consultant found the soil around the Davis 43-6 well now buried under the street was as much as 95% saturated with methane. It looked like the concrete plugs in the well drilled in 1994 and plugged in 2003 had not held.

“When the methane migrates up through the soil it replaces everything” said Mike Hickey head of the COGCC’s orphan well program. “It had years to accumulate.”

Broomfield officials put a freeze on building permits and turned to the state’s orphan well program for help. The concern was that the explosive gas could collect in basements.

In 2017 gas from a severed oil field line seeped into the basement of a home in Firestone leading to an explosion that destroyed the house and killed two people. Ten Anthem Highlands homes were tested for methane – all were negative.

There are 239 wells that need plugging on the state’s orphan well list and 535 orphan-well sites that need remediation.

The state has seized a little more than $2.7 million in bonds from defunct operators of these sites and a 2018 executive order by Gov. Jared Polis allocated $5 million to the orphan well program over two years. The money comes from industry fees and fines.

The COGCC’s strawman proposals would raise the orphan well fund to $10 million a year though a $200-a-well fee an operator would pay.

A commission analysis of orphan well plugging and remediation costs in the state program found the average price per well was $92710 with a range of $25500 to $291000.

Most of those wells however are in rural areas. “Remediating a well in the middle of a suburb is another story” Hickey said.

On Nov. 14 2019 not long after the Botts had moved in to their surprise a towering workover rig appeared in the middle of the roadway a few hundred feet down the street. There were fire trucks and police cars.

COGCC and Broomfield oil and gas inspectors were on site with infrared cameras to check for fugitive emissions. Air monitors were set up. “It was really some scene” said Hickey who oversaw the operation.

The Davis 43-6 well was buried under the asphalt and what the subdivision plans showed 8 feet of earthen fill had covered the well.

The crew had to dig through the tight compacted material and at 11 feet down they encountered a 2-inch pipe suspected of being attached to the well; a hydroexcavator a giant vacuum truck was used to expand the dig.

Finally 16 feet down they reached the well Hickey described as “a dark stinky hole.” The cement in the well had severely deteriorated.

“There were some plugs we were expecting to find that weren’t there that had fallen away degraded” Hickey said.

The workover rig which straddled the sidewalk set to its task first drilling down to clear old concrete and sliding extra metal casing into the well then a new concrete seal was pumped in. Repairs were made to a depth of 2500 feet. The job which was supposed to take two weeks was completed Dec. 8.

Then they waited for the methane to dissipate. The readings tended downward eventually got to single digits but the methane lingered.

This past June to speed the process Richmond American Homes paid to have trenches with vents built parallel to the sidewalks along the vacant stretch of Graham Peak Way. One of the test sites that had measured 3.4% methane on June 21 was down to 0.6% by June 26.

The city is still waiting to give Richmond American Homes which did not respond to email requests for comment the go-ahead for new homes.

Now all is quiet on Graham Peak Way. “I am glad all the construction is over” Bott said. “But you know they are going to start building homes whatever it takes.”

At a City Council briefing last spring Jack Denman Broomfield’s environmental consultant was asked if other municipalities were dealing with these issues or are doing methane soiling testing.

“Not only is this a new issue for the city and county I would pose it is a new issue for the oil and gas commission as well as many of the residential developments up and down or at least in the northern Front Range as residential development moves into legacy oil and gas wells” Denman said. “This is something new for the Front Range.”

And the final price tag of plugging and remediating Davis 43-6? Richmond American Homes spent $200000 on the trenches and vents according to the city and the COGCC spent nearly $300000 plugging. So dealing with this one well on a Front Range suburban street had cost about half a million dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Santa Clarita’s only Boston Market closed its doors in 2019 there has been much talk about what will replace it.

The storefront located at 26543 Bouquet Canyon Road has remained empty since and though many had believed a Chick-fil-A would replace it Jason Crawford city of Santa Clarita planning marketing and economic development manager confirmed Sunday the new drive-thru Chipotle Mexican Grill concept would fill the vacant location with construction currently ongoing at the restaurant remodel.

Chipotle is a fast casual Mexican restaurant serving build-your-own burritos tacos salads and bowls.

However Chipotlane will be a little different than your typical drive-thru Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol explained when unveiling the concept during a fourth-quarter earnings call in February 2019.

You can’t actually order food in a Chipotlane rather it’ll be a “mobile order pick-up lane” where customers will be able to place their order through the Chipotle mobile app or via the website then pick it up in the Chipotlane — all without ever having to leave their car — according to Niccol.

It is unclear when the new restaurant will open its doors as of the publication of this story.",,,,,,,,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church of Jesus Christ Responds to Major Flooding in Rio Grande Do Sul Brazil,"PHOTO-2024-05-08-12-51-59[13].jpg Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints help load emergency supplies from an Azul airplane onto a truck at a military airport in Canoas Brazil following severe flooding in the Rio Grande do Sul state Brazil May 8 2024.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some 200000 people have been forced out of their homes with at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at a military airport in the city of Canoas on Wednesday May 8. Working with Azul Airlines the Church is planning to send an aircraft from Saõ Paulo to Porto Alegre with supplies donated by the Church on Thursday May 9.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

Authorities consider the flooding the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also explain that the Church is responding to the disaster.

Thousands of essential items are being donated including basic baskets mattresses bedding and blankets hygiene kits cleaning kits drinking water personal protective equipment and tools.



These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Also local church leaders are coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post goes on to say that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

Biaya yang besar dan risiko yang tak terduga pada akhirnya membuat banyak orang mundur.

”Aku bukan anak alam anak alay iya ha-ha-ha” canda Rere sapaan akrab Regina saat berjumpa secara virtual pada Selasa (10/8/2021) siang. Tak setitik pun pengalamannya berjibaku di alam liar sebelum akhirnya meyakinkan diri menerobos hutan di Kalimantan Timur untuk memotret orangutan pada 2011. Kini ia tengah berada di Sumatera Utara membantu pergerakan Orangutan Information Centre.

Ada benarnya bahwa kekuatan cinta mengalahkan banyak hal. Keragu-raguan yang muncul dapat pupus. Bahkan rintangan seberat apa pun tak dirasakannya. Fotografer Regina Safri (37) membuktikannya. Kecintaan yang sangat besar terhadap alam dan isinya membuat langkahnya mantap menjajaki banyak hutan demi menjaganya.

Dari tayangan televisi tentang orangutan yang tak sengaja disaksikannya Rere tergugah untuk mendalami mengenai orangutan. Kenapa mereka disiksa? Kenapa mereka diburu? Apa salah mereka? Apa benar separah itu kondisi di sana? Berbekal izin yang diberikan kantornya saat itu Rere berangkat ke Kalimantan Timur.

Meski mengantongi izin bukan berarti Rere mendapat pembiayaan dari kantor berita yang menaunginya. Tabungan yang dimilikinya pun terpaksa dikuras hingga bisa berangkat. Delapan bulan perempuan kelahiran Jakarta ini pulang pergi Kalimantan-Jakarta untuk menuntaskan hasratnya mengurai akar persoalan tentang orangutan.

”Iya pulang balik karena aku juga masih harus liputan harian juga. Kalau dipikir-pikir ya capek tapi enggak berasa. Biaya juga banyak keluar. Tapi semacam ada koneksi saat melihat orangutan pertama kali secara langsung saat memotret itu. Aku cari tahu lebih banyak dan cari datanya. Aku yakin aku harus berbuat sesuatu” ungkapnya.

Kemampuan meramu foto dan menulis pun menjadi senjatanya untuk bersuara bagi orangutan di Kalimantan. Membangun akses dengan warga lokal hingga komunitas lingkungan setempat membawanya semakin dalam menelusuri seluk-beluk orangutan. Fakta orangutan diburu salah satunya juga berasal dari manusia.

Tempat tinggal mereka berganti beton berubah menjadi kebun sawit. Periuk makan orangutan ini kosong karena hutan makin sempit. Demi tetap hidup mereka masuk ke permukiman warga dan kebun masyarakat.

”Lalu mereka dianggap hama merugikan ekonomi. Padahal mereka bermanfaat bagi kehidupan. Mereka ini penyebar biji yang juga berfungsi membentuk kehidupan baru dan bisa menjaga kelestarian hutan. Kalau hutan hilang orangutan hilang. Begitu juga sebaliknya manusia bakal kena dampaknya juga” tutur Rere.

Perjalanan selama delapan bulan pun dibukukan pada 2012 disertai pameran foto tunggal. Ia juga pergi ke beberapa kota bercerita tentang orangutan lewat buku fotonya yang bertajuk Orangutan Rhyme and Blues.

Tak cukup hanya Kalimantan. Rere menggagas perjalanan ke hutan Sumatera. Dari Aceh sampai Lampung disusurinya dengan telaten. Lagi-lagi ia menghabiskan tabungannya ditambah dengan menjual perhiasan dan kamera untuk membiayai proyeknya kali ini. Keluar masuk hutan selama tiga tahun menjadi kebiasaan baginya. Hingga lahir buku tentang hutan Sumatera yang juga dibawa Rere berkeliling ke sepuluh kota di Indonesia.

”Karena dorongan passion yang besar segala halangan yang susah aku hadapi. Dorongan cinta yang besar itu yang buat aku cepat belajar. Learning by doing” ujar perempuan yang gemar menonton Discovery Channel dan National Geographic yang kemudian menjadi referensinya dalam menghasilkan karya di alam liar.

Mendobrak batas

Sejak awal niat Rere menjumpai orangutan hingga keluar masuk hutan bukan untuk memenuhi ambisi proyek pribadi. Keinginannya agar orangutan dan satwa langka termasuk hutan yang ada di Indonesia tetap lestari. Selama ini banyak kampanye untuk menjaga hutan tanpa orang memahami secara dekat tentang hutan dan satwanya. Lewat foto Rere merasa lebih mudah.

”Visual itu kan lebih nempel. Orang melihat langsung terekam. Hutan yang hijau cantik. Satwa misalnya burung sungai berwarna-warni yang cantik. Saat menyadari itu mereka jadi mengerti alasan kenapa harus menjaga hutan. Kenapa harus menjaga satwanya. Jadi ini salah satu caraku berkampanye dan ngompori orang-orang. Juga menyebarkan virus peduli” ujarnya.

ARSIP PRIBADI Regina Safri bersama gajah.

Namun upayanya ini tentu saja sempat berbenturan karena alasan klise bahwa dirinya perempuan. Pandangan bahwa perempuan akan kerepotan berada di dalam hutan bahkan tidak tangguh mengiringi langkahnya. ”Dari teman satu profesi juga ada yang bilang emang lu bisa? Tapi ya udah dijalani aja dan ada buktinya” ungkapnya.

Keluarga terutama ibunda Rere juga tak mengizinkan anak perempuannya ini berlama-lama di hutan. Lebih karena rasa khawatir yang besar. Akan tetapi hasil yang ditunjukkan anak ketiga dari empat bersaudara ini meluluhkan hati ibunya. ”Asal harus ngasih kabar dan jelas baru diizinin ha-ha-ha” kata Rere.

Masuk dalam dunia fotografi yang didominasi pria saja merupakan dobrakan yang dilakukannya. Rere melampaui batasnya dengan memilih jalur memotret di alam liar yang tak banyak ditekuni. Diminati iya tetapi untuk ditekuni tak semudah itu. Biaya yang besar dan risiko yang tak terduga pada akhirnya menjadi penghambat bagi yang ingin mendalami fotografi alam liar.

Belum lagi lokasi yang tak menentu karena kondisi di hutan tak dapat diprediksi. Adakalanya jalur yang mereka lalui terendam banjir karena sungai meluap sehingga membuatnya tertahan sementara waktu.

Memotret pun acap kali menemui kendala meski dipersiapkan karena lokasi yang dihadapi kadang tak sesuai ekspektasi. Memotret gajah misalnya. Sudah ribuan frame milik Rere mengabadikan gajah. Namun tiap akan mengambil gambar gajah lagi Rere selalu menemui tantangan berbeda. ”Medan perangnya beda dengan liputan di kota” ungkap Rere yang masih ingin terus mendalami profesi ini.

Menurut Rere masih banyak cerita yang harus dia bagikan kepada banyak orang untuk mengetuk hati berkesadaran menjaga alam. Ia pun keras menolak donasi atau bantuan untuk proyeknya apabila ada kecenderungan mengintervensi karya. Pengalamannya menangkap pemburu harimau yang ternyata merupakan oknum pegawai negeri sipil Taman Nasional Berbak Jambi pun dapat terangkum apik dengan jujur dalam bukunya.

Jaringannya sebagai wartawan dimanfaatkan Rere untuk menyebarkan informasi serupa atau mengabarkan kampanyenya sehingga dapat teramplifikasi. Untuk lebih memperkaya pengetahuannya Rere kini menempuh pendidikan S-2 dengan mengambil Jurusan Ilmu Lingkungan di Universitas Indonesia.

Tesis dengan tema pendidikan lingkungan untuk anak remaja di desa penyangga hutan dipilihnya. Tema ini diambil setelah menemui peristiwa anak di bawah umur memberondong orangutan dengan tembakan. ”Saat ditanya dia enggak tahu bahwa orangutan satwa yang dilindungi. Makanya aku pengin ada pendidikan lingkungan ini” ujarnya.

Selain merampungkan studi Rere juga sudah berencana kembali menyambangi hutan di timur Indonesia. Bahkan ia juga bermimpi membuat khusus tentang laut berbekal pengalaman bekerja dengan Susi Pudjiastuti mantan Menteri Kelautan dan Perikanan.

”Intinya caring capacity. Alam ini kan ngasih banyak ke kita makanya jangan bikin dia patah hati” tutur perempuan yang menjadi salah satu pembicara di Kompasfest pada Jumat (20/8/2021) ini.

KOMPAS.com - Pandemi yang seakan tak berkesudahan ini tak bisa dipungkiri membuat banyak orang mengalami kejenuhan. Tak bisa menutup mata keadaan ini juga melahirkan sebagian orang yang kemudian merasa “bodo amat”.

Sementara sebagian yang lain berusaha mencari pengalihan untuk kejenuhan mereka. Tak aneh jika berbagai aktivitas dan hobi pun bermunculan. Cukup banyak orang terlihat mulai melirik hobi bercocok tanam sementara sebagian yang lain semakin asyik berselancar di dunia maya.

Sebagian dari mereka yang berselancar di dunia maya dalam hal ini media sosial seperti Instagram atau Facebook ternyata menemukan teman-teman dengan minat yang sama dan mulai membentuk komunitas-komunitas. Komunitas fanbase menjadi salah satu di antaranya.

Beberapa fanbase yang mengidolakan artis tertentu bisa dikatakan lahir dan berkembang semakin besar bersamaan dengan sebuah keadaan yang memaksa orang untuk tidak bisa dengan leluasa pergi ke mana-mana seperti sekarang ini.

Seperti telah diketahui sebelum pandemi ini hadir fanbase yang sedang marak adalah fanbase yang lahir dari Korean Wave. Indonesia sendiri terkenal mempunyai fanbase yang banyak dan loyal pada Korean Pop atau yang kemudian dikenal dengan K-pop.

Pandemi ini memang membuat sebagian orang akhirnya menghabiskan lebih banyak waktunya di depan gadget komputer dan kembali pada televisi. Pada sebagian kaum perempuan misalnya drama Korea menjadi pilihan nomor satu demi mengusir kejenuhan.

Sementara sebagian yang lain menjadikan sinetron sebagai pilihan mereka. Tak aneh jika beberapa sinetron akhir-akhir ini mencapai rating dan share yang cukup tinggi serta melahirkan fanbase-fanbase yang cukup militan.

Misalnya kemunculan Sinetron “Samudra Cinta” menjadi salah satu sinetron dengan rating yang cukup stabil sejak kemunculannya pertama kali pada Desember 2019. Sinetron yang satu ini juga melahirkan fanbase yang tidak bisa dikatakan sedikit dan kalau boleh dibilang sangat loyal dan militan.

Meskipun sinetron ini sudah “bungkus” atau tidak tayang lagi sejak 23 Mei 2021 tidak halnya dengan para fans-nya. Dalam hal ini terlebih fans dari kedua pemeran utama sinetron tersebut yakni Rangga Azof dan Haico van Der Veken. Berbagai akun di media sosial yang mengaku diri mereka adalah fans dari keduanya baik hanya Rangga Azof (Azofers) hanya Haico van Der Veken (Haicovers) atau yang mengusung keduanya dengan membawa bendera Haizofers dan mempunyai hashtag #kawalsampaihalal memutuskan untuk terus mendukung karya dari idola mereka.

Hingga hari ini akun-akun yang kebanyakan lahir justru sebelum pandemi itu masih aktif dan bahkan semakin aktif memberitakan aktivitas seputar idola mereka. Tidak hanya itu sebagian dari mereka yang tergabung dalam komunitas Haizofers membuat berbagai aktivitas yang bisa dikatakan jarang dilakukan oleh fanbase-fanbase lainnya.

Aktivitas-aktivitas tersebut sebenarnya sudah mereka lakukan sejak sinetron “Samudra Cinta” masih tayang di televisi. Sebut saja Program Kita Bisa Haizofers Peduli yang sudah 5 kali diselenggarakan.

Kegiatannya berupa penggalangan dana yang hasilnya mereka sumbangkan pada orang-orang yang membutuhkan di antaranya membantu rumah tahfidz membantuk korban bencana alam (Maluku Kalimantan NTT Malang) memberi makan anak pemulung pembangunan jembatan membelikan huruf braile peduli Palestina membantu anak yatim melalui Pundi Amal Anak Yatim membantu keluarga korban KRI Nanggala dan berbagi kebahagiaan dengan para kru “Samudra Cinta”.

Selain Program Kita Bisa Haizofers juga mempunyai Program Haizofers Bertasbih berupa Doa Istigasah dan Tahlil yang rutin dilakukan minimal 3 kali dalam seminggu Program Melodi Kita Semua Program Haizofers Berqurban dan Program Buku Quotes Haizofers Seluruh Dunia.

Program Buku Quotes Haizofers Seluruh Dunia ini berangkat dari melihat banyak akun fanbase Haico dan Azof (Haizof) yang senang mengekspresikan kecintaan mereka pada idola mereka dengan menciptakan kata-kata indah (quotes) atau puisi. Dari sinilah muncul keinginan untuk mengompilasikannya dalam sebuah buku yang bisa dinikmati oleh lebih banyak orang bukan hanya fans Haizof.

Tak bisa terhindarkan buku yang akan diterbitkan oleh Penerbit Grasindo dan diberi judul Ini Soal Jodoh Takdir dan Kamu: Kita Bisa Apa? ini memang terinspirasi dari idola mereka dengan mengangkat tema seputar jodoh dan takdir. Sasaran dari buku ini adalah semua orang terutama mereka yang saat ini sedang galau soal jodoh. Bagi mereka yang sedang berada dalam situasi tadi mungkin saja quote berikut yang ada dalam buku karya Haizofers ini punya arti tertentu. Seperti apa quotes yang sudah diciptakan? Misalnya seperti di bawah ini:

Sekencang apa pun kamu berlari

sekuat apa pun kamu mencoba menghapus semuanya

sebanyak apa pun rintangan yang ada

kalau Tuhan sudah menakdirkan dia untukmu…

kamu bisa apa?

@haicoaja

Haizofers sendiri berharap buku yang akan disertai ilustrasi menarik dan full colour dikemas dalam bentuk hard cover dan akan terbit pada pertengahan Agustus tahun 2021 ini bisa diterima dan menghibur banyak orang.

Sementara bagi mereka sendiri buku ini seakan menjadi bukti bahwa mereka adalah fanbase yang “nggak kaleng-kaleng” dan senantiasa membagikan hal-hal positif pada sekitar seperti yang selalu ditekankan oleh idola mereka yakni “Spread Love” dan terus berkarya.

They won 132 games and three 2A state championships over the last ten years. They are the Refugio Bobcats.

Refugio has been a constant fixture in the 2A championship game since 2011. The Bobcats won state titles in 2011 2016 and 2019 and were the runners-up in 2013 2015 and 2017.

2011 Championship Season

The Bobcats went 15-0 that season averaging 59 points per game on offense. They scored 70+ points three times 60+ points three times 82 points once and 91 points once.

Refugio gained 8725 yards of total offense that season.

Their defense pitched four shutouts for a combined score of 267-0.

But they faced their toughest test of the season in the 2A championship game against Cisco. Refugio scored to start the 4th quarter and did not score again. But Cisco scored three times in the quarter and Refugio was able to hold Cisco off for the hard-fought victory.

The Bobcats were led on the field by QB Travis Quintanilla. He passed for 3910 yards and 53 touchdowns that season. Against Cisco Quintanilla passed for 372 yards and three touchdowns and no interceptions. He was named the 2A state championship game Offensive MVP.

By the end of his prep career Quintanilla passed for 13472 yards and 178 touchdowns.

RB Draigon Silvas rushed for 1 touchdown against Cisco. He rushed for 1650 yards and 25 TDs for the season.

RB Shiloh Wetsel also rushed for a touchdown. He also had 6 catches for 104 yards. His season totals were 1389 rushing yards and 25 TDs.

WR Cory Brown: 6 catches for 110 yards 1 touchdown.

WR Lynx Hawthorne: 4 catches 119 yards 1 touchdown.

2016 Championship Season

The 15-1 Bobcats averaged 45 points per game (728 points scored). Refugio’s defense allowed zero points scored against them on six different occasions.

They met Crawford in the 2A state championship game. And it was another close game in the fight to hoist the hardware.

When some people are caught breaking the law instead of being repentant they may turn the tables by asking officers to identify themselves.

At least 1 woman has been dubbed the “badge” lady by trying this and unfortunately her male counterpart might have emerged.

The man’s voice can be heard repeatedly demanding that Certis Cisco enforcement officers show him their badges.

Source

He’s also being told that Orchard Road is a no-smoking zone – a rule that’s been in force since 2019.

Man asks officers for names

The 1 minute 43 second-long video shared in the Complaint Singapore Facebook group appears to have been filmed by the man in question.

It starts off with the man behind the camera asking the officers – a male and female – for their names.

At that point the male officer seemed to be busy as he was holding a pink IC and entering something into his phone.

He politely asked the man to let him finish his work before he can explain everything to him.

Source

It sounded like a reasonable request delivered calmly but the man became insistent.

Man repeatedly tells officers to show card

He repeatedly told the officers that they “must show” him their cards saying

No no no no no no you must show you must show.

The male officer responded that he’s not allowed to take videos but the man insisted that he is for his “safety”.

He also pointed out that the officers also had body cameras.

Source

He then asks the officers again to show him their cards

You never show me your card how do I know who are you?

Officers wearing identifiable logos

This is despite the officers wearing 2 very identifiable logos.

From the video the Certis Cisco logo can be clearly seen on their caps.

Source

On 1 side of their vests what appears to be the logo of the National Environment Agency (NEA) can also be made out.

For reference here’s the NEA logo.

Source

Man wants ‘no smoking’ sign in the carpark

The video then cuts to the man behind the camera again saying to the officers “better show me your pass” while gesturing and pointing to them.

Source

At this point the voice of another man can also be heard in the background.

As they argued with the officers one of them can be heard demanding that “no smoking” signs be put up in the carpark.

It becomes apparent that the dispute is over smoking in the carpark.

Orchard Road is no-smoking zone

The female officer then starts speaking but is rudely interrupted by the man who loudly says “but he never throw”.

He’s possibly alluding to how cigarette butts weren’t disposed of on the ground which would constitute a littering offence.

The other man then cuts in to ask why they’re holding on to his IC for so long.

At this point we start having whiplash as the 1st man swerves back to talk about cigarette butts or rather how none of them were thrown on the ground.

The male officer then finally informs him that Orchard Road is a no-smoking zone – and signs saying so are everywhere.

Source

Strangely the man doesn’t manage to film the no-smoking sign that the officer is pointing to.

Source

The 2 men then quickly change the topic back to badges again demanding the officers show them.

Source

The video then cuts off after the male officer declines.

Here’s the full video:

Netizens blame man behind camera

Netizens reacted with dismay to the video speculating that the man was trying to scare the officers to avoid being fined.

Source

Another pointed out that the video was taken in the carpark off Angullia Park which is a part of the Orchard Road no-smoking zone.

Thus the officers are just doing their jobs and the man should just pay the fine.

Source

However 1 person was of the opinion that the officers should’ve displayed their badges prominently and show them when asked.

Source

Do treat others with civility & respect

Though we don’t know the full circumstances of what happened it does appear that the man behind the camera was being very belligerent.

As he was talking about cigarettes not being thrown on the ground and the officers were reminding him that Orchard is a no-smoking zone whatever the dispute is about involves smoking.

Whatever the reason we should always remember to treat others with civility and respect especially government servants who’re doing their jobs.

Simply sign up to the US economy myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

US and international data releases are missing forecasts at an accelerating pace highlighting rising investor angst that the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant will slow the pace of the global economic recovery.

Several closely watched US economic measures published in recent weeks have come in well below Wall Street expectations indicating the powerful economic growth from the depths of the Covid crisis may be losing steam.

US data have underwhelmed economists’ predictions for much of the past month while in recent days these reports have started missing the mark by the greatest degree since the pandemic was punishing the country last year according to an economic surprise index collated by Citigroup.

US consumer confidence fell sharply below estimates two weeks ago followed by weaker than expected reports on retail sales and the pace of new home construction days later. Business activity as measured by regional Federal Reserve branches has also been poorer than projected.

A similar story is at play outside of the US with Citi’s measurements of how economic reports in G10 countries have fared compared with estimates also falling into negative territory. And the bank’s monitor of China is even bleaker given retail sales and industrial production figures undershot estimates last week.

The deceleration in these economic gauges comes at a time when the Fed has signalled it could begin easing or “tapering” its crisis-era bond-buying programme later this year.

“The tone of investor focus has shifted from reopening momentum strong fiscal and monetary support and earnings strength to tapering talk political uncertainty . . . China slowdown and geopolitical tensions” said Mark Hackett analyst at Nationwide Investment Management.

Investor sentiment has been dented by the recent figures and continued reports of supply chain bottlenecks which have accompanied a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the US and other parts of the world.

Economists have dialled back their US growth forecasts slightly projecting an expansion of 6.2 per cent this year. That is down from a 6.6 per cent rise forecast at the end of July according to Bloomberg.

“The Delta variant may be the cause of the recent declines alongside supply chain disruptions but it is bothersome and could translate into earnings issues down the line” Tobias Levkovich a strategist at Citi said.

Read more

Before Green Day played “Longview” from their 1994 album Dookie during an exuberant headline set at the Hella Mega tour Friday Billie Joe Armstrong asked the hyper-enthused Citizens Bank Park crowd if there were any old-school fans in the house.

Yes of course there were. He followed with a second question. “How about middle school? That’s more like it.”

Advertisement

It is. Green Day is a starter band that sticks with you a gateway drug into catchy chorus punk-rock that began pulling in young fans 30 years ago and is still at it judging from the wide age range of the full house at the Phillies’ stadium in South Philadelphia.

And the band’s Ramones-derived three-chords and full-speed-ahead approach still packs plenty of pop. Songs of alienation and self-loathing — “Longview” is about among other things “when masturbation’s lost its fun” — perk up to embrace the moment.

The 21-song set was preceded by the utterly charming Green Day ritual of the crowd singing along to recordings of “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Blitzkrieg Bop” before the band entered with “American Idiot” the title cut to the 2004 album that established Armstrong as a rock-opera auteur.

“Holiday” also from the American Idiot album established the template. It’s a serious protest against the then-concurrent U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But it plays out as a celebration.

“I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies” Armstrong sang accompanied by bandmates Mike Dirnt on bass and Tré Cool on drums. “This is the dawning of the rest of our lives!”

That carpe diem theme ran through the band’s 90-minute performance which was frequently punctuated with fireworks and featured the trio augmented by three auxiliary musicians. It played extremely well with an audience that was more than ready to rock.

The Hella Mega tour which ran for 5½ hours and also featured Fall Out Boy Weezer and the ska-punk openers The Interrupters was supposed to happen last summer but was postponed because of the COVID-19 shutdown.

But tickets originally went on sale in September 2019 so the fans who high-fived and toasted each other during “Still Breathing” and stood in astonishingly long merch lines — everybody wants a Green Day shirt — had been waiting almost two full years to see the show.

Armstrong acknowledged that yearning during the set which didn’t feature a song from last year’s Father of All M— album but did include covers of Kiss’ “Rock and Roll All Nite” and Operation Ivy’s “Knowledge.” It concluded with the earnestly strummed ballad “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” which showcases the prom-theme/wedding-song side of Green Day that’s key to their enduring popularity.

“Put your phones down!” Armstrong implored the crowd early on. “We’ve been looking at our phones for a year and a half. Now we have each other. Now we can hug each other. Now we can kiss each other.”

Can we? In fact one shirtless dude overcome with love for humanity did try to give me a big hug after “Bohemian Rhapsody.” But the concert was staged at a fraught moment when live music is moving forward despite fears of the delta variant of the coronavirus.

Proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was not needed to enter Hella Mega. Instead the show followed Philadelphia’s mask mandate protocols in which masks are only required in the stadium’s indoor spaces. Most fans went maskless outdoors.

A vaccine or a test was to be required however at the Dead & Company show the very next night at the ballpark. And here’s a fun fact: Tré Cool took drum lessons from the Grateful Dead’s Mickey Hart. Green Day and the Dead are San Francisco Bay Area bands who march to the beat of different drummers so to speak.

I missed The Interrupters so my Mega night began with Weezer’s delightful hour-long set. Playing a Flying V guitar in trademark black glasses and sporting a pandemic mullet Rivers Cuomo got nerdy with songs built on crunchy power chords that left plenty of space for audience participation. “All my favorite songs are slow and sad” he sang. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”

Coming on in a rainstorm that began as Weezer closed with “Buddy Holly” Fall Out Boy — back on tour after missing three shows due to a COVID-19 diagnosis — followed with an hour of aggressive emo-pop.

Flames shot out of Pete Wentz’s bass and singer Patrick Stump sang songs much denser and less immediately appealing — and with longer titles like “This Ain’t a Scene It’s an Arms Race” and “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark” — than those of the bands they were sandwiched between.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHAuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvZGVhZC1hbmQtY29tcGFueS1jaXRpemVucy1iYW5rLXBhcmstcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLTIwMjEvODIzNDU0MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dead and Company at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia 2021,"MUSIC

Due to concerns about the impending storm Dead & Company played one long set without a break and although the rain steadily persisted throughout the night the music never stopped.

Before the show I made the walk over to Shakedown Street to see hundreds of happy folks and vendors buying trading and telling stories in exchange for unique bootleg t-shirts stickers handmade jewelry and of course grilled cheese sandwiches.

Inside the ballpark light raindrops fell as the band took the stage with a steady “Mississippi Half Step” opener. John Mayer took lead vocals for an unexpected “Franklin’s Tower” while the sky above the stadium was gifted with a beautiful rainbow as the setting sun took over the first baseline upper levels.

Later in the set I made my way closer to the stage to find friends and other fans dancing in the outfield completely unbothered by the weather. During “Sugaree” Mayer sang out “Well in spite of all you gained You still have to stand out in the pouring rain” to wet fans erupting with screams of joy.

Other favorites played include “Terrapin Station” “The Other One” “The Wheel” and an absolutely wild “Morning Dew” before settling down for an encore of “One More Saturday Night” and “Brokedown Palace.”

Rodger Levenson has guided the company through an unprecedented challenge with the coronavirus pandemic following the acquisition of Beneficial Bank.

As he and his leadership team brought the Beneficial branches under the WSFS name while working to keep the Beneficial customers they kept the safety of their associates and customers as their top priority with social distancing guidelines.

For his efforts Levenson earned the leadership award for large companies in The News Journal’s Top Workplaces competition for 2021.

The Greenville resident said he is honored to receive the award but he gave credit for the bank’s performance to his leadership team and the associates.

“The number one reason for our success is our people” Levenson said. “We’re extraordinarily fortunate to not only have a very talented but also a very engaged group of associates who feel very connected to serving our customers in our community and supporting each other.”

He said the pandemic focused the spotlight on the associates’ commitment to service starting with helping businesses and nonprofits negotiate the federal Paycheck Protection Program for loans to pay workers during the initial shutdowns.

“We put together a team of 200 people working remotely to get that information into customers’ hands. We had some people working seven days a week” Levenson said. “We were the conduit of information and helped walk them through the process so they could get everything done and get their loan approved.”

WSFS arranged over 5000 PPP loans.

“I think it was a heroic effort on the part of our folks” Levenson said. “We gave our associates a small incentive as thanks but we got a lot of feedback from them saying ‘This was my pleasure. We’re just helping our neighbors and our community. We really appreciate it but it’s not necessary.’”

Banks and financial companies have similar services he said “but building relationships with your customers is how you differentiate yourself.”

Levenson joined the company as a member of the executive leadership team in 2006 after working for Citizens Bank and CoreStates Bank. He was promoted to CEO on Jan. 1 2019.

His philosophy is to lead by example give everyone a clear message about the company’s strategic plan and let the managers guide each team in reaching the goals.

“There’s a tremendous amount of communication that comes directly from me and through our senior leadership team through multiple channels so we’re constantly reinforcing that strategy and those goals” he said. “I’m there to be their coach sounding board and to assist without getting into how they’re managing things day to day.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZvcmxpdmVtdXNpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWFkLWNvbXBhbnktcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLW1vcm5pbmctZGV3LXJhaW4tb25lLXNldC0wOC0yMS0yMS1waG90b3MtdmlkZW9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Dead & Company Defies Evening Rain With Powerful ""Morning Dew"" In Philadelphia [Photos/Videos]","Perhaps Dead & Company should try playing in bad weather more often. The Grateful Dead spinoff band consisting of 3 alumni (drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann and guitarist/vocalist Bob Weir) and 3 younger bucks (guitarist/vocalist John Mayer keyboardist/vocalist Jeff Chimenti and bassist/vocalist Oteil Burbridge) were forced to make a pre-show announcement that Saturday night’s show at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia would have no intermission due to severe incoming storms and instead consist of one solitary set.

But this Mother Nature-inspired decision just happened to occur in Philly a city whose Deadheads have a 50-year history of pushing whichever band is in front of them to play harder. The result was a powerful energetic show that ran 2 hours and 40 minutes and in addition to winding up the strongest show of the tour so far also featured an all-time Dead & Company highlight.

With a light rain and a temperature of 77 degrees with and 88% humidity the show kicked off just after 7:15 pm with a relaxed exploratory version of “Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo” highlighted by Weir’s unusually forceful vocals.

Dead & Company – “Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo” [Pro-Shot] – 8/21/21

The pace picked up with an upbeat “Alabama Getaway” that featured a nice Hammond B3 organ solo from Chimenti but the band have continued its curious practice of cutting this song off at around the four-minute mark and not giving Mayer a shot at a closing solo.

After a short pause the band moved into “Jack Straw” but its long slow introduction lagged as did the first verses and the first instrumental section. But then Mother Nature intervened to deal out a pair of rainbows over the stadium as the crowd went wild and from there it was go time. Mayer strummed some percussive chords to rev things up before the final verse and the extended closing jam found Mayer employing the late Jerry Garcia’s time-honored practice during this song of nimbly jumping back and forth between individual notes and light chords.

A stand-alone “Franklin’s Tower” was a welcome and surprising choice as the fourth song and it raised the energy level up a couple notches where it would stay for the rest of the night. This version also contained a nice change-up: after Mayer belted out the “If you get confused listen to the music play” line he gave his solo slot over to Chimenti who responded with a long powerful B3 solo with an extended section of blasts at the end that were clearly reminiscent of the fiery approach to the B3 taken by late Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland.

Weir now had a tough act to follow but he did it with ease by deploying a second-set classic “Estimated Prophet” as just the fifth song in the show. It confidently skulked along in its groovy seven-beat meter with the slight alterations of the melody lines that set Dead & Company versions of this song apart. Its outro jam kept a more insistent pace than usual and was followed by a first-time-ever Dead & Company pairing with “Sugaree” one of Mayer’s showpieces with the band on which he used the solos to just let ‘er rip as Garcia once did.

“Terrapin Station” followed and cast its otherworldly spell for a full 18 minutes with the help of an extended introduction and a pleasant mid-song wander. It made three strong solid passes through its dramatic closing section before spilling into Weir’s signature jamming vehicle “The Other One” which ran another 17 minutes on its own. It contained Burbridge’s rumbling bass introduction that may have been felt more than it was heard and between the verses there was determined interplay between Mayer and Chimenti that was set apart byJeff’s ongoing use of synthesizer effects which prompted Mayer to start altering his guitar tones as the segment progressed.

The Drums interlude featured steady work by Hart Kreutzmann and Burbridge but Hart (clad in a red Phillies jersey) got a bigger reaction from his extended solo on The Beam motioning to the crowd with outstretched arms before rattling the stadium with several heavy blows to the instrument’s strings with a metal pipe. The following Space segment quickly morphed into a purposeful jam that hinted strongly at “The Wheel” for several minutes while Mayer peppered the music with guitar noises that recalled Tony Iommi’s work on the “FX” track from Black Sabbath’s Vol. 4 LP.

Eventually “The Wheel” arrived as the rain came down harder but this this 12-minute version had considerably more punch that the version in Raleigh three shows ago on the tour’s opening night.

By now it was clear that Mayer was having a great night successfully taking chances and trying out different approaches but he’d hit a musical jackpot during the the “Morning Dew” that closed the set. Its tempo was faster than usual as Weir delivered the vocals with the same strength that he’d shown during the show-opening “Half Step” and Mayer nailed the mid-song solo while employing some deft and tasteful tremolo-assisted string-bending.

After Weir sang the final verse Mayer brought the house down with his closing solo starting with some of his trademark finger-picking before heading onwards and upwards while the drummers increased their intensity to stay with him. Burbridge then let loose with a couple of bass bombs as Mayer went to the fanning approach and just when the music couldn’t soar any higher Mayer took it to an even higher place that no one knew existed before Weir sang the closing line. Mayer had shot for the moon and hit it and he knew it right away. This version of “Morning Dew” will remain one of John Mayer’s signature moments with Dead & Company and it provided a knockout ending to the strongest set of the tour so far.

On paper the band had planned to close the set with “One More Saturday Night” but they wisely chose to push it to the encore and not have it try to follow “Morning Dew” directly. From there the planned encore of “Brokedown Palace” dished out a gentle group hug to the crowd before sending them into the rainy night.

So was it a show with a four-song first set tacked onto a “normal” second set or was it a marathon “second” set with an 8-song pre-Drums that would fill a 100-minute XLII-S cassette on its own? Either way it was a winner—and Dead & Company got it all in before 10:00 pm to get everyone out of the venue safely.

CARNOUSTIE Scotland Aug. 22 2021 – Thailand’s Patty Tavatanakit has won the 2021 Rolex ANNIKA Major Award (RAMA) which recognizes the player who has the most outstanding record in all five major championships during the current LPGA Tour season.

Tavatanakit earned the honor thanks to her win at the ANA Inspiration and cemented it with a tie for fifth at the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship and a tie for seventh at the AIG Women’s Open.

The 21-year-old joins Michelle Wie West (2014) Inbee Park (2015) Lydia Ko (2016) So Yeon Ryu (2017) Ariya Jutanugarn (2018) and Jin Young Ko (2019) as winners of the prestigious award which will be presented to Tavatanakit at the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples Fla. in November. The award was not given out in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Points for the Rolex ANNIKA Major Award were awarded at all five major championships in 2021 to competitors who finished among the top 10 and ties. To earn the award a player must have also won at least one of the five majors. Yuka Saso (U.S. Women’s Open) Nelly Korda (KPMG Women’s PGA Championship) Minjee Lee (Amundi Evian Championship) and Anna Nordqvist (AIG Women’s Open) were the other players to qualify this season.

Heading into the final major of the season the AIG Women’s Open 13 players had a chance of earning the RAMA with a win at Carnoustie. Entering the week with 72 points six behind Rolex Rankings No. 1 Korda Tavatanakit needed either a victory to win the award outright or to finish eighth or better to have a chance. She secured her tie for seventh at -9 after a final-round 67 earning six points and surpassing Korda by two in the standings. Korda ended the major championship in a tie for 13th and received no points.

Tavatanakit was the 2021 season’s first Rolex First-Time Winner with her victory in Rancho Mirage this past April. She became the sixth player on Tour history to earn her first career victory at the major and was the first LPGA Tour rookie to win the ANA Inspiration since Juli Inkster in 1984. Along with her win this season Tavatanakit has accumulated an additional six top-seven finishes and also represented Thailand in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics finishing in a tie for 23rd. She currently leads the Louise Suggs Rolex Rookie of the Year standings with 970 points.

Tavatanakit earned LPGA Tour status for 2020 after finishing second on the Epson Tour’s 2019 Race for the Card winning three times and earning Gaelle Truet Rookie of the Year honors. She played collegiate golf at UCLA winning seven events and was a two-time WGCA First Team All-American.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Odisha government has asked its renewable energy development agency to come up with cost-effective incentive schemes to promote domestic use of solar power in the state according to a statement. Chief Secretary SC Mohapatra has directed the Odisha Renewable Energy Development Agency to explore options for incentivising private use of such green power  it said.In a virtual review meeting the chief secretary told officials to prepare a plan for promotional activities and popularise use of solar-based agricultural equipment water heater lights and green-powered machines.New solar technologies in the fields of cold storage drinking water millet processing sewing and rope-making were also discussed in the meeting according to the statement issued on Saturday.The agency has 4 lakh renewable energy installations till July and has been able to reduce emission of more than 30 tonne of carbon dioxide per year OREDA's Chief Executive Officer Dhananjaya Swain said.The OREDA executed 1163 rooftop solar projects with a total capacity of 12.3 megawatt and 2.44 lakh biogas plants.It also developed 13219 solar-powered drinking water projects and distributed 1687 irrigation pumps and 82033 green lanterns he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy9udHBjLXN0YXJ0cy1pbmRpYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1mbG9hdGluZy1zb2xhci1wbGFudC1pbi1hbmRocmEtcHJhZGVzaC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTUxNTgzNS5jbXPSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3MvbnRwYy1zdGFydHMtaW5kaWFzLWxhcmdlc3QtZmxvYXRpbmctc29sYXItcGxhbnQtaW4tYW5kaHJhLXByYWRlc2gvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NTE1ODM1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTPC starts India’s largest floating solar plant in Andhra Pradesh,NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh can now boast of India’s largest floating solar power plant after state-run NTPC commissioned a 25 MW project on the reservoir at its Simhadri coal-fired power station in Visakhapatnam on Saturday.Floating solar power projects are seen as a gamechanger in India's quest for building 450 GW (gigawatts) renewable energy capacity because of their inherent advantages over onland projects which require large contiguous tracts of non-farming non-forest land.Floating solar reduces temperature related losses due to the cooling effect of water they float on reduce evaporation rate of water bodies and have lower maintenance costs.NTPC’s floating solar installation covers 75 acres of the Simhadri reservoir’s surface. It will produce power from more than a lakh of solar PV modules for lighting 7000 households. The project will annually save 46000 tonnes of CO2 emission and 1364 million litres of water which is adequate to meet the requirement of 6700 households in a year.The project was inaugurated by regional ED (western and southern) Sanjay Madan in the presence of Mohit Bhargava ED of the company’s renewable energy arm RE NTPC and Simhadri chief GM Diwakar Kaushik.The floating solar plant is part of the coal-burning behemoth’s plan to turn green by adding a 60 gigawatts renewable energy capacity by 2032. It is also the first solar project to be set up under the power ministry’s 2018 ‘flexibilisation’ scheme allowing generators to supply power from any of their sources based on plant efficiency to reduce discoms’ cost.NTPC is also building a 100 MW floating solar power plant on the reservoir of its Ramagundam thermal power station in Tamil Nadu. Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha Ltd has tied up with NHPC to explore plan and develop commercially feasible floating solar power projects with a total capacity of 500 MW in a phased manner on the state's reservoirs.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2FuZGhyYS1ub3ctaG91c2VzLWluZGlhcy1sYXJnZXN0LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50L2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NTMwMjU1LmNtc9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2FuZGhyYS1ub3ctaG91c2VzLWluZGlhcy1sYXJnZXN0LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTUzMDI1NS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andhra Pradesh now houses India's largest floating solar power plant after NTPC starts operations at Simha,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

The persistent impulse among domestic and international bottlers and distributors has been to stimulate the consumption of the sugary beverages to increase market share. We call this the “sweet drink wars”: the battles for the palate in hot and humid Guyana.

As we saw in a previous installment the Berbice bottlers resorted to destroying the competition’s bottles in their fight for market share. The sweet drink wars in British Guiana intensified between the 1940s and the 1970s: from the end of World War II to the mid-1970s when a severe foreign exchange crisis crippled the Guyanese economy. The battle involved three urban companies: D’Aguiar Brothers Ltd. Wieting and Richter’s (W&R’s) Cold Storage and Ice Depot and the Rahaman Soda Factory. They developed new technologies established national distribution systems and launched innovative marketing and promotion campaigns that invoked hygiene- and ideology-related narratives. The sweet drink wars in Guyana have always featured geopolitical class ethnic and community dimensions.

I pick up the story during World War II. On September 2 1940 the United States and Great Britain signed the Destroyer-for-Bases Agreement. A 99-year lease facilitated the United States’ establishment of an airbase at Hyde Park on the east bank of the Demerara River (now Timehri) and a seaplane or naval base on the west bank of the Essequibo River. American military personnel remained in the colony until 1966 when British Guiana gained its independence.

At the start of World War II both Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola were expanding their domestic and international operations. Both companies supported the American war effort. Robert W. Woodruff President of the Coca-Cola Company declared that it was his company’s intention to “see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents wherever he is and no matter what the cost.” He was gambling on the proposition that when the troops returned from overseas campaigns they would remain Coca-Cola consumers. In 1941 Pepsi Cola adopted the red white and blue logo to express its support for the American war effort.

Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola were available in British Guiana during World War II. Wieting and Richter had the Coca-Cola franchise. The Banks DIH website indicates that the company acquired the first Pepsi-Cola franchise in South America in 1942. This was indicative of the significant changes in the company. In 1939 Peter Stanislaus D’Aguiar the U.K.-educated grandson of José Gomes d’Aguiar became the managing director. According to the company’s narrative Peter D’Aguiar “relinquished” the cocoa chocolate and schooner shipping businesses to concentrate on bottling. The company’s museum located in the rotunda at Thirst Park has an illustration of the first bottling equipment Peter D’Aguiar bought. It was in bottling technologies from Flugel Co. Ltd.

By about 1952 DIH had launched the I-Cee brand of nonalcoholic carbonated beverages. Among the initial I-Cee flavors were cream soda orange and tonic. I-Cee lemon was launched in 1961. The I-Cees were the large (10 oz) drinks. DIH also bottled small (6 oz) drinks such as Lime Rickey ginger ale and soda water under the Club brand. These were “mixers” which were targeted to hotels clubs and bars. Another small drink bottled by DIH during the 1950s and early 1960s was Vimto. Vimto whose trademark was registered in British Guiana in 1919 has enjoyed prestige in the society’s sweet drink culture.

Coterminous with this expansion was a series of assertive marketing and public relations efforts aimed at increasing D’Aguiar Bros’ market share and dominating the market. Wieting and Richter’s Cold Storage and Ice Depot (CSID) with the Coca-Cola Juicee and Star brands sought to defend its market share maintain brand loyalty and increase consumption of its fizzy products. One of CSID’s strategies was providing free “Cokes” for school children attending the annual Empire Day rallies in Georgetown.

During the early post-World War II years the fight for British Guiana’s sweet drink market was primarily between D’Aguiar Bros. Ltd and Wieting & Richter. However by 1950 there was another player the Rahaman Soda Factory located in Houston on the East Bank Demerara. The company started with the Wonder brand of lemonade after the end of World War II. By the early 1950s it was bottling the Red Spot brand under a franchise relationship with S. M. Jaleel of Trinidad and Tobago. At its launch the Red Spot brand had more flavors than any bottler in colony. There was banana ginger beer grape grapefruit Kola Champagne Lime Rickey pineapple and R S Cola along with the traditional orange cream soda and ginger ale. Among its marketing slogans was “Always Refreshing.” The company located in Rahaman’s Park Houston East Bank Demerara was solely owned by Hajji Meer Amjad Ally Rahaman the son of Meer Abdul Rahaman the founder of the Peter’s Hall mosque.

In 1958 the Rahaman Soda Factory acquired the Coca-Cola franchises for Demerara and on Monday June 9 1958 it launched the 12 oz king-sized Coke from a new and technologically advanced factory. A regular 6.5 oz bottle of Coca-Cola cost 7₵ (US 3.5₵) and a king-size bottle was 8₵ (US 4₵). The opening of the Coca-Cola factory was covered extensively in the press. The Daily Argosy of Saturday June 7 1958 carried an extended story that included a photograph from the press conference held at the Palm Court in Georgetown the previous day. In the photograph were Cyril White managing director of The Argosy Company; Ulric Gouveia with Radio Demerara; M. A. Rahaman; and Juan Basseda regional manager of The Coca-Cola Company. The report stated that Basseda had “flown in from Havana Cuba to be present at the press conference.”

The opening of the Coca-Cola factory occurred at an important moment in British Guiana’s Cold War experience. Beginning in 1953 the United States and its allies had concerns about British Guiana becoming a base for Soviet expansionism in the Americas. For the United States this was unacceptable. In 1953 the colony’s first government elected under universal adult suffrage was declared to have been pro-Communist. It was ousted from office after 90 days. According to Dr. Cheddi Jagan:

“Soon after the suspension of the constitution in 1953 the British government moved quickly and launched what Emrys Hughes British M.P. called ‘rule by the iron hand and wooden head.’ The kid glove gave way to the mailed fist.”

Between 1953 and 1957 British Guiana was administered by an interim government whose explicit goal was to promote capitalism as the engine of social and economic development. When the Rahaman Soda Factory launched its Coca-Cola line in June 1958 the People’s Progressive Party under the leadership of Dr. Cheddi Jagan had returned to power. His electoral base the Indo-Guianese population remained loyal during the August 12 1957 general elections. In June 1958 Coca-Cola’s regional manager’s office was in Havana Cuba while Fulgencio Batista was in power.

The opening of a new Coca-Cola bottling plant in British Guiana represented a development model promoted by U.S. foreign policy. It has been referred to as franchise capitalism. Simply stated in this model the developing world would leap into the world of industrialization through franchise relationships with American private sector corporations. Not only would this accelerate “modernization” but it would also quickly provide employment increase consumption and in the process stop the spread of communism. In British Guiana in 1958 Coca-Cola represented private investment a sacrosanct value system to be promoted and defended as was democracy within the American sphere of influence.

Prior to the Rahaman company’s becoming the “newly authorized Coca-Cola bottler for Demerara” the brand’s bottler in British Guiana was W&R’s CSID. However by the late 1950s its bottling plant had grown old and consequently was unable to meet Coca-Cola’s quality specifications. According to members of the Rahaman family “Coke approached [their] grandfather to take over their franchise from W&R. W&R had failed to meet Coke’s standards.”

Senior Coca-Cola executives made many visits to the Rahaman Soda Factory during the early years of the franchise. One such was the 1961. The Evening Post of May 12 1961 reported a routine visit by Mr. Montague Thomas vice president of the Coca-Cola Inter-American Corporation and the Coca-Cola Export Corporation. Thomas is reported to have reiterated that the Rahaman Soda Factory plant was “one of the finest in the region which includes the Caribbean islands and the three Guianas.”

Also accompanying the Coca-Cola vice president was Mrs. M. Thomas. Another article in the May 12 Evening Post indicated that “late last year [1960] the Cuban government confiscated the Coca-Cola Company and the belongings of Mr. and Mrs. M. Thomas both Americans.” Coca Cola’s regional head office was now in Nassau Bahamas. These were intense ideological times in the hemisphere!

In late 1972 W&R relocated its bottling plant from Water Street to the Ruimveldt Industrial Estate. It eventually reacquired the Coca-Cola franchise which it maintained until December 1975 when its operations were acquired by Banks DIH which was also located in the Ruimveldt Industrial Estate. In 1970 Hajji Meer Amjad Ally Rahaman died and the company was acquired by his sons Meer Hamaz Meer Imran and Meer Ansari. The company name was changed to the Republic Soda Factory. By the early 1970s all three of Guyana’s dominant bottlers were located relatively close to one another on East Bank Demerara.

The companies’ advertising and marketing campaigns have played pivotal roles in creating awareness and stimulating the consumption of nonalcoholic carbonated beverages in post-World War II British Guiana. The outcomes of those campaigns still resonate in Guyana. In the sweet drink war there were many casualties especially among the Lemonade People and other small community-based bottlers. Many had been in business since the early 20th century. These bottles of fizz especially the franchised brands were ascribed a higher social status. They not only challenged the small lemonade but they also marginalized homemade drinks as thirst quenchers and refreshers. The franchised sweet drinks were positioned as healthy symbols of modernity and sophistication. The Lemonade People and the community-based bottlers were framed as unsanitary. The next installment will examine some of the tactics deployed in the sweet drink wars.

SSB consumption is also associated with poorer diet quality e.g. energy drinks with unhealthy diets in college students inflate the possibility of disease. These destructive products are heavily marketed towards the youth in our community the demographic most susceptible to these diseases and future health complications. Not only are industry titans like Pepsi targeting the malleable lives of our youth but their products pollute our natural environment e.g. PepsiCo and CocaCola were the two top global sources of plastic pollution in 2020.

The community of Santa Barbara has been a leader of the environmental movement since the 1969 oil spill that led to the creation of Earth Day in 1970. Local organizations such as the Environmental Defense Center and the SurfRider Foundation work to increase environmental protection by defending native habitats preserving waterways and much more. While Santa Barbara as a whole seems to be riding the growing wave of global environmental awareness the prevalence of single-use plastics such as the ubiquitous PepsiCo plastic beverage bottles at UCSB hinders the city’s sustainability progress. In late 2020 Break Free From Plastic a global movement pushing for solutions to the plastic pollution crisis named PepsiCo as one of the world’s top three plastic polluters. Sales of single use plastic beverage containers have increased from <150 billion (B) in 1999 to 550B in 2019. These plastics degrade slowly persisting in the environment for up to a thousand years damaging ecosystems harming terrestrial and marine life and polluting water air and soil. Additionally microplastic particles are known to accumulate within human tissue leading to potential health issues we are only just beginning to understand such as respiratory diseases and cancer. The heavy promotion of and reliance on single-use plastic beverage containers at UCSB impedes Santa Barbara’s vision of a sustainable future and makes the community complicit in PepsiCo’s damaging environmental practices.

At the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are strategically subtle in convenience stores vending machines and sports events through extensive advertising and display. UCSB’s pouring rights contract (PRC) with PepsiCo gives the beverage company exclusive rights to promote and sell their products at university events and venues. While there are countless beverage options available to the campus community up to 75% of the shelf space in certain campus convenience stores are dominated by PepsiCo products. The agreement makes healthy beverages less convenient restricts the sales of non-PepsiCo bottled beverages and allots UCSB approximately $6000000 over the course of 10 years to actively facilitate the promotion and sales of PepsiCo beverages. UCSB prides itself on being a leader in environmental sustainability health promotion and equal opportunity so why are these values left unacknowledged within the UCSB-PepsiCo PRC?

The UC Healthy Beverage Initiative (HBI) part of the UC Healthy Campus Network aims to increase tap water accessibility and decrease SSB consumption at all 10 UC campuses. At UCSB the HBI research group (HBIRG) aims to spark discussions about the environmental health and social equity implications of the PRC as well. The UCSB HBIRG consists of student researchers that investigate how the campus beverage environment can be more inclusive and consistent with our UC and UCSB health equity and environmental goals.

As graduating UCSB students and part of the UCSB HBIRG we hope that Santa Barbara gets more involved in spreading awareness of the negative public and environmental health impacts of SSBs and the large influence beverage companies have on our community. Let’s work together to keep Santa Barbara healthy and thriving for many future generations to come!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzIyL2NhcmluLXNjaG9wcG1leWVyLWZpbG0tZmVzdC1mcmllbmRzLWNlbGVicmF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carin Schoppmeyer: Film fest friends celebrate | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Bentonville Film Festival leaders welcomed filmmakers sponsors and other friends of the festival for an opening reception Aug. 4 at Blake Street House in Bentonville.

Announced with a 30-second film “Ginjaaah Your Flow” debuted to warm reception logging over 395000 views on Youtube in its first week. Earlier today the eponymous campaign song was released as a standalone single.

With this song the beverage giant seeks to portray the infectious energy and buoyant spirit of young Nigerians and inspires them to remain Ginjaaah’d every day.

On the fresh hot track Mayorkun excitedly sang “When I’m looking for my favourite food or chilling on a Saturday give me one Coke Coca-Cola – makes you Ginjaaah Your Flow”. According to reports Coca-Cola needed someone who understood Ginjaaah Your Flow and could connect with teens and young adults in an authentic way.

Self-titled Mayor of Lagos and now Africa Mayorkun is known for commanding attention through his catchy melodies and we could feel this same energy in the Ginjaaah Your Flow song.

The campaign and newly launched single are just the first steps of Coca-Cola’s year-long commitment to uplift Nigerians to transform dull daily moments into memorable and uplifting ones by reaching for an ice-cold Coke.

Company owner Takahide Kobayashi stirs his cola syrup which took him more than two years to develop into its current flavor.

Created using a blend of spices and original recipes craft cola is experiencing a boom in popularity. Their unique aromas and refreshing sensations said by some to be addictive have been causing quite a stir.

The spike in interest was sparked by Iyoshi Cola a business located in Shinjuku Ward Tokyo that is said to be a pioneer in craft cola’s creation.

On a weekend in mid-May many customers could be seen lined up in front of the store before it opened for the day.

“The nostalgic and addictive taste cannot be found in colas sold in supermarkets” said one customer from Tokyo’s Nakano Ward who sampled “The Dreamy Flavor” one of the store’s regular flavors made with lemon and more than 10 varieties of spices such as cola nut and clove.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

Cola nuts directly imported from Ghana and other countries

The store’s 31-year-old founder and operator Takahide Kobayashi was originally an employee of a major advertising company who enjoyed making homemade cola on his days off as a hobby. “I enjoyed the pursuit of [finding] a satisfying flavor” he recalled.

He became inspired to open a store of his own after sorting through the belongings of his grandfather who ran a Chinese medicine workshop called Iyoshi Yakko. When making his cola Kobayashi used the exquisite way of heating or treating medicinal herbs described in a memo of his grandfather’s that he found. The process soon enabled him to produce drinks with a similar fragrant flavor to the cola he serves today.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

Iyoshi Cola is served in a plastic bag. The syrup and carbonated water must be mixed before drinking.

While working as a company employee he began to sell his cola from a food truck in Tokyo on weekends. His cola soon gained quite a following on social media. About a year after the launch of his product he began to sell his cola syrup wholesale nationwide.

In 2018 he quit his company job to focus on making cola. After renovating his grandfather’s Chinese medicine workshop he opened his store last February. In April this year he opened another branch in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward. Iyoshi Cola has grown into a company with about 20 employees.

Kobayashi’s next goal is to open a store in the United States the home of cola.

“I want to become a cola dealer on par with Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola and spread the taste of Iyoshi around the world” he said with a smile."

""Being everything we thought it would be I think the atmosphere was incredible. I think our performance was pretty good and I think it's a great stepping-stone for us to continue to build on for this series and hopefully moving forward.

For Turnbull the win came as a result of weeks of regular season preparation adding that the team was ""proud"" of its execution throughout their first playoff game.

""The whole season we’ve been building and building waiting to get into playoffs and trying to find our game every week and get better so that when players arrived we are ready to go"" Turnbull said. ""I think there’s still a few areas that we can keep improving on but overall we’re pretty happy with where we’re at so we’re excited to get back on the ice for game two.""

The postseason outing continues a record-breaking regular season for the young league. In total the PWHL set six attendance records for women’s hockey this year with nearly 400000 fans showing up to watch the inaugural teams take the ice over the 72-game season.

And in case you haven’t heard – amid all the panic and trepidation over the continuing COVID-19 saga there’s a global climate crisis in full swing and has been for some time.

Evelyn Anca is perfectly aware of that and has been doing her damnedest to make sure as many of us as possible are cognizant of the painful fact that if we don’t get our act together PDQ things are going to become increasingly dire for us all.

I met the 30-year-old Israeli multidisciplinary artist and environmental activist a few days before her show opened at the Shaarabiah Gallery in Jaffa (August 17-21) and shortly before she jets off to Oxford UK – if that is at all doable these days – to start a master’s degree in primate conservation/ human-primate interface.

Fittingly the new exhibition of works – made of junk Anca retrieved from the sea and beach here – took place in the wake of this month’s release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on global warming that indicates that greenhouse gas emissions need to be halved to limit heating to 1.5 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. And that goal was only included in the 2015 UN-sponsored Paris Climate Accords after the obduracy displayed by Pacific island leaders.

Should worldwide temperatures continue to rise and we see more of the catastrophic flooding that hit various parts of Europe this summer people close to Anca could lose everything they have literally. As part of her undergraduate studies in psychology she traveled to Kiriwina the biggest of the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea to conduct research in psychology and culture there.

“While staying in the village of Kavataria and examining culture my intentions were never to change anything but to observe” Anca notes.

Still you can’t keep an impassioned environmentalist under wraps for long.

“I couldn’t ignore the negative effects of the outside world on the local environment and people’s health” she continues. So I tried to understand the environmental problems of the community - and any ways we might be able to solve them.”

While on Kiriwina Anca became friendly with kids at the Kavataria Elementary School and teacher-principal Titi Chris. The artist was appalled with the way life was panning out on the island on several fronts.

“Christianity has taken over the local culture. Almost all the ceremonies funerals weddings and other stuff there is so little left of the old traditions there.”

Anca was also keen to convey to the local inhabitants the perils of ignoring the almost irreversible damage being wreaked on their habitat and cramping their lifestyle.

“The sea is full of plastic. The fish eat the plastic so the people do too” she says becoming emotional as she ponders the fate of her friends in the southwestern Pacific region.

“With the pollution and sea levels rising soon they won’t have anywhere to live.”

Despite the international climate control accords preventing the approaching environmental holocaust sadly seems to be still some way off but Anca who also serves as co-director of Plastic Free Israel is trying in her show to convey some idea of the enormity of the problem – and the horrifying volumes of garbage we blithely leave around or intentionally dump particularly in the sea.

“This morning I went to collect litter from Jaffa beach” she says by the by.

Still she does manage to put some of the detritus of modern day life to good creative and – hopefully – educational use as “Love Death & Plastic” demonstrates aesthetically but also in no uncertain terms. Anca put her body and soul into the exhibits the display of which is supported by a bunch of green ventures including the community-business Up To Us organization which furthers urban sustainability through culture and arts events and community projects. Other green-minded sponsors include the Zalul Environmental Association Tipa Compostable Packaging the Billabong sports clothing company and somewhat surprisingly the Philip Morris cigarette manufacturer which now pledges to achieve a “smoke-free future.”

Anca’s investment in the exhibition comes across palpably for example in Butt Jacket. As the title suggests the piece incorporates cigarette butts loads of them.

“There are thousands in there” she laughs. “I took needle and thread and joined them all up. It took me a long time to do that.”

There were some Band-Aids applied during the process too – to the artist’s fingers that is not the jacket.

Her evolving oeuvre which also takes in photography and drawings includes a two-meter high seahorse made of garbage which was acquired by the Underwater Observatory in Eilat.

I Was not surprised to learn that Anca plied her own course through her creative craft from the off.

“I didn’t formally study art anywhere” she declares. “My mother who is a neurologist studied art in Romania so we often used to draw together. But I never thought I would engage in art.”

Still the natural inclination was always there bubbling under. The catalyst for the art-ecology combo came while Anca was on a prolonged visit to South Africa.

“I went to a place where they kept lions in a fenced area to make it easier for rich people who probably pay a lot of money to come there and shoot lions” she recalls.

One thing led to another and Anca developed a passion for “bringing plastic waste to life letting these colorful abandoned pieces tell the story of plastic pollution and how it affects the environment wildlife and ultimately comes back to us humans.”

Over the years she has participated in group exhibitions and had her own solo shows producing alluring creations with a powerful often oxymoronic subtext.

“Every piece is inspired by real-life events scientific facts and sad truths that I believe art can help us face” Anca explains. “The battle between the vibrant colors of plastic and the persistent black element in all my works represent both the role of this material in our society and consumerism while reminding us of the dark side of plastic and the results of our behavior.”

The University launched the Fund on 10th July 2021 in Lilongwe as one way of weaning itself from dependency on government subvention and establishing diversified revenue streams for the University.

Speaking at MUST Campus in Thyolo NBM plc Chief Executive Officer Macfussy Kawawa hailed the University management for coming up with an idea of an endowment fund.

“As our partner especially in the scholarship program of supporting needy students we thought as a bank especially as The Bank of the Nation we should support this noble cause by our beloved partner.”

“As the Bank of the Nation we are cognizant of the fact that one of the key enablers of Malawi’s vision 2063 development agenda is the development of human capital through provision of education and skills development for the youth.

“This is why we at NBM plc have been running scholarship programs for the needy students in our public universities on top of awarding best performing students through our Corporate Social Investment (CSI) program for many years” said Kawawa.

He announced that NBM plc will be channeling K60 million towards the MUST Endowment Fund to be remitted for the next three years starting this year up to the year 2023 with K20 million each year.

“We believe this is a sustainable corporate social investment which will continue to yield results and support beneficiaries for a long time.

“We believe our contribution to the fund will enhance our existing relationship with MUST and create continued awareness of our brand as the driver of tertiary education in the country and also as The Bank of the Nation while contributing to the Vision 2063 development agenda” said Kawawa.

MUST Vice Chancellor Professor Address Malata said the Endowment Fund will be of benefit for the University including students.

“We are very excited that NBM has responded to our call. Our Fund has several purposes including supporting needy students research and teaching plus infrastructure. What we have done is build the resource base which will take years.

“The funds will be used to support students since the University will use the benefits while the principal investment remains intact” she said.

Malata said by December this year they are eyeing to raise at least K2 billion.

The country’s Vice President Saulos Chilima graced the launch of the Fund in Lilongwe where a number of companies and individuals made pledges towards the Fund.

The 24-year-old phenom has already earned $14 million on the course as a pro including more than $7 million in winnings this season alone.

Last weekend despite not hitting a single shot on the PGA Tour Morikawa still found a way to add another $2 million to his bank account.

In the words of Lil Wayne: “Real G’s move in silence like Lasagna.”

Collin Morikawa’s brilliant PGA Tour season

We thought Morikawa wouldn’t be able to replicate his incredible 2020 season in which he won two tournaments secured his first major championship trophy and finished sixth in the FedEx Cup standings.

Well we sure were wrong about that.

All Morikawa did in 2021 to follow up that performance was win two more tournaments become the Champion Golfer of the Year qualify for his first Ryder Cup notch a career-high eight top-10s and bank $7 million in winnings. Oh and he also enters the FedEx Cup Playoffs in the No. 1 spot in the standings.

This is only the beginning for the young superstar.

Morikawa added $2 million to his bank account without even touching a club

PGA Tour players are competing for millions of dollars in winnings every week. But in the bigger picture they have their sights set on the $15 million FedEx Cup grand prize from the first tournament of the year to the last.

Morikawa enters the playoffs as the man to beat in that respect as he finished the regular season in the No. 1 spot in the Comcast Business Tour Top 10. The 10 players on that list get to split a $10 million pot for their sustained success throughout the regular season.

The winner’s share? Oh just $2 million.

Morikawa didn’t even need to play in last weekend’s regular-season finale at the Wyndham Championship to secure the top spot on the list and he still saw his bank account grow by $2 million.

Now that’s an efficient weekend.

World No. 3 looking to add $15 million more in the FedEx Cup Playoffs

Morikawa has earned just over $14 million in on-course winnings in just three years on the PGA Tour but he has a chance to double that in one day. If he can hold on to his No. 1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings and win the TOUR Championship next month Morikawa will bank another $15 million. Yeah you read that right.

$15 million.

So does Morikawa believe he’s the man to beat this postseason?

“Yeah I think so” Morikawa said on CNBC’s Halftime Report this week. “I’ve shown it throughout the regular season. Obviously finishing first in this Comcast Business Tour Top 10 shows a lot of consistency but this is a three-week stretch of a lot of golf. I’m kinda looking at this playoffs as a whole not necessarily three separate events. But I want to peak in this final event.”

Yeah with $15 million on the line — I bet you do Collin. I bet you do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2Nhc3RpbmcuY29tL2NvbGxpbi1tb3Jpa2F3YS1lYXJuZWQtMTQtbWlsbGlvbi1wZ2EtdG91ci1vbmx5LXNwbHVyZ2VzLTEtc2ltcGxlLXBsZWFzdXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collin Morikawa Has Earned $14 Million on the PGA Tour but Only Splurges on 1 Simple Pleasure,"Collin Morikawa is a star in the making on the PGA Tour.

No check that.

Collin Morikawa is already a superstar on the PGA Tour.

Yeah that’s better.

The 24-year-old has already seen massive success in his young career with five victories and two major championships in just three years as a pro. Incredibly Morikawa has already banked $14 million in earnings on the PGA Tour but he doesn’t care too much about spending any of it. He only splurges on one simple pleasure in life: food.

Collin Morikawa’s early PGA Tour success has added $14 million to his bank account

Professional golfers aren’t supposed to have the success that Morikawa has enjoyed so early on in his professional career. The young phenom has won nearly 10% of the tournaments he’s entered in on the PGA Tour and he’s already won two majors in just eight tries.

Morikawa’s impressive success on the course has also stuffed his pockets with tournament winnings and sponsorships. Through just 51 events played as a full-time PGA Tour member Morikawa has made more than $14 million in on-course earnings. He’s earned more than $7 million in the 2021 season alone.

Just three years into his PGA Tour career Morikawa has risen from No. 2006 to No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking. It’s been a Tiger Woods-like start to his professional golf career and he’s only going to get better.

Morikawa saves his money and only splurges on food

Morikawa is just 24 years old but he’s wise beyond his years in terms of his financial future. He’s not out celebrating his victories with lavish parties or reckless purchases. Instead he’s putting all the money he can right into the bank to save for later.

The Champion Golfer of the Year appeared on CNBC’s Halftime Report this week and spoke about his spending habits. Apparently he only splurges his millions on one thing.

To be honest I’m spending a lot of money on food. That’s about it. Everything else throw it in the bank throw it in investments being smart with it. I’m still very young. I mean I’m 24 but I’ve got a lot of things in my life that I’m very happy with. For the most part it’s just I don’t mind taking in a couple extra million (dollars). Collin Morikawa

It’s no secret that Morikawa is a huge foodie. I mean the dude has various breakfast foods stamped on his wedges. But with $14 million in earnings already his morning meals probably consist of a little more than just eggs and bacon.

Morikawa can add $15 million to his total by winning the FedEx Cup

The FedEx Cup Playoffs are finally here and Morikawa is the name everyone’s chasing entering this weekend’s Northern Trust. He starts the postseason in the No. 1 spot in the standings and 32 points ahead of Jordan Spieth.

But does he believe he’s the man to beat in the playoffs?

“Yeah I think so” Morikawa said on CNBC. “I’ve shown it throughout the regular season. Obviously finishing first in this Comcast Business Tour Top 10 shows a lot of consistency but this is a three-week stretch of a lot of golf. I’m kinda looking at this playoffs as a whole not necessarily three separate events. But I want to peak in this final event because that’s where it’s all gonna come down to.”

If Morikawa triumphs at next month’s TOUR Championship to take home the FedEx Cup trophy and the $15 million grand prize he’ll double his current career earnings in just one day.

Then he’ll be able to buy all the food he wants."

Marcuse who's been dishing out hot dogs to Detroit Tigers fans since Tiger Stadium's final season in 1999 thinks baseball fans visit Comerica Park at least in part to hear him sing.

Behr the general manager of SportService in Detroit -- the Tigers' food vending service -- thinks fans would rather lick mustard off a bleacher than hear one more note from Marcuse's prolific mouth.

The truth as they say is likely somewhere in the middle.

What's undeniable though is that anyone who sits within earshot of Marcuse's area -- Comerica's 100-section near the Tigers' dugout -- will hear his now-famous operatic rendition of ""Hooooooooooooooot Dooooooooooog!""

Marcuse began his singing spiel during a 1999 Three Tenors concert at Tiger Stadium. He found success and transferred his act to ballgames.

""People have a lot of fun with it"" Marcuse said during a rain delay at a recent Tigers game. ""That's why I keep doing it. It started as an advertising gimmick. It's a commission business so why are people gonna buy hot dogs from me? You have to have a little fun with it.""

Now imagine being Short who actually has to take those hacks to transform his mechanics during his debut MLB season. The benefit of his adjustment was displayed Friday. He drilled a crucial line-drive single to left against left-hander Robbie Ray in the eighth inning of a 4-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.

""Trying to change at the highest level it's (expletive) hard"" Short said Saturday. ""Excuse me but you know it's hard. It's tough to make a really drastic swing change when you're facing the best guys in the world.""

A solid defender at shortstop Short has too much power for his own good. He won't stick in the majors if his second-best attribute is home-run power built on insane launch angles. The 26-year-old can be a more complete hitter with a level swing which should help him improve his batting average and situational hitting.

""You don't want to be too pushy"" Short said. ""I'm always going to have that loop to it or whatever but if I can be more in the zone and on-plane with it as opposed to underneath it there's going to be a lot more room for error. It's all about the most room for error.""

Short is hitting .150 with six home runs 19 RBIs 19 walks and 52 strikeouts over 46 games.

He made his MLB debut in late April but didn't get a chance to make a long-term impact until June 26 when he was called up as the 27th man for a doubleheader against the Houston Astros at Comerica Park. After blasting his first MLB home run in Game 1 of the doubleheader he remained on the roster.

From July 7 through Aug. 12 a span of 28 games Short went 7-for-78 (.090) with eight walks and 29 strikeouts.

""It got the point where it was a month-plus where I felt like I couldn't even (draw a) walk"" Short said. ""I was swinging at everything. ... I would swing at the rosin bag. If you were to throw me something I was swinging at it. As soon as I saw something down in the zone because I know I can hit it I was swinging. Even if it's a slider that's bouncing I was trying to yank it somewhere.""

In his past three starts though Short is 3-for-13 (.231) with one homer two RBIs and four strikeouts. Short said he has gotten more comfortable over the past two weeks with his redefined swing and is hitting line-drive outs instead of pop outs.

He believes consistent hits will soon arrive.

""I've always been skittish about being on top (of the ball)"" Short said. ""If you become too on-top you'll cut the ball and it'll go even higher up. There's a fine line to being too direct or too underneath. I'm trying to find that middle ground. ... We're trying to be more on-top.

""There are some guys who try to hit the ball right off the plate and their swing is going to be a little more level. If I did that I would take it to the extreme and either go straight down or straight up and I would be in even more trouble.""

Hutchison returns

Right-hander Drew Hutchison starts Sunday for the Tigers at Rogers Centre a place the 30-year-old called home for four seasons in 2012 and again from 2014-16.

Despite being Toronto's Opening Day starter in 2015 Hutchison was optioned back and forth near the end of his tenure with the Blue Jays. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Francisco Liriano Harold Ramirez and Reese McGuire in August 2016.

""It's the first time I've been back"" Hutchison said. ""It's good to be back in the city and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I've always just turned the page and doing what I can do to be in the big leagues. It's been a fight for me the last few years.""

For the Blue Jays Hutchison posted a 4.92 ERA 128 walks and 374 strikeouts over 406⅓ innings in 76 games. He continued his career with the Pirates (2016) Philadelphia Phillies (2016 2018) and Texas Rangers (2018) before joining the Tigers in 2021.

""I think my stuff is closer to where it was when I was here (with the Blue Jays)"" Hutchison said.

He made his first MLB appearance since 2018 last Sunday at Comerica Park allowing six runs (two earned) on five hits and one walk with three strikeouts. He admitted he needs to improve his fastball command against the Blue Jays' powerful lineup.

""I was just a little off"" Hutchison said. ""It's a little different but I don't think nerves got the better of me or anything like that. I just didn't execute pitches.""

Industry executives say new problems are arising weekly driven by shortages of labor and raw materials. Groceries including frozen waffles and beverages remain scarce as some food companies anticipate disruptions lasting into 2022. A wider range of products is running short and logistical challenges are compounding for many retailers.

Donny Rouse chief executive of Louisiana-based Rouses Markets said he is struggling to fill shelves as his company runs low on everything from pet food to canned goods. The chain of more than 60 supermarkets is sometimes receiving as little as 40% of what it orders prompting Mr. Rouse and his staff to try to secure products earlier and more often. Before the pandemic Rouses received well over 90% of its orders.

""It is difficult for customers to get everything they want to get"" said Mr. Rouse grandson of the chain's founder.

Many grocery chains said that it is hard to predict how complete or on-time their deliveries will be due to limited guidance from suppliers and executives said there is often little recourse when trucks show up with a fraction of what was ordered. Demand is higher than expected by retailers with monthly sales up about 14% from two years ago and 3% from a year ago according to data from research firm IRI.

To keep stores stocked retailers are rethinking when and how to procure products they sell. Some are carrying fewer flavors or sizes selling different brands and gathering inventory whenever possible. Regional and smaller grocers are struggling more than the biggest chains industry executives said.

Albertsons Cos. and other big grocers said they are also feeling the impact of labor and commodity challenges but that their supply picture has improved since last year. Some including Ahold Delhaize USA said they have greater control of their inventory because they have their own vehicles and drivers.

BIDEN'S PROPOSED TAX HIKES WILL DO 'GREAT DAMAGE’ TO MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES: KUDLOW

After stores ran short of toilet paper and canned soup in the early days of the pandemic food manufacturers now are confronting new problems. Resin aluminum and other raw materials used for packaging are running short and many producers are giving priority to their most popular items retailers said. Industry executives said manufacturers are unable to produce enough items to meet demand with many employees staying home because of the coronavirus or because they have received rounds of stimulus checks. Advocates of the stimulus aid have said such federal coronavirus-relief efforts shield households from sudden income drops and help low earners.

Kraft Heinz Co.'s Lunchables have been tough to get and Rouses now is making its own version with crackers cheese grapes and meat. Canned tomato goods have also been running low. When Rouses recently received 40% of its orders for Conagra Brands Inc.'s Hunt's products the chain got more private-label products to fill the gap said Jason Martinolich Rouses' vice president of center store. It has also secured more products from other brands but the grocer is offering less variety than it used to.

Kraft Heinz said there is a record demand for Lunchables with sales growing in double digits for the first time in five years. The company said that it is proactively managing the supply chain and that it is getting more products to customers.

Conagra said its inventory of some Hunt's items will be low until it can package more tomatoes from this year's harvest adding that demand for the products is unprecedented.

Mr. Rouse said he and his team are asking some manufacturers to send products directly from plants. They also check shelves of Rouses' competitors and ask manufacturers why rivals have products that his stores lack. Those efforts don't always alleviate his challenges though.

""Every grocery store is doing the same thing"" Mr. Rouse said.

Many food sellers said they expect the flow of groceries to stay spotty for the near future. Walmart Inc. and other major buyers of food have reinstated penalty fees for late and incomplete orders that they paused last spring but that hasn't improved supply challenges.

""Every day overall stores are ordering 10% more than what we can get for them"" said David Smith CEO of Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc. which supplies food for Rouses and other regional and independent grocers across the country.

The biggest chains are faring better Mr. Smith said because they make up a greater portion of manufacturers' business and are receiving more than their proportionate share. New issues are arising every season for others such as shortages of sports beverages in the summer or string cheese ahead of the fall grocery executives said.

Consumers are adjusting to the new norm retailers said. Quincy Mass.-based Stop & Shop Supermarket LLC owned by Ahold Delhaize is lowering prices of substitutes for items that are running low.

The center of the storm is expected to pass over eastern Suffolk County but its strong winds heavy rain and potentially damaging storm surge to entire region.

With maximum sustained winds at 70 mph – 5 mph short of hurricane status — Henri was still a tropical storm Saturday morning but it is expected to gain strength as it moves north at about 12 mph. A hurricane warning is in effect for most of Suffolk County.

New Yorkers can expect to start feeling Henri’s winds late Saturday night. While the center of the storm is expected to make landfall in Long Island there’s an 70-80 percent chance gusts up to 70 mph will blow through the five boroughs National Hurricane Center forecasts show.

That could lead to widespread power outages. Con Edison said it is bringing in 1500 extra workers from other regions to help restore power. Experts have warned power outages in some areas could last for days.

Henri is expected to dump as much as 10 inches of rain on the central parts of Long Island and as much as 6 inches on parts of the city and Northern New Jersey. That could lead to flash floods in much of the region.

Storm surge is also a big concern not only for Long Island but for parts of the city New Jersey and Southern Connecticut particularly since Henri is arriving the same day as a full moon.

The National Hurricane Center said early Saturday that the water could rise by 3-to-5 feet in the Long Island Sound including Flushing and the waterfront Bronx and on the ocean side of Suffolk from Mastic Beach east to Montauk.

The Rockaways Southern Brooklyn and Staten Island could see a 2-to-4-foot storm surge. The city said all beaches are closed on Sunday and Monday.

Corning organized a group of artisans event vendors and models to come together for an event billed as the first of its kind: Fleur de Muse a virtual design showcase Aug. 8 at the Castle on Stagecoach in Little Rock.

The event was brought via social media to viewers who witnessed the latest fashion and floral trends: bridal gowns by Couture by Tess Bridal; fashion floral accessories made with live flowers by Rose of Sharon Floral Design Studio; and fashions by Paul Rainwater with Q Clothier. In addition to his custom menswear Rainwater showed menswear-style shirtdresses for women custom tailored to their bodies which he began creating last year.

A floral garden installation on the castle's steps set the stage and served as the catwalk for the show whose models were Erica Watkins Kiley Salge Kyla Dishman Samantha Anderson Michaela Boothby Stacy Heath Alyson Perry Chase Rackley and Joshua Ang Price. Models carried selfie sticks down the runway while sharing with their fans on social media. Viewers could tune into any participant's Instagram account for highlights from each member throughout the day.

Artisan hors d'oeuvres by Vibrant Occasions Catering were served to models at the end of the runway who enjoyed them poolside: ""Jar-Cute-eries"" mini-charcuterie in jars; Caprese pipettes -- fresh mozzarella heirloom tomato and fresh basil on a pipette filled with aged balsamic vinegar; hummus shooters topped with marinated feta and served with vegetable crudites; and mini lox and bagels house-smoked salmon with dilled cream cheese on a mini house-made bagel.

Rose of Sharon also released its latest product launch -- floral accessories including necklaces rings anklets hair clips bracelets and more again composed entirely of fresh flowers.

""[The] goal of Fleur de Muse is to provide inspiration for other artists and designers who may be looking for new ways to showcase their work in more sustainable ways"" says Althea Wiles with Rose of Sharon.

We got to check out the phone and here are the first impressions.

Quick Start guide and warranty information

Starting with the display the Galaxy Z Fold3 features a 7.6” (2208 x 1768 pixels) QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display (22.5:18) Infinity Flex Display with 120Hz adaptive refresh rate with up to 1200 nits brightness 29% brighter than the Z Fold 2’s display. The company also says that the Samsung Ultra Thin Glass used in the Fold3 is 80% stronger than the predecessor. You hardly see the under display camera when you are watching videos.

It still has that crease which is visible when you look at the screen from certain angles and the under screen camera is also visible from this angle.

The 4MP under screen camera is a good first attempt from Samsung but it not as good as the 400 PPI under screen cameras used by other companies. Hope we can expect some improvements in the next year’s model.

On the outside there is a 6.2-inch (2268 x 832 pixels) 24.5:9 HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display and this time this also has 120Hz refresh rate offering a smooth experience. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. The tall aspect ratio makes the text look small and typing in a narrow screen might not be a good experience if you have large hands.

The phone is powered by Snapdragon 888 with 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB or 512GB (UFS 3.1) storage options. It doesn’t have a microSD expansion slot. The phone runs Android 11 One UI 3.1 on top. This has Flex mode features which let you do more at once such as joining a video call on the device’s top screen while checking meeting notes on the bottom. There is updated Multi-Active Window App Pair and new Taskbar can be used to quickly switch between apps without returning to the Home screen.

There is a 10MP camera for the outside screen the same as the Z Fold2.

The phone has an Armour Aluminium frame which the company says is its strongest aluminium frame yet. It is definitely better than the predecessor and I like the matte finish which doesn’t attract fingerprints. The phone also has IPX8 water resistance rating but it is not dustproof. When closed the phone is 16mm thick and it is 14.4mm at its thinnest point. You still see a small gap when the phone is closed.

Coming to the button placements the power button that embeds the fingerprint scanner is present on the right side along with the volume rockers. The dual SIM slot is present on the left side. Instead of a single SIM and an eSIM option in the previous Fold Samsung has offered two physical nano SIM slots arranged in a single tray which is a good thing. When unfolded the phone is just 6.4mm thick.

The phone has a same 12MP triple camera arrangement for the main ultra-wide and 2x telephoto. Both the main and telephoto cameras feature OIS. This time the cameras are covered by Super clear glass with Corning Gorilla Glass with DX that offers a better scratch resistance.

Selfies from the 10MP cover camera is good but the 4MP under display camera is just average and looks heavily processed. Other cameras are good. The phone has up to 4K 60fps video recording both on front and rear cameras but it doesn’t have 8K recording that is present in the S21 series. Check out some camera samples below.

The back of the phone also has a matte finish on the back cover which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus that offers a smooth finish and doesn’t attract fingerprints. At 271 grams the phone is 11 grams lighter than the Z Fold2. It packs a 4400mAh battery with support for 25W wired and 10W wireless charging and also supports 4.5W reverse wireless charging.

The Z Fold3 also has S Pen support and the company sells an S Pen Fold Edition with a special tip designed for the foldable phone with force limit technology to protect the Z Fold3’s Main Screen. It also sells the S Pen Pro which has an option to switch between the Z Fold mode and normal S Pen mode to use it for other phones like the Galaxy Note models.

Starting at price of Rs. 149999 in India the pre-bookings for the phone will start August 24 till September 09 2021 before they go on sale from September 10. The company is also hosting India’s first live pre-book event for the phone on August 23 on Samsung.com at 6pm that will let customers avail exciting limited period offers till midnight of that day. This offers priority delivery Galaxy Z Fold3 5G Flip Cover with S Pen and more. In addition there are cashback offers and Samsung Care+ Accidental & Liquid Damage Protection.",,,,,,,,,

Production sources tell TMZ ... Tarek's team went to the production company after we posted our story about him flipping out on his ex-wife Christina Haack and demanded that any crew member who was working on ""Flip or Flop"" that day be removed from the staff of his spin-off series 'Flipping 101.'

We're told Tarek was pissed because he believes someone on that crew leaked the story about him going off on Christina and the production company -- which produces the show and ""Christina on the Coast"" -- shifted some workers around to accommodate his demand.

However a source close to Tarek tells us the crew change request was more about wanting a group that is excited for him and his fiancee Heather Rae Young ... and one the couple can trust to not leak any upcoming wedding spoilers.

As we told you ... Tarek was accused of yelling at Christina on set last month after she signaled it was time to begin filming and allegedly it wasn't the first time he'd done this.

A source close to Tarek claimed his anger toward his ex-wife stemmed from her recent admission she smoked toad venom ... and he was concerned about what else she was doing around their kids.",,,,,,,,,,,,

JASON CAIRNDUFF/Getty Images



It's never a good sign when American shoppers start hoarding goods from Costco.

When the pandemic first hit the US last March Costco stores were mobbed with panic shoppers bulking up on staples like toilet paper and water leaving stores dry of necessities. As the highly contagious Delta variant surges across the US Costco-goers have taken to Twitter to complain about shortages of toilet paper and water at the warehouse again as well as restrictions on the number of products they can buy.

One customer tweeted: ""Headed to Costco and I'm buying all the damn toilet paper"" while another in California said the shortages could be a ""sign of the times to come.""

It indicates that shoppers may be back to stockpiling goods reported Insider's Mary Hanbury but it's not just Costco consumers. With hospitals in less-vaccinated regions becoming overcrowded and mask recommendations returning the Delta variant is sparking fears of a repeat of 2020. These Costco anecdotes suggest Americans are responding just how they did a year ago – by preparing to stock up.

Nearly three-fourths of Americans (69%) said they would consider replenishing their stockpiles of groceries and essentials according to a survey conducted by the analytics firm Inmar Intelligence that polled 1000 people.

Stockpiling could exacerbate the supply crunch that has been plaguing the economy throughout the year just at a time when it looked like things might finally be righting themselves.

A return to hoarding could worsen supply chain issues

America reopened to a more expensive economy than the one that existed pre-pandemic thanks in large part to a supply chain crisis that resulted from a cocktail of factors.

Early in the pandemic manufacturers struggled to estimate demand in a work-from-home economy while also halting factory production for safety reasons resulting in a shortage of materials. As unpredictable consumer behavior surged earlier this year imports picked up speed clogging shipping ports and resulting in shipping delays. Bad weather from February's Texas Freeze to the drought in Brazil only compounded matters.

As stimulus checks and pandemic savings unleashed a wave of pent-up consumer demand that ran up against the widespread supply shortages and bottlenecks businesses began to jack up prices and inflation hit Americans' wallets. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.9% between May and June much more than the consensus estimate of 0.5%.

There have been recent signs that both the supply crunch and inflation could slowly be abating. Major retailers including Levi Strauss & Co. Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc. all saw fewer imports in July according to an S&P analysis from earlier this week. The ratings agency said this might suggest the import boom that stemmed from the economic reopening and vaccination rollout may be slowing down.

While inflation remains elevated it also slowed its roll last month as price hikes waned. The Biden administration said it expected inflation to cool as supply chains heal and the economy normalizes.

The supply chain hasn't fully rebalanced though signaling that Americans' spending behavior in the face of Delta could add ""a speed bump in the recovery"" in the words of Michelle Meyer Bank of America Research's chief US economist. In a note published Friday Meyer wrote that recent softness in spending on the back of Delta shows the economy might have ""a bumpier path ahead than we had initially thought.""







As Hanbury reported consumer stockpiling could become an even bigger issue for grocery stores now than earlier in the pandemic since retailers are still grappling with these supply-chain issues as well as a labor shortage.

The economy has faced a lot of problems during the worst pandemic in a century. It would be something if the typical American overloading on toilet paper turned out to be another one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29zdGNvLXB1cmNoYXNlLWxpbWl0cy1wYXBlci1wcm9kdWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Just Put Purchase Limits on 6 More Grocery Items,"Earlier this week Costco members got a flashback to some of the worst days of the pandemic when the superstore enacted limits on some common household items. This weekend many Costco shoppers showed up in-store to learn that more groceries also now have caps on the quantities per customer.

Saturday one Costco member announced via Costco's Reddit community that their U.S. store had posted a hand-made notice of maximum purchase allotments on some products. The message stated this had been done ""due to supply issues"" though participants on the message board speculated other factors such as staffing issues and Costco's August members-only savings.

I assume it doesn't function too differently than the ones in the States and I was thoroughly put off from it after seeing the crowds from opening week. People mountain people sea.



The main reason though: it's in Qingpu. I don't live in Qingpu. I live very far from Qingpu. As much as I miss Costco and the warehouse full of wonderful things in bulk it's not worth the trip and membership commitment.



Enter the Neighborhood store in Qun Jie Long a WeChat mini-program. Neighborhood does daigou 代购 for Costco which is when a shopper purchases products for you at a slight markup.



Neighborhood launched early 2020. They deliver to: Biyun Lujiazui and Lianyang; and Puxi Qiantan Zhangjiang Kangqiao and Tangzhen. What makes Neighborhood different from the other daigou services that probably exist is that they have an English version.



We tested it out.

Here's How You Use Neighborhood

Neighborhood uses a third-party service which means you can't simply search it up on Qun Jie Long and find it. To find it either get a friend to forward you their store or scan this QR code.

In Shanghai Neighborhood delivers by the region with the exception of remote areas (of which Baoshan Fengxian Jinshan Lingang and Chuansha fall under). Tap into whichever one you happen to fall under. There's a Chinese and English version of each.



The first thing that greets you is a fairly comprehensive introduction into how Neighborhood operates. They deliver three times a week orders cut off at 9.30pm the night before meat and seafood are weighed products yadda yadda yadda.



Important note: they only process issues reported the same day as delivery.

Scroll down and you'll see the products come up. Sections are split into Discount Snacks Kirkland Frozen Drinks Sweets Deli Seasonings Fruits/Nut Vegetables Dairy Health Household Pets and Others. Some items end up in the wrong section but for the most part everything's pretty accurate. Cheese for instance somehow ends up in four different sections. ""Other"" includes everything from AirPods to ironing boards to markers to contact lenses.



Here you add items to your cart in the same way you would with most online stores. When you proceed to payment — tap the green bar on the bottom — they'll ask for your name phone number and address. Neighborhood accepts WeChat Pay and Alipay.

Something particularly irritating about Qun Jie Long is that they publicize the contents of your order first initial and order number (I was #4142).There's no way around this but you can anonymize yourself when the mini-program asks to connect your WeChat account. If you select the additional option of 啊白 you log in as WeChat's version of anonymous. There are a lot of 啊白s.



I ordered midnight after a Tuesday and my order arrived Friday. It's slow compared to Hema but it's good enough as an independent service.



Unfortunately my order of bagels did not come with my delivery. Sad because I was looking forward to my bagels.



I messaged their support box in English and was refunded the price of the missing bagels less than three hours later. They replied that the bagels were out of stock when they bought my order. It's a hassle that this process wasn't automatic; I had to ask for it and Neighborhood says that they only deal with delivery issues reported the same day as delivery.



As for the order — I included a Beef Roll for 20.8rmb to see if Costco's fresh food is actually decent daigou'ed. It comes expectedly cold but was alright. The fruits weren't bruised and frozen food was insulated and delivered with ice packs.



Unlike Taobao or Ele.me Qun Jie Long doesn't track your order. You just have to trust your delivery will come and be delightfully surprised when it does.



The Qun Jie Long mini-program itself isn't the smoothest thing in existence occasionally freezing up with tabs disappearing and then reappearing. It's not Neighborhood's fault but it does make using the service more frustrating. Still it saves you from a trip to middle-of-nowhere Qingpu.

***



So there you go. Costco delivered to your door. Modern life!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3dhc2hpbmd0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbm8tb25lLXJlcG9ydGVkLWh1cnQtaW4tc2hvb3Rpbmctb3V0c2lkZS1tYXJ5bGFuZC1jb3N0Y28vMjc3OTY1Mi_SAXBodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmN3YXNoaW5ndG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25vLW9uZS1yZXBvcnRlZC1odXJ0LWluLXNob290aW5nLW91dHNpZGUtbWFyeWxhbmQtY29zdGNvLzI3Nzk2NTIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suspect Fires Gunshots at Armored Truck Outside Md.

While Costco is highly applauded for great deals bulk purchases and tasty samples the experience can be overwhelming to many shoppers. In an interview with Mashed Dr. Nicole Avena a research neuroscientist health psychologist nutrition expert and author of ""Why Diets Fail"" shared some insights about the phenomenon of how the store so many of us love also produces significant levels of anxiety. One of the main contributors to anxiety is buying in bulk which can upend a person's shopping plans. Dr. Avena explained ""Without preparation it can be a lot easier to get anxious when deciding whether or not to purchase an item. You may have trouble figuring out how flexible your list really is and what your backup plan should be if you don't buy certain things.""

Dr. Avena cited the story of Lauren Wicks who described the experience of handling all of the bulk items from a Costco haul. ""There was no way I was going to be able to haul more than a few items at a time to my car ... I felt like everyone was laughing at me as they watched me try to fit (read: wrestle) a two-quart jar of soy sauce next to a three-liter tin of extra-virgin olive oil into my little canvas bag"" Wicks said (via EatingWell). The availability and scale of Costco's products sometimes force shoppers to buy products in bulk that they might otherwise only need small quantities of. This can ""ramp up nerves"" according to Avena."

Invalid email Something went wrong please try again later.

Something went wrong please try again later.

One of the most well-known and loved aspects of the city Edinburgh Castle has stood proudly on Castle Rock for hundreds of years.

Watching over the city the castle has seen different eras come and go from the times of Robert the Bruce to different world wars and finally being the tourist attraction we know and love.

Since it was first constructed the site has been sieged a number of times and has often fallen into different hands along the way. In fact the most recent siege was in August of this year after a group of protestors attempted to reclaim the site.

Bringing in millions of visitors every year and holding the crown for being one of the most photographed sites in the city you would think that you already know everything about the landmark.

However the Daily Record have shared eight unusual facts you may not have heard but will definitely enjoy about the historic site.

1. It's been under siege more times than any other castle in Europe

Taking its place at the centre of Scottish conflicts it's no wonder the castle has been besieged more times than anywhere else in the UK.

In fact the castle has faced 23 recorded attempts to take it from the Scottish Wars of Independence in the 13th and 14th centuries to The Jacobite Risings in the 17th and 18th centuries control of the castle has switched from English to Scottish control and back several times over.

2. The Scottish crown jewels were hidden in the castle for over a century before being rediscovered by Sir Walter Scott

Locked away in a chest in the castle after the Union of the Crowns in 1707 the crown jewels - known as the Honours of Scotland and comprising of the Crown the Sceptre and Sword of State - were largely forgotten about until they were rediscovered by Sir Walter Scott in 1818.

3. It has its own gin that you can buy

The iconic visitor attraction has created an exciting new gin in collaboration with the award-winning Edinburgh Gin distillery.

The small-batch spirit has been inspired by the city's rich heritage of distilling and brewing and will feature the vibrant yellow flower Gorse that will be familiar to the many people who have climbed the nearby Arthur's Seat to get a unique view of the castle.

4. The authenticity of the Stone of Destiny kept at the castle is heavily debated

The ‘Stone of Destiny’ or ‘Stone of Scone’ which was the traditional coronation stone of all Scottish royalty is also kept at the castle.

Though many debate whether it is the true one taken by the English in the 13th century it was stolen from Westminster Abbey by a group of Scottish students before being returned to England.

The stone was sent back from Westminster Abbey to Scotland in 1966 (on the 700th anniversary of its removal) and is now located at the castle.

However many believe that it was swapped for a fake by the students and the real stone is now rumoured to be kept in a number of places including the Arlington Bar in Glasgow where the students hatched their plan.

5. The castle is said to be haunted by the ghost of a boy Piper

(Image: Alexander Klemm. via Getty)

The story goes that a set of mysterious tunnels were discovered under the castle centuries ago and in a bid to see how far they ranged the young boy was duly employed to explore them.

With bagpipes in hand he was told to play them as he navigated his way along to allow people in the streets above to follow and keep track of his progress mapping out the tunnels as they went along.

The pipes however were said to abruptly stop when he reached the Tron Kirk and though a search party was duly arranged the tunnels were sealed when he wasn't found.

He is now often heard by tourists visiting the Royal Mile near the castle forlornly playing his pipes as he searches for a way out.

6. Mons Meg one of the greatest medieval cannons ever made can be found at the castle

The powerful cannon was gifted to King James II in 1457 it was used to defend the castle until in 1680 its barrel burst making it unusable.

In 1754 it was taken to the Tower of London along with other unused weapons but was returned to Edinburgh Castle in 1829 where it has since been restored but is now on display only.

Contrary to popular belief it is not the famous One O'clock gun.

7. King James IV had a special spy hole called the ‘laird’s lugs’ (the Lord’s ears) in the Great Hall

A small window high above the fireplace in the castle's famous Great Hall allowed the King to spy and eavesdrop on conversations taking place below.

8. The castle once had its own elephant

In the 19th century the 78th Highlanders returned to Edinburgh after a long posting in Sri Lanka with one of the magnificent creatures it went on to live with them in the castle and became their mascot.

The elephant's toes are currently displayed in the National War Museum within the castle grounds.",,,,,,,,,

SUPPLIED

The Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) is vigilant in ensuring that the market operates in a transparent accountable and orderly environment.

With more and more investors and companies entering the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) since its establishment it is even more important for the SERC to ensure the market is well regulated.

One of SERC’s priority areas is in strengthening professionalism among market participants through regular training such as the compulsory Training and Examination for Approved Persons and the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) programme.

The management and senior staff of companies that are licensed or authorised by the SERC to work in securities collective investment schemes or derivatives or any business that provides services in the sector are required to attend the Training and Examination for Approved Persons and CPE programme.

Who can attend these courses?

Training is conducted in Khmer with English and Chinese translations. SUPPLIED

Training and Examination for Approved Persons refers to the course organised by the SERC for all individuals who work in companies that do business and provide services in the securities sector.

These include senior and technical staff and other key employees with the companies involved. Members of the public can also apply to join.

The training focuses on regulatory frameworks and other topics pertaining to the securities sector.

After attending the training participants take an exam organised by the SERC.

After passing the Training and Examination for Approved Persons the CPE programme ensures high standards with continued learning.

Why is it necessary to attend the training?

One of the regulator’s core focuses is on developing human capital for the industry. SUPPLIED

The staff of relevant companies need to attend the SERC training and pass the examination in order to be licensed recognised and/or authorised as a service provider in the securities sector.

The CPE programme then further strengthens the sector by keeping participants abreast of new regulations and developments after having gained their initial qualification.

To keep their qualification valid and continue doing business or providing services in the securities sector participation in the CPE programme every two years is required with the attendance requirement needing to be fulfilled.

The qualification is renewed if participants show at least 80 per cent attendance with them not having to re-sit the exam.

The SERC has held the training courses and examinations since 2010 hosting more than 20 sessions including online classes with 1635 participants having attended.

The SERC organises the training which covers the entire Cambodian securities market system at least twice a year.

Anyone wishing to learn more about the securities sector can attend.

The training is conducted in Khmer with English and Chinese translations as well if necessary.

Application forms for the Training and Examination for Approved Persons and CPE programmes are available on the SERC website – www.secc.gov.kh – and the official Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia Facebook page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBobm9tcGVuaHBvc3QuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3NvdXRoLWtvcmVhcy1rYi1jb21wbGV0ZXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tcHJhc2FjLW1maS1wbGPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Korea's KB completes acquisition of Prasac MFI Plc,"Prasac Microfinance Institution Plc (Prasac) is the Kingdom’s largest microfinance deposit-taking institution (MDI) in term of total assets. SUPPLIED

New York-listed KB Financial Group Inc (KB) successfully acquired 100 per cent ownership of the Kingdom’s largest microlender Prasac Microfinance Institution Plc.

KB paid $322 million for the remaining 30 per cent stake (90 million shares) after it acquired a 70 per cent stake for $603.4 million from Sri Lankan-based non-banking lender LOLC Holdings in April last year.

In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission KB said it now owns 299999999 shares representing 99.99 per cent of Prasac’s total number of shares issued.

One share among the 90 million will be held by Kookmin Bank Cambodia Plc the subsidiary in the Kingdom of KB’s commercial banking unit Kookmin Bank.

“Although there was an option contract pursuant to which Prasac’s shareholders could sell the remaining shares of Prasac and Kookmin Bank could purchase such shares Kookmin Bank and the shareholders have agreed that Kookmin Bank would acquire the remaining shares prior to the exercise dates of such options.

“The acquisition however is expected to be conducted in accordance with the basic principles set forth in the options contract such as the method for establishing the purchase price” KB said.

Prasac received approval from the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) on January 29 last year to sell the 70 per cent stake to KB.

Prasac president and CEO Sim Senacheert said KB’s investment in Prasac reflects a surge in confidence among foreign investors in Cambodia and the microfinance deposit taking institution (MDI).

“Prasac management and staff would like to warmly welcome our new shareholder KB Kookmin Bank to drive Prasac to become more effective and efficient in the expansion of financial inclusion in Cambodia” said Senacheert.

He said Prasac stands as a market leader with the largest operational network among MDIs strong financial returns and a proven record of sustainable growth in its loan portfolio and deposit balances.

Coronado senior shortstop Ryan Ward (6-2 175) committed to Arkansas on Friday night.

Ward is is the son of late San Diego Padres baseball player Kevin Ward and had previously been pledged to Arizona where his dad played both college baseball and football.

Coronado head coach Morgan Cummins praised the newest Razorback commit one of six Arkansas has landed this week.

“Ryan is one of the most talented players I’ve ever coached” Cummins told The Coronado Times. “His biggest strength is he can do everything. He has great tools. Very athletic. Can hit with power to all fields. Very instinctual player.”

Ward is ranked as the 162nd-best prospect nationally by Perfect Game.

Kevin Ward was diagnosed with brain cancer in December of 2018 and passed away on March 9 2019 at the age of 57.

A sixth-round pick by Philadelphia in the 1983 Major League Baseball draft Ward made his MLB debut in 1991 and also played with the Padres the following season while totaling 125 games.

His first major league at-bat on March 10 1991 resulted in double that scored Fred McGriff from first base.

“My dad is such a big reason why I got into baseball” Ward told the same newspaper. “I mean it’s human nature to want to do what your dad does. It’s such a classic game and I just fell in love with it right away. My dad always told me to never take the game for granted and to play tough all the time and to leave everything on the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8xMzAwLWhwLWRpZXNlbC1jaGV2eS1waWNrdXAtcnVucy04cy1pcy1zdGlsbC1yb2FkLWxlZ2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1300-HP Diesel Chevy Pickup Runs 8s Is Still Road Legal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8xMzAwLWhwLWRpZXNlbC1jaGV2eS1waWNrdXAtcnVucy04cy1pcy1zdGlsbC1yb2FkLWxlZ2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L2FydGljbGUvcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtdG8tam9zLWJ1dHRsZXItbGlzdC1vZi1wbGF5ZXJzLXdoby1oYXZlLXB1bGxlZC1vdXQtb2YtaXBsLTIwMjFzLTJuZC1sZWctaW4tdWFlLzgwMjA0MtIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9hcnRpY2xlL3BhdC1jdW1taW5zLXRvLWpvcy1idXR0bGVyLWxpc3Qtb2YtcGxheWVycy13aG8taGF2ZS1wdWxsZWQtb3V0LW9mLWlwbC0yMDIxcy0ybmQtbGVnLWluLXVhZS84MDIwNDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pat Cummins to Jos Buttler: List of players who have pulled out of IPL 2021's 2nd leg in UAE,"Pat Cummins will be missing the second leg of IPL 2021 in UAE. | Photo - IPL |

The second leg of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is all set to commence from the 19th of September and oozes excitement action and is brimming with exuberance. Fans are eagerly waiting for the ball to roll out as breaches in the bio-bubble had led to an unprecedented scenario earlier this year and the cash-rich tournament came to a screeching halt after 29 games. The second half will be taking place in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as India seems like a hotbed for the deadly virus. Amidst all the chaos and unfoldment of bizarre events several international cricketers have pulled out of the IPL for a plethora of reasons. In this article we touch upon some of the players who will be missing out on the second leg of the tournament:

Pat Cummins

The tall and lanky speedster from Australia was roped in for a whopping 15.5 crores in IPL 2020 by the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) franchise and since then he has been the backbone of the bowling department of the franchise based out in Kolkata. Not only with the ball Cummins has been contributing with the bat as well. However the talented speedster will be missing out on the second leg of the tournament as his wife is pregnant and is due to give birth in around September or October. Cummins had said confirmed this in one of the Q&A sessions of his official YouTube channel in August.

Jos Buttler

The swashbuckling opening wicketkeeper-batsman of the Rajasthan Royals (RR) Jos Buttler has pulled out of the IPL because of personal reasons. His wife Louise and he are expecting a second child and the buccaneering batsman will be missing out on the IPL sojourn. This comes as a huge blow to the Rajasthan franchise as their star bowler Jofra Archer is also out of contention as he is nursing a recurrent elbow injury. Buttler had amassed 254 runs in 65 matches in IPL 2021 with a S/R of 153.01.

Adam Zampa

Wily leg-spinner from Australia Adam Zampa has often outfoxed batsmen with his clever variations and wrong-uns and is hard and difficult for the batsmen to tackle. Even though Zampa did not feature in any of the matches of the first leg of IPL 2021 he was very much in the scheme of things for the second leg of the IPL for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise as the pitches in UAE are conducive to swing. However he will be missing out as RCB have recently announced that he is ‘unavailable’ and hence they have signed spin all-rounder from Sri Lanka Wanindu Hasaranga as a replacement.

Riley Meredith and Jhye Richardson

The pace duo from Australia Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith are all set to miss the second leg of IPL 2021 as they pulled out just before the squad announcement day as reported by InsideSport. As a replacement of them the Punjab Kings (PBKS) franchise have roped in Nathan Elis. Jhye Richardson was picked up at an astonishing price of 16 crores in the IPL 2021 auction and Riley Meredith had bagged a contract worth 8 crores in the same auction. Both of them performed decently in the first leg of IPL 2021. While Meredith picked up 4 wickets in 5 games Richardson scalped 3 wickets in 3 matches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ2dHJhdmVsLmNvbS9iYWQtZGVmLXNlbnNvcnMtZmFjdHMtaHVtYW4tdG9sbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RVers stranded with bad DEF sensors.

Adam Zampa: The Australian is quite a handy bowler in the T20 format He is successful in this format because of his variations.

Carol Miller and Alex Mooney have displaced Rep. David McKinley as the wealthiest members of West Virginia’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation according to their 2020 personal finance disclosures filed earlier this month.

All three are Republicans. Miller 3rd District is tops with an estimated net worth of $75.21 million. Mooney 2nd District is second at $14.7 million. McKinley 1st District is third at $10.4 million.

As we reported last week Sen. Joe Manchin’s estimated 2020 net worth was $8.6 million and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s was $2.53 million.

As we stated last week The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probable range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

Here’s a look at each member of Congress.

Carol Miller

Miller has an asset range of $15186062 to $340390006. Her liabilities range from $4365006 to $200800004.

Using the formula that puts her range of worth at -$185613942 to $336025000. From that her estimated net worth comes to $75205529.

Members of Congress are required to report their own and their spouse’s assets. The bulk of Miller’s assets come from her husband’s (Matt Miller) ownership of five Dutch Miller auto dealerships all valued at more than $1 million. In addition he has ownership interest through MFM Realty of the five dealership properties with four of those valued at more than $1 million and one valued at $100001-$250000.

Open Secrets notes the challenge of estimating spousal assets valued at more than $1 million because House reporting rules don’t require a maximum range. For those assets Open Secrets sets a cap of $50 million for its formula and we used the same figure.

Out of curiosity we also calculated an estimated net worth by setting that cap at $5 million. Even with that lower cap Miller still comes in at the wealthiest of West Virginia’s five with an estimated net worth of $30.2 million.

Miller and her husband also hold a variety of stock assets. They have pharmaceutical stock: Abbott AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb CVS Health Johnson & Johnson McKesson Merck Pfizer and Viatris.

Their tech holdings include Apple Microsoft Cisco and Oracle.

Examples of other holdings are: Altria (tobacco products) Coca-Cola Dominion Energy Energizer (batteries) Hormel Foods (Spam) McDonald’s Yum! (KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut) and Proctor & Gamble.

Stock portfolios are subject to frequent trades and updates logged on Periodic Transaction Reports; the companies cited here and for the others are on their annual filings.

Miller’s liabilities include two mortgages a farm loan two loans for the dealerships and a business floor plan loan.

As we reported last week Manchin ranked 67th most wealthy for both houses of Congress in 2018 (the last year for which Open Secrets evaluated and ranked all 535 members) and 19th in the Senate. Capito was 169th and 46th respectively.

Miller wasn’t in the U.S. House in 2018 but plugging her current estimated net worth into the 2018 list would put her at 11th overall and ninth in the House.

Alex Mooney

Virtually all of Mooney’s worth stems from one asset: his wife’s (Grace Mooney) TIAA retirement annuity valued at $5000001-$25000000.

Mooney himself holds nine Maryland Supplemental Retirement Plan 401K funds. All but one of those are valued at $1001-$15000. The ninth is valued at $1-$1000.

His combined asset range is $5009011-$25136000. He reports one liability a home mortgage valued at $250001-$500000.

Using the formula Mooney’s range of worth is $4509011-$24885999. That puts his estimated net worth at $14697505.

In 2018 his wife’s retirement annuity wasn’t factored in and his estimated net worth was just $137005 ranking him 287th in the House and 360th overall.

David McKinley

In 2018 McKinley’s estimated net worth was $6739056 placing him second after Manchin and above Capito Mooney and then-Rep. Evan Jenkins. Jenkins now state Supreme Court chief justice ranked fourth among the five with an estimated net worth of $920023.

For all of Congress in 2018 McKinley ranked 82nd overall for net worth and 59th in the House.

For 2020 McKinley reported assets of $5016118-$15796000. He reported no liabilities.

His estimated net worth came to $10406059.

He and his wife Mary hold a broad array of assets. Stock holdings include Abbott Laboratories Apple Costco Dollar Tree Home Depot Intuit MasterCard Microsoft Starbucks Sysco (food distributor) Tractor Supply and UnitedHealth.

Many of their assets are packaged into IRA accounts and a Black Rock-managed set of exchange-traded funds called iShares.

They own a rental property in Wheeling worth $1000001-$5000000 and co-own with other family members 90 acres of Preston County timber land valued at $15001-$50000.

The former Heisman finalist didn’t get into the game until the second half in a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills this time. Despite fans going downright giddy about his entrance into the game Fields didn’t have nearly the same success he had in his preseason debut against Miami last week.

On top of that he’s lucky he didn’t get severely injured by a vicious hit from the Bills’ Andrew Smith who somehow came off the edge unblocked and had an unabated free run on Fields. Smith left his feet and went headhunting.

Memo to Da Bears — you might want to protect your first-round quarterback who the entire city of Chicago is worshipping right now a little better than that.

Justin Fields got hammered pic.twitter.com/9LeNfFcc4z — CJ Fogler (@cjzer0) August 21 2021

Fields was jarred so hard that not only did his helmet come off but his headband also went flying. The hit expectedly drew a flag and we’re guessing the former Buckeye felt what was a scary moment for sure. He stayed in the game so we don’t expect any negative injury news to come out of this but welcome to the NFL I guess.

For the game Fields completed just 9 of 19 passes for 89 yards. He also carried the ball four times for 46 yards during a 41-15 beatdown (enter preseason disclaimer here). He’ll look to build on his preseason action to date next Saturday against the Tennessee Titans.

Phil Murphy since late June.

The measure which establishes a three-year pilot run of ""financial empowerment centers"" in certain towns would use funding the state received in a 2019 settlement of complaints against Equifax following a data breach that affected millions of New Jersey residents.

Should the legislation become law the pilot program would contract a non-profit provider to establish an empowerment center in Camden New Brunswick Newark Paterson and Trenton in locations that are easily accessible to residents. The centers would facilitate forums programs or initiatives designed to educate the public regarding financial literacy and provide coaching to ""economically vulnerable individuals.""

""With such challenging times upon us the ability to make informed decisions regarding our finances is more important than ever"" said Ralph Albert Thomas CEO and executive director of the New Jersey Society of CPAs which is encouraging Murphy to sign the legislation. ""We believe many adults — especially those who live in underprivileged communities — could benefit from the program’s focus on bank accounts credit scores decreasing non-mortgage debt and increasing savings.""

Following conclusion of the pilot program the legislation states a report would be issued to the Department of Community Affairs which would then submit a report to the governor about the effectiveness of the program. The report would include a recommendation about whether the program can be extended and expanded.

""By providing centers like this we can hopefully help elevate individuals in challenged areas as I would call them"" Thomas said.

The Democrat-sponsored measure was approved unanimously by the full Assembly in March and unanimously by the full Senate in June.

Some people enjoy painting others cooking and others love crocheting motorcycles and stuff. However one of the more popular pursuits recently—given lockdowns and all—has been wood carving. That's the hobby of choice for Jim DeBoer of Orange City Iowa who has been carving stuff since before it was cool and his decades of craftsmanship shine bright in his expertly-built John Deere equipment replicas.

via KLEM

They say necessity is the mother of innovation and that holds true in this story. Before the now 92-year-old DeBoer ventured into replicas his creations actually doubled as his toys when he began carving them at 12 years old. Growing up on a farm he didn't have many toys of his own so he decided to build them.

One of the first wooden replicas DeBoer ever built was of a spreader—that's a piece of farm equipment that spreads seed fertilizer or other materials. After building a functional pull-behind model he had to have a tractor with a motor to pull it so he built that too.

As DeBoer became more proficient his models became increasingly more complex. Something that he loves to do is shock people with the craftsmanship he puts into his work. And above all he does this by adding as many moving parts as possible.

A prime example is a John Deere spreader with blades that moved with the wheels. As if that mechanical link made of wood wasn't cool enough he took it a step further and designed components to be disengaged individually with the flip of a switch.

It's the forage harvesters that have the most moving parts though. DeBoer said that he was even tempted to quit a few times because of how complicated they were to build. A quick demonstration shows just how much work he put into these as they can even load and unload interchangeable headers using a maneuverable system he built into the model.

The process of designing one of these models begins on ordinary pen and paper. Jim sketches out a scale example of what he wants to build and then walks over to his pile of scrap wood to get started. His main tools? A coping saw wood file and lots of sandpaper. Depending on the model Jim might also use nails wire and tin in the construction and his door hinges are often made from ordinary paper.

In 2019 DeBoer said that he had built 29 tractors (each takes between 80 and 100 hours to complete) seven combines five corn pickers four harvesters three bailers two field cultivators and countless trailers. He also has a Peterbilt truck and forage harvester which took around 250 hours each to complete.

DeBoer finds it hard to pick a favorite but the one that really pulls his heartstrings is the scale 4020 cabbed tractor—which resembles the last full-sized piece of machinery he owned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2JpZGVuLWZhcm1lcnMtcmlnaHQtdG8tcmVwYWlyLTEuNjEwNTM5NNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42MTA1Mzk0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmers seeking 'right to repair' rules to fix their own tractors gain White House ally,"Grain farmer Cole Siegle didn't have time to waste when a combine his family was using to help with the harvest started acting up.

An onboard computer glitch was the problem — a quick fix with the right equipment.

Instead the Alberta farmer had to wait for a dealership technician to drive out to diagnose and reset the system. It was a five-minute job that idled the combine for two hours.

It was ""extremely"" frustrating he said of the incident from two years ago. In those couple hours he said the combine might have harvested the equivalent of roughly $20000 worth of canola.

It's situations like this behind wrangling over whether ""right-to-repair"" laws are needed to ensure farmers can fix their own machinery or whether they open the door to legalizing the kind of modifications the industry says would have implications for safety and privacy.

""I'm not going to rewrite the software"" Siegle said.

""I just want to be able to read these codes … and then [be] able to reset the computer so that I can actually use this half-million-dollar piece of equipment.

""I don't think that's asking too much.""

Biden weighs in

The right-to-repair issue has been around for years but the discussion has grown louder as more products — from smartphones to dishwashers to tractors — become increasingly sophisticated and integrated with computers.

Consumer advocates say these repairs can be difficult due to a lack of access to parts tools and information needed to actually complete the fix.

When it comes to farm equipment the issue took a leap in prominence last month after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to limit equipment manufacturers from restricting people's ability to use independent repair shops or do DIY repairs.

""Powerful equipment manufacturers — such as tractor manufacturers — use proprietary repair tools software and diagnostics to prevent third-parties from performing repairs"" read a White House statement provided to reporters last month.

The statement said such practices force farmers ""to pay dealer rates"" for repairs they can make themselves or that an independent repair shop could do for less.

Later in July the FTC voted to make right to repair a priority.

Right-to-repair movement gets boost after executive order from Biden Duration 5:51 Canada Tonight guest host Arti Pole speaks with Alice Henry from Share Reuse Repair Initiative in Vancouver about why consumers should have more ability to repair and alter the products they buy without going through the manufacturer.

Industry concerns over privacy safety innovation

In Canada some advocates hope if the U.S. makes legislative changes the benefits will ripple across the border. Others believe Biden's stance should ease concerns that if Canada passed its own reforms it would risk running afoul of bilateral trade deals.

""If the United States is on board to move in this direction anyway it makes that argument pretty much null and void"" said Bryan May who as a Liberal MP recently advanced a private member's bill that took aim at copyright laws related to right to repair.

But such issues are often complex and have been hotly debated with big tech like Apple and Microsoft among those pushing back against repair rules.

Representatives for farm equipment dealers have argued new regulation is unnecessary and have objected to efforts they say push beyond the right to repair equipment into software modification which they say has implications for privacy safety and industry innovation .

Leading tractor manufacturer John Deere said in a statement to Reuters last month that it ""does not support the right to modify embedded software due to risks associated with the safe operation of the equipment emissions compliance and engine performance.""

Industry groups also point to commitments made by two trade organizations representing North American equipment dealers and manufacturers to provide access to training and make diagnostic equipment tools and manuals available for farmers to purchase. They say these are also available to third-party repair shops.

John Schmeiser chief executive of the Western Equipment Dealers Association (WEDA) which represents more than 2000 North American equipment dealers said these commitments demonstrate that legislation isn't necessary.

""If the issue really is right to repair and if it is farmers that are concerned about not getting quick answers to an error code or not having the ability to fix their own equipment if that is really the concern those tools are now available to help our customers"" said Schmeiser from Calgary.

He said no one has taken away the farmers' right to fix their own equipment noting the success of equipment dealers depends on the success of farmers.

In a statement the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) a lobby group representing North American construction and farm equipment manufacturers said it has ""always supported"" the rights of farmers to repair their own equipment and that Biden's order doesn't change its commitments.

Canadian group wants legislation

But one Canadian farmers group said its members want to see regulation that ensures the industry lives up to those commitments. A representative called industry concerns about modification a ""deflection"" from the issues farmers face.

""Most producers feel they would be best served if there was some legislation"" said Geoff Backman business development and markets manager for the Alberta Wheat and Barley Commissions which represents about 17000 farmers across the province.

Anthony Rosborough a lawyer and right-to-repair advocate understands why farmers want to see legislation rather than rely on industry commitments which he said are really about allowing repair on the industry's terms.

He said it's also important that farmers be able to innovate as they've always done.

""Farmers need the freedom to not only develop their own ways of devising a solution but freedom to circulate and distribute and provide solutions to others.""

Equipment manufacturers and dealers say they've committed to making diagnostic equipment tools and manuals available for farmers to purchase as well as providing access to training. They say those same things are available to third-party repair shops. (Don Somers/CBC News)

In Ottawa May's private member's bill hit a dead end last Sunday with the federal election call but he said earlier this month he feels there's enough support to try again later.

He said his bill aimed to carve out a specific and limited allowance for consumers to bypass a technological protection measure (TPM) or digital locks without violating the Copyright Act — but only for diagnosis maintenance or repair.

Much of the responsibility for right to repair lies with provinces May said but he contends that the copyright issues his bill sought to address would have eliminated a major barrier for provinces to develop their own frameworks.

Larger discussion around right to repair

The right-to-repair issue is part of a larger discussion about consumers' right to repair more of the things they buy including smartphones  cameras and other sophisticated electronics.

But it's also been an issue for medical equipment mining and home-automation systems like the kind that turn off your lights or lock your doors via an app said Rosborough.

""Right to repair is about really trying to get some legal changes to allow for greater access to parts tools and information.""

Rosborough a part-time faculty member at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University said he's optimistic changes will come adding Biden's executive order provides some momentum even in Canada.

""But we still have to do our own heavy lifting"" he said. ""We're starting on that process now.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5jYXN0ZXJmYXJtaW5nLmNvbS9jb3VudHJ5LWxpZmUvYW50aXF1ZXMtYW5kLWhpc3RvcnkvZmluZ2VyLWxha2VzLWFudGlxdWUtcG93ZXItcHJlc2VydmVzLXZpbnRhZ2UtYW5kLWFudGlxdWUtdHJhY3RvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV80Mzg4NTE4YS0wZDViLTVmODAtYWJmNi00YzliMzc2YWE2ZWYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finger Lakes Antique Power Preserves Vintage and Antique Tractors,"It is difficult to mistake the distinctive sound of a vintage tractor firing up. In the Finger Lakes New York region at events like the Seneca County Fair the sounds of the lineup of antique iron on display is likely from a group called Finger Lakes Antique Power.

The group enjoys sharing their love of all “colors” of antique tractors. However this was not always the case. Sharon Alnutt the group’s secretary said that Finger Lakes Antique Power originated from the Two Cylinder Club which was interested in only John Deere tractors. The Two Cylinder Club traditionally gathered at the Ward O’Hara Agriculture & Country Living Museum in Auburn New York. Now the group includes 127 tractor enthusiasts from all over central New York.

Alnutt and her husband Robert Alnutt Sr. live in Montezuma New York and have been involved with the Finger Lakes Antique Power group since it began in 1999. Robert grew up on a 40-head dairy farm and currently works as a truck driver for Oakwood Dairy in Aurelius New York.

Joining an antique tractor club helps the couple feel reunited with the tractors of their youth. That is a common thread among club members — an early connection to small-scale farming and a desire to reconnect to the equipment that they used back then.

The Alnutts enjoy traveling — and usually incorporate tractor shows on their trips — and helping out the club when it is time to set up an exhibit.

“We’re committed to preserving the past for future generations to enjoy” Sharon Alnutt said of the club.

Not all members of the group own tractors but those who do can bring their pre-1965 tractors to display at events. It doesn’t matter if the tractors are completely restored or “in their work clothes” as the group describes their tractors which have not been restored.

“We have some tractors that are beautifully restored but all tractors are beautiful” Alnutt said.

The group holds no snobbery about whether a tractor has been meticulously restored or whether its original paint and accessories are preserved. Some tractors are only occasionally driven while others perform regularly. Seldom does a vintage car club attract such a variety of viewpoints on restoration and use. But for tractor collectors their fascination with vintage tractors is the focal point.

The club’s displays at events such as county fairs the New York Farm Show and Empire Farm Days help the public view and appreciate vintage tractors as well as the scale of the farms that used them.

“We have many people ask questions about different tractors” Alnutt said. “They may have a Ford and have a question about it. We don’t advertise that we will be there. People come to find us.”

Priceless Memories

During a show many passersby enjoy posing for photos in front of their favorite antique tractors reminiscing about their dad’s or granddad’s tractor. Or some may even recall driving the old tractor models themselves on the farm.

Some viewers wonder about how much a particular tractor may be worth. But that represents a tricky question to club members for many reasons.

“The value is what the person puts into it” Alnutt said. “The next person wants to know the price to put on theirs but it’s only what the next person will pay for it.”

A restoration is less expensive to complete if the owner can do at least some of the work him- or herself. While many owners can do or find someone to do the mechanical and wiring aspects of a restoration “there aren’t many who paint them” Alnutt said. “We have a tractor waiting to be painted but can’t find someone willing to do it.”

Robert restored their own 1956 Case Model VAH. Though the couple has sunk $3000 into restoration the value of a tractor partially depends upon what a buyer would offer for a tractor and the availability of the desired make and model.

The club also hosts Plow Days for members only which include demonstrations and wagon rides. The liability for these events causes the club to restrict rides to members though the club maintains insurance for the events.

Determining the value of tractors depends on a few different factors beyond rarity.

Some of the group’s members have been part of the club since its inception. Many others are older adults now and cannot climb aboard their tractors or haul them to events but they are always welcome to attend club events and help the organization in other ways.

In addition to membership dues the club’s support comes from raffles of toy wagons at their events. The club purchases the wagon and members donate items to fill it. Normally the group raffles two or three wagons per year and makes $1200 from the raffles but with the cancellation of events because of the COVID-19 pandemic the group has only one raffle for 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtuaWFrcmxzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL2tub3h2aWxsZS1tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWZ0ZXItdGhlZnQtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knoxville Man Arrested after Theft Investigation,"A warrant has been served on a Knoxville man who allegedly committed multiple felonies in Knoxville earlier this month in connection to a previously investigated incident.

The antique green tractor puttered alongside his wife Carol’s vegetable garden a reminder of all the years that have passed since Bill grew up on his family’s potato seed farm.

For Bill who has also kept antique potato seed cutters drills hay balers and other equipment living a life without farming was never something he considered even as a young man.

“I always wanted to farm. I never worked anywhere else except at the potato plant in Washburn one winter when I was young” Bill White said.

As the Whites approach their 50th wedding anniversary in November they have reflected on the family and work values that have remained consistent throughout their life on the farm.

Though both grew up in Wade Bill and Carol did not meet until 1968 when mutual friends introduced them. Bill was 24 and Carol was 23. They married in 1971 and one year later moved to the farm in Crouseville a section of Washburn that became White Farms Inc.

By then Bill had already been well accustomed to life on a farm. His father’s farm raised seed potatoes and Bill spent his childhood and adolescence learning the ways of the land. After Bill Sr. died in 1958 his son remained in high school but began farming with his brothers Milford and Eugene as soon as he graduated.

“I farmed with them until Milford retired in the ‘80s and Eugene who we called Sonny passed away in 1998” Bill White said.

Family has always been a part of White Farms which has grown potatoes oats barley and soybeans. Bill and Carol’s sons Matthew and Brock have worked full time on the farm their entire adult lives and live within walking distance of their own families.

As she watched her sons grow up and learn how to help their father in the fields Carol could sense that farming would become part of them too.

“It’s great to watch them. They’re doing a wonderful job” Carol said.

Throughout their five decades on the farm the Whites have seen agriculture in the Washburn area go through many changes. While modern equipment proves much easier to handle rising prices often make budgeting difficult for the few small family farms that are left.

They have also seen a steady decline in the number of high school students who work during the district’s fall harvest break.

“We still have at least three or four who will work here. Years ago when we picked potatoes by hand we used to have a lot more” Bill said.

Bill and Carol are longtime members of the Salmon Brook Historical Society in Washburn which focuses many of its tours on the region’s agricultural history.

With more Aroostook farms becoming corporate entities rather than remaining small family operations the couple want to help young people learn how important agriculture was to the region’s history.

“I would like to see more young people work on farms and know what it’s like to raise their own products” Bill said. “You learn to spend your money wisely work hard and be honest.”

“It’s the satisfaction of standing back and saying ‘I did this'” Carol said."

Evacuations have continued aboard military aircraft moving roughly 7000 U.S. citizens and personnel Special Immigrant Visa applicants and other at-risk individuals from Afghanistan to locations such as Ramstein Air Base in Germany and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

The latest mobilization means CRAF has now been activated for the third time since it was created after World War II. The CRAF was established in 1951 as an emergency authorization to use commercial and charter planes to augment airlift and resupply missions. It was previously used during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990 and again in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Defense Department and U.S. Transportation Command are the activating authority for CRAF. The airlines volunteer for the program which also involves the Department of Transportation.

But the wave of coronavirus infections linked to the Delta variant has somewhat clouded predictions about costs remaining high.

When it comes to travel consumer confidence is sagging. The marketing research firm Destination Analysts has been surveying 1200 Americans weekly about their travel sentiments since March 2020 and by Aug. 9 found optimism had crashed 40 percent since early June with only 20 percent of respondents feeling optimistic — a year-to-date low. The majority still believed road-tripping outdoor activities and dining out were safe but less than half considered flying visiting an indoor attraction like a museum or taking an Uber safe.

Fall has traditionally been the season when leisure travel slackens triggering lower shoulder season rates.

Biden Administration Congress Must Step In.,"Eighty-four percent of methane flares in Texas have no permits. Researchers say that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

This summer methane got a nickname that stuck. Climate scientists and policy analysts have been calling the greenhouse gas a “low-hanging fruit” for years but the term seems to have caught on more broadly among world leaders journalists and organizers due in part to a major United Nations report on methane and the most dire Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment issued yet.

Methane is the second greatest contributor to the climate emergency after carbon dioxide but unlike CO2 it only sticks around the atmosphere for about a decade. So cutting methane emissions drastically and immediately can have a sizable impact on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and thereby averting the most catastrophic impacts of climate change such as global food shortage.

In total the oil and gas industry is responsible for over one-third of methane emissions some of which occur through flaring and venting: the practice of burning off or releasing unwanted methane gas in the process of drilling pumping transporting and refining fossil fuels.

An August 19 report by Earthworks reveals that among the lowest of low-hanging fruits may be found in the Permian Basin in West Texas where up to 84 percent of producers are flaring without permits. Since fracking was commercialized a decade ago the Permian Basin has exploded as the top oil-producing region in the U.S.

The report outlines how state regulators charged with keeping tabs on flaring including the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) which issues flaring permits and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) which oversees air quality are doing nothing to stop producers observed to be dumping gas into the atmosphere. In other words the Permian Basin is even more of a climate bomb — and a potential site of climate intervention — than environmentalists may have originally thought.

Texas is the top flarer of all U.S. states according to federal data from 2019. But the practice is a problem far beyond the Lone Star State. A July study in Environmental Research Letters found that across the U.S. over half a million people live within three miles of a flare. Living near a flare is associated with 50 percent higher odds of premature birth. In addition to being a climate pollutant methane which seeps out of leaky flares is also the primary precursor to the asthma-causing pollutant ground-level ozone.

Methane emissions have slid under the rug for years — in part because the gas is invisible to the human eye but also because systems for monitoring emissions are less comprehensive and therefore more uncertain than for CO2. Sometimes incomplete flaring leads to black smoke that is visible also known as black carbon. But in recordings at oil and gas production sites without a special camera you can also see a lot of sky.

The increased use of optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras in recent years has made it possible to watch dark plumes of otherwise unseen pollutants escape from inactive-looking infrastructure like steel storage tanks and thin metal chimneys.

Sharon Wilson a senior field advocate for Earthworks and co-author of the report on unpermitted flaring is a certified optical gas imaging thermographer and has been busy capturing footage of oil and gas production sites around the U.S. since 2014.

It’s only when putting an OGI camera up to one’s face Wilson told Truthout that dark plumes of pollutants become visible turning landscapes into what look like war zones. “If people could see with their naked eye what I see with my lens there would never have been a fracking boom.”

According to the report many flares are left unlit which means they are seeping methane straight into the atmosphere rather than burning it which makes the release visible and at least converts the gas into less-potent carbon dioxide.

To assess flaring operations in the Permian Wilson and co-author Jack McDonald pulled from two data sets. One was generated from Environmental Defense Fund helicopter flyovers using OGI cameras from the sky to capture flares in January March and June of 2020. After ensuring the data was focused specifically on the area of the Permian Basin in Texas rather than in New Mexico the authors cross-referenced that data with permits logged in the RRC’s database.

If there was any overlap between a flare observed during flyovers and one for which a permit could be identified in the database over any period the authors gave the producer and regulators the benefit of the doubt and counted that site as permitted. But ultimately of the total 227 flares they ended up counting a mere 35 sites had permits to flare every time they were observed to be doing so. Many companies were found to be flaring without ever obtaining a permit including Diamondback Energy Conoco and Shell.

In Texas flaring permits are governed by a state administrative law known as Rule 32. Under the rule flaring is only legal for the first 10 days of a new oil and gas operation. After that the practice is illegal without a permit except for during 24-hour emergency periods. But the law does not clearly define what conditions oil and gas companies need to justify a permit or emergency exemption.

As such the operations that have received permits have essentially been rubber-stamped the report suggests. Operators have applied for and received permits to flare for a host of nebulous reasons such as “inconsistent curtailments” or “economic conditions.” Still the vast majority are unpermitted the report suggests.

Earthworks visited one site known as the “Seattle Slew” 14 times with an optical gas camera as is described in the report and detected pollution every time — nine of which involved flaring specifically. The owner of the site MDC has never been issued a permit from the RRC according to the analysis. Earthworks reported as much to the TCEQ.

According to correspondence Earthworks obtained via a public records request the state agency did reach out to the company about the findings. “There is no way to estimate how much gas was vented as we don’t measure our tank gas … since it isn’t sold to gas sales but instead sent to the combustor for incineration” MDC replied. “Also we don’t know for how long this gas was vented to the atmosphere.”

In spite of this response the state agency did not issue any violations Earthworks found. A TCEQ representative told Truthout that “compliance determinations were made based on a review of the completed questionnaires and other relevant data such as reported emission events and applicable permits or authorizations” noting that the facility did have a permit covering other emissions including volatile organic compounds nitrous oxide and carbon.

Wilson says she’s documented numerous similar instances in which she’s reported emissions violations on the ground such as at Diamondback’s Waler State Battery site which regulators have all but shrugged off.

In response to the report RRC Spokesperson Andrew Keese told Reuters “A short-term observation of a flare from a flyover and absence of an explicit exception does not necessarily mean the observed flaring is illegal.”

In July the RRC published data suggesting that the practice of flaring was declining across the state dropping from 2.29 percent of all natural gas produced in June 2019 to 0.65 percent in May 2021. “Texas is seeing significantly reduced flaring rates as a result of improved technologies infrastructure and regulatory processes” RRC Chair Christi Craddick said in a statement.

McDonald however said that dealings with the two state agencies do not offer much assurance. “From what we can tell this seems to be an issue broadly across Texas with just this kind of systemic lack of will to go and get these permits.”

Without closely monitoring releases or following up on violations the agency’s data is a moot point. “Even if they are right that exempt flaring is exclusively the cause of the flaring the RRC does not know how much flaring is happening” McDonald said. “That means they are dramatically underestimating the amount of flaring that’s actually happening in the state because they aren’t able to account for all those exempt flares.”

As Clean Energy Wire has reported oil and gas production in places like the Permian has expanded faster than infrastructure to transport it. Oil is still profitable but gas prices are so low that it’s cheaper to burn it on the spot or release it directly than to pay to send it to markets.

The report concludes with a handful of actions state lawmakers and regulators could take to bring protocols in line with the regulatory agencies’ purported missions including making all permitting data and enforcement actions publicly available online; updating Rule 32 such that it clearly identifies what justifications warrant a flaring permit or an emergency exemption; and creating an impartial panel free of oil and gas interests within the RRC to review all flaring permits.

But Wilson says real reform will also require action beyond state lines. “After over a decade it’s pretty clear that Texas has no intention of enforcing any rules” Wilson said noting lawmakers’ and regulators’ conflicts of interest. The RRC’s Craddick for instance owns land with her father — a state congressman — that generated over $100000 from natural gas production in 2019 according to The Texas Tribune.

The Biden administration is likely to unveil a new methane rule in September. In anticipation the RRC and TCEQ penned a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in July requesting minimal changes. “The TCEQ has a robust air permitting program. Air permits typically include fugitive monitoring programs and control of volatile organic compound emissions which could include methane emissions since methane is not separated from [volatile organic compounds] prior to atmospheric release” agency directors wrote. “Additional requirements to control and monitor methane specifically are burdensome to the regulated community duplicative and are therefore unnecessary.”

Given that the EPA delegates how states must implement Clean Air Act regulations Wilson says the moment warrants the strongest possible rule such as one that would lead to slashing oil and gas methane emissions 65 percent by 2025. “If Biden is serious about taking action on the climate the federal government will need to step in” she said. “What they give they can take away.”

Chelsea Hingston returned to her Tasmanian home after dropping her daughters at playgroup to find the doors wide open and debris scattered across her living room.

Chairs and pot plants were knocked over clothes and blankets damaged and books toys pieces of paper and piles of manure were strewn across the carpet.

But despite tearing the house apart the two intruders appropriately named SOB and Bandit refused to flee - and were instead found at the scene of the crime.

Chelsea Hingston returned from an outing to discover two cows had thrashed her Tasmanian home

Inside Ms Hingston found the family's two beloved pets had pushed their way through the back door.

'I was horrified and in denial' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I opened the front doors and called to them they just walked out.'

The mother-of-two said the fence to the cow's paddock was damaged the night before when a tree fell during a storm.

After chasing them back into their property she locked them in the backyard.

But when she left the house the mischievous duo decided to explore.

'My partner and I had only purchased the home in December so to say our hearts broke when we saw inside is an understatement' she said.

'We have bare concrete flooring whilst we wait to be able to get new flooring laid and lost a considerable amount of clothing plants and toys.'

Ms Hingston said the estimated damage of SOB and Bandits' escapade is more than $15000 which includes the cost of carpet repairs and replacing broken items.

Footage posted on TikTok shows Ms Hingston walking into the soiled house to discover the culprits standing sheepishly in the lounge room.

While SOB looks up at the camera sprung Bandit turns to avoid eye contact.

Despite the devastating financial toll Ms Hingston said the family was able to see the funny side of the bizarre situation.

'It’s hilarious now' she said.

'It’s just such an unheard of thing. We are working on getting a sign for the house saying ""home is where the herd is"".'

OnlyFans has brought in billions of dollars distributing pornography. The website which allowed sex workers to enter the so-called creator economy with its popular direct-to-consumer subscription platform did $2 billion in sales in 2020 and took a 20% cut of the action according to Bloomberg which first reported the news of the pivot away from porn.

Now OnlyFans plans to ban all videos featuring “sexually explicit conduct” starting Oct. 1. While the definition of sexually explicit content is still undefined (the company says some nude photos and videos will be allowed) hardcore porn on the platform seems unlikely to survive the new policy. It’s unclear if the new policy will make illegal content such as child pornography any easier to eliminate.

But the decision to remove OnlyFan’s most popular product was not a result of legal pressure according to the company. The decision was made in order “to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers” an OnlyFans spokesperson wrote by email.

The change marks a growing trend where financial services firms such as credit card and payment processors effectively decide what content is allowed or prohibited on internet platforms. For creators who depend on internet platforms for their income especially adult performers the sudden change represents a cautionary tale as the gatekeepers of the creator economy take shape.

Backpage and Pornhub fell first

Last year Visa and Mastercard cut ties with PornHub the online porn giant over allegations detailed by The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof that it didn’t aptly stop the spread of videos showing child abuse and non-consensual sex. PayPal had cut the site off the year before. After credit card companies cut ties the service turned to cryptocurrencies for transactions. Today PornHub users can only pay for exclusive content (similar to OnlyFans) with a direct bank account transaction or via cryptocurrency handled by the company Cosmo Payment. Something similar happened to Backpage an online classified ad business popular with sex workers which was cut off by credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in 2015 before being shut down by US authorities in 2018.

Adult performers claimed decisions like these don’t help abuse victims and further ostracize sex workers looking for legitimate platforms to make money. Alana Evans president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild (APAG) wrote on Aug. 20 that one of the “real reasons” that OnlyFans changed its tune was pressure from credit card company Mastercard. In the past Digital rights activists like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have claimed that payment companies are trying to police speech online while the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized PayPal and Venmo’s ban on sex work for endangering already vulnerable populations.

OnlyFans now faces similar allegations to those leveled against PornHub: A recent BBC investigation showed that OnlyFans gave repeated warnings to creators who posted illegal content but did not ban them on the first offense. So far Visa Mastercard and other credit card companies as well as the online payment processor Stripe which powers other creator platforms like Substack have maintained ties with OnlyFans.

But it was clear change was coming.

Mastercard announced a new policy directed at adult content due to take effect on October 15. Under the new rules adult sites taking Mastercard payments will need to prove the age and identity of anyone uploading or depicted in adult content conduct a pre-publication content review process and offer a robust complaint resolution and appeals process. “The ability to upload content to the internet has become easier than ever” the company stated in its announcement this April. “Now our requirements address the risks associated with this activity. And that starts with strong content control measures and clear unambiguous and documented consent.”

A Mastercard spokesperson said the company did not directly pressure OnlyFans to change policy and only found out about the decision through media coverage. “It’s a decision they came to themselves” said Seth Eisen a communications executive for Mastercard. Visa and Discover which are also payment partners of OnlyFans did not respond to a request for comment. Stripe which OnlyFans uses for payments to creators for non-adult content as Stripe explicitly bans pornography or other “obscene” content declined to comment.

OnlyFans later clarified that it would have been in compliance with the new Mastercard policies and instead blamed the banks for putting up unnecessary obstacles. OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely told the Financial Times that he would “absolutely” welcome porn back if banking policies changed. On OnlyFans creators upload videos of themselves or others and users can subscribe to creators’ pages with access to exclusive content for a fee (though some accounts are free).

Now the porn industry’s role in the creator economy which promised individual internet users can make a living by selling content directly to their fans is in jeopardy. OnlyFans briefly removed adult performers’ reliance on the industry’s gatekeepers but instead exposed their reliance on internet platforms and financial services companies.

This story was updated on Tuesday to clarify that Mastercard’s new policies were not the reason for OnlyFans’ decision according to the company.

The shifting sands have revealed sunken ships that we have never seen before. The high water has caused erosion forcing shoreline owners to erect seawalls along the beach. It also changed the minds of some folks who decided not to put up boat hoists on Saginaw Bay fearing they would never see their boat again if a fierce storm blew in.

However the high lake levels have also revealed a new abundance of small Petoskey stones in Saginaw Bay and other Great Lakes beaches where these were seldom seen before. These are mixed with the small pebbles and gravel at the water’s edge especially near new seawalls. This is a new development between Sleeper and Port Crescent State Parks in the beach areas. This phenomenon is occurring on other beaches besides the northwest shores of Lake Michigan.

Why Are Petoskey Stones Suddenly So Prevalent On Saginaw Bay?

Little Petoskey Stones Found Within Two Minutes On Our Beach

The truth is that the stones have always been in Saginaw Bay. Just they were buried by sand and silt. The high lake levels have moved some sand around to reveal gravel beds. However so has all the work erecting hundreds of sea walls along the shore. The net result is that these little fossilized wonders are seeing the light of day.

Erosion from high lake levels reveals hidden stones every 20 to 30 years. The beaches will be almost devoid of rocks when the water levels recede. But even today it’s easy to find them since the water reveals them as it rises. All you have to do is take a few steps into the water.

These are small stones. It is ideal for a quick polish and to make into jewelry or to place in a terrarium with tiny plants in their native state.

What is a Petoskey Stone?

A Petoskey stone is a rock and a fossil made up of Hexagonaria percarinata a fossilized rugose coral. It is commonly pebble-shaped. Glaciers ripped stones from the bedrock ground down their rough edges and deposited them in the northern portions of Michigan’s lower peninsula. As a result complete fossilized coral colony heads have been discovered in the parent rocks for the Petoskey stones in the same places of Michigan.

Petoskey stones are found in the Traverse Group’s Gravel Point Formation. They are coral reef remnants that were initially deposited during the Devonian period. The stone seems like an ordinary grey limestone when dry but when wet or polished with lapidary processes the mottled pattern of the six-sided coral fossils is revealed. These stones are used to make jewelry and other decorative items. Different types of fossilized coral such as the Cheboygan Stone are also prevalent in the northern Great Lakes.

Since these stones are so unique looking and only found in a few areas they are very popular with rock collectors. We’re very lucky to be in a state that has a ton of great places for rockhounding near you no matter where you are. However the ability for locals to find Petoskey Stones is another great example of what makes our state geology stand out. Once you fill up your collection there are so many other rocks and minerals you can find.

How to identify and clean your Petoskey Stones

Once you’ve found your Petoskey stones it’s important to know how to identify and clean them. Here are some tips to help you identify and clean your Petoskey stones:

1. Identify your stones

Petoskey stones are typically light-colored with a distinctive honeycomb pattern. To identify your stones look for the hexagonal cells that make up the pattern. You can also try shining a light on the stone to see if it has a fossilized coral pattern.

2. Clean your stones

To clean your Petoskey stones soak them in warm water for a few minutes to loosen any dirt or debris. Then use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the stones being careful not to damage the honeycomb pattern. Rinse the stones in clean water and dry them with a soft cloth.

Is it Illegal to Take Petoskey Stones?

Mlive discussed the question with a National Park Ranger. His suggestion was sound. Andrew Blake acting chief ranger at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Empire advised against rock hunting in national parks. Collecting anything within the park is prohibited and anyone caught doing so will face a hefty fine. “We mostly educate individuals and provide warnings but we do issue tickets on occasion” Blake explained. If you take any fossils or wood you will be fined at least $325. However in Michigan State Parks you are permitted to collect up to 25 pounds of rocks for each person.

Individuals may not take more than 25 pounds of rocks fossils or minerals per year from state parks recreation zones or the Great Lakes bottomlands in Michigan according to state law.

Tips and Tricks For Finding A Petoskey Stone

Find an uncrowded and somewhat rocky stretch of Saginaw Bay or Lake Huron beach. It’s perfectly fine and legal to wade in the shallow gravel area at the water’s edge. Bring a driver’s mask to see clearly in calm waters. It will make finding these little Petoskey stones a lot easier.

Take your time. After you find a few you will get better at recognizing the shape and color of the Petoskey stones and your eyes will soon get tuned into just looking for them.

When Is the Best Time of Year to Look For Petoskey Stones?

Because wave activity and winter ice have delivered new stones to the shores of Lake Huron spring is often the best time of year to find Petoskey stones. However going out in the rain or right after a storm might prove productive in finding the tiny rocks.

Map On Where to Find Petoskey Stones in Michigan

With the Great Lakes constantly changing the opportunity to seek and find Petoskey stones on just able any beach is potential. Based on newspapers and social media reports I created this map of the prime spots on where to find Petoskey stones in Michigan. (Also Charlevoix stones too.)

However some beach areas are well known for their ability to offer good quality large stones that you can collect polish and make into jewelry. Here are the top beaches that are good places to explore for Petoskey stones.

Petoskey Stone Hunting Near Charlevoix Michigan

In the Charlevoix area there are at least five beaches to explore. The first is Mt. McSauba Recreation Area. While it’s better known for its ski hill the proximity to Lake Michigan is one of the prime hunting grounds for Petoskey stone hunters.

Just north of Mt. McSauba is the North Point Nature Preserve. This is known as a quiet sanctuary away from tourist areas. Take a short rock hound hike in the woods and dunes right along the lake.

A short drive southwest of Charlevoix is Fishermen’s Island State Park. Situated on Bells Bay on Lake Michigan this lakeside park offers excellent Petoskey hunting opportunities.

In Charlevoix take a short walk to Michigan Beach Park. This is a great little beach where Charlevoix and Petoskey stones can be found. Lots of fun! It offers excellent scenery and picture-taking opportunities too.

Finally take a day trip by ferry out to Beaver Island if you are adventurous. You can take your car over or bring a bike and circle the island exploring the best spots for Petoskey stones. If you visit the Beaver Island Head Light take the stairs down to the beach and explore.

The Petoskey Stone’s Namesake Town is A Place to Hunt

Between the tourist towns of Petoskey and Harbor Springs is Petoskey State Park. The beach is a mile long and at the extreme eastern edge of Little Traverse Bay. This prevailing winds drive waves and opportunities to uncover Petoskey and Charlevoix stones.

Find Petoskey Stones on Lake Michgian Near Frankfort

Another prime Petoskey hunter location is a five-minute drive north of Frankfort Michigan. Again the Point Betsey Lighthouse Beach is a great place to pursue. Unfortunately the Lake Michigan water levels have severely eroded the beach. However this tends to turn up new Petoskey stones under the shifting sands.

Prime Petoskey Finding Near Manistee

Those hunting Petoskey’s further down the shore should stop at Orchard Beach State Park. The park is situated on a bluff that offers shaded campsites and a stairway down to the beach. One local tip is that the ridges at the park are a great spot to watch a sunset.

Other Petoskey Hunting Spots in Leelanau County

We previously mentioned that taking Petoskey Stones on the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore is a no-no. However the area has other beaches to explore too. One spot to visit for the day is Empire Beach. This offers million-dollar views of the Sleeping Bear dunes and a place to look for Petoskey’s

The other location is at the tip of the Leelanau Peninsula at Leelanau State Park. The park has been described as having breathtaking views with waves lapping on the stony pebble shore. Take a tour of the Grand Traverse Lighthouse for a few bucks.

Find Petoskey Stones Near the Scenic and Historic Fishtown

Fishtown in Leland

If you are in the area it is worth stopping at the famous Fishtown for a picture and an ice cream cone. Few people know it’s an excellent location to find Petoskey Stones. Just south of Fishtown is Thompson Street Beach. It is a rock hunter’s prime spot and a place to look for another collectible stone the Leland Blue.

Petoskey Stone FAQs

How Old Are Petoskey Stones? Both Petoskey and Charlevoix stones are prehistoric coral that dates back 350 million years to the Devonian Period. These stones are distinguished by their distinct exoskeleton structures. How Are Petoskey Stones Formed? Glaciation created the stones by picking up the stones from the bedrock grinding down their rough edges and depositing them in northern Michigan and Saginaw Bay on Michigan’s lower peninsula. Are Petoskey Stones Rare? Petoskey stones aren’t particularly rare they’re the state stone of Michigan but they can be hard to find. Since many people search for them popular beach areas tend to get picked clean of stones.

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzIxL3Nob3BwZXJzLXBpbmNoLXBlbm5pZXMtYXQtZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers pinch pennies at dollar store | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Kyle Dishman said he can't afford to shop at the grocery store anymore. Instead he goes to Dollar General where he can make $40 stretch into a week's worth of groceries and the occasional can of motor oil for his car.

He sticks with pasta frozen pizza and canned vegetables fully aware that ""any food you can buy for only $1 is not the greatest for you."" But Dishman said that prices have gone up so much that he's started rationing his food.

""When you only have a certain amount to spend it's like why not just go to the dollar store?"" he said.

A growing number of Americans are relying on dollar stores for everyday needs especially groceries as the coronavirus pandemic drags into its 18th month. Chains such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree are reporting blockbuster sales and profits and proliferating so quickly that some U.S. cities want to limit their growth. The 1650 dollar stores expected to open this year represent nearly half of all new national retail openings according to Coresight Research.

Foot traffic at the largest such chain Dollar General is up 32% from pre-pandemic levels according to Placer.ai which analyzes shopping patterns using location data from 30 million devices.

Analysts say the explosive rise of dollar stores is yet another example of how the pandemic has reshaped the economy and widened the gulf between the wealthiest and poorest Americans. Rising grocery prices -- inflation is up 5.4% from last year -- coupled with disproportionately high job losses among low-income workers have left many of the most vulnerable Americans in even worse shape.

""It's a striking disparity: In this country there is now dollar-store land and there is Whole Foods land"" said Stacy Mitchell co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance a nonprofit advocacy group. ""And if you live in Whole Foods land it's very hard for people to understand just how desperate circumstances are for the rest of the country.""

(Whole Foods is owned by Amazon whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Dollar stores which sell any number of name-brand items including snacks toys and holiday decor have been proliferating for years particularly in impoverished and rural areas where they are often the only major retailers. The pandemic though ushered an influx of new shoppers -- including many who previously had been able to buy in larger more cost-efficient quantities at big-box chains. But with smaller paychecks and rising prices they say it's no longer feasible to stock up elsewhere.

Executives at Dollar General say they began seeing a rise in new customers last March just as much of the country began shutting down because of the pandemic. Its newest shoppers tend to be younger have higher incomes and be more ethnically diverse according to spokeswoman Crystal Luce.

Dishman 29 who works at a Vans outlet store in West Carrollton Ohio said his hours were nearly halved during the pandemic from about 35 hours a week to 20. He's been picking up food-delivery gigs with Grub Hub but has had to do away with trips to Kroger where he used to spend about $150 every two weeks for his two-member household.

""Prices are going sky-high and my income is going in the opposite direction"" he said. ""That makes buying food even at the dollar store kind of rough.""

UBIQUITOUS STORES

There are more than 34000 dollar stores in the United States more than all Walmart Starbucks and McDonald's businesses combined. The two largest chains -- Dollar General and Dollar Tree which owns Family Dollar -- make up the vast majority of them with more than 32000 locations. Many are concentrated in lower-income areas and analysts say it's increasingly common to see three four and even five dollar stores within a few blocks of one another making it difficult for smaller chains and grocery stores which have thinner margins to compete.

The pandemic has accelerated the dominance of the country's largest retailers like Walmart Amazon Kroger and Target to the detriment of small and regional operations. That dynamic analysts say has been pronounced in small towns across the country. Major chains have been better positioned to handle supply-chain disruptions rising costs and labor shortages.

Growing income inequality economists say also has led to rising polarization among retailers. Discount chains and high-end retailers have in many cases fared much better than their midrange counterparts.

Dollar General which carries national brands such as Clorox Coca-Cola Hanes and Nestle keeps costs low by renting in inexpensive parts of town and keeping stores thinly staffed analysts said. The chain which last year posted $33.7 billion in sales also has tremendous buying power allowing it to keep prices within a few percentage points of Walmart's the world's largest retailer according to Anthony Chukumba an analyst at Loop Capital Markets.

""The formula for Dollar General is small conveniently located stores with a lot of name-brand items and very sharp pricing"" he said. ""In tough economic times we see folks trade down from grocery stores and convenience stores to dollar stores. With inflation pushing prices higher we're starting to see that phenomenon again.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZW5uZXNzZWFuLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kaWNrc29uLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvZXh0cmVtZS1mbG9vZHMtZGV2YXN0YXRlLW1pZGRsZS10ZW5uZXNzZWUtY2l0eS13YXZlcmx5LzgyMzMyNDIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tennessee flash flooding: Pictures from Waverly Humphreys County,"PHOTOS: Extreme flooding devastates Humphreys County

Also helping to underpin the greenback was a slight rise in U.S. Treasury yields. There were no major economic reports from the United States which helped drive down volume and volatility.

On Friday the USD/JPY settled at 109.791 up 0.010 or +0.01%.

When there aren’t a lot of worries in the market Dollar/Yen investors revert to the carry-trade i.e. they buy risky assets and sell the Japanese Yen after borrowing from Japanese banks at extremely low interest rates. That’s probably what we saw on Friday following a volatile trade throughout the week tied to Wednesday’s release of the Federal Reserve minutes and worries over the COVID surge.

The USD/JPY may have been supported on Friday as Wall Street rallied and Fed jitters waned. The major U.S. stock indexes closed sharply higher closing out a tumultuous week on easing concerns over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin tightening its dovish monetary policy sooner than expected.

Friday’s Dollar/Yen price action also reflected the mixed performance in U.S. Treasury markets. Yields moved sideways amid continued uncertainty about the spread of the delta variant and discussion from the Fed tapering bond purchases.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 1 basis point to 1.257%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped less than a basis point to 1.868%.

Although Treasury yields surprisingly ebbed lower all week the USD/JPY remained firm as the latest meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday showed that central bankers were planning to taper bond purchases before the end of the year.

In addition concerns about the spread of the delta variant continued to weigh on sentiment.

In economic news Japan’s core consumer prices narrowed their annual pace of declines for three straight months in July a sign global commodities inflation was offsetting some of the deflationary pressure from a pandemic-induced spending slump.

But analysts expect consumer inflation to stay well below levels seen in the United States and Europe as Japan’s decision on Tuesday to extend state of emergency curbs into mid-September is seen dealing a blow to already weak household spending.

Short-Term Outlook

We’re expecting more of the same choppy two-sided trading over the short-term as many of the major players take to the sidelines ahead of the central bankers’ summit at Jackson Hole Wyoming on August 26-28. Market participants will be awaiting insights into the Fed’s “taper talks” as many central bankers aim to move away from easy policy.

debbiepage.iredellfreenews@gmail.com

For several years Troutman leaders have sought to beautify its buildings with art and in July Town Council members jumped at the chance to partner with Pepsi and Randy’s BBQ to create unique murals celebrating the town.

Artist Joey Stewart Dill of Studio 73 in Statesville was hired to design the project in collaboration with Troutman staff and Pepsi. She spent roughly 125 hours painting and another 40 planning and designing the murals on the north and south sides of the building.

The large mural on the south side depicts a number of scenes including the Troutman Depot the ESC Park Pavilion Richardson Greenway Lake Norman and water sports the town’s welcome sign and the American flag and fireworks in a nod to the town’s annual Independence Day parade and festival.

Council members made suggestions of local landmarks to include said Dill. “We tried to keep it kind of nostalgic but also a little bit more modern too.”

The north side mural highlights a smaller throwback Mountain Dew ad from the 1960s featuring the old bootlegger with a jug with the “Yahoo – Drink Mountain Dew” slogan popular at that time.

Originally a mural was planned for the front as well but power lines and awnings prevented Dill’s lift from accessing the area to paint. After consulting with Pepsi who funded the entire project Dill said this mural was canceled due to safety concerns.

Instead Pepsi plans to put up some vintage metal signs or other artwork according to Dill.

Dill enjoyed folks stopping by to watch and chat as she worked. She’s also become a well-recognized celebrity around town getting lots of positive feedback for her mural work.

Randy and Robin Pittman owners of Randy’s BBQ were great to collaborate with on the project added Dill. “They’ve been a breeze to work with!”

ANOTHER MURAL IN THE WORKS

After temperatures cool probably in mid-September Dill will start on another mural on the south side of T-Town Jewelry and Pawn facing the Dollar General store. This mural will also be a Mountain Dew ad but with a more outdoorsy theme.

With the tagline “This is Dew Country” the mural will feature scenes of hunting fishing and nature. Dill is working on the design details now in preparation for the creation. She hopes her father and mentor Tommy Stewart will be able to join her on the project after he recovers from his recent illness.

THE PROCESS

When approaching a new mural project Dill begins by sketching out her ideas on an iPad on a high quality image of the area on which she will be painting. This technique helps her plan around obstacles like windows awnings pipes and receptacles.

Using Procreate software Dill pulls in images for the mural and digitally paints over the images in layers to try out colors and techniques. “That way if we need to make changes it’s so much easier. I don’t have to start over from scratch.”

“I can go in and remove a layer or take an element out and put another element in. Once all the changes have been made then I’ve got that final image to go from. I then grid it out.”

Prior to beginning a mural the background surface is prepared with a coat of primer and then a layer of high-quality paint. Dill next uses a projector at night to sketch out the project on the wall using an old school grid “just to make sure the layout is where I want it to be.”

During the day Dill uses the sketch lines to hand paint the design filling in details. She uses Golden mural paint which resists UV fading. With this paint and a protective coating Dill expects the mural to last 20 years before fading begins. “I think it will hold up really well.”

Because the exterior walls of Randy’s BBQ were painted with a glossy oil-based paint Dill had another challenge with this project. She decided to call in professionals to spray it with a special primer to seal the oil-based paint and create a chalky finish to which Dill’s water-based paints could properly adhere.

“Years ago that was not possible. We would have to have sandblasted the walls. Thankfully we had that!” said Dill.

After finishing the murals Dill has a clear coat applied to prevent fading and also to protect the murals from graffiti which can be removed from the clear coat layer without damaging the design underneath.

The new murals join previous town projects completed over the past few years. Previous town murals include the recreation of the original vintage Coca Cola and Dr. Pepper logos over Southern Treats in May of 2016 and a 10 foot by 30 foot Town of Troutman paddle logo mural on the side of the town’s building at 153 Wagner Street last fall.

BACKGROUND

Dill was born to be an artist sketching in her father’s business Tommy’s Sign Shop in Statesville from the age of four. Her father set up a desk with art supplies for her to use and proudly displayed her works on a large bulletin board in the shop.

She studied commercial art and advertising at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte but believes she learned most of her skills from her dad his artist friends and extensive practice and study on her own.

Dill is proud of her father’s artistic legacy in Statesville and around Troutman which includes signage on Randy’s BBQ Kat’s Patch the laundromat and Banner Drug.

“He’s been around a long long time doing signs. It’s kind of neat going into Troutman and being able to do stuff like that that will be around a long time just like his signs have been around a long time.”

Dill’s artistic work can be viewed in Smokin’ Southern Cantina Western Avenue Baptist Church and in many private residences. She also does many family and pet portraits as well as ceramics.

Instead he goes to Dollar General where he can make $40 stretch into a week's worth of groceries and the occasional can of motor oil for his car.

He sticks with pasta frozen pizza and canned vegetables fully aware that ""any food you can buy for only $1 is not the greatest for you."" But Dishman said that prices have gone up so much that he's started rationing his food.

""When you only have a certain amount to spend it's like why not just go to the dollar store?"" he said.

A growing number of Americans are relying on dollar stores for everyday needs especially groceries as the coronavirus pandemic drags into its 18th month. Chains such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree are reporting blockbuster sales and profits and proliferating so quickly that some U.S. cities want to limit their growth. The 1650 dollar stores expected to open this year represent nearly half of all new national retail openings according to Coresight Research.

Foot traffic at the largest such chain Dollar General is up 32% from pre-pandemic levels according to Placer.ai which analyzes shopping patterns using location data from 30 million devices.

Analysts say the explosive rise of dollar stores is yet another example of how the pandemic has reshaped the economy and widened the gulf between the wealthiest and poorest Americans. Rising grocery prices -- inflation is up 5.4% from last year -- coupled with disproportionately high job losses among low-income workers have left many of the most vulnerable Americans in even worse shape.

""It's a striking disparity: In this country there is now dollar-store land and there is Whole Foods land"" said Stacy Mitchell co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance a nonprofit advocacy group. ""And if you live in Whole Foods land it's very hard for people to understand just how desperate circumstances are for the rest of the country.""

(Whole Foods is owned by Amazon whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Dollar stores which sell any number of name-brand items including snacks toys and holiday decor have been proliferating for years particularly in impoverished and rural areas where they are often the only major retailers. The pandemic though ushered an influx of new shoppers -- including many who previously had been able to buy in larger more cost-efficient quantities at big-box chains. But with smaller paychecks and rising prices they say it's no longer feasible to stock up elsewhere.

Executives at Dollar General say they began seeing a rise in new customers last March just as much of the country began shutting down because of the pandemic. Its newest shoppers tend to be younger have higher incomes and be more ethnically diverse according to spokeswoman Crystal Luce.

Dishman 29 who works at a Vans outlet store in West Carrollton Ohio said his hours were nearly halved during the pandemic from about 35 hours a week to 20. He's been picking up food-delivery gigs with Grub Hub but has had to do away with trips to Kroger where he used to spend about $150 every two weeks for his two-member household.

""Prices are going sky-high and my income is going in the opposite direction"" he said. ""That makes buying food even at the dollar store kind of rough.""

UBIQUITOUS STORES

There are more than 34000 dollar stores in the United States more than all Walmart Starbucks and McDonald's businesses combined. The two largest chains -- Dollar General and Dollar Tree which owns Family Dollar -- make up the vast majority of them with more than 32000 locations. Many are concentrated in lower-income areas and analysts say it's increasingly common to see three four and even five dollar stores within a few blocks of one another making it difficult for smaller chains and grocery stores which have thinner margins to compete.

The pandemic has accelerated the dominance of the country's largest retailers like Walmart Amazon Kroger and Target to the detriment of small and regional operations. That dynamic analysts say has been pronounced in small towns across the country. Major chains have been better positioned to handle supply-chain disruptions rising costs and labor shortages.

Growing income inequality economists say also has led to rising polarization among retailers. Discount chains and high-end retailers have in many cases fared much better than their midrange counterparts.

Dollar General which carries national brands such as Clorox Coca-Cola Hanes and Nestle keeps costs low by renting in inexpensive parts of town and keeping stores thinly staffed analysts said. The chain which last year posted $33.7 billion in sales also has tremendous buying power allowing it to keep prices within a few percentage points of Walmart's the world's largest retailer according to Anthony Chukumba an analyst at Loop Capital Markets.

""The formula for Dollar General is small conveniently located stores with a lot of name-brand items and very sharp pricing"" he said. ""In tough economic times we see folks trade down from grocery stores and convenience stores to dollar stores. With inflation pushing prices higher we're starting to see that phenomenon again.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpbmdmaXNoZXJwcmVzcy5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL3BhcmtpbmctdmFyaWFuY2Utb2slRTIlODAlOTlkLWhlbm5lc3NleS1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parking variance OK'd for Hennessey dollar store,"The latest hurdle has been cleared for Hennessey to add another retail store. “We’d be their landlord” explained Alabama developer/builder Scott Delaney who asked for a variance to Hennessey’s parking space requirements.

Moving into Former Ruth's Location,"Reading Time: 2 minutes

Norman’s Hallmark is coming to Deptford NJ taking over the store location which most recently was Ruth’s Hallmark. Norman’s is a large regional chain of Hallmark Greeting Cards and Gift stores with dozens of store locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They are hiring now for Deptford and hoping for a late September opening.

This Norman’s Hallmark will be a full Gold Crown “Rewards” Store.

As mentioned Norman’s Hallmark will be moving into the recently closed Ruth’s Hallmark location close to Deptford’s Hobby Lobby and Party City stores.

Ruth’s Hallmark surprised everyone on February 20th with news they were closing all of their remaining stores the next day. They are not the only recent Hallmark franchise with multiple store closing and it seems competition from the internet and larger discount retailers are typically blamed but…

… Norman’s seems to be bucking the trend in the Greeting Card and Gift retail industry in a very good way as news searches on them turn up multiple stories over the last two years of new stores and store expansions! We see new stores planned for Reading PA an expansion in Bridgewater NJ a new location opened in Hamilton NJ

While Norman’s has it’s largest presence in Pennsylvania (including the Corporate office and Distribution center in Newtown PA) a 2011 NJ.com article informs us they started out in Trenton NJ… way back in 1939!

Norman’s Hallmark Deptford is Now Hiring

A loyal reader let us know about the store when she recently was in the shopping center… and in a quick search I see back on August 8ththe manager of the upcoming Deptford location posted the news in a Deptford town group that the store was coming… and they are hiring!

Carol Miller and Alex Mooney have displaced Rep. David McKinley as the wealthiest members of West Virginia’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation according to their 2020 personal finance disclosures filed earlier this month.

All three are Republicans. Miller 3rd District is tops with an estimated net worth of $75.21 million. Mooney 2nd District is second at $14.7 million. McKinley 1st District is third at $10.4 million.

As we reported last week Sen. Joe Manchin’s estimated 2020 net worth was $8.6 million and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s was $2.53 million.

As we stated last week The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probable range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

Here’s a look at each member of Congress.

Carol Miller

Miller has an asset range of $15186062 to $340390006. Her liabilities range from $4365006 to $200800004.

Using the formula that puts her range of worth at -$185613942 to $336025000. From that her estimated net worth comes to $75205529.

Members of Congress are required to report their own and their spouse’s assets. The bulk of Miller’s assets come from her husband’s (Matt Miller) ownership of five Dutch Miller auto dealerships all valued at more than $1 million. In addition he has ownership interest through MFM Realty of the five dealership properties with four of those valued at more than $1 million and one valued at $100001-$250000.

Open Secrets notes the challenge of estimating spousal assets valued at more than $1 million because House reporting rules don’t require a maximum range. For those assets Open Secrets sets a cap of $50 million for its formula and we used the same figure.

Out of curiosity we also calculated an estimated net worth by setting that cap at $5 million. Even with that lower cap Miller still comes in at the wealthiest of West Virginia’s five with an estimated net worth of $30.2 million.

Miller and her husband also hold a variety of stock assets. They have pharmaceutical stock: Abbott AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb CVS Health Johnson & Johnson McKesson Merck Pfizer and Viatris.

Their tech holdings include Apple Microsoft Cisco and Oracle.

Examples of other holdings are: Altria (tobacco products) Coca-Cola Dominion Energy Energizer (batteries) Hormel Foods (Spam) McDonald’s Yum! (KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut) and Proctor & Gamble.

Stock portfolios are subject to frequent trades and updates logged on Periodic Transaction Reports; the companies cited here and for the others are on their annual filings.

Miller’s liabilities include two mortgages a farm loan two loans for the dealerships and a business floor plan loan.

As we reported last week Manchin ranked 67th most wealthy for both houses of Congress in 2018 (the last year for which Open Secrets evaluated and ranked all 535 members) and 19th in the Senate. Capito was 169th and 46th respectively.

Miller wasn’t in the U.S. House in 2018 but plugging her current estimated net worth into the 2018 list would put her at 11th overall and ninth in the House.

Alex Mooney

Virtually all of Mooney’s worth stems from one asset: his wife’s (Grace Mooney) TIAA retirement annuity valued at $5000001-$25000000.

Mooney himself holds nine Maryland Supplemental Retirement Plan 401K funds. All but one of those are valued at $1001-$15000. The ninth is valued at $1-$1000.

His combined asset range is $5009011-$25136000. He reports one liability a home mortgage valued at $250001-$500000.

Using the formula Mooney’s range of worth is $4509011-$24885999. That puts his estimated net worth at $14697505.

In 2018 his wife’s retirement annuity wasn’t factored in and his estimated net worth was just $137005 ranking him 287th in the House and 360th overall.

David McKinley

In 2018 McKinley’s estimated net worth was $6739056 placing him second after Manchin and above Capito Mooney and then-Rep. Evan Jenkins. Jenkins now state Supreme Court chief justice ranked fourth among the five with an estimated net worth of $920023.

For all of Congress in 2018 McKinley ranked 82nd overall for net worth and 59th in the House.

For 2020 McKinley reported assets of $5016118-$15796000. He reported no liabilities.

His estimated net worth came to $10406059.

He and his wife Mary hold a broad array of assets. Stock holdings include Abbott Laboratories Apple Costco Dollar Tree Home Depot Intuit MasterCard Microsoft Starbucks Sysco (food distributor) Tractor Supply and UnitedHealth.

Many of their assets are packaged into IRA accounts and a Black Rock-managed set of exchange-traded funds called iShares.

They own a rental property in Wheeling worth $1000001-$5000000 and co-own with other family members 90 acres of Preston County timber land valued at $15001-$50000.

A new request for proposals for the tear down should be issued later this month or early next month Aiken Housing Authority CEO Chanosha Lawton said Aug. 11. A prior request was canceled in February because it “needed additional supporting documentation” she said.

A Department of Housing and Urban Development spokesperson corroborated the information Aug. 9. The spokesperson also said the department is uninvolved in the current process.

The outmoded public housing complex off Laurens Street is now a ghost town; windows and doors are boarded few cars dot the complex and some stoops are strewn with soiled clothes.

Everyone who lived at Hahn Village Lawton said has been successfully relocated. The authority coordinated with residents and families beginning last year the Aiken Standard previously reported. The coronavirus crisis complicated things.

Hahn Village could be fully demolished by early 2022 according to Lawton. The Aiken Housing Authority has already worked with the city and Dominion Energy to address stormwater and utilities among other loose ends.

HUD approved an application to demolish Hahn Village in 2019.

The neighborhood was built decades ago – and its age shows. At the time of construction air conditioning was considered a public-housing luxury according to Reggie Barner who previously led the housing authority. Hahn Village Barner warned in 2018 “never should have been built the way it was.”",,,

""Y’all keep asking us for a low carb option"" the pizza chain captioned their review video on Monday and credited Oliver Paterson (AKA El Burrito Monster) as its source for inspiration.

Paterson had created a watermelon pizza recipe in June that went viral on TikTok with more than 3.4 million views. However his recipe called for barbecue sauce and chorizo while Domino’s opted for tomato sauce and pepperoni slices.

LIZZO TRIES TIKTOK’S MUSTARD ON WATERMELON TREND: ‘I DON’T UNDERSTAND’

The pizza chain determined watermelon pizza ""might be acquired taste"" but Paterson told Fox News that the pizza chain might have a better experience following his recipe.

@dominosau Y’all keep asking us for a low carb option 😏🍕Nah fr when we saw @elburritomonster make a watermelon pizza we HAD to give it a go. ♬ original sound - Domino’s Australia

""I’ve seen people attempt to recreate it but get the key details wrong to make it work – the watermelon needs to be cooked before the toppings go on to remove as much moisture as possible to avoid a soggy mess"" Paterson wrote in an Instagram direct message. ""Also it’s very vital to use BBQ sauce rather than marinara/tomato. BBQ is already a tried and tested flavor combination with watermelon. Tomato (I haven’t tried myself but would assume) simply does not work so with these two errors it’s unsurprising they did not enjoy their recreation.""

11 WONDERFULLY CREATIVE WAYS TO SERVE WATERMELON THIS SUMMER

Paterson went on to add that he’s gone on to make his viral watermelon recipe for several people who have reportedly enjoyed the unconventional dish.

""It tastes sweet and smoky with fatty salty richness from the cheese and chorizo"" he shared when describing the flavor.

PIZZA IS THE 'MOST EXPENSIVE' IN THESE 9 STATES

Paterson said he felt inspired to try watermelon pizza after he saw a contestant on the Netflix cooking show ""Crazy Delicious"" win a round with their barbecue watermelon creation.

""The judges really liked it so I decided to recreate it myself"" he wrote to Fox News. ""It came out really great so I wanted to put my own twist on it and with the pineapple on pizza debate raging I decided to switch to watermelon as I don’t really like pineapple but then thought I would make watermelon the base for the pizza as it was just the right size for it.""

While Paterson knew his watermelon pizza recipe would likely elicit a strong reaction when he shared it on social media he said he’s still surprised at how many people it has reached.

If you thought Apple computers were expensive you haven’t seen what their manuals go for.

Boston-based RR Auction on Thursday sold an Apple II manual signed by the company’s late co-founder Steve Jobs for a whopping $787484.

The computer’s 196-page manual is signed and inscribed opposite the Table of Contents: “Julian Your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! steven jobs 1980.”

It’s also signed by Mike Markkula an early investor in Apple and the company’s second CEO.

The manual was signed while Jobs and Markkula were in the United Kingdom promoting Apple RR Auction said in a statement announcing the sale. The recipient was Julian Brewer the son of an entrepreneur who worked with Apple to distribute their products in the UK.

“I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests” Brewer said. “To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad so I feel the inscription was made with care.”

Launched in 1977 the Apple II was the company’s first successful product and is generally regarded as one of the first computers made for the mass market. The first computer spreadsheet VisiCalc was written for the Apple II in 1979 and expanded the computer’s popularity to the business market.

The manual detailed the Apple II's technical architecture and even featured a fold-out schematic of its main logic board. Courtesy RR Auction

“Whereas the Apple I was primarily for hobbyists with less than 200 units made the Apple II truly ‘changed the world’ by giving around 6 million homes and businesses their first taste of personal computing. Apple II’s revenues supported Apple’s successful floatation the biggest tech IPO of the time” RR Auction said.

Jim Irsay owner of the Indianapolis Colts placed the winning bid for the manual.

“When we think of the greatest most innovative minds of the past two centuries Steve Jobs must certainly be included among them” Irsay said in a statement provided to the auction house. “Jobs was a truly transformative figure who changed the way in which human beings think do business and interact on a daily basis.”

RR Auction also sold other items related to Jobs and Apple including a signed letter from Jobs in which he ironically states: “I’m afraid I don’t sign autographs.”

It sold for $479939.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmRvdy5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2Vlay10b2dldGhlci9zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS1jYXNlLXN0dWR5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sustainable Agriculture Case Study,"For long-term preservation of grains different mold inhibitor solutions can be used to protect them from microorganism degradation.

Dharmesh Thakkar owner of Dharmesh Foods said ""We're committed to securing a healthy and sustainable future for India. Our partnership with Dow P&SP and Vishakha allows us to use state-of-the-art recyclable barrier films which ensure better taste and increased shelf life. This is a significant breakthrough for the wheat industry which can offer our customers better quality of daily life as well as providing environmental benefits.""

The company claims that vacuum-packed flexible packaging increases the shelf life of wheat and avoids contamination. It sees Vishakha's barrier films as the best fit for this packaging need as it can extend shelf life reduce food wastage and is also recyclable.

Jigish Doshi CMD of Vishakha Polyfab said ""We at Vishakha always strive to contribute to the future of the country by developing sustainable solutions for agriculture renewable energy storage and in this case packaging materials that allow for longer shelf life.

Dow’s Retain Polymer Modifiers aims at enabling the efficient compatibilisation of two otherwise immiscible materials while maintaining critical value-added physical properties. It is specifically designed to compatibilise polyamide (nylon) and ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) into a continuous polyethylene matrix.

The company explains “This innovative technology is based on a reactive ultra-low viscosity compatibiliser. Reactive groups coat the polar components encapsulating them into micro-domains to enable excellent dispersion. When blended at specified ratios with pelletised barrier film recycle streams the Retain polymers allow recyclers to re-process used barrier films into conventional polyethylene-based recycle streams.”

Guest columnists

We are the Board of Directors of Ascension Florida and Gulf Coast which includes Ascension Sacred Heart in Pensacola Destin Panama City and Port St. Joe Ascension Providence in Mobile and Ascension St. Vincent’s in Jacksonville. We truly value and appreciate our associates and medical staff and we care about their safety therefore we wholeheartedly support Ascension’s decision that all associates and medical staff members must be vaccinated against COVID-19.

This decision is consistent with our mission and with the actions of an ever-increasing number of major healthcare systems nationwide which are also requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for all their employees.

Cases up:Santa Rosa COVID-19 cases are up 20.7% over last week Escambia increases by 13.6%

Monoclonal antibody treatment:Ascension Sacred Heart relaunches monoclonal antibody treatment for mild COVID-19 cases

The mission of Ascension is to serve all persons especially those who are poor and vulnerable. This mission also compels us to deliver responsible safe high quality and compassionate healthcare. Our associates share in this commitment to improve the health of those we serve.

In addition to all of the other safety and infection prevention practices that we’ve deployed consistent with CDC and OSHA guidelines Ascension’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement helps us to protect our associates and patients and to prevent the spread of the virus to others. In this way we honor the imperative to love our neighbor. As the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops reminds us “Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine ought to be understood as an act of charity toward the other members of our community…. In this way being vaccinated safely against COVID-19 should be considered an act of love of our neighbor and part of our moral responsibility for the common good.”

We strongly encourage all members of our community to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves their families their friends and their neighbors. COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly in our communities. Over 96% of patients being treated in our hospitals for COVID-19 are not vaccinated. Individuals who are vaccinated are much less likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 and require hospitalization. This has largely become a pandemic of the unvaccinated.

By getting vaccinated Ascension associates and all of our community members demonstrate solidarity with many businesses governmental agencies and institutions which have recognized that getting a vaccine is an important step towards ending this pandemic.

Protecting our associates and those we serve is a responsibility we do not take lightly. To demonstrate our commitment to this responsibility all of our Board members have been fully vaccinated. With reverence our Ascension St. Vincent’s Ascension Sacred Heart and Ascension Providence leaders associates and medical staff members have our collective support.

In the midst of a heavy road construction summer in northern Michigan DTE Energy has also been busy with two major gas line projects – one intended to add redundancy to DTE’s local gas line system the other a $3.5 billion effort to replace aging lines.

The first project the Traverse City Alpena Reinforcement Project (TCARP) will “increase the reliability of the DTE natural gas system serving Grand Traverse Benzie and Leelanau counties” per a statement from the company. DTE currently serves some 91000 customers across northern Michigan including 51000 in the Traverse City region. All those customers are reliant on a single natural gas supply source. TCARP is a multi-year expansion project that will bring redundancy to the region’s natural gas supply infrastructure to prevent a potentially catastrophic outage.

“We're going to add a separate natural gas supply source to the area to help ensure minimal customer disruptions during routine maintenance or in the unlikely event of emergency” says Kelly Fedele director of asset management and engineering for DTE Engineering Gas Operations. “We have one pipeline right now [in northern Michigan] and if somebody was to damage that pipeline the whole area would be without gas.”

The TCARP project is in its second year with recent work happening near the Interlochen Golf Course and along the US-31 right-of-way near Interlochen and Grawn. Phase 1 started last year and included pipeline installation from Paradise Township to Garfield Township. That piece was completed and placed into service as of January. Phase 2 currently underway will stretch from Blair Township to Inland Township in Benzie County and is expected to be completed by January. Ultimately the TCARP project will span 22 miles of new pipeline in six local townships.

“There’s different factors that go into [deciding where to add redundancy]” Fedele explains. “That could be the age of the system. It could be the diameter of the pipeline. A lot of it has to do with the potential outage that we could have if there was an issue. We reviewed [DTE’s northern Michigan distribution system] back in 2019 along with a lot of the counties and local municipal officials and also with the Michigan Public Service Commission. And looking at the fact that this was a single feed [of gas service] we just wanted to be very proactive and make sure that we mitigated that potential risk.”

The TCARP work dovetails with another series of projects DTE has going on in the region this summer called the Gas Renewal Program (GRP). Unlike TCARP which is specific to the northern Michigan GRP is a massive statewide gas infrastructure improvement effort that will upgrade gas mains service lines and gas meters. According to DTE the GRP program is an 18-year project that will cost $3.5 billion when all is said and done. The company has so far replaced more than 1000 miles of gas main throughout Michigan as part of the program.

GRP came to Traverse City earlier this year with work starting on gas lines near the Hagerty Center in the spring and moving east toward Peninsula Drive Bryant Park Eastern Avenue and several neighborhoods around Central High School. Those projects – including post-installation restoration of affected driveways sidewalks lawns and landscaping – should be completed in the next 4-6 weeks according to Fedele.

The key purpose of the GRP program is to trade out outdated gas lines with more reliable and environmentally friendly alternatives. Fedele says the affected gas lines in and around the Central High School area had been installed in the 1950s and 1960s and were mostly cast iron and steel. The replacement pipes are made from durable plastic and will “help reduce methane emissions” representing “a key component of the DTE Energy commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions across its electric and gas operations by 2050.”

Fedele says the GRP projects in Traverse City will also allow DTE to upgrade homes in the area that still have gas meters located inside the house. Pulling those meters outside she explains will improve customer experience – by eliminating situations where property owners have to let DTE technicians into their homes.

Locals can expect more GRP work in the area next year. In April and May of 2022 DTE is planning to execute similar gas line improvements along Barlow and Woodmere from South Airport to Carver. “This project will also impact the area between Carver Street and Boon Street from Woodmere all the way east toward the airport” Fedele says.

More information about all GRP projects is available via an interactive map on DTE’s website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9wdWJsaWMtaW50ZXJlc3QvMjAyMS8wOC93aGF0LWRvLXBpdGJ1bGwtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tYW5kLWFsdmluLWthbWFyYS1oYXZlLWluLWNvbW1vbi1uYXNjYXIuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vcHVibGljLWludGVyZXN0LzIwMjEvMDgvd2hhdC1kby1waXRidWxsLW1pY2hhZWwtam9yZGFuLWFuZC1hbHZpbi1rYW1hcmEtaGF2ZS1pbi1jb21tb24tbmFzY2FyLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What do Pitbull Michael Jordan and Alvin Kamara have in common? NASCAR.,"NASCAR’s TV ratings may not be anywhere close to its peak in the 2000s but its guest list – and investor list – is full of star power.

In the past year the following pop culture icons have dipped their toe in the sport:

Music icon Pitbull helped start a new NASCAR team called Trackhouse Racing with driver Daniel Suarez. In 2022 it’s buying out Chip Ganassi Racing and adding Ross Chastain to its driver lineup. Pitbull also co-authored a song with country music artists Trace Adkins and Luke Bryan called “Where the Country Girls At” in which Pitbull has a verse about NASCAR and the Daytona 500.

Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan started a new team with Denny Hamlin hiring Bubba Wallace to drive.

NFL Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith announced this week he’s starting an Xfinity Series team in 2022. Jesse Iwuji a black driver and U.S. Navy reserve officer will be his driver.

Current New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara became a NASCAR employee this summer as a “growth and engagement advisor.”

Rapper Post Malone made a music video for his song “Motley Crew” at a NASCAR track with Wallace and Hamlin making cameos in the video.

People across NASCAR welcome the new crop. The opportunity trickles down to the smallest levels of the sport like to Grass Lake driver Morgen Baird – who finished seventh in Friday’s ARCA race at Michigan International Speedway but needs sponsorship if he wants to race full time.

Being able to mention names like Jordan and Pitbull during meetings with companies could go a long way Baird said.

“I think it gives potential sponsors the opportunity to look at it and say ‘Alright if these guys are investing in it there’s got to be some sort of value in it’” Baird said.

The stars aren’t just contributing from a distance either. Both Pitbull and Jordan have attended a handful of races this season.

Pitbull also known as “Mr. Worldwide” can’t attend Sunday’s race at MIS because he has a concert in Chicago Sunday night – although he was at the Woodward Dream Cruise on Saturday. He had a concert at DTE Energy Music Theater in metro Detroit on Friday. His driver Suarez saw Pitbull in concert for the first time that night.

Having these big names at the track gives the sport more validity Rochester Hills driver Brad Keselowski said.

“They bring some global presence which I think is very healthy for our sport” Keselowski said. “We’re really I think in the midst of a major upswing. I think that’s case-in-point with the interest shown from some new and unique owners.”

Some of NASCAR’s biggest names have retired in recent years – like Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jeff Gordon Tony Stewart and Danica Patrick. NASCAR hopes to introduce casual fans to a new group of racing stars if the Jordans and Pitbulls can attract new eyes.

“Then it’s on us to make it a great experience when they come out so they want to keep coming” MIS President Rick Brenner said.

Why are these stars taking an interest?

NASCAR’s newfound pop culture popularity is largely the result of two factors – social justice efforts and a new more attractive business model.

After the murder of George Floyd last summer many American sports took a stand and made statements. NASCAR’s was one of the most notable banning the confederate flag at race tracks. It ruffled some feathers among the sport’s base which is largely white and from the Southeast.

While some confederate flag memorabilia made its way to MIS this weekend it’s unlike previous years when confederate flags flew proudly above a handful of motorhomes and RVs.

Wallace the only Black driver in the Cup Series also had a “Black Lives Matter” paint scheme at a 2020 race.

Athletes like Kamara took notice saying they never felt welcomed by NASCAR before because of the open acceptance for the flag. Kamara attended a race a few weeks later and fell in love with the sport.

It was the start of NASCAR shedding its perceived racist past. A few months later Jordan committed to a stake in the sport. And the momentum has continued.

“Michael Jordan was somebody I looked up to and I still apply his mentality not only when I play ball but in life” Pitbull said. “So to be able to be in a suite next to Michael Jordan ... I’m excited.”

The other big shift is the Next Gen car which replaces the current car in 2022. Instead of teams building each piece of their race car from the ground up vendors will manufacture the pieces for all and the teams will assemble the vehicles.

The goal is to save money and even the playing field between top teams and new teams.

“The Michael Jordans and the Pitbulls and the folks like that are in part attracted to the change that the Next Gen car brings to the entire business model of racing” said John Probst senior vice president of racing innovation with NASCAR.

The new car offers a reboot for everybody and makes it easier for new teams to form. Investors are taking notice – with a handful of teams sprouting up in the past 12 months.

NASCAR is loving the big names taking interest. And so far the big names are enjoying the NASCAR experience.

“As far as what’s been great about it let me tell you – the fans” Pitbull said. “To see the passion to see the loyalty to see the willingness to just run through a wall for the team that they love.”

While at the Daytona 500 Pitbull went to P.F. Chang’s. A fan jokingly came up to him saying he didn’t dress like a NASCAR owner.

“And I said yeah you’re right” Pitbull said. “I bought him a couple of shots and we started drinking and I said ‘Yeah but I do drink like a NASCAR owner.’”

They drank together and the fan covered Pitbull’s bill before he left – an unusual gesture that had a lasting impression on the music icon.

“Not too many people do those kinds of things” Pitbull said. “Especially in today’s day and age where it’s all about instant gratification – grab your photo grab your video do this for me do that for me.”

Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe has taken to Instagram to implore fans coming to see the band on their current tour with Megadeth Trivium and Hatebreed to “be vaccinated and wear a fucking mask.”

Blythe wrote yesterday (August 20):

“Tonight’s the 1st night of our tour with Megadeth Trivium & Hatebreed. Tour after tour is cancelling/rescheduling because someone tested positive for COVID w/some folks I personally know getting VERY sick. Therefore we are going to try our best to maintain #thebubble so we can get through this motherfucker (that means a strict NO GUESTS BACKSTAGE policy- ZERO exceptions so don’t bother asking me.) We will be wearing masks backstage not hanging out on other band’s buses etc. Welcome to the #NOFUNTOUR2021. These are weird times but as Hunter S. Thompson said: ‘When the going gets weird the weird turn pro.’

“BTW we don’t get sick days out here so spare me the ‘it’s just a bad flu’ crap. ‘A bad flu’ doesn’t work for a singer ok? I’m a healthy dude w/a strong immune system- in 25+ years I have cancelled precisely ONE show due to illness (food poisoning in Vegas- shitting & puking violently at the same time) & I don’t want to start now.

“On that note if you are coming out to a show if I were you I would A) be vaccinated & B) wear a fucking mask. These are outdoor shows & while science tells us that outdoor transmission is much less likely I would still go with better safe than sorry. If you think vaccines & masks are nonsense I have ZERO interest in arguing with you. Good luck to you & I mean that 100%- I wish illness on NO ONE.

“Before I got sober I cheerfully did: heroin cocaine crystal meth Oxycontin Xanax Percocet Vicodin LSD ecstasy barbiturates PCP mushrooms weed opium morphine fentanyl a bunch of other weird shit I had zero idea of what it was & of course- UNGODLY amounts of alcohol.

“Needless to say I am not scared of a vaccine.

“If you are on the fence wondering ‘Hmmm… should I bring a mask to the show?’ my advice is… YES. Will it be hot & uncomfortable? Probably. Is it doable? Definitely. If my old ass can fly screaming across the stage for over an hour with giant blasts of fire going off all around me you can wear a mask for a few hours to help protect yourself & others.

“PSA over. Have fun & stay safe y’all.”"

FERC Seeks Evidence in PJM TOs’ Bid to Rate-base Network Upgrades

(Photo courtesy of FGI)

“Stocks over sneakers” says the T-shirt neatly capturing the premise behind First Generation Investors (FGI). Three college students launched the nonprofit which uses real money to introduce high school kids from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to investing in the stock market in 2018.

FGI was founded by Dylan Ingerman along with his brother Alex and their friend Cole Mattox while attending the University of Pennsylvania. From a single location in Philadelphia and three kids FGI now has chapters in 25 schools with 30 more planned to open this fall. In addition to Penn these include Harvard Vanderbilt Middlebury Tulane and Duke as well as historically black colleges and universities like Morehouse and Spelman in Atlanta. Nearly 500 students are enrolled in or have completed the program.

“The reason it’s called First Generation Investors is because none of these kids’ parents have had the chance to learn what they’re learning” says Niso Nahmiyas who helped found an FGI chapter at Duke University in Durham N.C. The goal he says is to “stop the cycle of some people working hard and investing and others working just as hard but never having the opportunity to accumulate wealth.”

Last year there were 27 official “graduates” – students who finished the program and also completed high school – at which point they come into control of the investment account set up for them by FGI. That number jumped to 109 this year and should grow as the program expands. Based on this year’s FGI survey the demographic breakdown of participants is about 57% female 42% male 55% Black 22% Hispanic 11% white and 10% Asian/South Asian. The majority of these students are hoping to attend college including three who have been admitted to Harvard and wrote about FGI on their college applications.

Perhaps there’s never a “normal” time in the stock market but the last three years have been particularly eventful. There was the 2020 Covid crash a quick and massive economic contraction and in the wake of that the rise of meme stocks and digital currencies.

But the high school students in the FGI program don’t seem to get distracted by the occasional drama on Wall Street. The FGI curriculum includes a showing of what to this demographic must appear to be an ancient video featuring Fidelity’s Peter Lynch discussing market cycles and extolling the benefits of having and sticking to a long-term strategy. They discuss idiosyncratic versus systemic risk with idiosyncratic risk illustrated using the example of a 2018 Kylie Jenner tweet that knocked $1.6 billion off the market cap of messaging app Snap.

They provide a grounding in the basics of equity investing and the dynamics of the stock market. But what really seems to grab students’ attention is another concept at the core of the program: the idea of compounding – making money on money over time. And why not? After all these are 16- to 18-year-olds and they have a long run ahead of them.

Mortgages are boring

Cole and Dylan met during their freshman year at Penn. Both grew up in New Jersey within commuting distance of New York City and had been interested in markets since a young age. Both understood they had economic and social advantages not available to most people – parents who went to business school family members working on Wall Street. They thought there might be a way to use the markets to help address the challenges of income inequality and multi-generational wealth.

That led them first to the issue of financial literacy. After a visit to the Wharton Social Impact Center to review the literature there on financial literacy programs it became apparent that a lot of this didn’t work as well as it could says Cole. But what did seem to work was using real money to teach kids about investing. “We thought this [investing in the markets] would have a more immediate and tangible impact than trying to teach someone about mortgages when they’re 16 years old” says Dylan.

To that end FGI provides students with $100 in $20 increments over the last five weeks of the program. The money is held by FGI in a custodial account and the kids are given a menu of mutual funds and ETFs in which to invest. Once they complete the course and graduate high school they assume ownership of the account.

That the sums involved were dwarfed by the money changing hands around AMC or GameStop didn’t seem to matter that much. “I worried that given the small amount of money they might lose interest but they were mostly happy to just have a stake in the game” says Duke’s Niso. “Just asking the kids to think about this stuff sends them off in a new direction.”

Working initially with the three kids from Philadelphia’s Boys Latin Charter Dylan Cole and Alex began to sense they’d hit on something. “We saw that the program we had crafted was really ‘sticky’ – they all wanted to come back to learn more and ask questions. That was the lightbulb moment” says Cole.

From there they went on to develop a formal curriculum and adopted a “franchise” model for the program which would provide a higher level of autonomy to the chapters and make it easier to grow. They did an initial capital raise through GoFundMe bringing in $10000 in just two days in November 2020. “Every decision we made from early on was about scale” says Dylan.

Within a few months they added Fordham and Harvard. From there the interest has continued to snowball.

‘Squawk Box’ in the school hall

Brett Oslon teaches AP History and financial literacy at Motivation a Title One high school in West Philadelphia. (He also serves as a senior academic advisor to FGI.) He estimates that about a third of the student body there is made up of “first generation students” including a large contingent from African countries like Ethiopia and Liberia. He learned about FGI by chance one September Friday in 2019. He was alone in the school at the end of the day when the phone rang. On the other end was Blake Kernan a cold-calling student from Penn working with FGI asking to speak to the financial literacy teacher.

“Having taught in Philadelphia for 21 years I thought I’d heard everything but this was the first time I’d heard this pitch” says Oslon. “High school kids from impoverished areas are going to spend time with college kids talking about the stock market. And by the way they’re going to give your students $100 to invest. It sounded too good to be true.”

Intrigued Oslon asked around to see who if anyone might be interested. The following Saturday he delivered 25 students for the school’s first class. In those pre-Covid days the meetings took place in person on the Penn campus a few miles but a world away from Motivation. Oslon says at first his kids were a little intimidated. “There were some socio-economic differences. Some of our students had a preconceived notion about what a University of Pennsylvania kid looked like.” But ultimately it became a place for a “great exchange of ideas.”

“A lot of adults make the mistake of correlating poverty and intelligence” says Oslon. “We have very intelligent kids who given the opportunity will do well. Opportunity is the biggest piece of the puzzle for our students.”

Good grades were not a prerequisite for the class. We were looking for kids with a “spark” says Oslon. This is consistent with the program’s overall philosophy. “We don’t look at grades because we realize that the motivation for something like this isn’t tied to how they do in school” says Cole.

Oslon likes to tell the story of two students who were late to class one day talking in the hall. “Our principal was upset that they were late but when I spoke with them I found out they were having a Squawk Box-like conversation about the value of compounding” Oslon says. “One of them said something like ‘this compounding is insane.’ Both kids are in college now.

Of course students this age aren’t necessarily known for long-term planning. Professor Roberto Quercia who teaches a popular personal finance course at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggests incorporating a “holistic approach” would be useful if the goal of building intergenerational wealth is to be achieved. “Investing is an important part of this but not the only part” he says. Values – why you want money what you plan to do with it – matter too he says.

Harvard professor John Campbell who also teaches a financial literacy course takes a similar view. Using “real money is good” he says but should be part of a broader financial literacy program. “The concern with financial knowledge is right on point but there are many other financial decisions that people have to make that have nothing to do with the stock market but also contribute to wealth inequality.”

A big leap

This fall FGI is taking a big leap more than doubling in size. Of the founders Alex Ingerman has graduated; Dylan and Cole are both rising seniors busy laying the groundwork to support FGI once they're out of school. On Aug. 11 they announced a plan to raise an additional $500000 to support all this growth. By Aug. 17 they already had pledges for $100000. The money will be used to fund more portfolios and to bring on full and part-time staff.

Wall Street is starting to buy in. Global Endowment Management an asset management firm based in Charlotte N.C. recently stepped forward to fund the student portfolios for eight chapters for schools including Vanderbilt Notre Dame Wake Forest and North Carolina A&T.

Professor Quercia notes that successfully managing personal finances is “20% knowledge 80% habit.” To that end FGI is working to establish the saving and investment habit in students early on. The hope is these habits will persist even when the markets go south as they inevitably will. They understand that this is unlikely to solve wealth inequality on its own but believe every little bit helps. Here again the program founders are taking the long view defining success as “the accumulation of household wealth over time.”

It’s an ambitious goal. As Cole says “This is way bigger than a college project.”

Mike MacMillan is a writer living in Chapel Hill N.C. He is working on a book on innovative solutions to the retirement crisis and wealth inequality.

The company also had sought to improve water and sewerage pipes and add fire hydrants that would serve the camps.

On Aug. 10 company representatives sent an email to the commission asking to remove the plan from consideration.

“Please remove the above item that was tabled at the last meeting from further consideration"" the email reads. ""The owners are going to just continue leasing the property to the camp owners instead of selling them the land under their camps.”

The board voted unanimously to take the item off the table.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not on the interstate highway system or a major airport.

But Bloomfield Davis County’s seat in southern Iowa 11 miles from Iowa’s border with Missouri grew its population from 2640 in 2010 to 2682in 2020 new U.S. census data show.

“Even if people aren’t working here they’re living here” Tammy Roberts the town’s community development director said.

A handful of small Iowa towns like Bloomfield with populations of less than 5000 and not part of a larger metro area bucked the trend and grew their populations in the 2020 census data just released. These outliers come at a time when census data show Iowans increasingly living in urban areas. The growing small towns have one or more of the following working in their favor a four-month IowaWatch investigation revealed during visits to 58 towns of 5000 or fewer people:



Infrastructure such as high-speed internet local phone and cable decision makers basic amenities such as good streets and lighting and restored or replaced old buildings so that enough housing exists.

A local attraction that brings people into town to hear a story including the arts and other recreational outlets.

Creative businesses that attract out-of-town shoppers but also embrace a sense of community pride that leads to coordinated business and local philanthropy efforts.

Readily available health care.

Adequate day care options.

Strong local schools.

A sense of being safe.

Aggressive pursuit of community development grants.

Some of these efforts can be duplicated in other towns but success would not be guaranteed because each town has its own dynamics experts IowaWatch interviewed said.

“A lot of this stuff is so fuzzy it’s really difficult to tie it to one particular factor” Liesl Eathington Iowa State University economics researcher and the Iowa Community Indicators Program coordinator said.

“The bottom line is we can’t figure out really the magic recipe for growth.”

Population growth is not the exclusive measure of whether or not a small Iowa town is vital IowaWatch found.

The population in Audubon in western Iowa has dropped from 2382 in 2000 and 2176 in 2010 to 2053 in 2020. All of Audubon County only has 5674 residents down from 6119 in the 2010 census.

Yet Audubon opened a $2.6 million community center in November 2018 and already volunteers for the non-profit center are planning a $2 million expansion. Residents volunteer to show movies for $4 admission Fridays Saturdays and Sundays at the Rose Theater movie house. The town has farmers’ markets the annual T-Bone Festival and thriving businesses. Even Albert the Bull the huge statue greeting motorists from the south got attention with a recent $18000 renovation.

“I guess our common theme in the area is volunteers” Sara Slater Audubon County’s economic development and tourism director said.

Audubon is 75 to 80 minutes from the nearest metropolitan areas — Omaha-Council Bluffs and Des Moines — so sustaining itself is important. Denver meanwhile benefits in eastern Iowa by being near the Waterloo-Cedar Falls metro area where jobs exist.

Scott Krebsbach Denver

Denver’s 2020 censuscount was 1919 up from 1780 in 2010 and 1627 in 2000. “You graduate a class of 65 kids but you have an incoming class of 85 kids” Scott Krebsbach Denver community school district board president said.

Denver school district voters approved in March 2020 with 85% voting yes a $7.75 million bond issue for a new middle/high school addition to the district’s Cyclone Center arts and athletics facility. The Cyclone Center was built after a similar vote in 2016.

All of the district’s 52 seniors graduated in 2020 giving the high school a 100% graduation rate for the year. The class scored 82% in both reading and math proficiency the previous year when the students were juniors state Department of Education data show.

Bremer County where Denver is had a June unemployment rate of 3.7% while Black Hawk County where Waterloo is had a 5.2% unemployment rate in June Iowa Workforce Development data show.

What makes a small town successful? With Sara Slater Audubon IA

Analyzing a small town

Roberts said one of the smartest things Bloomfield’s business leaders did in recent years was a thorough needs assessment that included why those needs exist. Bloomfield Main Street the local business support organization got an $18000 grant from the Iowa Economic Development Authority’s Main Street Iowa program for the study which Main Street Iowa and Bloomfield Main Street conducted in 2018.

Tammy Roberts Bloomfield

They analyzed existing housing income and jobs. Making the exercise especially useful they dove head-on into weaknesses — deteriorating infrastructure like streets and sewers for example — along with strengths.

“It’s very holistic” Roberts who was Bloomfield Main Street’s director when the study was done said. “You’ve got to have that understanding of what your businesses think and what your communities think.”

That doesn’t mean total agreement. Mayor Dan Wiegand vetoed in 2018 moving forward with a streetscape project for which Bloomfield had more than $600000 in grants. The City Council vote approving the project was 3-2 but four votes were needed to override the veto.

Wiegand said in his veto message the timetable for completing the project was unattainable. The veto has those supporting the project hoping he is booted out of office this coming fall.

Wiegand said in an IowaWatch interview he hopes others see Bloomfield as a place they’d like to live in with close-by industry for jobs local health care and day care options and a good school system. “It’s just a safe community for people to live in” he said.

Dan Wiegand Bloomfield mayor

And it has local businesses that provide essentials including a grocery store shops restaurants and local utilities. The benefits of having goods in local businesses showed during the COVID-19 pandemic interviews in town revealed.

“Bloomfield has everything it needs to sustain itself” said Tori Ward a six-month Pathfinders Resource Conservation and Development contract employee originally from Memphis Missouri and working through September at Bloomfield Main Street. “That’s crazy to me.”

Towns like Belmond in Wright County are trying to replace old businesses. An Eaton Corp. engine valve manufacturing plant in Belmond that employed 1000 people in the early 1980s was down to 182 workers when it closed for good in 2020.

The company had been laying off people in phases over several years. Belmond City Manager Darrel Steven Carlyle said the Belmond Growth Alliance is working with Eaton and a Des Moines real estate broker to market the company’s building for potential reuse.

“We are doing a mass mailing to industries similar to Eaton who would have a use for the facility. And we’ve had some nibbles. So that’s encouraging” Carlyle said.

Belmond’s 2020 population count was 2463 up from 2376 in 2010 but down from 2560 in 2000 census data show.

Relying on a story

Having a story to tell helps a small town. Dyersville’s story was on full display the night of Aug. 12 when FOX Sports broadcast the first Field of Dreams Major League Baseball game from the tourist attraction just outside of town that became famous with the 1989 movie “Field of Dreams.”

“I just think we had a very good event. Just a lot of good will” Dyersville Mayor James Heavens who watched the New York Yankees-Chicago White Sox game in Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred’s box said.

“There’s something about the movie site and that movie that still strikes a nerve” Heavens said about the baseball field in a cornfield where the movie was filmed. The Aug. 12 game was played on a specially built ball field near the old movie set.

Dyersville — whose 2020 populationwas 4477 up from 4058 in 2010 and 4035 in 2000 — already had other attractions in northeast Iowa before the movie. Nicknamed the “The Farm Toy Capital of the World” it has the National Farm Toy Museum because of the famous Ertl farm toy company that is in town and now Ertl/TOMY.

The Basilica of St. Francis Xavier church on Third Street also draws tourists to Dyersville. The result of all this is a town that can count successes other than population growth Heavens said. The city is in good financial shape and moving forward he said.

“Having a story to tell helps but I think the other thing here is we really have an ability to execute plans” Heavens said. “Even as objective as I can be Dyersville is a very successful city.”

A little more than 100 miles south of Dyersville Kalona markets a history that includes artisans and local Mennonite and Amish residents who bring different religious customs but also unique businesses to the area. “A lot of folks are interested in that” Krista Hershberger assistant director of the Kalona Chamber of Commerce said. “It’s just such a different way of doing life.”

Ed Miller grew up in Kansas before moving to Kalona 45 years ago after marrying a woman from nearby Wayland. “I think it’s important to the people here to understand what their heritage is and to see it in displays” he said.

Miller whose great-great grandfather lived in Kalona in the 1860s before moving to Kansas volunteers at theKalona Historical Museum.

Kalona on the north edge of Washington County south of Iowa City has 2630 residents in the new census up from 2363 in 2010 and 2293 in 2000. It has the museum several festivals and downtown businesses that cater to people interested in specialty shops. “People like to come to Kalona because it’s a friendly community” Ronald Slechta publisher of the local newspaper said.

Being a half-hour drive from Iowa City the state’s fifth-largest city helps Kalona because of people in that metro area who take the short drive to Kalona for its offerings.

Lyle Muller / IowaWatch Riverside Iowa laid claim to being the future birthplace of the fictional starship captain James T. Kirk of the Star Trek series. It holds a Trek Fest at the end of each June. The town has a Star Trek museum.

Near Kalona the town of Riverside created its own story: the future birthplace of the fictional Star Trek starship captain James T. Kirk.

Civic leaders made the claim in 1985 for their summer community festival coining the nameTrek Fest after reading that Kirk would beborn in Iowa in the future. Paramount Pictures which owns the Star Trek film franchise accepted Riverside’s claim.

But Riverside whose population in 2020 grew to1060 from 993 in 2010 and 928 in 2000 also benefits from a nearby casino. The casino’s foundation provides grants for community betterment projects that include rebuilding streets and other infrastructure but also amenities tied to community aesthetics the arts recreation and education.

LeClaire at 4710 people in 2020 up from 3765 in 2010 and 2847 in 2000 has a story to tell as the home of Antique Archaeology where the national television show “American Pickers” originated. But the town also benefits from being near recreation and the Quad Cities in eastern Iowa. It hosts the annualTug Fest during which people in the Mississippi River town pull on a 2700-foot rope that spans the river in a contest with a team on the other side in Port Byron Illinois.

Other Iowa towns did not grow in the 2020 census despite having local attractions. Columbus Junction with a Tyson meat packing plant that provides jobs and a vibrant Latino community dropped in population to 1830 from 1899 in 2010 and 1900 in 2000. Meanwhile West Liberty with a similar story grew to 3858 in 2020 from 3736 in 2010 and 3332 in 2000.

McGregor population dropping to 742 in the 2020 census and neighboring Marquette population rising to 429 have the Mississippi River Pikes Peak State Park and Marquette’s casino. Nashua dropping to 1551 people has the nearby Little Brown Church made famous in song; Sac City population droppingto 2063 has the proclaimed largest popcorn ball; Elk Horn population dropping to 601 has the Museum of Danish America.

Away from a big city in western Iowa The Shrine of the Grotto of the Redemption draws people to the small town of West Bend. Started more than 100 years old it is the world’s largestmanmade grotto. West Bend’s population was close to steadyfor the first time in a while with 781 people for the 2020 census. The town’s populations were 785 in 2010 and 834 in 2000 but as many as 940 people as recently as 1980.

COVID-19 impact

Being self-sustaining was helpful during a 2020 business shutdown that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds ordered during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only essential businesses were allowed to remain open during the shutdown and small-town businesses that relied on relatively small customer bases felt the pain.

“We’ve lost out on money those few months that we were closed and we’ve lost out all the times we haven’t been doing dine-in” said Rob Arnold who owns Sugarpie Cafe and Bakery in Belmond with his wife Melissa Arnold. “But I’d rather not have people die – especially at the beginning of the pandemic before we got vaccinated.”

Belmond regained some population in 2020 with 2436 people. It had been dropping from 2376 in 2010 and 2560 in 2000.

Pat Kinney / IowaWatch Rob Arnold and his wife Melissa of Sugarpie Café & Bakery in downtown Belmond took advantage of the state-ordered pandemic closure of their dine-in business to renovate the inside of their establishment – and Rob took piano lessons to entertain guests once they reopened to dine-in traffic.

Linda Dawson owner of Snips of Thread Quilt Shop and The Yard Pantry in the southern Iowa town of Humeston tried going online with marginal success during the pandemic. “You have to be out and about to come to a small town and if that doesn’t happen OK now what does that mean?” she said.

Thriving businesses in a small Iowa town have to keep moving forward to engage people Dawson said. “People want to be connected. I don’t care who you are or where you drive” she said. “We might have to change how that happens.”

Humeston has been losing population from 495 in 2010 to the 2020 census count of 465. Still a group of business owners including Dawson bring customers to town by working together promoting each other and the small-town feel they provide.

Pat Kinney / IowaWatch John Luhring started Parkersburg Hardware and Garden Center in 2018. Deemed essential during the pandemic he helped other community businesses by buying and handing out gift cards.

That happened elsewhere. When a longtime Parkersburg hardware store closed after 45 years John Luhring whose parents run a monument company and whose brother is the city administrator put together a business plan and started his own hardware store in early 2018. Two years later the pandemic hit. The store remained open deemed an essential business during the pandemic.

“It ended up being a blessing” Luhring said. “We’ve seen an increase in sales; we’ve seen an increase in local customers coming in. And really it made people aware.

“I don’t know how many times I heard during the pandemic ‘We didn’t know you were here;’ ‘we haven’t had a chance to check you out.’ The pandemic really provided people an opportunity to check out local businesses.”

Parkersburg’s 2020 census count was 2015 up from 1870 in 2010 and 1889 in 2000.



State assistance

Iowa has doled out $300000 in Rural Innovation Grants each of the last two fiscal years to rural towns and counties to fund projects that local leaders hope put a spark in their towns. All but seven of the 34 cash awards handed out in the program’s first two years — fiscals 2020 and 2021 — went to towns with fewer than 5000 people and all went to towns of around 10000 or fewer state Department of Economic Development reports show.

The state funded projects like sound and lighting gear for a community theater technical training program for youth in St. Ansgar; design work for three housing developments in Manning; developing a rural grocery delivery system in Manning and Lenox; leadership training for Latino communities in Hampton Tama and Perry; and improvements to Chariton’s downtown square. Other projects focused on business development aesthetics and training as well.

Demand for the funding exceeds supply. While 22 applicants sought a total of $416395 from the state in fiscal 2020 for local innovation projects 64 sought $1.2 million in fiscal 2021 state reports show. That meant $3 in requests were rejected for every $1 approved. A new round of applications is being accepted for fiscal 2022 which began July 1.

Iowa established the Empower Rural Iowa Initiative for the Iowa Economic Development Authority in 2018 and later added the Center for Rural Revitalization for making rural grants. The state also has a Governor’s Empower Rural Iowa Initiative in a partnership with the Iowa Rural Development Council.

Empower Rural Iowa gives $10000 grants to towns to conduct rural housing assessments and in some cases demolish dilapidated homes. Leaders in small towns interviewed by IowaWatch said they face a housing shortage.

“We have some communities that haven’t had a new house built in 10 20 years” Liesl Seabert the Center for Rural Revitalization director said in an IowaWatch interview.

Ten of the 60 towns applying in fiscal 2020 and six of the eight applying in fiscal 2021 won grants. The towns work with the Iowa State University Extension Service to determine what kind of housing they need and how to deal with factors such as zoning and housing codes to make housing available.

“It’s much more action focused than to just produce a report that will stay on the shelf” Seabert said. “We know it’s not solving housing but we are helping.”

Empower Rural Iowa also has doled out more than $56 million — $50 million of that from Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act — in grants the past three years to build high-speed broadband in the state although plenty more work remains to be done state data show.

As much as $97.5 million is available this fiscal year in the broadband program. The state received 178 bids by the July 28 due date. An intent to award grants is scheduled for September.

The Empower Rural Iowa Task Force has made several recommendationsfor the program that include developing the next generation of local business owners and to continue state funding for the rural development programs.

Emily Clausen Ogden

Emily Clausen city administrator in Ogden said state rural economic development experts are working with that town on replacing a grocery store that burned down in November 2019 one year after new owners bought it.

She said state grants also have been used for other projects in town. “We’ve done (grants) for the new fire trucks playground equipment downtown street lights” Clausen said.

Ogden is losing people after gaining in 1980 through 2010. The 2020 census showed it with 2007 people down from 2044 in 2010 and 2023 in 2000. That hasn’t deterred Clausen. She said she and her daughter have bought the town’s flower shop and have gone into business together.

“I’m going to have a side gig” she said.

Man 20 killed in crash just hours before his wedding as fiancée pays tribute

A 20-year-old man was killed in a car crash hours before his own wedding with his grieving fiancee saying the 'best' day had been turned into the 'worst'.

Myles “Miley” Harty from Askeaton in Co Limerick Ireland died instantly when the car he was a front seat passenger in left the road and hit a pole the Irish Mirror reports.

A third man who was a back seat passenger in the silver Skoda hatchback was taken by ambulance from the scene to University Hospital Limerick with “non life-threatening” injuries.

Mr Harty was due to get married at St Munchin’s Church in Limerick City on Saturday afternoon but grieving loved ones were instead having to prepare for a funeral.

His heartbroken fiancée Kate Quilligan was being comforted by family and friends. She wrote in a tribute: ""I will love you forever"".

Hundreds gather at St Munchins Church this Saturday to release balloons to pay tribute to Miley Harty Askeaton who died a few hours earlier in a road crash. Mr Harty was due to marry Kate Quilligan from Thomondgate Limerick at the church this afternoon.

Others took to social media to pass on their sympathies to Ms Quilligan and pay tribute to Mr Harty.

“So sorry for your loss Kate Mylie R.I.P.” wrote one.

“My heart is broke for you Kate” said another.

“I’ve yet to witness sadder news I really can’t imagine what you are going through. Thinking of you your family and Miley’s family rest in peace Miley” another wrote.

“The driver of the vehicle (late teens) was arrested at the scene and conveyed to Henry Street Garda Station where he is currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.

“The road is currently closed and Forensic Collision Investigators are conducting a technical examination of the scene. Local diversions are in place.”

Mr Harty's family and friends released balloons outside the church.

Appealing for witnesses the spokesman said: “Gardaí are also appealing to any road users who were travelling on the R518 at Cragmore Askeaton at the time and who may have camera footage (including dash-cam) to make this footage available to Gardaí.”

And they have appealed to the company to place grills at the top of the tail-race at Askeaton to protect salmon smolt and eels on their journey to the sea. They also want a grill or barrier placed at the lower end so that adult salmon going upriver are not caught in the turbine or left floundering in the pond.

Ger Hayes secretary of the angling club said they believe that electricity generation should stop each year at the peak season for the salmon smolt May/June to give them maximum chance.

“This year they (Kingspan) agreed to that when we identified there was this fish kill” Mr Hayes said. “They gave their word they wouldn’t run the turbine until the salmon smolt run was finished in 2021.”

If fish stocks on the river are to be restored these measures are vital he argued. “This is the gateway for migratory fish species into the whole catchment area” he said.

In a statement from Kingspan a spokesman said the company “is aware of the concerns raised and we are working with Inland Fisheries Ireland”.

“The turbine is not in operation and will only be used when an agreed approach with IFI is finalised. Sustainability is a core pillar of Kingspan’s approach to business and we are committed to working with statutory bodies and relevant stakeholders to support the biodiversity of the river Deel and surrounding areas.”

Meanwhile the Deel Anglers which is an amalgamation of the Askeaton Angling Club and the Rathkeale Angling Club also wants the Office of Public Works to get involved in improving other aspects of the river.

The weirs Mr Hayes explained need to be re-examined and modified for ease of fish passage. They are particularly concerned about the weir above the tail-race. They are also adamant that water quality in the river needs to be addressed urgently and that incidences of raw sewerage entering the river need to be stopped.

The Inland Fisheries Board replying to questions put to them by the Limerick Leader acknowledged “the salmon run in the River Deel is significantly below the level that sustains a healthy population”.

“The Deel has a number of significant pressures including a series of weirs in the Askeaton area which negatively impact on the ability of fish to freely migrate” a spokeswoman said. “The weirs also damage the natural habitat of the river. Inland Fisheries Ireland has recently secured funding to examine options to improve fish passage at these weirs.”

The organisation the spokeswoman continued “Will work with the various stakeholders including Kingspan which operates the hydroelectric facility at Askeaton to identify potential improvements with the aim of restoring conditions on the River Deel to a more natural state.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbGl2ZS5jby56YS9tb3RvcmluZy9tb3RvcnNwb3J0LzIwMjEtMDgtMjItY2hhbXBpb25zLXRveW90YS1sZWFkLW9uZS10d28tYXQtd2V0LWxlLW1hbnMv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNsaXZlLmNvLnphL2FtcC9tb3RvcmluZy9tb3RvcnNwb3J0LzIwMjEtMDgtMjItY2hhbXBpb25zLXRveW90YS1sZWFkLW9uZS10d28tYXQtd2V0LWxlLW1hbnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Champions Toyota lead one-two at wet Le Mans,"Champions Toyota settled into a one-two lead in the Le Mans 24 Hours with a third of the distance gone after a wet start and plenty of spins and collisions around the slippery Sarthe circuit on Saturday.

The number seven Toyota GR010 hybrid Hypercar of Britain's Mike Conway Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez led the eight car through the night by nearly a minute and a half.

Conway had taken the first stint at the wheel leading the field from pole position after two extra formation laps behind the safety car at the start.

The number eight Toyota driven by Switzerland's Sebastien Buemi Japan's Kazuki Nakajima and New Zealander Brendon Hartley had an early spin after being shunted from behind by Frenchman Olivier Pla in the number 708 Glickenhaus.

Pla was handed a 10-second penalty for the collision with Buemi continuing after briefly stopping by the side of the track.

The number eight car has won the Le Mans overall title for the past three years.

Spaniard Fernando Alonso winner of two of those races and now back in Formula One with Renault-owned Alpine was watching as a spectator after earlier performing a demonstration lap in an F1 car.

Alpine's number 36 car ran second in the opening laps until Nicolas Lapierre spun at Indianapolis with the 709 Glickenhaus moving up before also spinning and opening the door for Portugal's Antonio Felix da Costa in the LMP2 JOTA entry.

The eight Toyota moved back into second place after 90 minutes and stayed there trading the lead with the seven at pit stops.

The 708 Glickenhau moved up to third overall when Matthieu Vaxiviere spun the Alpine into the gravel at the first Mulsanne chicane and had to be towed out.

The rain came back after six hours and the safety car was again deployed due to several accidents.

Germany's Sophia Floersch in the all-female Richard Mille car was taken to the medical centre for precautionary checks after the car was retired but was reported unhurt.

Two more safety car periods followed in the seventh hour.

The number seven Toyota with Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez teamed up with Conway has yet to win Le Mans after four poles from the last five races but is hoping to shrug off the jinx in the new Hypercar era.

The 61 cars in the 89th edition of the endurance race were flagged away by Ferrari chair John Elkann the official starter waving the French tricolour.

The race ends at 1400GMT on Sunday."

Even BTS-themed paper bags are a hot commodity among ARMYs. Here's what we know about this boy band's 2021 partnership with McDonald's.

McDonald’s has officially discontinued the 2021 BTS Meal. Still the products that accompanied this menu item are available for purchase via resale websites like eBay.

In fact the BTS Meal paper bags are still sold online including some used and “greasy” containers worth over $200.

McDonald’s released ‘The BTS Meal’ in May 2021

From Louis Vuitton to Samsung BTS often partners with large brands. In 2021 that meant a collaboration with the fast-food chain McDonald’s. As one of the largest chain restaurants this K-pop group brought the “BTS Meal” to fans across the globe.

The specifics of this meal varied based on location but generally speaking the BTS McDonald’s meal was the same for ARMYs regardless of geographical location. This meal included 10 or 9-piece Chicken McNuggets medium fries a medium drink and two dipping sauces.

Those sauces Sweet Chili and Cajun were new to customers in the United States and came with pink and purple packaging. This collaboration came with exclusively pictures and videos including the Behind the Sauce: Making of Film posted to YouTube during June.

McDonald’s employees wore BTS-inspired uniforms. There were also BTS x McDonald’s bags that came with the meal with ARMYs transforming them into phone cases and wall art.

As a result fans were selling these containers (and some packaging available in select countries) on platforms like eBay some going for hundreds of dollars.

Fans can buy the BTS Meal bags via eBay

In the United States BTS-specific Chicken McNugget containers and cups were not available. The McDonald’s bags dotted with the BTS logo and purple hues did come with meals at select locations.

Even weeks after McDonald’s discontinued the BTS Meal the paper bags are still available for purchase on platforms like eBay. Some fans sell them for as little as $0.99 while others sell used bags for as much as $200.

The sauces available exclusively with the BTS Meal are also available for resale via eBay with some fans selling cases of flavors like Sweet Chili and Cajun. As a limited-time offer these sauces are fairly rare and can cost about $20 for a set.

BTS x McDonald’s merchandise is still available for purchase

In addition to the two new sauces BTS released original merchandise in conjunction with their McDonald’s partnership. Thanks to a fictitious phone call between Jin and the fast-food company these products even came with photocards.

These t-shirts bags and crewnecks were only sold through the Weverse Shop as a limited-time offer. Later the K-pop group created the BTS X McDonald’s Collaboration Merch: Melting Collection sold exclusively through this website.

However some “Crew T-Shirts” worn by the actual McDonald’s employees while the BTS Meal was sold are available through eBay. As of August 2021 prices ranging from $7.99 to $99.95 depending on the seller.

The pictures bought from a seller in America were taken by an architect who enjoyed travelling and visited the Hill House now owned by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) in the 1970s.

Conservationists said the images will help them create a visual timeline of decorative alterations made by previous owners such as the ceiling in the drawing room which was plum coloured for several decades.

Miss Egbers told the PA news agency: ""I stumbled across the slides online and thought 'those are brilliant'.

""From the advert I saw they were not really images that I'd seen before and I thought those will be great for the house to have and also for the conservation project.""

The seller had bought the slides from an architect's estate sale.

The architect's wife had told the seller that in the 1970s her husband who enjoyed photography spent lots of time travelling around famous places including Hill House.

Miss Egbers added: ""We are so lucky he took the photos. It's not very often that you get a set of 30 slides and it's nice because they are so personal you do get a completely different view of the property than you would if it had been a professional because they are just somebody's holiday snaps of the property.

""And that's the reason I was keen to get them because I knew that they'd be angles that aren't necessarily repeated by professional people who come to the house.

""That's why I was really keen to see them because it had that kind of personal view of the house.""

Miss Egberts said it was ""very exciting"" to find the slides which were bought for around £30 in the eBay sale.

The Hill House was designed and built by Mackintosh for publisher Walter Blackie between 1902 and 1904.

The slides show how one alteration brought in by the Blackie family in 1912 was still in place in the mid 1970s.

In 1912 the Blackie family asked Mackintosh to return to the property to alter the drawing room ceiling from white to dark plum and it remained that colour until NTS took over the care of the property in 1982 and restored the rooms to how they looked in 1904.

Miss Egbers said the photos showed that fireplaces in the house were still being used.

She said: ""I thought it was quite beautiful to see the drawing room with the dark ceiling which is also quite unusual to see along with the fireplace being on.

""I thought that was really really interesting I'd not seen a photo with the fireplace on before so that was my favourite one.""

The house was sold to Thomas Campbell Lawson in 1953 and was then cared for by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland from 1971 until NTS took it over.

There are also slides of rooms such as the white bedroom showing how little it has changed over the years the library and hallway as well as several exterior shots.

Miss Egbers said the slides will be scanned and uploaded to the archive to help piece together more about the story of the house.

The house is currently protected by a giant ""box"" built to protect its saturated walls from further damage from the elements."

The collection is rich in analog electronics used during the classic 1960s and ’70s era of rock and roll but it spans from the early genesis of synthesizers in the 1930s to the late 1980s when the market began to be dominated by digital keyboards and computer software.

Emma Lee / WHYY The Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project is hounsed in a former food distribution warehouse in Harleysville Pa.

This is the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project or EMEAPP. By design there is not a computer anywhere in the building aside from a few rare digital prototypes from the early 1980s.

“The general energy of the world tends these days toward a homogenizing energy” said Wouter De Backer also known as the musician Gotye who sits on EMEAPP’s advisory board. “There’s been all these fantastic things that have come from the democratization and miniaturization and economization of electronics but over the years that has made us blind to the fact that there’s this homogenizing pull.”

De Backer disrupted that perceived homogenization of pop music in his hit 2011 song “Somebody That I Used To Know” by using a xylophone to carry the melody with a sample from a 1967 Latin jazz nylon-string guitar mixed with an African drum.

Vintage analog synthesizers often cast into the dustbin of musical history have what he calls “dormant potential.”

Emma Lee / WHYY Devices from synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla are part of the displayed collection at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

“I felt over the years that instruments that are more untapped that still have a dormant potential have so much possibility for adding to the richness and diversity of a culture” De Backer said.

EMEAPP has 30000 square feet of dormant potential. The former wholesale food warehouse in Montgomery County is stacked floor-to-ceiling with old technology. Each piece tells a story.

“Here’s a Sennheiser Vocoder that belonged to Kraftwerk” said executive director Drew Raison gesturing to a rack-mounted box with 50 knobs and about 30 cable ports.

Emma Lee / WHYY The collection at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa. reaches back to the earliest efforts at synthesized music.

Nearby is a cluster of electric organs. “That Hammond B-3 used to belong to John Entwhistle of The Who” he said.

Around the corner is the organ Rick Wakeman of the band Yes used to record the hit song “Roundabout” and the Marshall amp Lindsay Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac used to record the album “Rumours.” Around another corner is the amp system Led Zeppelin used on its 1969 American tour and the portable mixing board Neil Young likely used to record “The Needle and the Damage Done” for his 1972 album “Harvest.”

“That’s the wah-wah Jimi Hendrix used at Woodstock” said Raison pointing to a guitar pedal on a high shelf. “I’m going to say that again: That’s the pedal Jimi Hendrix used at Woodstock.”

Raison cannot give a number to the amount of gear in EMEAPP’s collection. His best guess is 2000 or 3000 objects including early Ondioline electronic synthesizers from the 1940s and one of the world’s first digital synthesizers the Con Brio ADS 100 used to make the soundtrack for “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn” in 1982.

The pièce de résistance is the enormous Moog system that Keith Emerson hauled around the world several times while touring with Emerson Lake and Palmer from the 1970s through the 2000s.

“You’re looking at the Keith Emerson world here” Raison said of the recording studio built inside the warehouse.

The centerpiece is Emerson’s monolithic Moog standing about 10 feet high with a dizzying number of knobs and patching cables. Next to it is a smaller Hammond L100 organ Emerson liked to abuse on stage. It has two daggers stuck into the keyboard its wooden body repaired with steel mending plates.

Emma Lee / WHYY Keith Emerson's Moog synthesizer is set up as he had it for stage performances in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

Emerson a rock showman would sometimes stab the keys with daggers to hold them down while he moved to another keyboard. He destroyed a lot of L100s over his career. This particular L100 caught fire onstage during a show in Boston in 1997.

“Basically the L100 is your grandmother’s organ from the living room and he beat the living daylights out of them” explained Raison. “Keith ate the L100 for dinner. He would throw them around the stage pull it on top of himself play upside down stand on top of it and rock it.”

EMEAPP started four years ago as the nonprofit foundation stewarding the collection that its founder Vince Pupillo has been amassing for 20 years. The organization keeps the equipment in working condition as much as possible and uses them for educational programs including group tours and the occasional loan to an exhibition. Some pieces were recently part of “Play It Loud” a 2019 exhibition of rock gear by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Pupillo started collecting the pieces because these were the kinds of instruments he played as a young musician in the 1960s and ’70s.

“When I was in high school and in college I always had a band and I always played” Pupillo said. “But when disco came along it took the joy away from playing rock and roll.”

Emma Lee / WHYY A mixing board used by Neil Young is on display at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa. Executive Director Drew Raison is working to establish that it was used to record ''The Needle and the Damage Done.''

He quit playing around 1978 and sold his Minimoog his Fender Rhodes keyboard and his Hohner clavinet to focus on raising a family and building a company. He eventually became successful in the salad business.

Around 2002 Pupillo wanted to get his hands on those old instruments again with their “warmer” tones.

“Every time I hear those instruments it just makes you feel like butter” he said.

Once he had the keyboards from his youth back in hand Pupillo started acquiring more as his interest in the history of the technology deepened.

Pupillo became known to collectors and musicians as the guy who would buy instruments that otherwise might be thrown away. Around 2016 he was approached by the Audities Foundation a Calgary-based vintage recording studio to see if he would be interested in five Minimoog prototypes the handmade portable synthesizers Robert Moog’s company made while developing the product for the retail market. The Minimoog became the first synthesizer an average musician could buy off the shelf revolutionizing electronic music.

Pupillo thinks that the Minimoog was essential to the development of popular electronic music and that these prototypes as the objects on which concepts of analog sound technology were being worked out had huge historical importance.

Emma Lee / WHYY The daggers that Keith Emerson used to hold notes on his Hammond L100 organ are left in place in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

EMEAPP was created in 2017 as a mission-driven nonprofit to preserve and maintain the invention engineering and culture of early electronic equipment and tell the stories behind the gear.

“I did whatever I had to do to get those instruments under one roof and preserved” said Pupillo. “A lot of musicians and folks in the music industry they want to preserve their legacy and they see what we’re doing.”

De Backer/Gotye saw that EMEAPP coincided with his personal interest in antique electronics. In 2015 he started a partnership with the pioneering electronic musician Jean-Jacques Perrey who in the 1950s was a virtuoso of the Ondioline an early synthesizer that allowed the players to create vibrato on the keyboard.

“It had this incredibly boisterous hyperactive almost kind of infectious joy about it” said De Backer. “Other parts of his music have a real romanticism a wistfulness about them and he manages to coax those poles of expression out of the Ondioline.”

De Backer had organized an Ondioline ensemble and planned a concert in New York with Perrey. However Perrey died at age 87 in Switzerland before that performance could happen. De Backer started a label Forgotten Futures to reissue Perrey’s electronic Ondioline recordings from six decades earlier.

Emma Lee / WHYY Vince Pupillo Jr. tweaks the settings on Keith Emerson's Moog synthesizer in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

“There are really wonderful human stories behind those instruments” said De Backer. “They’re often so surprising and unlikely that they feel like an antidote to what feels like the same narratives we hear again and again in the culture.”

The pandemic hit EMEAPP hard immediately canceling all school tours and events around the collection. Nevertheless it is still acquiring and maintaining equipment. Recently it received a grant to finish construction of a new control room for its recording studio which will allow musicians to tease fresh sounds out of the old equipment.

The first two Alice games are cult classics aesthetically driven action platformers that riff on the Alice in Wonderland stories in very dark very end-of-the-90s ways.

Either way McGee has finished his script pitch concept whatever you want to call it and has released it into the world. You can read the whole thing over on American McGee's Patreon.

""The narrative contained within is still very much a Work In Progress"" says McGee in the post. Part of his process here is asking for feedback from series fans. ""The polishing phase for those things will come next as part of the Crowd Design process"" McGee said ""And keep in mind that this content is not an exhaustive collection of everything we imagine will be in the game - but the minimum amount required to convey the main story.""

American McGee has been working on the script and concept since at least 2017 though he has always been clear that he has no power over the future of the series: That's owned by Electronic Arts.

What you are seeing here is a variety of things.

Firstly it’s Dmitry Mazurkevich’s creative look into a possible second evolution of a Lancia Delta Group B rally car. Secondly it showcases the amazing power and realism of CGI and at the same time – the third point here – the immense possibilities that modern computer-aided design unlocks.

It fills me with joy that we are currently experiencing somewhat of a rebirth in coachwork customs. Aside from the fact that companies like McLaren and Lamborghini have been capitalizing on the practice of re-dressing halo cars into limited edition design studies it’s the smaller outfits that I’m really talking about here.

Fittingly Automobili Amos and their Delta Futurista comes to mind as does the MAT Stratos and the Kimera EVO37.

It’s because of CAD and CGI that companies like these are able to speed up the R&D and engineering process and then rapid prototype to test out and sign off for final low-volume production. It’s a far cry from the days where a bodywork specialist would take his array of hammers and dollies and an English wheel in order to re-skin a sports car working on it for nine months or more.

What we are able to do in today’s world visualize a car virtually and then 3D print it at scale before going to final production is bringing about a new era of creativity and personalization.

Which brings us to Dmitry’s digital Delta concept which he’s finished in two very appropriate colors.







Dmitry’s idea here was to take the original Delta S4 and Group B idea and mash it up with the ECV1 evolving an evolution of a much-loved Italian high performance hatchback.

Think: a tube-frame chassis wrapped in a lightweight carbon fiber body powered by a mid-mounted twin-charged Abarth 233 ATR 18s ‘Triflux’ engine able to rev to 10000rpm and develop 1000hp.

The twin-charge system remains in its original state with pneumatic actuators and release valves. An Haltech ECU and modern sensors manage the complexity of the engine in a more efficient and smoother fashion while monitoring and logging an amount of parameters that would have been a dream back in the Group B Delta’s era.

The rear quarter and roof vents supply the engine bay with cool air while three Behr intercoolers keep the intake charge temperature in check.

Taking a virtual step back allows you to see and appreciate the layout in its entirety.

Looking at this rear end shot reminds me of the Ferrari F40 and automatically makes me wonder if Dmitry might look at that car in the same way at some point. I for one would love to see what an evolution of arguably Ferrari’s finest creation could look like.

I found myself amazed at the realism of the textures; Dmitry’s digital render work really is mind-blowing.

The large central opening at the rear is both technical and a design feature. It lets hot air out and shows the beauty of custom twin-loop exhaust.

There’s no dirty air formation beneath the engine thanks to a flat underbody and rear diffuser that channels the airflow away.

The exterior had to be highly recognizable and refreshed at the same time and to achieve this balance Dmitry kept the front lights and grill shape stock. Same goes for the profile lines and side-body-to-window proportions while the arches were widened to fit 295/30 Pirelli tires on 19-inch Fifteen52 wheels. The rear extended diffuser completes the grounded silhouette look with plenty of attention having been paid to aerodynamic features demanded by the engine configuration.







The front end was designed around dual radiators and brake cooling ducts while the space under the hood is additionally ventilated by the fan bar.







The interior is built around an adjustable dashboard extension and Woodward steering column for optimal driver’s seat ergonomics.

A conceptual Nvidia AI module running on x2 RTX 2080 GPUs collects real time data and 3D scans of upcoming relief from front sensors to adjust suspension steering aero and engine parameters.

There separate USB ports for transferring logs are located near the passenger seat.

Even fabric simulation software was used to recreate the look of Kirkey seats fitted with TAKATA Racing harnesses.

While these digital renders are cool enough Dmitry also created some animated sequences of the Delta in all its glory and even in action. Hit play above to check it out.







The digital realm has always resonated with us and I am sure I’m not the only one who would like to send Dmitry a very long list of cars to work his magic on. I’ll start it off… Ferrari F40 and BNR34 Skyline GT-R please!

Over a year the Dunderrow Solar Farm Extension would generate approximately 5000 Megawatt (MW) hours of sustainable power and reduce the nearby Eli Lilly plant’s carbon footprint by 2000 tonnes per year.

In addition it will mean more than 75pc of the Eli Lily site’s future total power demand of around 10.5MW would be sourced from renewable electricity.

Bioenergy Power Systems Limited which trades as Enerpower submitted the planning application to Cork County Council for the site in Dunderrow Kinsale Co Cork. The development would comprise a 5.1MW solar PV farm site to help power Eli Lilly’s nearby pharmaceutical plant.

A spokesman for Eli Lilly said the company had made the planning application for the extension but would not comment further until Cork County Council had made a decision. However he added the company had a track record for embracing sustainability.

“Our commitment to sustainability has been consistent over the 40 years that we have operated in Dunderrow” he said. “The clearest and most visible aspect of that was the opening earlier this summer of the largest solar farm in the country.

“But we have always operated on the reduce reuse recycle recover principle. For example before the new solar farm opened we already used a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant that efficiently produces approximately 45pc of the site’s electricity.”

Last month Taoiseach Micheál Martin opened Eli Lilly’s 16-acre €5m 5.6MW solar farm near Kinsale to help power its nearby plant.

Over its lifetime it would provide the equivalent energy to power all the households of Kinsale for the next 20 years..",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvYXN0cmF6ZW5lY2EtaGFpbHMtc3VjY2Vzcy1vZi1zZWNvbmQtY292aWQtdGhlcmFweS1pbi1sYXRlLXN0YWdlLXRyaWFscy1rc3B6cmt6c3rSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AstraZeneca hails success of second Covid therapy in late-stage trials,"A new antibody therapy produced by AstraZeneca has reduced the risk of people developing Covid-19 symptoms by 77 per cent the drugs company said yesterday putting it on track to offer protection to those who respond poorly to vaccines.

The collection is rich in analog electronics used during the classic 1960s and ’70s era of rock and roll but it spans from the early genesis of synthesizers in the 1930s to the late 1980s when the market began to be dominated by digital keyboards and computer software.

Emma Lee / WHYY The Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project is hounsed in a former food distribution warehouse in Harleysville Pa.

This is the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project or EMEAPP. By design there is not a computer anywhere in the building aside from a few rare digital prototypes from the early 1980s.

“The general energy of the world tends these days toward a homogenizing energy” said Wouter De Backer also known as the musician Gotye who sits on EMEAPP’s advisory board. “There’s been all these fantastic things that have come from the democratization and miniaturization and economization of electronics but over the years that has made us blind to the fact that there’s this homogenizing pull.”

De Backer disrupted that perceived homogenization of pop music in his hit 2011 song “Somebody That I Used To Know” by using a xylophone to carry the melody with a sample from a 1967 Latin jazz nylon-string guitar mixed with an African drum.

Vintage analog synthesizers often cast into the dustbin of musical history have what he calls “dormant potential.”

Emma Lee / WHYY Devices from synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla are part of the displayed collection at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

“I felt over the years that instruments that are more untapped that still have a dormant potential have so much possibility for adding to the richness and diversity of a culture” De Backer said.

EMEAPP has 30000 square feet of dormant potential. The former wholesale food warehouse in Montgomery County is stacked floor-to-ceiling with old technology. Each piece tells a story.

“Here’s a Sennheiser Vocoder that belonged to Kraftwerk” said executive director Drew Raison gesturing to a rack-mounted box with 50 knobs and about 30 cable ports.

Emma Lee / WHYY The collection at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa. reaches back to the earliest efforts at synthesized music.

Nearby is a cluster of electric organs. “That Hammond B-3 used to belong to John Entwhistle of The Who” he said.

Around the corner is the organ Rick Wakeman of the band Yes used to record the hit song “Roundabout” and the Marshall amp Lindsay Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac used to record the album “Rumours.” Around another corner is the amp system Led Zeppelin used on its 1969 American tour and the portable mixing board Neil Young likely used to record “The Needle and the Damage Done” for his 1972 album “Harvest.”

“That’s the wah-wah Jimi Hendrix used at Woodstock” said Raison pointing to a guitar pedal on a high shelf. “I’m going to say that again: That’s the pedal Jimi Hendrix used at Woodstock.”

Raison cannot give a number to the amount of gear in EMEAPP’s collection. His best guess is 2000 or 3000 objects including early Ondioline electronic synthesizers from the 1940s and one of the world’s first digital synthesizers the Con Brio ADS 100 used to make the soundtrack for “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn” in 1982.

The pièce de résistance is the enormous Moog system that Keith Emerson hauled around the world several times while touring with Emerson Lake and Palmer from the 1970s through the 2000s.

“You’re looking at the Keith Emerson world here” Raison said of the recording studio built inside the warehouse.

The centerpiece is Emerson’s monolithic Moog standing about 10 feet high with a dizzying number of knobs and patching cables. Next to it is a smaller Hammond L100 organ Emerson liked to abuse on stage. It has two daggers stuck into the keyboard its wooden body repaired with steel mending plates.

Emma Lee / WHYY Keith Emerson's Moog synthesizer is set up as he had it for stage performances in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

Emerson a rock showman would sometimes stab the keys with daggers to hold them down while he moved to another keyboard. He destroyed a lot of L100s over his career. This particular L100 caught fire onstage during a show in Boston in 1997.

“Basically the L100 is your grandmother’s organ from the living room and he beat the living daylights out of them” explained Raison. “Keith ate the L100 for dinner. He would throw them around the stage pull it on top of himself play upside down stand on top of it and rock it.”

EMEAPP started four years ago as the nonprofit foundation stewarding the collection that its founder Vince Pupillo has been amassing for 20 years. The organization keeps the equipment in working condition as much as possible and uses them for educational programs including group tours and the occasional loan to an exhibition. Some pieces were recently part of “Play It Loud” a 2019 exhibition of rock gear by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Pupillo started collecting the pieces because these were the kinds of instruments he played as a young musician in the 1960s and ’70s.

“When I was in high school and in college I always had a band and I always played” Pupillo said. “But when disco came along it took the joy away from playing rock and roll.”

Emma Lee / WHYY A mixing board used by Neil Young is on display at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa. Executive Director Drew Raison is working to establish that it was used to record ''The Needle and the Damage Done.''

He quit playing around 1978 and sold his Minimoog his Fender Rhodes keyboard and his Hohner clavinet to focus on raising a family and building a company. He eventually became successful in the salad business.

Around 2002 Pupillo wanted to get his hands on those old instruments again with their “warmer” tones.

“Every time I hear those instruments it just makes you feel like butter” he said.

Once he had the keyboards from his youth back in hand Pupillo started acquiring more as his interest in the history of the technology deepened.

Pupillo became known to collectors and musicians as the guy who would buy instruments that otherwise might be thrown away. Around 2016 he was approached by the Audities Foundation a Calgary-based vintage recording studio to see if he would be interested in five Minimoog prototypes the handmade portable synthesizers Robert Moog’s company made while developing the product for the retail market. The Minimoog became the first synthesizer an average musician could buy off the shelf revolutionizing electronic music.

Pupillo thinks that the Minimoog was essential to the development of popular electronic music and that these prototypes as the objects on which concepts of analog sound technology were being worked out had huge historical importance.

Emma Lee / WHYY The daggers that Keith Emerson used to hold notes on his Hammond L100 organ are left in place in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

EMEAPP was created in 2017 as a mission-driven nonprofit to preserve and maintain the invention engineering and culture of early electronic equipment and tell the stories behind the gear.

“I did whatever I had to do to get those instruments under one roof and preserved” said Pupillo. “A lot of musicians and folks in the music industry they want to preserve their legacy and they see what we’re doing.”

De Backer/Gotye saw that EMEAPP coincided with his personal interest in antique electronics. In 2015 he started a partnership with the pioneering electronic musician Jean-Jacques Perrey who in the 1950s was a virtuoso of the Ondioline an early synthesizer that allowed the players to create vibrato on the keyboard.

“It had this incredibly boisterous hyperactive almost kind of infectious joy about it” said De Backer. “Other parts of his music have a real romanticism a wistfulness about them and he manages to coax those poles of expression out of the Ondioline.”

De Backer had organized an Ondioline ensemble and planned a concert in New York with Perrey. However Perrey died at age 87 in Switzerland before that performance could happen. De Backer started a label Forgotten Futures to reissue Perrey’s electronic Ondioline recordings from six decades earlier.

Emma Lee / WHYY Vince Pupillo Jr. tweaks the settings on Keith Emerson's Moog synthesizer in the studio at the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project in Harleysville Pa.

“There are really wonderful human stories behind those instruments” said De Backer. “They’re often so surprising and unlikely that they feel like an antidote to what feels like the same narratives we hear again and again in the culture.”

The pandemic hit EMEAPP hard immediately canceling all school tours and events around the collection. Nevertheless it is still acquiring and maintaining equipment. Recently it received a grant to finish construction of a new control room for its recording studio which will allow musicians to tease fresh sounds out of the old equipment.

The company is planning a $150 million village at the 20ha Clevedon site it has bought.

Delisted retirement giant Metlifecare has made a big profit turnaround due to revaluations and bought a 20ha site at Clevedon where the $4 billion business plans a $150 million village.

Earl Gasparich who replaced Glen Sowry as the company's chief executive announced a $304.4m net profit after tax after last year's loss driven primarily by $335m revaluation gains when previously the assets were written down by $74.7m.

Gasparich previously CEO of Oceania Healthcare said the new village would be Clevedon's first and part of an active development programme with four large North Island villages planned or under construction.

Metlifecare was delisted from the NZX and ASX on November 3 after Swedish investment firm EQT Partners made a $1.27b takeover for all the shares via its Asia Pacific Village Group.

The company is one of the big six retirement village operators in New Zealand and its new project is at 17 Clevedon Kawakawa Rd 30 minutes south of Auckland.

Metlifecare which already houses 5500 residents plans 130 independent villas and apartments and a 60-bed hospital on its new site.

Gasparich said it had worked with iwi business association and community members on the design and resource consent process.

The company has 26 villages and is developing four new ones. Construction is under way at Orion Point and Fairway Gardens in Auckland a site has been purchased at Havelock North and now Clevedon is planned.

Last week the company reported a net profit after tax of $304.4m for the year to June 30 2021 up from last year's $33.7m loss. Statutory operating cash flow was $119.3m up from $116m. Total assets of $4.078b are up from $3.571b. Total equity $1.842b is up from $1.533b.

Net gearing remains almost static at 16.6 per cent compared with 16.9 per cent last year. During the June 2021 financial year the business opened its new Beachlands village Pohutukawa Landing.

Gasparich said the result reflected several achievements Metlifecare had made during the year although the company also noted the revaluation gains that boosted the bottom line so much.

""We are proud of the way everyone – staff and residents alike – have adapted and looked after each other's safety and wellbeing during a year of intermittent Covid-19 restrictions. Our strong operating performance has highlighted the wide appeal of Metlifecare's villages and aged care facilities where we experienced record levels of demand and strong occupancy across all of our villages"" he said.

Pohutukawa Landing opened in June he said.

Operating revenue was $143.5m 7 per cent higher than the June 30 2020 year due to continued growth in care revenue and higher deferred management fees he said.

This together with a 21 per cent increase in realised resales gains grew statutory operating cash flow to $119.3m for the year.

Metlifecare repaid its $6.8m wage subsidy received late in the previous financial year. The company believed this was the appropriate action given Metlifecare's financial position and reflected the spirit of the scheme.

Reported net profit after tax of $304.4m was driven primarily by a fair value gain on its investment property portfolio of $335.5m the company said in its August 20 statement.

""The strong increase in the value of Metlifecare's investment property reflects the reversal of Covid-19-related property valuation assumptions applied in the prior year and completion of new developments at Pohutukawa Landing"" the statement says.

The company had $171m invested in development activities.

""We welcomed the first residents to our new Pohutukawa Landing village in Beachlands as well as making solid progress on five large-scale project developments. These developments include two new villages at Fairway Gardens (Botany Auckland) and Orion Point (Hobsonville Point Auckland) both due to open in FY22 and new homes and community amenities at Pohutukawa Landing and Gulf Rise (Red Beach Hibiscus Coast)"" Gasparich said.

""We are also looking forward to completing a multi-year regeneration project at Edgewater village (Pakuranga Auckland) in FY22 which will transform the site with a new community centre care home and independent living apartments.""

Metlifecare had further sites in Havelock North and south Auckland.

""Our goal is to significantly increase our build rate and we have made significant progress to deliver this. We look forward to sharing more exciting development and land acquisition news in the coming months"" Gasparich said last week.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Varo’s credit-building program Believe will launch in the coming weeks. Chime debuted a no-interest secured credit card in June of 2020. Other companies like Extra and Grain offer revolving lines of credit that are linked to regular debit cards. MoneyLion extends a loan meant to bolster its users’ credit history. Esusu a service that reports rental payments to the credit bureaus has backing from the tennis champion Serena Williams; the NBA star Stephen Curry has invested in a startup called Kikoff .

There are other products with a niche. Step  a challenger bank touts credit-building benefits for its teen customers. Sequin a debit card that fronts money for purchases and repays itself from a linked bank account is targeted at women who founder Vrinda Gupta formerly of Visa concluded were disproportionately being rejected by credit cards or getting lower limits and higher interest rates.

Some banks have recently launched products along these lines. Others offer secured credit cards that may require a sizable upfront deposit.

All these efforts are designed to serve a wide range of customers who could benefit from boosting their credit scores from young consumers and immigrants establishing a credit history for the first time to military veterans who spent years abroad and retirees whose records may have stagnated to those recovering from past mistakes or misfortunes. And most have shortcomings or drawbacks for borrowers or for lenders which partially explains why they’re not more widely available.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s most recent report on this topic from 2015 found that 11% of the adult population in the U.S. was “credit invisible” or without records from the national credit reporting agencies and another 8.3% were “unscorable” because of insufficient or stale history.

Anecdotal evidence suggests this hasn’t changed dramatically in the past six years. “We survey our customers all the time"" and credit score help ""was one of the top two to three things they were asking for” said Aaron Plante vice president of lending products and banking strategy at Chime.

There is also room for improvement in these initiatives. Alex Johnson director of fintech research at Cornerstone Advisors says some of these products are loaded with fees and interest charges. Others such as credit-building cards or services that report rent and utility payments to the credit bureaus may not be as effective as the marketing hype leads customers to believe.

“Just because this stuff exists and could end up on a credit report doesn’t mean that a mainstream legacy lender sees the same empirical value in this information” said John Ulzheimer a credit expert witness and formerly of FICO and Equifax. “You can’t load up a credit report with gym memberships and Hulu and expect to have a FICO score of 800.”



Pros cons of credit-building tools

Credit-builder cards such as the one offered by Chime have their users set aside a sum of money each month that will be drawn upon to make payments often automatically. Unlike with traditional secured credit cards customers don’t need to hand over a large deposit initially and typically won’t need to pay interest or fees.

“The odds that they will spend more money than they have or miss a payment are extremely low” Johnson said.

Chime customers can move any amount they choose from their spending accounts to their Credit Builder secured accounts and charge up to this amount on their Credit Builder card. At the end of the month Chime automatically pays off the balance from the secured account if the customer enables automation and it reports the successful payment to all major credit bureaus. Credit Builder does not charge an annual fee or interest.

Millions of Chime customers are using this product Plante said.

The downside to such cards is that the repayment data is not as indicative to the credit bureaus of a customer’s “willingness to repay” because the regular risks and decision-making of repaying loans are taken out of the equation Johnson said.

That may not be a problem right now as these products are still new. “But as credit-builder products become more popular it wouldn’t surprise me if the bureaus and FICO which are constantly tuning models and approaches look at them and try to better understand how the data correlates to someone’s creditworthiness” Johnson said.

For Plante the upsides to the product are still key.

“The consistent thing we hear from the credit bureaus is this is bringing more people into the credit world” Plante said. “The credit invisibles now have a trade line.”

Another fintech trying to bring more people into the credit world is GO2bank  the digital bank belonging to Green Dot that serves low- to moderate-income customers.

Its secured credit card does not charge an annual fee and keeps the minimum deposit to $100 rather than the more typical minimum of $200. It also recently partnered with Experian to offer its customers glimpses of their FICO score credit monitoring the ability to lock and unlock their Experian credit files and access to Experian Boost which lets them improve their scores by paying bills like video-streaming services phones and utilities on time.

These additions are expected to launch later this year.

Most of these features can be assembled for free through other sources. For example consumers can sign up for Experian Boost directly. GO2bank and Chime are the only two neobanks to partner with Experian Boost so far.

Abhi Chaudhary head of direct to consumer at Green Dot said GO2bank sets itself apart by consolidating this suite of tools in one place.

“Our goal was to create a financial ecosystem for customers in one mobile app” Chaudhary said.

One potential issue with rent and utility reporting services is that lenders may not rely on scores that incorporate it. FICO 8 for example takes utility data into consideration but not rental data. FICO 9 incorporates both but is not yet widely used by lenders.

“The older credit-scoring systems specifically used in mortgage lending don’t see those cool things [like rent and utility payments] that consumers can add to their credit reports” Ulzheimer said.

Chaudhary still sees plenty of benefit in fostering responsible behaviors among his customers.

“Our intent is to ensure our customer’s credit profile is getting better and once it is getting better this is over time reflected in other models” Chaudhary said.

Other products such as credit-builder loans levy fees and interest. In exchange they say they help customers improve their credit scores while amassing a chunk of savings.

“I’m not a big fan of the credit-builder installment loans” Johnson said. “I don’t think it’s worth locking up that much money and paying interest.”

Johnson pointed out that banks have followed in the footsteps of fintechs by rethinking overdraft fees and granting customers early access to their paychecks .

“We will see a resurgence of credit-builder products and secured credit cards coming from banks in much the same way” he said.

Austin Capital Bank in Texas launched Credit Strong in 2019. It's a credit-building product that includes an installment loan and a federally insured savings account. With Credit Strong the $341 million-asset bank funds a loan and the proceeds are placed in the savings account. Users make fixed monthly payments that cover principal which is credited toward the loan and interest which compensates the bank for the product. There are no prepayment or early withdrawal penalties.

These payments are reported to all three credit bureaus and once the loan is repaid the savings are released.

“What they spend in credit building they will save in thousands of dollars of interest expenses over their financial life” said Erik Beguin the CEO and founder of Austin Capital Bank.

Credit Strong will report both positive and negative data which Beguin says is important. Anywhere between 3% and 7% of Credit Strong customers pay late.

Credit-building products ""that only generate positive payment history could eventually erode the reliability of the credit bureau data and underwriting models based on that data” he said.

Where banks might have edge over fintechs

Beguin said that there were two roads he could have taken: a secured credit card or an installment loan. He chose the latter because he wanted a product with no upfront deposit.

He also says that one of the major advantages his bank has over fintech credit-building products is robust know-your-customer checks.

“Weak KYC programs that are not subject to Bank Secrecy Act [rules] and federal examination could aid bad actors to manufacture synthetic identities at scale” he said.

Johnson predicts that more banks will start offering some of their own credit-building products to compete with the neobanks. This could be as simple as refreshing their secured credit cards.

“More than anything the biggest problem with secured cards is consumers can tell when the companies they are working with don’t want to work with them” Johnson said. “Secured cards always had that vibe like ‘Here are all our great cards we want you to have and oh yeah here is our secured card.’ ”

In contrast Chime positions its credit-builder card prominently on its website.

“It’s a subtle distinction but it matters” Johnson said.

The better approach for banks might be rethinking how they underwrite customers and incorporate alternative data. That would mean more customers get approved for regular products.

There are a few examples on the market. Petal has started selling its cash-flow-based underwriting technology to banks and fintechs in addition to offering its own credit card directly to consumers. TomoCredit launched a credit card in March that assesses creditworthiness exclusively on cash-flow data. Nova Credit helps usher immigrants into the American credit system by making sense of foreign credit bureau information for U.S. banks’ underwriting systems. American Express partnered with Nova Credit in 2019.

In May The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the largest U.S. banks will start sharing data on customers’ deposit accounts to expand access to credit. This pilot program grew out of Project REACh (Roundtable for Economic Access and Change) an initiative by the Officer for the Comptroller of Currency to promote financial inclusion. JPMorgan Chase is one bank involved with Project REACh. Mark Brucker chief risk officer at JPMorgan said the goal is to broaden access to credit responsibly.

“Depending on what we learn through this effort underwriting models may evolve in the future to account for new alternative data sources” Brucker said by email. “While we’re beginning with deposit account information as we gain experience we’ll consider expanding the techniques to evaluate other areas such as rent utilities and other payment information.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) has added three further providers to its list of certified players to store sensitive data locally.

Added this week is NextDC which joins recently added Equinix and Fujitsu.

NextDC has its Perth 1 and 2 Sydney 1 and 2 Melbourne 1 and 2 Brisbane 1 and 2 and Canberra 1 facilities classed as certified against the requirements defined in the Hosting Certification Framework.

Equinix Australia has its CA1 SY3 SY4 SY5 SY6 SY7 PE2 and ME4 faciltiies certified while Fujitsu Australia's Western Sydney and Homebush facilities have been accepted by the DTA.

The DTA is the government's certifying authority for the Hosting Certification Framework.

The framework aims to operationalise the principles outlined in the whole-of-government hosting strategy and to support the secure management of government systems and data.

""The framework will assist agencies to mitigate against supply chain and data centre ownership risks and enable them to identify and source appropriate hosting and related services"" the DTA claims.

In June the DTA certified Australian Data Centres Canberra Data Centres and Macquarie Telecom's Canberra Campus as the initial three providers to store sensitive government data.

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) shuttered the government's cloud certification program in July 2020 after an independent review recommended for the system be reworked. ASD cloud services certifications and consequently all services listed on the Certified Cloud Services List became void.

In its place is the Cloud Security Guidance which aims to guide organisations including government cloud service providers and Information Security Registered Assessors Program assessors on how to perform a ""comprehensive assessment of a cloud service provider and its cloud services so a risk-informed decision can be made about its suitability to handle an organisation's data"".

Five economists weigh in on what you should do,"Tulip reckons large home price gains clearly swung the equation in favour of property ownership in recent years. “However there is no guarantee that will happen again” he warns. For data of the long-term returns on shares versus property I went to AMP Capital’s chief economist Shane Oliver. He sent me a graph showing $100 invested in shares in 1926 would have turned into about $1.6 million today the combination of both capital gains and dividends delivering an 11.3 per cent average annual return. The same $100 invested in property (including capital gain and rental income adjusted for costs) would have grown by a not-dissimilar 10.7 per cent.

Credit: AMP Capital “Over the very long term residential property adjusted for costs has had a similar return to Australian shares” Oliver concludes. Despite this Oliver sits firmly in the “buy a home” camp. Shane Oliver at AMP Capital. Credit: Louie Douvis “It’s a hard one right now as house prices have had such a run higher but generally speaking I think it’s better to buy rather than rent given the tax advantages of owning a home and the forced saving [and wealth building] that having a mortgage and having to pay it down provides” he says.

“Yes people could rent and borrow to invest in shares – but they are far less inclined to do that and so won’t get the benefit of the leverage to build wealth that they would get from home ownership and a mortgage.” Brendan Coates an economist at the Grattan Institute is cautious about the leverage argument. “It’s worth remembering that leverage is a two-way street. It super-sizes returns on your property investment [housing equity] when prices are rising as they have for most of the past 30 years. But leverage can also super-size your losses in the event prices fall” he says. Brendan Coates Program Director Household Finances Grattan Institute. Credit: Coates also warns that investing all your savings in one single property carries inherent risk: “Buying a house is taking on a big exposure to a very specific asset – a single house – which goes against the way we try to construct investment portfolios by diversifying investment risks. If your house happens to need restumping or has some other structural defect then that is a risk you are wearing yourself.” Ultimately however Coates says Australia’s retirement system pushes people towards home ownership. “The biggest benefit of buying a house is that you are much more likely to qualify for an age pension as a homeowner than as a renter. People in multimillion-dollar houses can still draw a pension whereas someone with the same assets in superannuation wouldn’t qualify for any pension.”

Independent economist Saul Eslake says he agrees with my conclusion that the rent versus buy decision comes down to an individual’s circumstances and preferences. Independent economist Saul Eslake. Credit: Pat Scala Eslake says large property price gains over the past three decades have benefited homeowners. However “Can the same thing happen again over the next 30 – or even the next 10 – years? Probably not.” Timing it’s clear can make or break the decision. In 2019 Ernst and Young chief economist Jo Masters co-authored a study which compared the hypothetical situation of a person who bought a unit in Sydney with an 80 per cent loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) versus someone who continued to rent but took out a 50 per cent LVR margin loan to invest in an ASX200 index fund.

Loading The authors compared the relative 10-year returns (after tax) for purchases made between 1994 and 2007. “We found that in 62 per cent of each equivalent 10-year comparison people were better off renting and maintaining a leveraged investment in the ASX200 compared to owning a unit in the same area.” Masters tells me the study shows that successful “rent-vesting” is possible. But she questions whether most Australians would have the financial literacy to exploit it. “It’s a harder route because it requires more discipline. The truth is typically people know how to go and buy a house. I know that if I walk into a bank branch they will tell me how to do it. That’s not true of any other investment form.” “To me the key is not whether you should buy or rent the key learning is that you have to have a savings plan have an investment plan and have some leverage.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 22-year-old college student is from Reggio Calabria in Italy where proof of vaccination has been required since August 6 to enter most indoor venues. But rather than carry around a physical copy of his green pass — as the COVID cards are known in Europe — Colonetta decided to get a much more permanent version according to the According to the Corriere della Calabria newspaper. (And this one will be very hard to lose.)

Colonetta got the QR code confirming his shots tattooed on his left bicep so now whenever he goes anywhere he literally scans his arm. A video of the ink was posted on TikTok showing Colonetta and a companion testing it in real time and sure enough it scans correctly.

“It’s certainly something original — I like to be different” Colonnetta told Corriere della Calabria.

In a second video Colonnetta is seen using his tattooed QR code in the real world having his arm scanned to receive service at a local McDonald’s. Once he does a security guard then also scans it at which point confirmation that it is a valid Italian record shows up on screen.

Chandigarh August 21

As the world watched in horror the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of Kabul thousands of hapless Afghans thronged the Kabul International Airport in a desperate bid to escape the country.

Several people were seen running alongside an American military aircraft taxiing for take-off some clinging to its wheels – resulting in the death of at least two people including a teenager footballer as they fell from the sky.

Mocking the horrifying death of the innocent Afghans tasteless t-shirts with the offensive message ‘Kabul Skydiving Club’ are available on Etsy an American e-commerce company focused on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies.

The apparel available for both men and women in various colours had silhouettes of two people plummeting from a US military aircraft with “Est. 2021” written at the bottom.

Online retailers have come under fire on social media for selling offensive merchandise mocking Afghan people who tragically fell to their deaths attempting to flee the Taliban.

Shocking footage earlier this week showed multiple civilians falling to their death from a U.S. Air Force jet as it took off from Kabul airport.

Desperate people including a teenage footballer clung on to the plane's landing gear as the Taliban militants took hold of the capital.

Just days after the tragic incident online retailers including popular website Etsy were seen listing T-shirts sporting illustrations of two people falling out of the plane.

The sickening tee was being sold in a variety of colours and sizes.

The SouthCoast has been largely spared the worst effects of tropical storm Henri seeing light rain wind gusts that were strong at times and scattered power outages.

The storm charged up the Atlantic coast over the past few days threatening to be the region's first direct hit from a hurricane since Bob in 1991. About 12:30 p.m. the National Weather Service reported that Henri made landfall near Westerly R.I. as a tropical storm and began veering to the west.

Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 60 mph.

By mid-afternoon tropical storm warnings that had taken affect across the SouthCoast were called off.

Henri was forecast to slow down and possibly stall near the Connecticut-New York border Sunday night followed by an east-northeastward motion across northern Connecticut and southern Massachusetts on Monday. Slower forward speed means the storm may linger longer dumping excessive rain as it passes.

Scattered power outages reported

By 3 p.m. on Sunday National Grid and Eversource were dealing with a few power failures on the Southcoast including scattered outages in nearly every city and town from Swansea to Fairhaven.

On Sunday mid-morning about 1700 National Grid customers had lost power in Swansea Dighton and Rehoboth and later on Sunday Eversource reported more than 1000 people lost power in Dartmouth.

The power failures are minor compared to customers in Rhode Island where nearly 80000 people have lost electricity as of Sunday afternoon. Mainland Rhode Island received the brunt of the storm. East of Mount Hope Bay Tiverton has seen scattered power failures but about 750 customers remain without power in Little Compton.

Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant advised residents of its service area to stay away from downed power lines. To report outages and emergencies call 508-824-3111.

Damage appears minor overall

The area wasn't entirely spared from any damage. High winds knocked down multiple trees in New Bedford including one at 312 Maple St. that sent it crashing against a house.

Throughout the SouthCoast according to scanner reports police and fire were busy through the late morning and early afternoon responding to minor reports of downed trees and branches and utility pole damage including a reported telephone pole fire near 97 Preservation Way in Tiverton and a large branch at Ray and Milton streets in Fall River.

Fall River police reported no major incidents that typically accompany a major storm.

The town of Swansea posted photos on its Facebook page of flooding at the town boat ramp about 12:30 p.m. around the time Henri made landfall in Rhode Island.

Precautions were taken

In advance of Henri's approach several area cities and towns took safety precautions. Westport closed East Beach Road due to stormy conditions blocking the area with police vehicles. Earlier on Sunday police advised motorists to stay home as much as possible as the storm passed through the area.

By Ronni Newton

Officials had anticipated that the combination of rain and high winds from Tropical Storm Henri – on top of the already-saturated ground from last week’s flooding rainfall – would bring down trees and knock out power and as of 4 p.m. Sunday crews from the West Hartford Department of Public Works were responding to 15 separate reports of trees down across roadways in town.

“About half involve wires” Director of Public Works John Phillips told We-Ha.com.

In comparison to storms where limbs snap off trees on Sunday many of the trees that fell were completely uprooted due to the saturated ground.

As of 4:40 p.m. Eversource’s outage map indicated that 30753 customers (2.39%) across Connecticut were without power.

In West Hartford 360 customers (1.25%) were in the dark. The outages are spread throughout town with the largest concentration in the Duffy Elementary School neighborhood where a tree fell across the road on Spring Lane according to the Eversource map.

Other reports of downed trees in West Hartford according to West Hartford Police Capt. Eric Rocheleau include a tree that fell on construction equipment at Norfeldt Field a tree on the wires on Stratford Lane a large tree limb in the roadway at Albany Avenue and Mountain Road a tree limb on the wires on Miamis a tree on a house on Pioneer Drive and a tree blocking the road with wires involved at 21 Walbridge.

As Tropical Storm Henri continued to spin and make its way across the state on a diagonal from southeast to northwest rains began to let up in West Hartford and winds calmed a bit and began to shift direction. Phillips was optimistic that the worst may have passed.

According to Rocheleau there were reports of standing water on some local roadways but no flooding.

Mayor Shari Cantor declared a state of emergency for West Hartford early Sunday afternoon and that declaration remains in effect until terminated.

For the most part forecasted high sustained winds with gusts didn't materialize over the region in such intensity nor did a predicted widespread storm surge inundation. Still National Weather Service observers Sunday morning clocked a 51 mph wind gust in Mashpee a 48 mph gust in Wellfleet and a 45 mph gust in West Dennis.

As of 1:40 p.m. 59 Eversource customers were without power in Orleans and fewer than three in Falmouth — no other Cape towns had reported outages.

In Falmouth and elsewhere shorelines were battered by waves. Low-lying Surf Drive in Falmouth was closed to vehicle traffic for a time after water from Vineyard Sound splashed onto the roadway.

On Martha's Vineyard Atlantic Drive in Edgartown was closed late in the morning after a storm surge made sections of the road hazardous according to the Edgartown Police Department.

The iconic Sandwich Boardwalk was nearly covered in water at high tide Sunday as people strolled on its planks. The Cape has a nearly 4-foot astronomical high tide today one of the highest of the year.

Henri which began the day as a hurricane but was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning made landfall shortly after noon near Westerly Rhode Island with maximum sustained winds at about 60 mph according to the National Weather Service.

Forecasts several days ago put the Cape dead center in Henri's path.

Earlier today the weather service forecast called for tropical storm-force winds of 30-40 mph with gusts up to 50 mph on Cape Cod and the Islands the weather service said.

In advance of Henri the Woods Hole Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship canceled all trips through 5 p.m. Sunday including the scheduled 5 p.m. departures from Woods Hole and Vineyard Haven according to its website. All trips on the high-speed vessel M/V Iyanough on the Nantucket route were also canceled.

Hy-Line Cruises canceled all ferry service Sunday and all of its offices are closed. Service is expected to resume Monday.

Henri was expected to weaken rapidly as it headed into central and northeast Massachusetts on Sunday night into Monday.

Not a day goes by where we don't learn something in TV news. Today while reporting at Saybrook Point I noticed two red flags with black squares directly below the American flag.

There are many different nautical flags with various meanings. I discovered the red with black squares mean a Hurricane Warning is in effect. If there is only one flag it means there is a hurricane watch. Now I know!

AAA urges motorists to take care while on the roads today.

Take it slow – reducing your speed is the best way to avoid a crash or losing control of your vehicle

Turn on your headlights – so you can see and be seen

Turn Around Don’t Drown! As little as six inches of water can cause you to lose control of your car and potentially stall your engine. Do not attempt to drive through flooded roads. Turn around; find another way to get to your destination. Pull over to a safe location if needed.

Never drive through standing water - Standing water can be deceiving and motorists should avoid it. No matter how shallow it may appear the water may be concealing downed power lines or other obstacles

Watch for hydroplaning - No car is immune from hydroplaning on wet surfaces including four-wheel-drive vehicles. Even if brakes work under normal conditions that doesn’t mean they will react the same on slippery roads where tires roll with less traction.

Don’t use cruise control – Always maintain full control of your vehicle when roads are wet

Take the nearest exit - If conditions worsen to the point where there is any doubt about your safety take the nearest exit. Don’t just stop on the shoulder or under a bridge. If your visibility is compromised other drivers may be struggling too.

Respond to a skid – If you do lose control of your vehicle and start to skid/hydroplane always look and steer in the direction you want the vehicle to go.

Sign up for emergency alerts – alerts are often provided by agencies like the National Weather Service and can help notify you when there is a risk of flooding.

But this time Curry said none of the big rental companies had any vehicles available for the trip. And she had been shopping two months in advance.

“I’ve never ever had to make a reservation for a vehicle more than two days in advance” Curry said “and never had difficulty getting a vehicle before this occurrence.”

It’s no secret that getting a rental car has become tricky in some locations and very expensive in many others.

According to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index average daily car rental rates have almost doubled from $89 a day over Independence Day 2020 to $166 during that same time period in 2021. But some destinations are getting hit much harder with daily prices reportedly ranging from $250 to $600 or more at some airports across the country.

Sue Spinney vice president for ground transport with the Expedia Group said in an email that a comparison of searches for rental cars showed interest more than doubled jumping 115% from June 2019 to June 2021.

The rental-car shortage gained a national audience July 8 after singer-actor Audra McDonald known recently for her role as Liz Reddick in the legal drama The Good Fight posted her frustration on Twitter when she discovered Hertz had no cars in Atlanta tweeting: “lt’s the hunger games out here.”

Jessica Caldwell analyst for the automotive industry go-to site Edmunds explained the tsunami of bad events that befell the rental-car industry.

First came the pandemic and the country went into lockdown. Because so much of rental-car business involves vacationers and business travelers once those industries dried up rental car companies faced a cash-flow cliff.

Executives had to sell off unused vehicles in some cases as part of bankruptcy restructuring.

This business decision seemed wise at the time. Hertz which also owns Thrifty and Dollar brands reported that between April and June last year utilization of its U.S. cars was a dismal 28% versus 82% during the same period in 2019. The 2020 plummet came despite its rental fleet shrinking by almost 50000 cars compared with its 554794 vehicles the prior year. So obviously some of these cars had to go.

And so they did — from 516726 vehicles at the end of 2019 in the U.S. to 298183 at the end of 2020 according to Hertz a 40% reduction in a year. The company achieved utilization rates of about 75% by both the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 according to Hertz.

But Caldwell continued the trouble didn’t stop there. In 2021 the spread of vaccinations had Americans eager to get back on the road and demand for rental cars increased. At the same time consumer demand to purchase vehicles also skyrocketed in part because people were wary of mass transit in the pandemic. Car sales after wobbling in spring 2020 went through the roof by the end of the year — and stayed there.

And finally came the computer chip shortage. Cars couldn’t be finished for lack of computer chips and with a shortage automakers are not interested in fleet business.

“In terms of automakers wanting to sell cars their first priority is retail consumers or people like you and me and secondly is their fleet customers” Caldwell said. “I think rental cars are kind of at the bottom of that list; those are generally the lowest margin in terms of their profit.”

Caldwell shared the experience of a colleague at Edmunds who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Hawaii.

Talia James-Armand Edmunds’ associate director of public relations and communications said finding a three-row SUV for five nights in the Aloha State became an impossibility. Her party settled for a Dodge Grand Caravan but it came at a cost.

Five days with the car cost $2100 James-Armand said or $400 a day compared with about $90 when she’d taken a trip to the Big Island in 2018.

“Finding lodging was no issue but finding a rental car was kind of a nightmare” James-Armand said.

A new wrinkle that may change the rental car market yet again is the coronavirus delta variant and the new masking and travel advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jana Tidwell AAA MidAtlantic manager of public and government affairs said AAA always emphasizes that travelers follow the CDC guidance if they decide to get out of town.

“It feels as though we are having a very different conversation about travel today than we were having just two or three weeks ago” Tidwell said.

She expects demand to drop after Labor Day after a summer season when travel demand was down just 2% overall from 2019 according to AAA’s figures. Business travel has not rebounded in the way leisure travel has Tidwell added.

Keli Laverty of West Chester wanted to explore Glacier National Park in Montana for a week and needed an eight-passenger vehicle for a week-long trip in late August.

“It was really impossible to find a car” said Laverty 43. She particularly worried that she’d reserve the large vehicle her family needed only to be stuck with a sedan.

She learned of the online car-sharing marketplace Turo which is like Airbnb but for cars. There car owners offer up their private vehicles to people looking to rent. Laverty was able to find a Ford Expedition in time for the trip even canceling a minivan also reserved through Turo that would have ended up being a real squeeze.

Various reports found some travelers renting U-Hauls or Home Depot pickups. And even this has had a trickle-down effect.

Curry of Downingtown tells how her daughter Anna Curry 24 recently moved from Wissahickon to Manayunk. She rented a U-Haul as she’d done several times before. But this time the younger Curry hit a snag.

“She paid more and she had to travel farther to get the vehicle” Curry said.

And like traveling itself venturing into the unknown for a rental car — such as on Turo — can have its upside.

Laverty and her husband Nate also 43 had an unusual adventure while on their trip. The group spent an afternoon at a waterfall where people could dive.

Nate and a friend watched another park patron jump into the 50-degree water but not surface. They waited and finally decided to jump in for a rescue. They managed to save the man but in the confusion Nate Laverty forgot the key in his pocket to the Expedition the group had rented on Turo. When they returned to the vehicle the soggy fob wouldn’t start the car.

The owners told the Lavertys that they would travel to the park pick up the car with a spare key and get it to them after the vacationing group hiked an hour and a half for cell service and over the phone explained that they needed the car the next day.

Keli Laverty said that the help from the car owners was an unexpected perk of renting through Turo. “I think the personal communication and the kindness of strangers to help us out essentially make a bad experience better” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvdG91ci1ncm91cHMtb25saW5lLWJvb2tpbmctc2l0ZXMtc2VlLWh1Z2UtanVtcC1pbnRlcmVzdC10cmF2ZWwtYmV0d2Vlbi1nZXJtYW55LWFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tour firms online booking sites see huge jump in interest for travel between Germany and Singapore,"Vaccinated travellers from Germany will be allowed to enter Singapore without isolation orders from Sept 8

Some travel groups and booking sites have seen a surge in enquiries since the announcement on Aug 19

People are not rushing to make bookings though they noted

They expect leisure travel to pick up towards the end of the year

SINGAPORE — Since the announcement that fully vaccinated travellers from Germany will soon be able to enter Singapore without needing to be serve a stay-home order some travel agencies and online booking sites have seen a surge in enquiries with one website seeing a jump of up to 70 per cent in the last 24 hours.

People who are travel-starved may have perked up at the news but this has not translated into bookings for flights or tour packages yet the agencies told TODAY.

Ms Mae Cheah president of tour operator Trafalgar Travel’s Asia arm said that it has received about 50 to 60 per cent more queries from people thinking of heading to Germany compared to a week before though bookings have not started to roll in yet.

The company is “ready to take in customers” and expects demand for travel to “come back with a vengeance” since many Singaporeans have not been holidaying overseas for the past 18 months.

Travellers from Singapore have been able to enter Germany without quarantine but it was on Thursday (Aug 19) that Singapore announced it will open its borders for fully vaccinated travellers coming from Germany from Sept 8 without the need to serve a stay-home notice.

This is provided that they meet a set of criteria including taking designated flights that serve only vaccinated travellers without transiting elsewhere. They will also have to undergo some tests after they are here.

With this move leisure travel between the two countries can soon resume without the need for lengthy isolation periods or quarantines.

From next month seven designated flights from Germany to Singapore each week taking only fully vaccinated passengers will be operated by Singapore Airlines and the German airline Lufthansa.

Ms Lavinia Rajaram who is head of communications for Expedia’s Asia-Pacific arm said that the latest developments have resulted in a surge in interest for travel between the two countries.

The booking site saw a 70 per cent spike in searches for travel from Germany to Singapore in the last 24 hours. This is even though Singapore is not a top 10 leisure destination for German travellers listed on the site.

On the other end Expedia saw searches for travel from Singapore to destinations in Germany grow close to 10 times the average since the last seven days.

Ms Sarah Wan general manager for Klook said that the booking site similarly observed that traffic went up five fold for write-ups on tourist activities in Germany after the announcement was made compared to the day before.

SINGAPORE TRAVELLERS ‘STILL CAUTIOUS’

On why there has not been a simultaneous jump in bookings in tandem with the spike in searches and enquiries Ms Wan said that people in Singapore may still be taking a cautious approach because they are not familiar with the travel guidelines and Covid-19 regulations that differ from place to place.

“Some may also be initially deterred by the multiple Covid-19 tests they have to take.

“We believe that interest will ramp up towards the end of the year once more Singaporeans get acquainted with the rules and guidelines and gain more confidence” she said.

Agreeing Ms Alicia Seah director of public relations and communications at Dynasty Travel said that sign-ups for tour packages will not come in so quickly because travellers are still looking into the costs and documents needed to adhere to the rules at the destination country.

She predicts that leisure travel will likely pick up around November to December.

INTEREST IN HONG KONG AND BRUNEI

Under the relaxed border measures fully vaccinated travellers from Brunei will also be able to enter Singapore from Sept 8 without having to serve a stay-home notice as well.

However travel agencies and booking sites reported mixed interest in Brunei among leisure travellers.

Expedia reported a more than 300 per cent increase in interest for travel between Singapore and Brunei compared to the last seven days.

However the country remains an unpopular travel destination among Dynasty Travel’s clientele. Ms Seah said that this may be because the temperature and environment in Brunei is similar to Singapore’s and holidaymakers are thus not keen to travel there.

Brunei currently has strict entry and exit restrictions for all travellers. They have to apply for a permit before entry and those allowed to travel to Brunei will have to be quarantined in designated hotels upon arrival with the period of quarantine depending on the Bruneian authorities’ assessment.

From Aug 21 border restrictions will be lifted as well for all travellers from Hong Kong and Macau regardless of their vaccination status.

They will have to apply for an Air Travel Pass to enter Singapore and they do not need to serve a stay-home notice when they are here though they would still need to undergo a polymerase chain reaction test when they arrive at the airport.

Vaccinated travellers from Singapore entering Hong Kong will still have to serve a 14-day quarantine because Singapore is deemed as a place of medium-risk infection there.

The tour groups and booking sites TODAY approached have seen mostly Hong Kongers wanting to come to Singapore.

Expedia saw an almost 450 per cent jump in searches for travel from Hong Kong and Macau to Singapore Ms Rajaram said.

Ms Millie Sze outbound tour manager of Ace Tours and Travel said that so far it has been Hong Kong permanent residents living in Singapore who are making enquiries because they want to go back to their home city.

“I’ve had about three such calls since last night asking if it’s possible to book a flight there” she said.",,,,,,,,,

The handset runs the familiar ColorOS 11.3 based on Android 11 and brings a couple of new features to the table. Aside from the Android 11-intrinsic ones the overall user experience is more polished.

A couple of interesting things we've noticed - there's haptic feedback for almost every UI interaction the RAM expansion feature allows for up to 7GB allocation of the storage space and HDR doesn't kick in even in YouTube. Even though the handset is Widevine L1-compliant for HD streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime.



Home screen app drawer recent apps quick toggles

Anyway the haptic feedback motor elevates the user experience as its punchy strong and precise. Interacting with most of the UI elements even when changing modes in the camera app for example triggers a certain vibration pattern. It feels really nice in the hand. The fingerprint reader's accuracy and speed is also great.



General settings and RAM expansion

The RAM expansion feature is nice but it's also hard to justify on a 12GB RAM phone which is the only configuration in India right now. Allocating any additional virtual RAM would bear no net-positive. It would just limit your available storage.

Lastly setting the screen refresh rate to 90Hz means it's on auto. Once you stop interacting with the screen the software reduces the refresh rate to 60Hz to preserve power. And this applies to pretty much every app or system menu we've tested.

Camera samples

The slightly altered Camera app UI brings out a couple of useful shortcuts directly onto the viewfinder and provides an easier and faster access to the ""More"" sub-menu. The camera hardware remains the same though so we expect similar if not identical camera performance like the Reno5 Pro 5G. Here are a couple of photos for you to look at.





Camera samples: Main camera • Ultrawide • Main camera • Ultrawide

Oppo is particularly proud of the Extra HD (108MP) camera mode which upscales the full 64MP photos to 108MP. And here's a side-by-side comparison with the 64MP shots.





Main camera: 64MP • Extra HD 108MP • 64MP • Extra HD 108MP

The AI Highlight Video is another key feature and Oppo even uses it as a reason to promote the phone as a videography expert. Unfortunately 4K@60fps video recording isn't a thing here just like its predecessors. The camera sensor and the hardware support 2160p@60fps recording but Oppo believes it's not a feature that many users would benefit from. It did say that it might bring it with a future software update. Oh and the AI Highlight Video mode is restricted to 1080p only.

Early verdict

A premium-looking phone with a powerful hardware on board that's the Reno6 Pro 5G. A nice paint job to go along with too. However as it's usually the case with Oppo mid-range devices it's a bit on the expensive side - perhaps too much for its own good. The Reno6 Pro 5G has a tough competition to match in India with the Poco F3 GT the Realme X7 Max 5G and even the OnePlus Nord 2 are offering better value for money.

Additionally Oppo's odd decision to bring only the 12GB/256GB storage variant to the market puts it in an exceptionally tough spot. The entry barrier is higher this way. In fact the Reno6 Pro 5G may very well be the most expensive Dimensity 1200-powered phone right now. And that's a bit hard to sell.",,,,,,,,,

A total of 180 students from six regions are set to benefit from a two-month job readiness camp.

According to organizer the not-for-profit Specialists in Sustained Youth Development and Research Inc. (SSYDR) the fourth “Employment Attack 102 – SSYDR Job Readiness Summer Camp” will see participation from students in regions One Two Three Four Five Six and Ten.

In a statement SSYDR explained that ExxonMobil Guyana is funding the camp which to date has benefitted 450 young people from across five regions.

This year the camp was expanded to include students from Region One.

It explains that the camp targets 180 students from specific secondary schools within the regions who will receive training that includes focus on personal development interpersonal communication work habits and conduct leadership and teamwork safety and health rights and responsibilities and financial fitness.

“This year we have upgraded our course content to include an introduction to entrepreneurship focusing on the characteristics of an entrepreneur presenting a business idea and risk” Magda Fiona Wills Founder/Executive Director of SSYDR Inc was quoted as saying.

The statement notes that students from all the regions except Region One will have the use of smartphones and data plans for online training while the youth in Region One will benefit from face-to-face learning with full observation of COVID-19 precautions and guidelines.

The statement explains that “Employment Attack 102” was conceptualized to reduce poverty and minimize its impacts on the vulnerable youth population. Towards this end it ensures participants are assigned coaches and together they develop an individual livelihood plan identify short and long-term goals and map out the process of achieving these goals. Partici-pants are also guided on the accumulation of necessary documents towards employment opportunities.

“ExxonMobil Guyana is pleased to continue its support for an initiative that has such a transformative impact” said Community Relations Manager Suzie DeAbreu is quoted as saying in the release. “As we continue to develop Guyana’s natural resources it is becoming increasingly necessary for young Guyanese to position themselves for growing opportunities.”

SSYDR credited ExxonMobil Guyana the Ministry of Educa-tion regional administrations and the Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company for their support in helping to make the programme a success so far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vbWVuYWZuLmNvbS8xMTAyNjYzMjE4L1FhdGFyZ2FzLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1mYWJyaWNhdGlvbi1vZi13ZWxsaGVhZC1wbGF0Zm9ybS1qYWNrZXQtdG8tc3VzdGFpbi1Ob3J0aC1GaWVsZC1Qcm9kdWN0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatargas completes fabrication of wellhead platform jacket to sustain North Field Production,"(MENAFN- Gulf Times) The new wellhead platform jacket first of its kind to be entirely fabricated in Qatar was completed on schedule and to the highest standards of safety and quality says HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi The new wellhead platform jacket first of its kind to be entirely fabricated in Qatar was completed on schedule and to the highest standards of safety and quality says HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi

Qatargas announced the completed fabrication of wellhead platform jacket (WHP12N) for the North Field Production Sustainability (NFPS) Project.

The jacket will serve as the steel frame to support a topside structure as part of a fixed offshore production platform.

The new jacket is one of the several new offshore structures that will be installed to ensure that production from Qatar’s existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) trains is sustained at 77mn tonnes per year (MTPY).

The new jacket is the first support drilling structure ever to be manufactured in Qatar for Qatargas and a formal ceremony was held at the Qcon fabrication yard located in Mesaieed to mark the milestone. The ceremony was attended by Qatargas CEO Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa al-Thani and executives from Qatar Petroleum ExxonMobil TotalEnergies Qatargas Saipem and Qcon.

Qatargas executed the initial jacket fabrication project on behalf of Qatargas 2 shareholders which include Qatar Petroleum ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.

The engineering procurement construction and installation (EPCI) contract for the WHP12N Jacket was awarded to Saipem in June 2020.

Commenting on the“landmark” achievement HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi also the president & CEO of Qatar Petroleum and chairman of Qatargas said“This new wellhead platform jacket which was the first of its kind to be entirely fabricated in Qatar was completed on schedule and to the highest standards of safety and quality clearly demonstrating the steadfast progress we are making to expand our project delivery capabilities skills and knowledge in Qatar. The delivery of this jacket in such a short timeframe is testament to the effective collaboration among Qatar Petroleum Qatargas and Saipem.”

Sheikh Khalid said“I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate the Qatargas project team Saipem Qcon and all those involved in completing this critical piece of infrastructure to help sustain production from the North Field. Despite numerous challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic the entire team has done an outstanding job – and without compromising the highest safety and quality standards that we set for all our projects.”

Highlighting the project’s outstanding safety performance the Qatargas CEO added“Everyone should be especially proud of the over 650000 workhours expended on this project without a lost time injury. This achievement is what pleases me most about this project.”

As the world’s premier LNG company Qatargas has a“well-proven track record of delivering major projects and operating onshore and offshore facilities in the North Field with world-class safety reliability and operational excellence.”

Jamshedpur Aug 21: The placements for the batch of 2018-22 at the Adityapur-based National Institute of Technology ( NIT ) began on an impressive note.

Initial figures suggest that the tech cradle of national repute is heading for another successful placement year.

Data available from the institute’s Training and Placement Cell revealed that in the last one fortnight ever since the online recruitment process began at the end of July around 120 students from various streams of engineering bagged plum jobs.

The batch-size for placement comprises over 500 students.

Placement of over 100 students within a fortnight of the beginning of the recruitment process is a record in the history of NIT. And this has happened against odds- the Covid-induced pandemic and lockdown restrictions in the state and other parts of the country.

Samsung R&D Bangalore’s Rs 35 lakh annual package stood out as the best offer so far for the batch. The second best offer of Rs 32.20 lakh was that of e-tailer giant Amazon.

Deloitte a leading MNC which provides consultancy topped the list of mass recruiters.

It recruited 33 students offering them an annual salary package of Rs 8.6 lakhs.

Amazon emerged as the second mass recruiter. It headhunted 32 candidates from various streams.

Business applications company Tekion by selecting 24 students emerged as the third mass recruiter offering the candidates an annual package of Rs 30 lakh per annum.

Qualcomm a US-based MNC took 14 students offering them an annual salary package of Rs 23 lakh.

Lowe’s India a business analytics company selected nine students offering them an annual CTC of Rs 19.34 lakh.

Exxon Mobil a petroleum and chemical manufacturing company took eight students offering them an annual salary of Rs 11.5 lakh.

The average CTC of computer science students was more than Rs 25 lakh per annum while the average CTC of electronics and communications engineering stream was more than Rs 22 lakh per annum. The overall CTC was more than Rs 17 lakh per annum.

Professor-in-charge of NIT’s Training and Placement Cell Prahlad Prasad said ” The placement process begun well. It was a record of sorts as this was for the first time over 100 students got recruited in such a short period of time.”

He went on to say that the companies which so far participated in the placement process were recruiting more students compared to last year.

” The placement process will continue for one year. We are expecting the participation of around 160 companies. Looking at the current trend of recruitments we are hopeful of achieving 90 per cent placements by October” he added.

Gunjan Kumar a B.Tech student who completed his internship at Intuit and was offered an annual salary package of Rs 35 lakh thanked the placement cell.

“All credits go to the training and placement cell team for this remarkable achievement. The constant motivation and guidance of our director Prof. K K Shukla also resulted in this year’s record placement so far with good salary offers” he said.

Gunjan was born and brought up in Ranchi. His father Vinay Kumar is a lab technician and his mother Shiwani Kumari Mehta works as a teacher in a government school.

Some of the other recruiters so far included Juspay Cashfree Intuit Tata Steel and Proc DNA a global consulting firm."

In an update Cena stumbled back into the ring after the SummerSlam pay-per-view went off the air but Lesnar went back in and attacked him. Lesnar delivered a few German suplexes and a F5 to leave Cena laying once again.

Lesnar then laughed a bit and looked down at Cena before making his exit. He marched to the entrance way and looked back at the ring one more time before heading to the back.

Lesnar hasn’t wrestled since losing the WWE Championship to Drew McIntyre last year at WrestleMania 36. At SummerSlam Bobby Lashley retained the WWE Title over Goldberg via referee stoppage.

Becky Lynch also made her WWE return last night defeating Bianca Belair for the SmackDown Women’s Championship in under a minute. The Raw Women’s Championship also changed hands with Charlotte Flair forcing Nikki ASH to submit to win the gold.

The S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week on concerns the Federal Reserve may be dialing back its monthly stimulus spending sooner than expected.

On Wednesday the Federal Reserve released its meeting minutes from its July meeting which suggested the Fed may begin tapering its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases before the end of 2021. However committee members said the economy still needs to make “substantial further progress” in employment before the Fed will consider raising interest rates.

Investors are also growing increasingly concerned that the spread of the delta variant of COVID-19 will derail or delay the global economic reopening. Stocks in the energy materials industrials and travel and leisure sectors which are all highly sensitive to the economic reopening traded lower on the week.

On Friday China continued its aggressive crackdown on domestic tech companies by approving a major new data protection law that will restrict the ways Chinese companies can collect and store user data starting on Nov. 1. Shares of Chinese tech stocks Alibaba Pinduoduo and JD.Com have all traded sharply lower in response to the crackdown.

COVID-19 vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson announced on Friday that vice chairman Joaquin Duato will take over for current CEO Alex Gorsky on Jan. 3 2022. Johnson & Johnson navigated a string of negative headlines during Gorsky’s nine years as CEO including lawsuits linking the company’s talc-based baby powder to cancer and a $26 billion settlement related to the company’s role in the deadly opioid epidemic.

Robinhood’s rocky report

Robinhood’s stock dropped more than 13% last week after the company released its first quarterly earnings report and warned investors that trading activity is slowing down.

This week investors will be watching earnings reports from JD.Com on Monday Pinduoduo on Tuesday and Salesforce and Snowflake on Wednesday.

Roughly 87% of S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter revenue exceeding analyst expectations so far in the second quarter the highest percentage of revenue beats since at least 2008 according to FactSet.

Economic numbers

Following the Federal Reserve’s recent taping commentary Wall Street will get more economic updates on Thursday when the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases its preliminary second-quarter U.S. GDP growth estimate and on Friday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers a speech at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium.

The Tour announced on Saturday afternoon that the final round of The Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City N.J. will be postponed from Sunday to Monday because of the approach of Henri forecast to slam into Long Island N.Y. Connecticut and other parts of New England early Sunday.

The National Weather Service has issued tropical storm warnings for Jersey City with the potential for 3-6 inches in rain and winds up to 73 mpg.

""Based on the projected path of [Hurricane] Henri and the Tropical Storm Warning that has been issued by the National Hurricane Center for the area where The Northern Trust is located there will be no play on Sunday"" the Tour said in a statement issues at 1:30 p.m. 20 minutes before the final twosome of Jon Rahm and Tony Finau teed off.

""Round 4 will be played on Monday"" the statement continued. ""Tee times and groupings for Round 4 will be published on Sunday afternoon with play on Monday slated to begin no earlier than 7:30 a.m.""

The top-125 players on the FedEx Cup points list gathered at Liberty National in the first of three playoff events. The top-70 on the points list will advance to the BMW Championship beginning on Thursday at Olympia Fields near Chicago.

The top-30 after that will advance to the Tour Championship Sept. 2-5 at East Lake in Atlanta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tLmF1L2dvbGYvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMjA1NzMzMS9qb24tcmFobS1sZWFkaW5nLW5vcnRoZXJuLXRydXN0LWNhbGxzLWZlZGV4LWN1cC1mb3JtYXQtdW5mYWly0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jon Rahm leading at the Northern Trust calls FedEx Cup format unfair,"JERSEY CITY N.J. -- Jon Rahm has competed in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs enough times to know how the system works.

And he doesn't like it.

""I don't think it's fair"" Rahm said Friday after a 4-under-par 67 gave him a 1-shot lead over Tony Finau through 36 holes at the Northern Trust the first of three playoff events that conclude in two weeks at the Tour Championship.

Ranked No. 1 in the world Rahm is fifth in FedEx Cup points and would go to the top spot if he wins the tournament. Another victory next week at the BMW Championship would make him an overwhelming FedEx Cup points leader.

But it would give him only a small advantage the following week in Atlanta when the top 30 players are reset according to their points position. The top player starts at 10 under while the next player is 8 under with various breakdowns down to the bottom five players starting at even par.

The system in its third year mirrors what would have been a points distribution and allows for there to be one winner of the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup. Previously the Tour Championship had a winner with the possibility of a separate FedEx Cup winner.

""I don't like that at all"" said Rahm who has played 36 holes without a bogey at Liberty National. ""No. I think you have the playoffs itself and if you win the first two and if you don't play good in the last one ... you can end up with a really bad finish.

""I don't like it. I understand the system. And the way I was told by one of the PGA Tour officials [if] I'm a Patriots fans and the Patriots win everything to get to the Super Bowl and they don't win the Super Bowl you don't win the Lombardi trophy right?

""My answer was they still finished second. They have to understand that golf is different.""

Rahm who is from Spain and attended Arizona State has a good understanding of football -- or American sports in general. The team with the best record gets no big advantage over its opponent in the playoffs aside from perhaps home field.

To Rahm's point a golfer could win every tournament all year and would still have just a 2-stroke advantage at the Tour Championship.

The tour has sought to balance having some volatility during its playoff events while also rewarding players for a strong season. Collin Morikawa for example missed the cut at the Northern Trust. Ranked No. 1 in FedEx points the Open Championship winner is projected to drop to No. 6.

But he will easily qualify for both the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship regardless of his results. In a true playoff he might be done but the tour wants those who have strong years to be in Atlanta.

""I understand it's for TV purposes and excitement and just making it more of a winner-take-all and they give you a 2-shot advantage but over four days that can be gone in two holes"" Rahm said. ""I don't know what system is best. I do like going to East Lake with this new one in the sense of knowing where you stand and what you have to do. In years prior there were so many different combinations of what could happen. It was hard to get your head focused on one thing.

""But I don't think it's a fair system in that sense now but it's the one we have and it's what we've got to deal with.""

For now Rahm can only worry about the tournament at hand and while he has produced a mixture of great shots and great saves to reach 12-under 130 he still has his hands full.

""Believe it or not hit my fair share of bad shots today'' Rahm said. ""Much like yesterday I was able to save a couple of good ones. ... Coming into the weekend I'm definitely going to have to clean a couple of those mistakes up.''

Finau had a 64 with a bogey on the final hole as he tries to secure another spot among the 30 who make it to the season-ending Tour Championship along with boosting his bid to play his way onto another Ryder Cup team.

Olympic gold medalist Xander Schauffele tied his personal best on the PGA Tour and the course record at Liberty National with a 62 and was in the group at 10-under 132 along with Justin Thomas (69) and Keith Mitchell (64).

Thomas who shared the 18-hole lead with Rahm couldn't figure out which way the ball was going in making four bogeys in eight holes only to play his last five holes in 5 under -- that included an eagle at the par-5 eighth -- to stay in the mix.

Mitchell did his work at the start of his round by running off six straight birdies a streak that ended on the 18th hole as he made the turn. He took two shots to get out of a longer bunker and made double bogey on No. 7 only to close with two birdies. More is at stake for Mitchell who is No. 101 in the FedEx Cup and needs a high finish to be among the top 70 who advance to next week at the BMW Championship.

Jordan Spieth got back in the game with consecutive eagles -- he holed out from the fairway on the par-4 fifth and holed a chip from the edge of the water on the par-5 sixth -- and tied the course record himself at 62. That left him 4 shots behind along with Brooks Koepka (64).

Spieth started the day worried about making the cut especially after a bogey on the opening hole. He ended it in a tie for 10th and figures he led the field in luck with those eagles.

""When things starting well you go on a run right? You get momentum and the ball finds the cup and when it's not going well it bounces the wrong way'' he said. ""I feel like I'm on the right side of some momentum right now and I just have to keep it going.''

For others their season is over. Adam Scott who missed a 4-foot putt in a playoff that would have won the Wyndham Championship last week followed an opening 67 with a 75 to miss the cut by 1 shot. He was among 28 players outside the top 70 in the FedEx Cup who missed the cut.

Zach Lean a grocery delivery driver for Shipt was punched by one of the teen bicyclists and hit his head on the sidewalk around 10:18 p.m. on the 300 block of Christian Street police said. He was knocked unconscious and had a seizure before medics took him to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.

Police said that they are still searching for suspects and that there is camera footage of the incident.

Lean 38 was completing his last order for the night around the time of the attack according to his wife Christine Torrisi-Lean. She said Saturday that Lean had undergone surgery on his skull and is on a ventilator in Jefferson’s neurological ICU.

“It’s not something you ever imagine having to hold up through” said Torrisi-Lean 31. “I love him so much and all I want is for him to come back to me.”

She said she awoke around 3 a.m. Wednesday to phone messages from the hospital that turned her world upside down. Torrisi-Lean is still trying to make sense of the attack noting Lean’s car wallet and other items were not stolen. She asked for the attackers to come forward.

“I just wish that we could get these gangs of kids some sort of help and some sort of other activities to do so that they’re not doing this to other families” she said. “I mean this could happen to anyone. It wasn’t even that late at night.”

There is a GoFundMe page supporting Lean’s medical expenses. The couple were married in May and Torrisi-Lean has read her wedding vows to her husband in the hospital.

History of Liberty National Golf Club

Established in 2006 Liberty National Golf Club has hosted the Northern Trust three times in 2009 2013 and 2019 respectively.

Liberty National plays to 7370 yards and par 71. Major renovations were completed after players criticized the course in 2009. The tournament moved to Ridgewood Plainfield and Bethpage Black as Liberty National's renovations were ongoing. A total of 12 greens were retooled and 12 tee boxes were altered.

Situated on a former landfil a golf-course dream was turned into reality by Paul Fireman his son Dan architect Bob Cupp and pro-consultant Tom Kite.

Here’s a breakdown of the major golf events Liberty National Golf Club has hosted over the years:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNjYXN0aW5nLmNvbS9jb2xsaW4tbW9yaWthd2EtcmVjZWl2ZWQtMi1taWxsaW9uLWluZnVzaW9uLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC1kZXNwaXRlLW5vdC1oaXR0aW5nLXNpbmdsZS1zaG90LXBnYS10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collin Morikawa Received a $2 Million Infusion to His Bank Account Last Weekend Despite Not Hitting a Single Shot ...,"Collin Morikawa continues to rake in the dough just three years into his impressive PGA Tour career. The 24-year-old phenom has already earned $14 million on the course as a pro including more than $7 million in winnings this season alone.

Last weekend despite not hitting a single shot on the PGA Tour Morikawa still found a way to add another $2 million to his bank account.

In the words of Lil Wayne: “Real G’s move in silence like Lasagna.”

Collin Morikawa’s brilliant PGA Tour season

We thought Morikawa wouldn’t be able to replicate his incredible 2020 season in which he won two tournaments secured his first major championship trophy and finished sixth in the FedEx Cup standings.

Well we sure were wrong about that.

All Morikawa did in 2021 to follow up that performance was win two more tournaments become the Champion Golfer of the Year qualify for his first Ryder Cup notch a career-high eight top-10s and bank $7 million in winnings. Oh and he also enters the FedEx Cup Playoffs in the No. 1 spot in the standings.

This is only the beginning for the young superstar.

PGA Tour players are competing for millions of dollars in winnings every week. But in the bigger picture they have their sights set on the $15 million FedEx Cup grand prize from the first tournament of the year to the last.

Morikawa enters the playoffs as the man to beat in that respect as he finished the regular season in the No. 1 spot in the Comcast Business Tour Top 10. The 10 players on that list get to split a $10 million pot for their sustained success throughout the regular season.

The winner’s share? Oh just $2 million.

Morikawa didn’t even need to play in last weekend’s regular-season finale at the Wyndham Championship to secure the top spot on the list and he still saw his bank account grow by $2 million.

Now that’s an efficient weekend.

World No. 3 looking to add $15 million more in the FedEx Cup Playoffs

Morikawa has earned just over $14 million in on-course winnings in just three years on the PGA Tour but he has a chance to double that in one day. If he can hold on to his No. 1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings and win the TOUR Championship next month Morikawa will bank another $15 million. Yeah you read that right.

$15 million.

So does Morikawa believe he’s the man to beat this postseason?

“Yeah I think so” Morikawa said on CNBC’s Halftime Report this week. “I’ve shown it throughout the regular season. Obviously finishing first in this Comcast Business Tour Top 10 shows a lot of consistency but this is a three-week stretch of a lot of golf. I’m kinda looking at this playoffs as a whole not necessarily three separate events. But I want to peak in this final event.”

Yeah with $15 million on the line — I bet you do Collin. I bet you do."

Torrential downpour descended onto the Fifth Third Bank Stadium pitch but play continued until a lightning strike lit up the blue and gray skies overhead.

A delay was put into place but the game was able to restart after a minimal delay of 30 minutes.

Right after the teams retook the field the Owls recorded their best chance of the half as Aila Swinton placed a shot right over the Blazers' crossbar.

While Kennesaw State was able to convert its first chance since the restart UAB progressed well up the field from their goal kick; just a little over a minute after Swinton's opportunity a flick from Birmingham Ala. native Ava Martin put the Blazers 1-0 up.

UAB doubled its lead from a penalty shot but the Owls were able to put together their most fluid play after being two goals down.

Breon Grant was substituted into the match and one of her first actions was winning a corner after carrying the ball up the length of the pitch. A dangerous corner was put in and chaos ensued in the Blazer's box until junior forward Erin Miller pounced on the loose ball. Not only was the breakthrough the first goal of the Owls' season but it was the first in Millers' collegiate career.

Kennesaw State continued to apply pressure for the remainder of the fixture but were unable to find an equalizer. The final whistle blew with the scoreline favoring UAB two goals to one.

The Owls continue to look for their first win of the season and will hope to find Thursday Aug. 26 against the College of Charleston at 6 p.m.

HERE’S one that was prepared earlier- an 1970s-built eco-aware house reckoned to be the first in Ireland to sport solar panels: it's an early work by one of the world’s most renowned sustainable design architects William McDonough described by Time magazine a “Hero for the Planet.”

Acclaimed sustainable design architect and author of Cradle to Cradle William McDonough at one of his first designs a one-off home in Shanagarry east Cork in the 1970s for potter Elizabeth Neave

Set on Old Road Shangarry in east Cork this quirky and indeed pioneering one-off home with its south-facing gable wall covered in primitive examples of solar panels came to market in the same week the world was shaken out of its stupors on the urgency of the need for action on Climate Change with the planet’s crisis deepening and both global temperatures and sea levels rising alarmingly.

Rear of the house.

Set near the Shanagarry potteries long associated with the Pearce family this distinctive and experimental solar warmed home was built for potter Elizabeth Neave when she was working with pottery founders Philip and Lucy Pearce.

Home owner Elizabeth Neave (RIP) worked as a potter at Shanagarry/Stephen Pearce Pottery for many years.

It was done effectively as a student design project by William McDonough almost half a century ago while he was studying at Yale aged in his 20s.

Since his star has risen meteorically; he's considered a guru of sustainable design and the circular economy getting the Presidential Award for Sustainable Design as far back as 1996 and he’s the author of numerous books and papers including the seminal tome on sustainability Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way we Make Things (2002) TED speaker and contributor the Huffington Post.

And it started out here in Shanagarry.

It’s quite the global interconnected web spun around Shangarrry.

Originally born in Sydney and herself the daughter of an architect Stacey Arthur Neave Elizabeth Neave first worked in London as a primary school teacher before deciding she’d like to be a potter despite no formal training.

Elizabeth Neave (RIP) who worked as a potter at Shangarry.

She threw her lot in with potter Philip Pearce who’d started his pottery in Shanagarry in 1953 and which continues via his son Stephen and she became a core member of the pottery team as it grew to quite an enterprise says her nephew Harry Headley whose mother Mary was Elizabeth Neave’s sister and who married in Kent in Cork.

Living room with high ceiling facing the front of the house.

He was in Cork this week to oversee the sale of this property sadly ending a long half-century family link and he recalls decades of happy family visits to his aunt by the East Cork coastline with sea glimpses from some of the property’s novel letterbox-like windows and other view points over the marshes.

After she retired from potting with Pearces his aunt got her own kiln and did her own work as a hobby and while she toyed with idea of returning to Australia where she still had family she was happy to see out her days in Shanagarry coping well with the multi-layered home created for her by William McDonough a modern taken on the type of whitewashed Irish cottage she once wanted but couldn’t find in the area in the 1960s.

Harry Headley thinks his aunt met the young student architect Mc Donough via Simon Pearce (a glassworker) and entrusted him with her home hopes and “he appeared happy to give it a go.2 Still standing sturdily it’s a simple enough detached c 1500 sq ft block-built house with up to three bedrooms and the rooms seemingly spiral upwards through several levels with floors done in familiar-looking terracotta tiles – the same red fired tiles as seen in nearly every Pearce family property and/or shops.

Kitchen.

It’s now ‘of its time’ with plain interiors simple timber fittings and white painted walls with a large wood-burning stove installed after damage from an accidental fire in an earlier open fireplace ironically an example of increased energy efficiency in a design set out 50 years ago hinting at it designer’s future glittering career in the sustainable design sector.

Within a walk of Shanagarry village near the sea and beaches it’s set at the end of a 100 metre long approach avenue in a rustic setting.

Distant seaview.

On a split level garden with double car port and glasshouse this fascinating and indeed pioneering homestead is newly for sale for the first time ever with estate agent Der O’Riordan of Barry Auctioneers who guides at an even €300000 noting the design connection with McDonough as “a globally-recognised leader in sustainable development and design” adding “it will attract a lot of interest and is a must-view to appreciate the flow and airy feel of the property.”

And the solar panels? Well they worked and still adorn the walls but their efficiency levels were low unsurprisingly given the more primitive levels at the time of what was still an emerging nascent power source from the sun.

VERDICT: With its gable wall of solar panels this Cork home showed a way towards more sustainable design that has taken much of a slow-learning planet decades to catch up on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcGliLmdvdi5pbi9QcmVzc1JlbGVhc2VJZnJhbWVQYWdlLmFzcHg_UFJJRD0xNzQ3ODQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTPC commissions largest Floating Solar PV Project in the country,"Ministry of Power

NTPC commissions largest Floating Solar PV Project in the country



The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC ) Ltd has commissioned the largest floating solar PV project of 25MW on the reservoir of its Simhadri thermal station in Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh. This is also the first solar project to be set up under the Flexibilisation Scheme notified by the Government of India in 2018.

The Solar PV project was inaugurated today by Shri Sanjay Madan RED (WR2 & SR) NTPC .

The floating solar installation which has a unique anchoring design is spread over 75 acres in an RW reservoir. This floating solar project has the potential to generate electricity from more than 1 lakh solar PV modules. This would not only help to light around 7000 households but also ensure at least 46000 tons of CO2e are kept at arm’s length every year during the lifespan of this project. The project is also expected to save 1364 million litres of water per annum. This would be adequate to meet the yearly water requirements of 6700 households.

The 2000MW coal-based Simhadri Station is the first power project to implement an open sea intake from the Bay of Bengal which has been functional for more than 20 years.

NTPC is also planning to set up a hydrogen-based micro-grid system on a pilot basis at Simhadri.

With a total installed capacity of 66900 MW NTPC Group has 71 Power stations including 29 Renewable projects. NTPC has set a target to install 60 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2032. NTPC is also India's first energy company to declare its energy compact goals as part of the UN High-level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE).

The group has over 17 GW of capacity under construction including 5 GW of renewable energy projects. Uninterrupted supply of electricity through environment-friendly energy projects at affordable prices has been the hallmark of NTPC.

It will produce power from more than a lakh of solar PV modules for lighting 7000 households. The project will annually save 46000 tonnes of CO2 emission and 1364 million litres of water which is adequate to meet the requirement of 6700 households in a year.The project was inaugurated by regional ED (western and southern) Sanjay Madan in the presence of Mohit Bhargava ED of the company’s renewable energy arm RE NTPC and Simhadri chief GM Diwakar Kaushik.The floating solar plant is part of the coal-burning behemoth’s plan to turn green by adding a 60 gigawatts renewable energy capacity by 2032. It is also the first solar project to be set up under the power ministry’s 2018 ‘flexibilisation’ scheme allowing generators to supply power from any of their sources based on plant efficiency to reduce discoms’ cost.NTPC is also building a 100 MW floating solar power plant on the reservoir of its Ramagundam thermal power station in Tamil Nadu.

“I was like ‘It’s too early to be playing games man’ ’’ Cole recalled Sunday.

Cole also said this to Henderson: “You can’t be for real.’’

The response from Henderson?

“I’m serious.’’

This was Saturday morning and the news was this: Cole a first-year wide receiver facing long odds to make the Giants roster was going to be used on defense. As a cornerback. In a real live preseason game. And that is what happened as the Giants lost to the Browns 17-13 at FirstEnergy Stadium on Sunday.

“We looked at the amount of guys that we were going to play we knew depth at some point was going to be an issue we knew it was going to be hot’’ head coach Joe Judge said. “We turned around and said ‘Let’s let Matt go out there. Let’s see what he’s got.’ ’’

As it turned out Cole gained the admiration of his teammates as well as of Judge for what he was able to handle in an admittedly foreign situation.

“I’m proud of the way Matt competed’’ Judge said.

Giants wide receiver Matt Cole took snaps at cornerback in Sunday’s preseason game. AP

Cole did not catch a pass on offense and got roughed up a bit on a 15-yard kickoff return. The plan was to use him on defense although he had not played cornerback since his high school days in Chicago. When defensive backs Madre Harper and Quincy Wilson both left the field with injuries the Giants had no choice but to stick Wilson — wearing No. 83 — in at corner.

The Browns and quarterback Kyle Lauletta — a former Giants draft pick — did not target Cole right away. He seemed to get beat deep by receiver Davion Davis but the pass was overthrown. Most impressively on a third down Connor Davis caught a pass for a 6-yard gain and Cole — all 5-foot-10 and 197 pounds — stuck his shoulder down and tackled the 6-foot-8 271-pound tight end short of a first down.

“That was really amazing’’ safety Julian Love said. “He was really aggressive he was putting his hat on the ball. All the respect for what he did for us. We were fired up he wasn’t playing passive and in a situation like that it’s easy to fall back. But he went at it.’’

Cole 24 went undrafted out of Division II McKendree University and kicked around with the Dolphins 49ers and Jets before the Giants claimed him off waivers this month. When he went in on defense the Giants basically had a 10-man huddle while Cole received special instructions from the sideline as far as coverage and alignment assignments.

“I don’t want to toot my own horn but I don’t think a receiver caught a ball on my side’’ Cole said.

When someone joked to him “Cole Island’’ he had a quick correction.

“Cole World’’ he said. “I think I did pretty good.’’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcHJvL2Jyb3ducy8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2NsZXZlbGFuZC1icm93bnMtdHJveS1oaWxsLWRpc2NpcGxpbmVkLXByYWN0aWNlLWZpZ2h0LW5ldy15b3JrLWdpYW50cy1zdGVybGluZy1zaGVwYXJkLzgxOTQwMTYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Browns' Troy Hill disciplined for fight with Giants' Sterling Shepard,"CLEVELAND — In making the risky decision to punish cornerback Troy Hill by playing him Sunday Browns coach Kevin Stefanski briefly pulled back the curtain and revealed how tough he can be.

During a 17-13 preseason victory over the New York Giants at FirstEnergy Stadium the reigning NFL Coach of the Year showed he is more old school than we thought.

There probably won't be 100-yard gassers or an Oklahoma drill in the team's future. But Stefanski isn’t just building the Browns by striving to improve Baker Mayfield’s accuracy the defense’s tackling and the linebackers’ ability to cover tight ends.

In his second year Stefanski is setting a standard for respect for sportsmanship for putting the team first for sound decision-making on and off the field.

On Sunday he also drove home the point that they must do what they're told or there will be consequences.

That’s what it takes to change the culture what it takes to become a perennial Super Bowl contender what it takes to win a championship. For years the Browns didn't just need more talent they needed discipline.

Stefanski sat most of his starters on both sides of the ball for the second preseason game against the Giants. The heat index at kickoff was 88 degrees and the bright sun sent a large number of fans home early.

But Hill 29 a Youngstown native and a prized free agent from the Los Angeles Rams played all but the final defensive series in the first half.

That was the penalty for what happened Friday after the second of two joint practices against the Giants was completed at the Browns’ CrossCountry Mortgage Campus.

Players from both sides were chatting on the field. Many had departed when Hill began trading punches with Giants receiver Sterling Shepard. None landed.

The incident was witnessed by the Browns media corps and captured by two photographers but Stefanski knew nothing about it when he spoke afterward.

“That’s news to me. Thank you for breaking that to me” Stefanski said.

Shepard was interviewed by New York media after practice but they didn’t see the incident and didn't ask him about it.

Browns linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. attempted to downplay what happened saying Hill and Shepard weren’t serious.

“I'll review the tape” Stefanski said.

Obviously Stefanski did and he did not agree with Walker. Hill was in the slot or played in the nickel for three of the defense’s four first-half series before donning a ballcap on the sideline at the start of the third quarter.

Stefanski was asked if the decision to play Hill was related to Friday's skirmish and if so what went into the decision. Stefanski did not directly answer yes but neither did he offer the excuse of being short-handed on defense as a coverup.

""All those things I’ll keep between Troy and myself and keep that internal"" Stefanski said.

With the punishment Stefanski opened himself up to second-guessing on social media. But those criticizing the move did not hear Stefanski say that he started telling his players there would be no fighting against the Giants even before he addressed it in a team meeting.

When quarterback Baker Mayfield spoke Friday Mayfield was asked about his trash-talking with Giants running back Saquon Barkley with whom he trained before the 2018 draft. Then the subject of whether Mayfield wanted to play a series or two in preseason came up.

""If I'm lucky"" Mayfield said. ""Coach said if I start a fight at practice I have to play. So me and Saquon might swing today.”

If Stefanski pounded that priority all week he had to stick to it. Such inconsistencies don't go unnoticed by NFL players.

Of course there are concerns about the Browns’ rebuilt defense this season especially since it has not been together for one training camp practice because of injuries.

Greedy Williams injry:Browns cornerback suffers groin injury in preseason game

Safety Grant Delpit coming off a torn Achilles a year ago aggravated a hamstring problem Wednesday. Linebacker Jacob Phillips suffered a torn biceps tendon against the Giants on Thursday and could be lost for the season. Cornerback Greedy Williams who missed all of 2020 with nerve damage in his shoulder left Sunday's game with a groin injury. Linebacker Montreal Meander (Achilles) re-signed on Friday was carted off late in the third quarter. Linebackers Sione Takitaki (hamstring) and Tony Fields II (foot) were absent as were safety Sheldrick Redwine (ankle) and cornerback M.J. Stewart Jr. (hamstring).

That list seemed evidence enough not to play Hill especially since he’s a big part of the revamped defense’s plan.

But for Stefanski the contradictory message that would have sent the double standard it would have set likely trumped the gamble he took.

Stefanski cannot establish his core principles and apply them only to young players. Established veterans — Hill is beginning his sixth season — cannot be exempt. If Stefanski said fighting would have consequences it had to have consequences.

Chances are Stefanski didn’t just review Friday’s tape he might have shown it to the team. Then on Sunday he figuratively showed the rest of the NFL world.

What Stefanski expects of his players and staff go much further than the horn that sounds at the end of practice or the end of games.

Stefanski got lucky that the discipline of Hill didn’t backfire. But it was a risk worth taking to show he means what he says that smart tough and accountable aren’t just words thrown around Berea.

In Stefanski’s domain they are words to live by. And what Hill did on Friday was not smart even if his punches hit only air.

Smith's future hold?,"In the wake of reports that Max Kellerman will be departing ESPN’s “First Take” thus ending his fragile alliance with Stephen A. Smith there is no shortage of speculation surrounding MeMax’s future at the network.

Industry sources confirm Kellerman will likely move into a hybrid role with TV and radio components. What about Smith? He will probably debate a rotating cast of ESPN voices on the Max-less “First Take.”

Combined with the other ESPN platforms he presides over and the possibility of more opening up Smith’s role as the face of ESPN will expand.

Yet even with a heavy workload and all this going for him including being in the second year of a five-year deal worth between $8-$10 million per is this what Smith really wants?

“He’s got bigger fish to fry” a source said.

ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith reportedly has his eyes set on late-night TV.

Last March Smith said he his sights are set on becoming a late-night gabfest host. “I want to be in that lane someday” Smith said at the time.

On Monday night Smith gets his chance. He will fill-in for Jimmy Kimmel as guest host on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

“I ain’t ever given an opening monologue in my life where the objective is for me to be funny” Smith recently told Rickey Smiley on the comedian’s Morning Show. “They want me to be funny and told me it [the monologue] would be between 12 and 14 minutes. ‘Stephen A’s World’ [his ESPN+ show] is a segue for me going into late-night [TV].

“We have not had an African American in late-night since Arsenio Hall.”

It’s not a reach to suggest as Disney (ESPN/ABC’s parent company) and other media giants look for more and more content Smith’s itch to host a late-night show could eventually be scratched.

SAS said he is looking forward to a show where he won’t have to constantly criticize or go negative. “I want to celebrate my guests and their talents” Smith said. Snoop Dogg is scheduled to be one of the guests on Monday’s show.

Smith still performs in other areas. He recently finished appearing in an episode of ABC’s “Black-ish” which will air at a later date. He also continues appearing on “General Hospital” a long-running daytime soap opera.

Nonetheless while SAS has an eye on his future the present is plenty challenging. Despite their tenuous partnership Smith and Kellerman (Molly Qerim Rose moderates the proceedings) produced ESPN’s highest-rated daily show. Without Kellerman Smith will either get all the credit if the ratings success continues. Or all the blame if the numbers fall.

That’s just the reality of SAS’ world. Whether it be in the day or at night.

UNFILTERED DAVE

The Giants are finding new ways to cover Dave Gettleman’s tuchis.

On Wednesday the GM went back-and-forth with boss scribes who asked him questions about tight end Kyle Rudolph’s offseason foot surgery and how long it would take him to recover. Apparently no one knew Rudolph who missed the last four games of the season with the Vikings needed surgery until after he signed a two-year $12 million free-agent contract with the Giants.

The good albeit embarrassing stuff in Gettleman’s exchange with the reporters was edited from the video posted on the Giants’ website.

Luckily Giants’ website Gnomes don’t write Gettleman’s material.

Although they probably wish they did.

NOAH SOLUTION

There is something Noah Syndergaard can do about the often-outrageous travel schedule teams playing on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” are forced to follow.

Thor wigged on Twitter that after their “SNB” game with the Dodgers last week the Mets had to fly to San Francisco and play the Giants Monday night. To hear the injured pitcher you would think the Mets were all crammed into coach (by the toilet) rather than cruising on a private charter.

Here’s the deal: Syndergaard needs to tell Steve Cohen the owners should accept less money from ESPN for the rights to “SNB” in return for controlling the TV schedule. He will find out Cohen and the other owners would rather let the players fly all night as long as ESPN is paying maximum TV moo-la-dee.

TWEET HEARD ‘ROUND THE CITI

No matter how individual media membranes reacted to Cohen’s “It’s hard to understand how professional hitters can be this unproductive…” tweet there is a bottom line: They all can only hope that Cohen decides to micro-manage the team on social media.

More action on Twitter would show the man actually has a pulse. That he actually cares about his fan base. Face it. Cohen was playing the role of Goody Two Shoes with his tweets about black jerseys. Or asking what kind of ballpark food Mets’ fans enjoy. This amounted to condescending crap.

Besides can above-it-all billionaires be caring too? Do they give a hoot about the unwashed masses especially those foolish enough to pay their hard-earned dough to watch the inferior product Cohen puts on the field?

Would the real Cohen standup? Can you believe that some Gasbags after one harsh/critical tweet even compared him to George Steinbrenner?

Please. Win something first. And Steinbrenner would already have publicly beaten up on Sandy Alderson. And he would have made some public noise questioning why Jacob deGrom has been on the shelf so long.

Something One Tweet Cohen has yet to do.

AROUND THE DIAL

Give Kim Jones credit. Working with Sal Licata she was able to calmy and coolly cut through some of the Mayor of Panic City’s runaway rants and make her points. This set an entertaining dichotomy for their few days working together on WFAN. Licata riffed on Cohen saying the owners’ tweet would play negatively in the clubhouse because prior tweets had “preached positivity.” Jones pushed back saying Cohen found a “perfect way” to grab the Mets attention. The duo’s opposite styles produced compelling radio. … Carton-Chameleon: Depending on the moment the man becomes a quick-change artist. Craig Carton’s three Thursday WFAN interviews with the commissioners — Rob Manfred Gary Bettman Adam Silver — featured insightful pointed questions and a frills/shtick free give-and-take. Now if Carton can only get Roger Goodell to agree to a one-on-one that would be lovely. Carton’s partner Evan Roberts was on vacation and did not participate in the soiree.

The reason? They have a shared origin story. However after their foundation they went off in completely different directions. So let’s dive into the money-burning world of two very young manufacturers.

It all starts in a garage

There are wonderful examples of great things that started in a garage. Jobs and Wozniak working on the first Apple computers or the band members of Metallica practicing their hard rock riffs. In this case I’m obviously talking about a slightly different garage.

Feng Changge was assistant judge in the legal system of Henan province for a decade before he quit that job in 2002 and decided to become entrepreneur and investor. His first activities are in real estate including a golf course but in 2005 he turns his attention to the automotive sector. He sets up a BMW dealership in Zhengzhou City. It is quickly followed by a Lexus dealership and he then starts building a chain of stores for luxury and ultra-luxury cars. Maserati Bentley and Lincoln are among the brands he sells. Initially his activities concentrate on Henan province but following growing success there he sets up dealerships in several tier one cities around the country.

China Harmony dealership

Feng’s business does very well in the growing luxury market and in the early 2010s the company is restructured with separate real estate and automotive branches. The company name is China Harmony Industry Group and the automotive branch China Harmony Auto is listed on the Hong Kong Exchange in 2013. That provides Feng with a healthy sum of cash.

At the time the Chinese government had just started to put its money on New Energy Vehicles and provided serious subsidies for the development and sales of these cars. Feng spots an opportunity and pours the money into China Harmony New Energy Auto a fund for investments in China’s growing NEV sector. Contrary to many of his fellow countrymen Feng does not have the ambition to become a car manufacturer himself he just wants to be an investor. China Harmony NE takes its first steps as automotive investor when it acquires a majority stake in Green Field Motor in May 2015 but more on that later.

Green Field car (unbranded)

Just following the acquisition in June of the same year China Harmony NE itself forms an even more important investment fund jointly created with two major players in the technology sector. The partners in this fund are Hon Hai Precision Engineering a Taiwanese electronics company with many factories in China. We know this company as Foxconn manufacturer of the iPhone. The other partner is Shenzhen Tencent Holding a game developer competitor of Alibaba and developer of the WeChat app.

The joint fund of these three companies is Harmony Futeng or more correctly the full name of the fund is (hold on tight): Henan Harmony Futeng Internet & Intelligent Electric Vehicle New Energy Partnership. I explicitly mention the full name because it clearly describes the ambition of the three partners: to invest in electric vehicles which are equipped with all kinds of internet-based mobility solutions. Shareholding ratio is Harmony 40% Foxconn 30% and Tencent 30%.

The short history of Green Field Motors

Zhejiang Green Field Motors Co Ltd is a large production facility set up with money of the local government of Hangzhou Bay in June 2010. This is also the hometown of Geely. The company boasts about four complete production lines including stamping welding and painting. It is primarily a supplier for the industry producing various parts but they step up to being a car manufacturer in 2012. That year they start producing a sub-compact crossover type vehicle without logo’s. The idea is to sell the car as complete knock down kit to car manufacturers abroad. There was talk of a significant project in India but I can’t find out if it actually got off the ground.

Green Field BO90 (with company logo)

In 2014 Green Field also shows the same car with its own logo and they call it BO90. That probably attracts the attention of China Harmony and they see an opportunity to turn the company into an EV producer. What China Harmony quickly finds out during the acquisition process in 2015 is that Green Field is not licensed for the Chinese market and that the BO90 or any future EV may not be sold at all. Still China Harmony persists in the takeover on the promise by the Hangzhou Bay government that they will ensure such a production permit.

China Harmony’s RMB 300 million capital injection into Green Field is dependent on the permit but it is never issued. That seals the faith of the company as we’ll see in the next chapter.

Aichi Automobile (Aiways)

On New Year’s Eve 2015 Harmony Futeng founds a company named Zhejiang Aichi Internet Intelligent Electric Vehicle. It keeps 55% of the shares for itself 28% is awarded to China Harmony for injecting Green Field into the company and 17% is reserved for (future) management. The addition of Green Field into this company is of course to secure future production capacity but the plan quickly falls apart. The production permit is not forthcoming China Harmony denies to pay the promised amount and the company is in trouble. China Harmony compensates the initial shareholders of Green Field but leaves the debts with the creditors. Green Field is not heard from again.





Green Field’s massive but unused factory in early 2016

Harmony Futeng puts two automotive heavy weights at the helm of Zhejiang Aichi. Co-founder and CEO is Fu Qiang a man who crafted his career through the sales and marketing departments of FAW-Volkswagen and Mercedes China and ended up as the CEO of Volvo Cars. Co-founder and CFO is Gu Feng up till then the long-time CFO of SAIC Motor and director at several of its subsidiaries.

First order of business for these two men is creating production capacity after the Green Field disaster. They establish a new company called Jiangxi Yiwei Automobile Manufacturing an 51/49 joint venture with the local authorities of Shangrao City in Jiangxi province with the sole purpose of building a state of the art smart factory. With that project underway they can focus on the further development of the company.

Aiways factory in Shangrao

It’s a recurring subject with startup companies especially in the extremely capital intensive car industry but getting your hands on some money for R&D and growth of the company is essential. Like all its fellow startups Aichi goes through several financing rounds. In February of 2017 the company gets its current structure when Harmony Futeng pulls out altogether. Assets of Zhejiang Aichi are transferred to a new company called Aichi Automobile and shareholders now include the two co-founders and a large number of private investment funds. In the last year or so there’s much speculation about an imminent IPO. Aichi Automobile seems to be preparing listings both at the Shanghai STAR Exchange and at some American stock market.

Aichi presents its first car at the Beijing Auto Show in April 2018. The brand name is revealed as Aiways the concept car goes under the name of U5 Ion. It’s a mid-sized SUV in the mainstream segment. Aiways has been quite ambitious with the car. The platform traction motors and most of its ADAS and self-driving systems are in-house developments. Aiways emphasises user-friendliness and internet connectivity. The battery cells are supplied by CATL but Aiways does make its own battery packs.



Aiways U5

About a year later trial production starts in the Shangrao factory where the first stage with a capacity of 100.000 vehicles is finished. Still to be solved is the production permit problem. At first it seems Aiways wants to do a complicated licensing deal involving Jiangxi authorities but in August 2019 Aiways takes hold of Landwind instead. Landwind is brand of Jiangling Holding a joint venture between Jiangling Motor Group and Changan. Besides Landwind Jiangling Holding also makes JMC cars and operates a joint venture with Ford. The JMC and Ford assets are removed from Jiangling Holding and then Aiways takes an 50% share leaving the initial shareholders with 25% each. Now Aiways owns a production permit. In 2021 Aiways sells its 50% share in Jiangling Holding to the Jiangxi government while retaining the right to use the production permit.

Series production of the Aiways U5 starts in December 2019 right between the NEV sales crunch (after cuts in government subsidies) and the Covid-pandemic. So timing could be better and the U5 doesn’t get the same traction in mainstream media as technology leaders NIO or XPeng maybe because of its slightly utilitarian looks and good-but-not-great specs. Sales in the domestic market have not been impressive but Aiways always looked beyond borders. It ships quite a few cars to Europe.



Aiways U6

Aiways is in Europe since its formal founding in 2017. The company names Roland Gumpert (former Apollo sports car founder and lead engineer of the Audi Quattro rally cars) its product development director while setting up Gumpert Aiways Automobile GmbH in Ingolstadt and an European headquarters in Munich. Gumpert Aiways develops a 1200 hp sports car with the name RG Nathalie. The sports car is an RE-EV with an 70 kWh battery and a methanol fuel cell range extender. Aiways has invested in methanol fuel cells. They have a technical collaboration with Blue World from Denmark and are building a factory in China with a capacity of 80.000 fuel cell assemblies per year. These fuel cells run on methanol and don’t require the large high pressure tanks like hydrogen.



Gumpert Aiways RG Nathalie

Another interesting collaboration is with Prologium from Taiwan. Prologium is a battery maker that is currently building a gigafactory for solid-state batteries. Information on progress has been sparse but Prologium is promising affordable solid-state cells in the very near future. Aiways is likely to be first car manufacturer to use them.

Aiways U7 Ion (concept car)

Aiways recently introduced its second car the U6. This is basically a liftback/coupe version of the U5 but with much more pronounced exterior styling. The company hopes this car will force a breakthrough in its domestic sales and raise its profile in Europe. The next project is a larger SUV already previewed as U7 Ion. Aiways wants to enter the American market with that car and become a global car manufacturer.

Future Mobility Corporation (Byton)

Only months after Aiways Harmony Futeng creates its second NEV brand. On the 1st of March 2016 they establish Future Mobility Corporation (FMC) in Hong Kong. The company credits Carsten Breitfeld and Daniel Kirchert as its founders. Breitfeld is a former BMW R&D director and project manager of the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car project. Kirchert is also a former BMW executive (in sales and marketing) but worked as managing director of Infiniti China in the 4 years prior to 2016. The two founders recruit some high profile staff from BMW Nissan and Tesla.





Byton M-Byte

The Chinese operations are set up in the early part of 2017. FMC receives some additional funding from the Jiangsu government to establish its headquarters and factory in Nanjing. The operating company Nanjing Zhixing New Energy Vehicle Technology Development is founded in April. In September FMC starts the factory construction and also reveals its commercial brand name: Byton. The Hong Kong entity Future Mobility Corporation is subsequently renamed Byton Ltd.

Byton’s concept for a large SUV is revealed in January 2018 on the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Byton follows the Harmony Futeng principles far more closely than Aiways did because the M-Byte concept is a high tech vehicle. It promises 5G internet connectivity surround cameras advanced self-driving technology and is referred to by its creators as ‘extension of your living room’ or ‘moving electronic wearable’ depending on the occasion. The technology approach is envisaged for customers by a giant 48″ touch screen stretching the entire width of the car. Half a year later Byton shows the K-Byte concept a large sedan with similar specifications.

Look mine is 48 inches

With both car development and factory construction well underway Byton has to start worrying about a production permit. The company starts cozying up against large state-owned manufacturer FAW and reaches a technical cooperation agreement in April 2018. Two months later in a second financing round FAW also becomes one of the shareholders of Byton. FAW then provides the solution for the production permit: their long unused sub-brand Huali once a manufacturer of Daihatsu-licensed minivans has such a permit and is sold to Byton.



Byton K-Byte

With subsidiaries set up in Germany and California the factory being finished pre-ordering for the M-Byte started and another successful round of financing in the first half of 2019 Byton looks like being on a roll. Then suddenly and without explanation CEO Carsten Breitfeld leaves the company. It should have been a warning sign but it takes another year for the drama to unfold.

In early 2020 Byton starts trial production of the M-Byte and about 200 units are assembled. The car is registered for sale with the Chinese authorities. All that’s missing is a high profile public launch of the car. And then it all collapses.

In April Byton furloughs most of its staff because it can’t pay the wages. Two months later all operations are ceased because there’s no cash anymore to pay suppliers. It turns out that Byton burned through almost $1 billion in eight months and the money supply has dried out because of the Covid-pandemic. However with a production ready car a state-of-the-art factory and wealthy backers this must be a company that can be saved easily.

In September a new operating company Nanjing Shengteng Automobile Technology is founded in some sort of debt to equity scheme with FAW becoming the largest shareholder. The state-owned manufacturer presents a rescue plan that involves redesigning the M-Byte with (cheaper) FAW technology and appointing part of the Nanjing factory for the production of FAW’s Hongqi brand. Apparently this plan is rejected by the other shareholders. Amidst all the troubles Daniel Kirchert leaves Byton in October 2020.

Byton M-Byte (pre-production model)

In January of 2021 Byton signs an agreement with Foxconn worth $200 million for a limited restart of operations right away and full operations in 2022 with Foxconn assisting Byton in manufacturing and supply chain management. Remember Foxconn is one of the founding investors through Harmony Futeng. It seems like the lifeline for Byton but recent developments create new doubts. The German subsidiary goes bankrupt the American subsidiary has almost no staff left and is unable to pay its lawyers and according to the latest rumors all Chinese operations have ceased again in July.

Is this a power play between FAW and Foxconn? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? It’s hard to say but this week we spotted a sign of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Drivers in the United States as they have annually for nearly four decades bought more Ford F-series trucks than any other type of car. Those in countries like Argentina and Australia preferred Toyota pickups and Swiss drivers typically opted for a mid-sized sedan made by the Czech brand Skoda. That's all according to data from the website BestSellingCarsBlog.com which analyzed the car brands that topped sales charts in different countries around the world last year.

Toyota topped all other auto brands in 2020 global sales overtaking Volkswagen to regain the title as the world's best-selling car brand for the first time in five years. Toyota sold more than 9.5 million vehicles in 2020 which was down 11.3% from 2019 ⁠— but a less precipitous drop-off than Volkswagen's 15% decline to 9.3 million cars sold in 2020.

Globally Toyota also sold the most cars in a whopping 44 different countries around the world according to data compiled from BestSellingCarsBlog.com by the site AutomotiveTouchup. Volkswagen was again second topping the rankings in 14 countries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zZWVrLWxvdy1jb3N0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWV0aG9kcy82MDA3MTM3Lmh0bWzSAWxodHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zZWVrLWxvdy1jb3N0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWV0aG9kcy82MDA3MTM3Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Car Companies Seek Low-Cost Production Methods,"

Electric vehicle companies are racing to become the next Tesla but want to avoid Elon Musk's early problems with production.

So companies like Arrival and Fisker are taking very different roads to overcome such issues.

A few have found investors who are willing to spend billions to finance their startups. Rivian has raised around $10.5 billion from Amazon.com and Ford Motor Company. It is set to begin production on electric vans trucks and SUVs.

Startup companies without enough investment money need less costly ways to produce a lot of vehicles in a short time. If they cannot they risk having the problems Tesla had in its early years.

The remarkable thing is that Tesla was not ruined financially in reaching mass production Musk told Reuters news agency.

The traditional method of many carmakers has been to spend above $2 billion on a big factory to build 240000 or more vehicles each year.

Arrival has chosen instead to build electric van and bus ""microfactories.” They are small factories that cost $50 million and have fewer pieces of expensive equipment. Arrival does not need special equipment to paint its vehicles because they are made of lightweight colored plastic. Painting equipment can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Arrival plans microfactories close to major markets around the world. This will let them hire local workers and lessen shipping costs.

The money a company must raise ""to do this the traditional way…keeps startups from coming forward with new ideas"" said Mike Abelson. He is the North American head of Arrival.

The company raised about $660 million from selling shares of its company in its March public offering. Now it is building two U.S. plants. One is in North Carolina and will make vans. The other is in South Carolina and will make buses. In addition it is building a factory in Spain. Abelson said Arrival will announce more factories later this year.

Production in microfactories

Arrival's first microfactory in Bicester England will serve as the model for other plants. The lack of painting equipment is just one way the company will avoid the costs of traditional vehicle making.

The startup's engineers have built molds for plastic vehicle parts costing thousands of dollars. That is far less than the millions of dollars needed for traditional metal equipment. Arrival's engineers have also designed their own molding machines.

Abelson said Arrival needs around 70 robots for each microfactory. And it is buying only commonly used basic robots from long-time car industry suppliers.

Going small means that Arrival can produce 10000 vans each year in each microfactory rather than 100000 Abelson says. Also each microfactory will create around 250 jobs. That is not close to the many thousands of jobs created by larger plants in the past.

""That means if a plant doesn't work out it's not a disaster for a local economy"" Abelson said. ""A major car plant closing is a big hole to fill.""

‘Work our way backwards’

Electric vehicle maker Canoo has taken a similar path. But leader Tony Aquila said Canoo will build a larger microfactory to serve as a center for smaller future factories.

Electric Last Mile Solutions plans to launch a small electric van in the United States later this year. At first it will reassemble prefinished vehicles made in China at an old General Motors plant in Indiana. There it will add new safety features to meet U.S. regulations.

Company head James Taylor said this will at first save hundreds of millions of dollars on equipment. As profits grow it will add in more American parts over time. ""We'll work our way backwards"" Taylor said.

Other startups are doing production overseas to cut costs.

Israel-based REE is looking at agreements with American Axle and Mitsubishi to help build its electric platforms.

Both REE and Fisker have also teamed up with Canadian car supplier Magna International to build their electric vehicles. Fisker has a similar agreement with Taiwan's Foxconn Technology.

MARK RUSHBROOK Global Director Ford Performance

THIS IS THE SEVENTH WIN IN A ROW FOR FORD AT THIS TRACK AND THE HERITAGE TROPHY IS STYAING IN DEARBORN. YOUR THOUGHTS?

“This is such a big deal for our company for our employees. To come here and race in front of all of our employees and their friends and families and have Ryan (Blaney) go get that win with Team Penske and Roush Yates power. We are taking the Heritage Trophy back to Dearborn.”

RYAN BLANEY No. 12 Menards/Cardell Cabinetry Ford Mustang -- VICTORY LANE INTERVIEW

THAT LAST RESTART THAT START ON THE INSIDE FOR YOU PROPELLED YOU TO THE WIN:

“Yeah we were going to be fourth and the front row was open. You have to take the front row. It gave us a shot to win the race and Kyle (Busch) gave us a really good push to get us clear into turn one and then I was playing defense. We were wide open. Especially with Larson and William (Byron) laying back and tryin gto get runs. That made it tough. It was cool to persevere all day. We didn’t start off very good but we worked on it all day and found ourselves in a spot to capitalize on it at the end and did that. A very cool day and nice to be in victory lane here in Michigan. This is huge for Ford and Mr. Penske and a lot of fun.”

HOW MUCH DID YOU WORK ON THE CAR THROUGH THE DAY?

“All day really. The first run wasn’t very pretty. We slid backwards pretty good and we put packer in the right front and did a lot of stuff to try to free it up. There were a lot of changes but hopefully it paid off in the end and the last restart went our way too and we were able to hold those guys off the last 10 laps or so. That was stressful. That is not the ideal way to race just blocking everybody but it is what you have to do nowadays and Josh did a really good job up top. It is nice to be in victory lane.”

HOW COOL IS IT TO MAKE SURE TODD GORDON GOT AT LEAST THIS ONE MORE WIN?

“Well we talked to Edsel Ford before the race and he was wanting to get Todd another trophy here before he retired and told us to make sure we do that today. We will try to get Todd a few more before the season is out.”

YOU MENTIONED EDSEL FORD WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU TO DELIVER THIS WIN AND THE HERITAGE TROPHY TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY?

“It is huge. We come up here every year and know it is important to the Blue Oval and the Ford family and Mr. Penske as well. It is a really big race for all of our group including the Penske side. To have Edsel here I haven’t seen Edsel in over a year so it was great to have him out. I am excited to get him in victory lane. Everyone from Ford does so much for us. It really is a big family and I am just happy to be a part of it.”

MATT DIBENEDETTO No. 21 MasterTech/Quick Lane Ford Mustang

“We had a rocket for a while. Then something went sideways. We didn’t change anything but we lost the handle on it. I am not sure what exactly happened. Either way we made good calls and the team did a good job. We got the day going really good and were really fast and then had some things go wrong. We had trouble on a pit stop and had the car go a little off and then had to rebound at the end and fight. My spotter Doug does an excellent job and we work together well. We were super aggressive and made it back up. It was a proud team effort.”

BRAD KESELOWSKI No. 2 Discount Tire Ford Mustang

“We were really good in the sun. Those scattered clouds at the end took away a little too much handling I think. We had a pretty good Discount Tire Ford. I am bummed. I wanted of course to get a win and I hate that I had that contact with the 3. That really sucks for everybody. It really hurt our day and obviously ruined his. That was crappy. So it goes.”"

The decision follows advice from Government that the Springboks and Wallaroos would not be able to enter New Zealand to play the matches due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The All Blacks were scheduled to play South Africa at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin on Saturday September 25 and at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday October 2.

The Black Ferns were scheduled to play the Wallaroos at Rugby Park Christchurch on Sunday September 26 and at Eden Park as part of a double header with the All Blacks.

NZR has also confirmed that given the current uncertainty over The Rugby Championship schedule it has made the decision not to send the All Blacks to Perth this weekend for the third Bledisloe Cup Test which was scheduled to be played at Optus Stadium on Saturday August 28.

Ticket holders for the matches in Auckland and Dunedin will receive a full refund and will be contacted by the respective ticket providers in due course - Ticketek for Forysth Barr Stadium and Ticketmaster for Eden Park.

New Zealand Rugby CEO Mark Robinson said every effort had been made to keep the two Tests in New Zealand.

'We share the disappointment of our fans players and other stakeholders particularly those in Dunedin where the sold-out 100th Test between the All Blacks and South Africa was shaping up as a very special occasion” says Mark.

'However after discussions with Government it is clear that the COVID-19 travel restrictions meant there was no way of bringing the South African and Wallaroos squads into New Zealand and we understand the importance of putting the health and safety of New Zealanders first.

'Without complete certainty on the team's next movements around The Rugby Championship we felt it was prudent for the team to stay put in New Zealand until SANZAAR have announced the full tournament schedule” says Mark.

'Once the team leaves our shores they currently can't return until November 23 post their Northern Tour so given the uncertainty it makes sense to pause and get more clarity on these fixtures.

'We remain 100 per cent committed to playing in the entire Fortinet Rugby Championship in 2021 and are working closely with SANZAAR to look at a range of options to reschedule these important matches.”

SANZAAR will make further announcements around the Rugby Championship schedule in due course.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote to Fox News in response citing just a small fragment of Carlson's long racist record  and noting that ""Carlson has suggested that the very idea of white supremacy in the U.S. is a hoax."" Greenblatt concluded ""Carlson's full-on embrace of the white supremacist replacement theory ... and his repeated allusions to racist themes in past segments are a bridge too far. Given his long record of race-baiting we believe it is time for Carlson to go.""

Predictably enough Fox News and its ownership refused to take this seriously. Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch responded by falsely claiming that ""Mr. Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory."" But the only evidence he offered didn't sound like rejection only an attempt to sanitize Carlson's remarks through denial and reframing: ""As Mr. Carlson himself stated during the guest interview: 'White replacement theory? No no this is a voting rights question.'""

It's worth looking back at that episode now for several reasons. First Carlson has again been pushing ""Great Replacement"" discourse more recently this time by attacking the idea of bringing Afghan refugees to the U.S. in the wake of the Taliban's lightning conquest of that country. Second because Fox News' defense of Carlson has only supported the spread of this racist conspiracy theory. Third because that theory has a bloody record of inspiring mass murder — not incidentally but as a logical consequence of its central argument.

""The great replacement is very simple"" its originator French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus has said . ""You have one people and in the space of a generation you have a different people."" In this formulation immigration is equated with genocide which logically requires or demands genocidal violence in response.

And then there's the final reason: Because the ""Great Replacement"" and a family of similar almost interchangeable conspiracy theories — claiming that Western culture and civilization are being destroyed by immigration which is permitted or enabled by weak or malicious cosmopolitan elites often though not always identified as Jewish — effectively defines a radical shift in conservative ideology over the last few years. Indeed one could almost call it a great replacement of previous conservative thought.

Here's a key portion of what Carlson said in April:

Now I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term ""replacement"" if you suggest the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate the voters now casting ballots with new people more obedient voters from the Third World. But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually. Let's just say it! That's true.

Renaud Camus could not have said it better. That was no rejection of the theory; if anything it was an overt embrace. As conservative Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson noted  ""Nearly every phrase of Carlson's statement is the euphemistic expression of white-supremacist replacement doctrine."" It was Gerson wrote ""what modern poll-tested shrink-wrapped mass-marketed racism looks like.""

In fact it's much more than that. For two decades Republicans have been screaming about organized voter fraud while never producing any evidence. So here is a new and much darker conspiracy theory so sweeping that it does not rely on hard evidence but has even more sinister implications.

This past week Carlson helped spearhead right-wing opposition to welcoming Afghan refugees who aided the 20-year U.S. war effort. He understood that argument was a tough sell and framed it around a familiar trope telling his millions of viewers they were being manipulated by unnamed conspiratorial elites:

You should be happy you live in a country where your neighbors love children and dogs and want to help refugees. We are a generous and empathetic people and we can be proud. Unfortunately there are many in our ruling class who are anxious to take advantage of our best qualities. They see our decency and weakness and they exploit those things and they do it relentlessly. ""Let's try to save our loyal Afghan interpreters"" we tell them. ""Perfect"" they think. ""We'll open the borders and change the demographic balance of the country.""

There is no evidence for this of course. It's pure paranoid fantasy — but not Carlson's alone. He's only a transmitter of extremist views into the mainstream. A key source for these views is the notorious 1973 novel ""The Camp of the Saints"" by French right-wing author Jean Raspail which argued that mass migration is an invasion that will eventually destroy Western culture and replace Western populations that Western political elites lack the moral strength to defend their civilization and therefore that the invaders must be physically removed or destroyed. When I interviewed retired intelligence analyst James Scaminaci III last year he described how the novel's paranoid vision has inspired an entire worldview:

The main variations within this ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview are whether the political elites lack moral strength to resist the invasions (""Great Replacement"") enact immoral policies which weaken Western societies to invasion (""demographic winter"") or actively collaborate with the governments of the invading migrants to facilitate the invasion (as in John Tanton's network). The other variation distinguishes the neo-Nazis from all the other segments: whether or not the Jews are responsible for the destruction of their societies (""white genocide"").

These variations can bleed together. Catchphrases like ""great replacement"" or ""white genocide"" easily cross the boundaries Scaminaci describes as part of their lingua franca. So does the record of terrorism. Here are some examples.

On July 22 2011 right-wing terrorist Anders Breivik murdered 77 Norwegian citizens (mostly teenagers) and injured an additional 319 at the same time electronically distributing a 1518-page conspiracist manifesto calling for the deportation of Muslims from Europe and dividing blame between Muslims themselves and ""cultural Marxism"" an alleged Jewish conspiracy to destroy Western culture and civilization by promoting multiculturalism and undermining traditional values.

The manifesto used the terms ""cultural Marxism"" or ""cultural Marxist"" more than 600 times and plagiarized almost the entirety of William Lind's 2004 Free Congress Foundation book ""'Political Correctness': A Short History of an Ideology"" the most significant text promoting the theory which uses the terms ""cultural Marxism"" ""political correctness"" and ""multiculturalism"" almost interchangeably. The book disappeared from the FCF website shortly after the massacre. But Breivik was doing exactly what Lind had called for. He just did it a little too quickly.

On Oct. 27 2018 Robert Bowers killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. Before the attack he referenced the anti-Semitic variant ""white genocide."" Bowers had a record of posting anti-Semitic comments on Gab attacking the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). One congregation at the synagogue had participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the week before and Republicans were trying to whip up hysteria about migrant ""caravans"" during the midterm election campaign. Referencing those Bowers posted on Gab that ""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics I'm going in.""

On March 2019 Brenton Tarrant live-streamed himself killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand. In advance he released an 74-page online manifesto called ""The Great Replacement"" elaborating on Camus' ideas and citing Breivik as an inspiration. The manifesto included neo-Nazi symbols although Tarrant denied being a Nazi calling himself an ""ethno-nationalist"" and an ""eco-fascist."" Equating immigration with genocide he wrote  ""Radical explosive action is the only desired and required response to an attempted genocide"" underscoring the inherently violent nature of this worldview.

On April 27 2019 the last day of Passover white supremacist John Earnest killed one person and injured three others at a synagogue in Poway California. He posted a letter of explanation which the ADL summarizes:

The letter includes a laundry list of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories including the longstanding white supremacist assertion that Jews are responsible for non-white immigration which ""threatens"" the white race . ""Every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race"" the letter states adding ""… For these crimes they deserve nothing but hell."" This mirrors the language used by both Bowers and Tarrant prior to their attacks.

On Aug. 3 2019 white supremacist Patrick Crusius opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso Texas. The final death toll was 23  with almost two dozen others wounded. As the ADL reported  Crusius' manifesto claimed that his attack was a ""response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas"" and that he was merely defending his country from ""cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion."" What's more he also claimed that ""he did not intend to target the Hispanic community until he read 'The Great Replacement.'""

This is the conspiracy theory Tucker Carlson is spreading with Fox's explicit blessing. More than that what Scaminaci calls the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview ""is widespread in right-wing media think tanks and political parties."" He continued:

Thus there is very little difference between the rhetoric of right-wing media and the rhetoric of right-wing terrorists or mass murderers. The manifesto of the El Paso terrorist and nightly broadcasts of Fox News or the tweets of Donald Trump are remarkably similar. Right-wing elites may be ""shocked"" by these periodic massacres but they keep priming the pump. In turn these massacres create new right-wing ""heroes"" and ""martyrs"" and spur others to beat their ""score"" while spreading the conspiracy theory further.

Even more than the massacres noted above this points to the most frightening aspect of all: a transformation in conservative ideology which promises more such massacres. In 2012 Arun Kundnani shed light on this in "" Blind Spot? Security Narratives and Far-Right Violence in Europe "" published by the International Center for Counter-Terrorism at the Hague in the aftermath of Breivik's attack.

""Every perception has a blind spot the area that cannot be seen because it is part of the mechanism of perception itself"" Kundnani writes. ""This paper considers whether since 9/11 the far‐right has been the blind spot of counter‐terrorism the problem that could not be perceived clearly because it had begun to absorb significant elements from official security narratives themselves.""

This absorption was in fact only one aspect of a longer-term transformational process Kundnani identified. He describes a threefold evolution of far-right ideology in Europe which has allowed it to move into the mainstream from the fringes. Post-World War II neo-Nazi parties were ostracized for decades but this began to shift from the 1980s onward with a focus on culture rather than race followed by the latest evolution in the wake of 9/11.

""In the 'counter-jihadist' narrative the identity that needs to be defended is no longer a conservative notion of national identity but an idea of liberal values seen as a civilizational inheritance"" Kundnani explains. ""Islam becomes the new threat to this identity regarded as both an alien culture and an extremist political ideology. Multiculturalism is seen as enabling not just the weakening of national identity but 'Islamification' a process of colonization leading to the rule of sharia law.""

Summing up Kundnani writes ""In moving from neo‐Nazism to counter‐jihadism the underlying structure of the narrative remains the same but the protagonists have changed: the identity of Western liberal values has been substituted for white racial identity Muslims have taken the place of blacks and multiculturalists are the new Jews.""

That phrase ""the identity of Western liberal values"" should set off alarm bells coming from neo-Nazi-affiliated political activists. It's perhaps best understood in terms of something else promoted by the above-mentioned William Lind a pioneer of white supremacist ideology which I've written about before : fourth-generation warfare.

In 4GW — to use a shorthand familiar to aficionados — Carl von Clausewitz's distinctions between the government the army and the population collapse. There is no clear dividing line between war and peace combatant and non-combatant or as Tucker Carlson may see it between immigration and invasion — or even genocide. It is above all a war of perceptions a war for legitimacy. So when it comes to defining the identity of Western liberal values the current Republican obsession with defining freedom as the freedom to infect others with a deadly virus shows just how ludicrous a war of perceptions can become — and still have a legitimate chance of succeeding.

Scaminaci also told me that Matthew Feldman and Paul Jackson co-editors of the book "" Doublespeak: The Rhetoric of the Far Right Since 1945 "" argue that far-right movements have engaged in what they call ""fifth-column discourse"" described as a ""form of deception and political cunning intended to attack an enemy from within; in this case by aping the language of liberal democracy."" That's clearly similar to Kundnani's argument.

I asked Scaminaci whether racist right-wingers claiming to be defenders of Western values offer a paradigmatic example of fourth-generation warfare and also whether that helps explain Tucker Carlson's man-crush on Viktor Orbán Hungary's autocratic leader.

He agreed adding that the version of 4GW articulated in this instance was ""extremely clever."" He turned to Kundnani's description:

This new ""identitarian"" narrative makes the defense of Western civilization and Enlightenment values from invading Muslims and Islam central to its appeal. The new internal enemy are the multiculturalists instead of the Jews. This is consistent with a larger conservative narrative of the ""clash of civilizations."" One consequence of this new narrative is that the Jews and Israel are now potential allies. But this new narrative is entirely consistent with the central argument of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview.

Indeed support for Israel has a double appeal: First to fight Islam second to provide cover for continued anti-Semitism on the right. The older narratives haven't gone away just because new ones have emerged. For some ""cosmopolitans"" may have replaced Jews on their enemies list. For others that's just rhetorical code.

As for Carlson's bromance with Orbán Scaminaci said:

Tucker Carlson is following a well-worn path. Orbán embraced this ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview and made it the centerpiece of his political strategy. Orbán and [Benjamin] Netanyahu were allies and white nationalists found encouragement in casting Israel as a white-settler enclave worth defending. When Donald Trump went to Poland in July 2017 he delivered a ""Camp of the Saints"" or ""Great Replacement"" speech.

There's another dimension to the story not yet mentioned the ""Eurabia"" variation of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview as explained by Scaminaci:

Trump and Orbán were following the path laid out by Egyptian-Jewish author Bat Ye'or in the 1990s. Ye'or in her ""Eurabia"" writings brought Jews and Christians together to fight against a Muslim invasion of Europe. Ye'or made common cause with proponents of the Serbian genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina as did William Lind the originator of fourth-generation war. This Serbian genocidal policy was then imported into the Republican Party and the Christian right. Tucker Carlson is just the latest in a long line of Bat Ye'or followers.

Kundnani's description of the evolution of neo-Nazi narratives into ""counter-jihadist"" narratives was framed in a European context where multiparty democracies allowed extremists to use existing party structures to claw their ways into the political mainstream. America is locked into a two-party system that presents a different dynamic and Nazi ideology was never strong in the U.S. So the lines weren't as clearly drawn and the evolution wasn't as obvious or direct. But a similar story can be told about American politics as well Scaminaci said:

By now everyone is familiar with Lee Atwater's observation that the Republican Party used sanitized and abstract concepts like taxes rather than more crass and vulgar white supremacist terminology. GOP rhetoric from the 1980s up to Trump used sanitized code words to appeal to ... voters feeling their status was being threatened from below or they were being abandoned from above by Democratic Party elites. Trump dropped the dog whistles [and] never abandoned his central narrative that his key strategist Steve Bannon had borrowed and pushed into the conservative media ecosystem namely the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview. Trump may not be a true card-carrying white nationalist but he's close enough that they immediately recognized him as a kindred spirit.

The ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview provides a new framework for conservatism an overarching narrative that connects things together more tightly than postwar conservatives ever managed in the past. If ""invading hordes of immigrants"" are the enemy and falling white birthrates are key to the problem then the right's misogynist agenda and its xenophobic agenda are much more tightly linked than ever before.

Connections with Christian nationalism — an Old Testament-based worldview fusing Christian and American identities — are similarly strengthened. A 2018 paper "" Make America Christian Again "" which I wrote about here in 2018 explained that ""Christian nationalism … draws its roots from 'Old Testament' parallels between America and Israel who was commanded to maintain cultural and blood purity often through war conquest and separatism.""

In short all the major electoral facets of American conservatism are more tightly unified by the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview than they ever were or ever could have been in the days of William F. Buckley or Ronald Reagan. What's more the practical need to suppress voters of color becomes a central ingredient.

As Scaminaci put it: ""The underlying motivation of the Great Replacement and voter suppression is the same: Nonwhite voters are inherently illegitimate because they vote for an illegitimate political party that itself poses an existential threat to Western civilization or America or White America or White Americans because it conspires with external nonwhites to destroy the country.""

So the Great Replacement that has actually taken place is the replacement of the ideas ideals and mores of conservatism. As debased and depraved as those had already become they have now been supplanted by much darker principles which have deadly real-world consequences and pose an existential threat to what remains of American democracy.

""The right wing wants to use the language of liberal democracy and of the Enlightenment"" Scaminaci said in conclusion ""but the right wing is intellectually incoherent"":

It no longer has a governing philosophy. Thus it must make its appeals to resentments to frustrations to anger and to fear using liberal language in defense of Enlightenment values — while their arguments make little or no sense and cannot withstand scrutiny. But there is an underlying logic and that is the logic of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview. And they continue to develop rhetorical and narrative strategies to make that worldview palatable and electable.

Those rhetorical and narrative strategies will necessarily involve doublespeak of which Tucker Carlson is a master. For example in June David Neiwert author most recently of "" Red Pill Blue Pill: How to Counteract the Conspiracy Theories That Are Killing Us "" called out Carlson for inverting the reality of demographic change in the Mountain West in a further extension of replacement theory.

Carlson had suggested on his prime-time show that Montana Idaho and Nevada now face ""similar problems"" to the demographic change right-wingers view as catastrophic in California: ""The affluent liberals who wrecked California aren't sticking around to see how that ends. They're running to the pallid hideaways of Boise and Bozeman distorting local culture and real estate markets as they do it.""

Neiwert responded that as ""a fourth-generation Idaho native with family in Montana I can tell you that this is a complete inversion of the historic demographic reality in those places"":

It could only be accurate if viewed from a very short-term perspective — and even then it's wrong. Idaho and Montana have only become deep-red Republican states in the past decade or two. Prior to that they were classic ""purple"" states electing a mix of Democrats and Republicans. What changed that was an in-migration of right-wing voters .

We can expect more such gaslighting arguments in the days ahead. The far right now finds itself deeply at odds with the Western values it pretends to defend. Even if it has convinced the vast majority of conservative voters to go along it can only hope to gain and hold power by standing those values on their heads — including most fundamentally the biblical value of not bearing false witness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3JlbW90ZS13b3JrLW1heS1ub3ctbGFzdC1mb3ItdHdvLXllYXJzLXdvcnJ5aW5nLXNvbWUtYm9zc2Vz0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvcmVtb3RlLXdvcmstbWF5LW5vdy1sYXN0LWZvci10d28teWVhcnMtd29ycnlpbmctc29tZS1ib3NzZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remote work may now last for two years worrying some bosses,"With the latest wave of return-to-office delays from Covid-19 some companies are considering a new possibility: Offices may be closed for nearly two years.

That is raising concerns among executives that the longer people stay at home the harder or more disruptive it could be to eventually bring them back.

Many employees developed new routines during the pandemic swapping commuting for exercise or blocking hours for uninterrupted work. Even staffers who once bristled at doing their jobs outside of an office have come to embrace the flexibility and productivity of at-home life over the past 18 months many say. Surveys have shown that enthusiasm for remote work has only increased as the pandemic has stretched on.

""If you have a little blip people go back to the old way. Well this ain’t a blip"" said Pat Gelsinger chief executive officer of Intel Corp.  whose company has benefited from the work-from-home boom. He predicts hybrid and remote work will remain the norm for months and years to come. ""There is no going back.""

Return dates have been postponed repeatedly. On Thursday Apple Inc. told corporate employees that its planned return to U.S. offices would be delayed until at least January. Companies such as Chevron Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. have postponed September returns while tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. have pushed them to early next year. Lyft Inc. said it would call employees back to its San Francisco headquarters in February about 23 months after the ride-sharing company first closed its offices.

Prudential Financial Inc. delayed its office reopening from September to October at the earliest though Rob Falzon vice chair of the company said that date could change too depending on health conditions.

Prudential plans to allow for a mix of in-person and remote work once U.S. offices reopen. But the longer people stay at home the more Mr. Falzon worries about employees feeling disconnected. ""My single greatest concern is around talent"" he said. ""As individuals disassociate themselves with their organizations from a cultural standpoint it becomes increasingly easy for them to make decisions to leave and go elsewhere.""

Already many employees are ""bombarded"" with messages from recruiters and friends attempting to lure them elsewhere he said. ""When they’re in the workplace I think they have a broader sense of connection to the platform to the culture of the organization—their fellow employees their teams—that makes them less inclined to want to leave"" Mr. Falzon said.

JOB POSTS REQUIRING COVID-19 VACCINES SOAR: REPORT

Even so what many have concluded over time is that their companies can operate largely effectively while remote executives and workers say. After months spent hunched over kitchen tables some employees say they have settled into a more comfortable rhythm of remote work. Others have finally sprung for more ergonomic desks or chairs at home. As more time passes until offices reopen it could become difficult to convince existing employees to willingly upend their new lives and return to pre-pandemic schedules in offices executives say.

Perceptions of remote work have shifted as the pandemic has gone on. When professional-services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP surveyed employers across the U.S. in June 2020 73% of respondents said they deemed remote work successful. By January 2021 when PwC released updated data that figure rose to 83%. Now more workers also say they want to stay at home full time. In new data released by PwC on Thursday 41% of workers said they wished to remain fully remote up from 29% in the January survey.

Some employers including Gusto a payroll benefits and human-resources technology company say they have reduced any anxiety about office reopenings by providing assurances that employees will be able to largely select how they work—and change their minds over time.

The company earlier this year allowed most employees to select what it calls a work ""persona."" Those who want flexibility could commit to using an office two to three days a week with the freedom to work from home the rest of the time. Others could ask to stay fully remote. Roughly 64% of the company’s more than 1400 employees chose flexible schedules while 35% decided to go remote. A small number of employees such as those who work in facilities or security will need to be in offices full time.

Danielle Brown the company’s chief people officer said employees will be able to change their work style and she foresees a process similar to that used during annual enrollment when employees decide on benefits for the coming year.

Because it was made clear that employees weren’t locked into a choice many felt a sense of relief and empowerment Ms. Brown said.

The prospect of two years out of the office still concerns many employers though if only because it is harder to get a sense for how employees are feeling now. Conning a Hartford Conn.-based institutional asset-management firm recently told U.S. employees that they won’t be required back in offices even on a hybrid schedule until January at the earliest.

Chief Executive Woody Bradford said the company will be increasing training for managers over the coming months and encouraging them to communicate more with employees setting up informal outdoor lunches and dinners when possible to help create a sense of connection.

""I think that’s going to be really important so people don’t feel like they’re just locked in their basements"" Mr. Bradford said.

Mr. Bradford said he has heard from some employees that they are happy with their new routines and reluctant to give them up even a few days a week.

""There are people who have been working from home for like all of us a long time and say that because it’s habitual we’re used to it and change is difficult"" Mr. Bradford said.

He is sympathetic to those arguments but also tells employees that they must think of the organization as a whole. ""An individual may be very productive at home but the new employee who is trying to learn the culture and trying to develop through apprenticeship may really suffer too much"" he said.

Employers have tried a variety of tactics to ease the transition back into offices. Some like law firm Schwabe Williamson & Wyatt PC based in Portland Ore. have held soft reopenings giving workers a chance to get accustomed to commuting wearing dress clothes and interacting with colleagues in person again. ""It takes a lot longer"" to prepare for work than many may remember said Graciela Gomez Cowger the firm’s CEO. ""You’re out of practice. Just putting on a good shirt and getting dressed is a thing.""

Others have provided detailed descriptions of the new office environment and protocols to try to ease concerns. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. began bringing employees back into its offices in the United Arab Emirates last summer. The company found that many employees initially were uncertain and anxious about what awaited them in offices said Coni Judge a senior adviser for culture and employee engagement.

Company leaders attempted to demystify the corporate environment through messages graphics and animations explaining new safety protocols. The company held town hall sessions before and after return dates to hear concerns and to answer questions. It focused on both the length and color of messages sent to employees. ""People are in different psychological and physical states and it’s important to recognize that"" Dr. Judge said.

Many workers are still eager to see offices repopulated said Ms. Cowger the CEO of the law firm Schwabe which employs about 400 people across the Pacific Northwest. Her firm delayed its mandatory office return until at least November though Ms. Cowger said she eventually wants employees back in offices some of the time to help local cities recover economically and to ensure colleagues learn from each other.

""We can’t keep our office closed indefinitely"" she said. ""We just can’t.""

By Ryan Satin

FOX Sports WWE Analyst

John Cena’s historic WWE career has been filled with iconic moments and he'll undoubtedly add another to the list on Saturday when he takes on Roman Reigns for the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam in Las Vegas.



From his TV debut to most recently making a surprise return at Money in the Bank Big Match John has always delivered memories that will last a lifetime for the WWE Universe – but which are his best?

This difficult question was posed by the WWE on FOX account this week and you all came through with answers so we sifted through them to come up with a list of five you’ll hopefully be satisfied with.

5. John Cena’s United States Title Open Challenge

ADVERTISEMENT

After defeating Rusev for the United States Championship back in 2015 John Cena announced he’d defend the title on Raw in a weekly Open Challenge that led to exciting matchups against Superstars such as Cesaro Sami Zayn Dean Ambrose Stardust Xavier Woods and more.



This not only elevated the US title but also helped younger talent get an opportunity to work with one of the top stars in the company.



Additionally fans were given an incentive to tune in every week knowing they’d see one of the company’s rising stars on the opposite side of the ring as a bonafide legend (who raised his game in the process).



4. First World Title win at WrestleMania 21

Regardless of your opinion on the match itself John Cena’s first world title win has to be included for its sheer importance to his legacy.



The victory over JBL at WrestleMania 21 allowed Cena to transcend to the next level and establish dominance that would continue for the rest of his career.



Plus Batista defeating Triple H that night in similar fashion signaled a change in WWE going forward – with two new Superstars being given the ball to run with – so it’s a fairly-significant moment in wrestling history.

3. Ruthless Aggression

Who could ever forget John Cena‘s WWE debut?



Answering an open challenge from Kurt Angle and telling the Olympic gold medalist that he possesses ""ruthless aggression"" is one of those iconic moments that will not only go down in history as one of Cena’s greatest but also as one of the all-time best SmackDown moments too.



John’s gimmick would eventually morph into the character we all love but this put him on the map in a big way and let it be known from the start that Cena had potential to become the face of the company.



2. Cena Beats The Rock at WrestleMania 29

John Cena may have been the top guy in WWE at this stage of his career but he still lived in the shadow of greats who came before him.



That’s what made his years-long feud with The Rock so special.



Yes it’s fun to joke around about how ""Once in a Lifetime"" became twice but Cena needed that win the second time around to prove he was on the same level as other WWE icons – which is why it ranks so high for me.



In a way it’s almost similar to the match he has scheduled for tonight against Roman Reigns only with reverse roles this time around.



1. The Royal Rumble Return

John Cena’s greatest moment most certainly has to be his surprise return during the 2008 Royal Rumble.



Cena was thought to be injured at the time so no one expected him to be the number 30 entrant in the match and every single fan inside of Madison Square Garden lost their freaking mind when his music hit.



You couldn’t have paid for a better reaction.



The shock factor that comes with the Royal Rumble’s number 30 entrant is already fun for fans but a wild Cena returning in that spot was one of those lightning in a bottle situations where everything played out perfectly to illustrate the magic of a WWE surprise.

While Munster is a genuine game-winner on his best day he admitted in an interview with News Corp that his form post-Origin was not up to standards.

“Cameron Munster says he can change his ways” Fox League’s Yvonne Sampson said of the interview.

“He spoke about the perception with the NRL that he is a grub. He spoke about the fact he felt he had a poor Origin series he had multiple frustrations had lashed out and felt he was getting a reputation.”

A foot injury contributed to Munster’s drop-off while the Storm five-eighth was also fined for lashing out with his foot at Liam Martin and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.

In the end Munster admitted the pressure got to him.

“It was a whirlwind Origin series” Munster told News Corp.

“There were high expectations from a lot of people for me to perform after what I did last year then I didn’t perform this year.

“There was a lot of pressure going into the games.

“It was a bit of a let-down and I got a bit frustrated. I was being called a grub a lot around the game. That was on me.

“I just want to make sure I play some clean football at the back end of the year and play the footy I know I can play. I don’t want to get into any of the grubbiness.”

Michael Ennis told Fox League on Saturday night that he “loved the honesty” from Munster and could relate to leaving the field with a sense of regret.

“I love Cameron Munster as a player he loves the big games and is a ferocious competitor” Ennis said.

“He’s probably done some things he’d like to take back. I’ve been there so I know the feeling.

“But sometimes the battle gets to you. He obviously sees there are areas in his game he wants to change he doesn’t like that.

“As long as it doesn’t affect his performance that is the big thing. He’s shown that post-Origin he’s really starting to hit his straps for Melbourne he really is.”

That was evident on Thursday night as Munster starred in a second-half comeback to down the Titans 34-20.

After a relatively quiet first 40 minutes Munster led from the front in the second finishing with a try assist two linebreaks five tackle busts 69 run metres and a try.

The 26-year-old revealed a Bellamy spray was behind the turnaround.

“We got a bit of a rocket at halftime from ‘Bellyache’ so I put it on myself being in the spine and the most experienced player” Munster told News Corp.

“He gave everyone a rocket but especially me. I don’t know if it’s me or what but every time he sprays everyone he looks at me.

“I can really turn it on and show what I can do in big games but I need to make it consistent each and every week.”"

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote to Fox News in response citing just a small fragment of Carlson's long racist record  and noting that ""Carlson has suggested that the very idea of white supremacy in the U.S. is a hoax."" Greenblatt concluded ""Carlson's full-on embrace of the white supremacist replacement theory ... and his repeated allusions to racist themes in past segments are a bridge too far. Given his long record of race-baiting we believe it is time for Carlson to go.""

Predictably enough Fox News and its ownership refused to take this seriously. Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch responded by falsely claiming that ""Mr. Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory."" But the only evidence he offered didn't sound like rejection only an attempt to sanitize Carlson's remarks through denial and reframing: ""As Mr. Carlson himself stated during the guest interview: 'White replacement theory? No no this is a voting rights question.'""

It's worth looking back at that episode now for several reasons. First Carlson has again been pushing ""Great Replacement"" discourse more recently this time by attacking the idea of bringing Afghan refugees to the U.S. in the wake of the Taliban's lightning conquest of that country. Second because Fox News' defense of Carlson has only supported the spread of this racist conspiracy theory. Third because that theory has a bloody record of inspiring mass murder — not incidentally but as a logical consequence of its central argument.

""The great replacement is very simple"" its originator French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus has said . ""You have one people and in the space of a generation you have a different people."" In this formulation immigration is equated with genocide which logically requires or demands genocidal violence in response.

And then there's the final reason: Because the ""Great Replacement"" and a family of similar almost interchangeable conspiracy theories — claiming that Western culture and civilization are being destroyed by immigration which is permitted or enabled by weak or malicious cosmopolitan elites often though not always identified as Jewish — effectively defines a radical shift in conservative ideology over the last few years. Indeed one could almost call it a great replacement of previous conservative thought.

Here's a key portion of what Carlson said in April:

Now I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term ""replacement"" if you suggest the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate the voters now casting ballots with new people more obedient voters from the Third World. But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually. Let's just say it! That's true.

Renaud Camus could not have said it better. That was no rejection of the theory; if anything it was an overt embrace. As conservative Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson noted  ""Nearly every phrase of Carlson's statement is the euphemistic expression of white-supremacist replacement doctrine."" It was Gerson wrote ""what modern poll-tested shrink-wrapped mass-marketed racism looks like.""

In fact it's much more than that. For two decades Republicans have been screaming about organized voter fraud while never producing any evidence. So here is a new and much darker conspiracy theory so sweeping that it does not rely on hard evidence but has even more sinister implications.

This past week Carlson helped spearhead right-wing opposition to welcoming Afghan refugees who aided the 20-year U.S. war effort. He understood that argument was a tough sell and framed it around a familiar trope telling his millions of viewers they were being manipulated by unnamed conspiratorial elites:

You should be happy you live in a country where your neighbors love children and dogs and want to help refugees. We are a generous and empathetic people and we can be proud. Unfortunately there are many in our ruling class who are anxious to take advantage of our best qualities. They see our decency and weakness and they exploit those things and they do it relentlessly. ""Let's try to save our loyal Afghan interpreters"" we tell them. ""Perfect"" they think. ""We'll open the borders and change the demographic balance of the country.""

There is no evidence for this of course. It's pure paranoid fantasy — but not Carlson's alone. He's only a transmitter of extremist views into the mainstream. A key source for these views is the notorious 1973 novel ""The Camp of the Saints"" by French right-wing author Jean Raspail which argued that mass migration is an invasion that will eventually destroy Western culture and replace Western populations that Western political elites lack the moral strength to defend their civilization and therefore that the invaders must be physically removed or destroyed. When I interviewed retired intelligence analyst James Scaminaci III last year he described how the novel's paranoid vision has inspired an entire worldview:

The main variations within this ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview are whether the political elites lack moral strength to resist the invasions (""Great Replacement"") enact immoral policies which weaken Western societies to invasion (""demographic winter"") or actively collaborate with the governments of the invading migrants to facilitate the invasion (as in John Tanton's network). The other variation distinguishes the neo-Nazis from all the other segments: whether or not the Jews are responsible for the destruction of their societies (""white genocide"").

These variations can bleed together. Catchphrases like ""great replacement"" or ""white genocide"" easily cross the boundaries Scaminaci describes as part of their lingua franca. So does the record of terrorism. Here are some examples.

On July 22 2011 right-wing terrorist Anders Breivik murdered 77 Norwegian citizens (mostly teenagers) and injured an additional 319 at the same time electronically distributing a 1518-page conspiracist manifesto calling for the deportation of Muslims from Europe and dividing blame between Muslims themselves and ""cultural Marxism"" an alleged Jewish conspiracy to destroy Western culture and civilization by promoting multiculturalism and undermining traditional values.

The manifesto used the terms ""cultural Marxism"" or ""cultural Marxist"" more than 600 times and plagiarized almost the entirety of William Lind's 2004 Free Congress Foundation book ""'Political Correctness': A Short History of an Ideology"" the most significant text promoting the theory which uses the terms ""cultural Marxism"" ""political correctness"" and ""multiculturalism"" almost interchangeably. The book disappeared from the FCF website shortly after the massacre. But Breivik was doing exactly what Lind had called for. He just did it a little too quickly.

On Oct. 27 2018 Robert Bowers killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. Before the attack he referenced the anti-Semitic variant ""white genocide."" Bowers had a record of posting anti-Semitic comments on Gab attacking the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). One congregation at the synagogue had participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the week before and Republicans were trying to whip up hysteria about migrant ""caravans"" during the midterm election campaign. Referencing those Bowers posted on Gab that ""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics I'm going in.""

On March 2019 Brenton Tarrant live-streamed himself killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand. In advance he released an 74-page online manifesto called ""The Great Replacement"" elaborating on Camus' ideas and citing Breivik as an inspiration. The manifesto included neo-Nazi symbols although Tarrant denied being a Nazi calling himself an ""ethno-nationalist"" and an ""eco-fascist."" Equating immigration with genocide he wrote  ""Radical explosive action is the only desired and required response to an attempted genocide"" underscoring the inherently violent nature of this worldview.

On April 27 2019 the last day of Passover white supremacist John Earnest killed one person and injured three others at a synagogue in Poway California. He posted a letter of explanation which the ADL summarizes:

The letter includes a laundry list of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories including the longstanding white supremacist assertion that Jews are responsible for non-white immigration which ""threatens"" the white race . ""Every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race"" the letter states adding ""… For these crimes they deserve nothing but hell."" This mirrors the language used by both Bowers and Tarrant prior to their attacks.

On Aug. 3 2019 white supremacist Patrick Crusius opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso Texas. The final death toll was 23  with almost two dozen others wounded. As the ADL reported  Crusius' manifesto claimed that his attack was a ""response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas"" and that he was merely defending his country from ""cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion."" What's more he also claimed that ""he did not intend to target the Hispanic community until he read 'The Great Replacement.'""

This is the conspiracy theory Tucker Carlson is spreading with Fox's explicit blessing. More than that what Scaminaci calls the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview ""is widespread in right-wing media think tanks and political parties."" He continued:

Thus there is very little difference between the rhetoric of right-wing media and the rhetoric of right-wing terrorists or mass murderers. The manifesto of the El Paso terrorist and nightly broadcasts of Fox News or the tweets of Donald Trump are remarkably similar. Right-wing elites may be ""shocked"" by these periodic massacres but they keep priming the pump. In turn these massacres create new right-wing ""heroes"" and ""martyrs"" and spur others to beat their ""score"" while spreading the conspiracy theory further.

Even more than the massacres noted above this points to the most frightening aspect of all: a transformation in conservative ideology which promises more such massacres. In 2012 Arun Kundnani shed light on this in "" Blind Spot? Security Narratives and Far-Right Violence in Europe "" published by the International Center for Counter-Terrorism at the Hague in the aftermath of Breivik's attack.

""Every perception has a blind spot the area that cannot be seen because it is part of the mechanism of perception itself"" Kundnani writes. ""This paper considers whether since 9/11 the far‐right has been the blind spot of counter‐terrorism the problem that could not be perceived clearly because it had begun to absorb significant elements from official security narratives themselves.""

This absorption was in fact only one aspect of a longer-term transformational process Kundnani identified. He describes a threefold evolution of far-right ideology in Europe which has allowed it to move into the mainstream from the fringes. Post-World War II neo-Nazi parties were ostracized for decades but this began to shift from the 1980s onward with a focus on culture rather than race followed by the latest evolution in the wake of 9/11.

""In the 'counter-jihadist' narrative the identity that needs to be defended is no longer a conservative notion of national identity but an idea of liberal values seen as a civilizational inheritance"" Kundnani explains. ""Islam becomes the new threat to this identity regarded as both an alien culture and an extremist political ideology. Multiculturalism is seen as enabling not just the weakening of national identity but 'Islamification' a process of colonization leading to the rule of sharia law.""

Summing up Kundnani writes ""In moving from neo‐Nazism to counter‐jihadism the underlying structure of the narrative remains the same but the protagonists have changed: the identity of Western liberal values has been substituted for white racial identity Muslims have taken the place of blacks and multiculturalists are the new Jews.""

That phrase ""the identity of Western liberal values"" should set off alarm bells coming from neo-Nazi-affiliated political activists. It's perhaps best understood in terms of something else promoted by the above-mentioned William Lind a pioneer of white supremacist ideology which I've written about before : fourth-generation warfare.

In 4GW — to use a shorthand familiar to aficionados — Carl von Clausewitz's distinctions between the government the army and the population collapse. There is no clear dividing line between war and peace combatant and non-combatant or as Tucker Carlson may see it between immigration and invasion — or even genocide. It is above all a war of perceptions a war for legitimacy. So when it comes to defining the identity of Western liberal values the current Republican obsession with defining freedom as the freedom to infect others with a deadly virus shows just how ludicrous a war of perceptions can become — and still have a legitimate chance of succeeding.

Scaminaci also told me that Matthew Feldman and Paul Jackson co-editors of the book "" Doublespeak: The Rhetoric of the Far Right Since 1945 "" argue that far-right movements have engaged in what they call ""fifth-column discourse"" described as a ""form of deception and political cunning intended to attack an enemy from within; in this case by aping the language of liberal democracy."" That's clearly similar to Kundnani's argument.

I asked Scaminaci whether racist right-wingers claiming to be defenders of Western values offer a paradigmatic example of fourth-generation warfare and also whether that helps explain Tucker Carlson's man-crush on Viktor Orbán Hungary's autocratic leader.

He agreed adding that the version of 4GW articulated in this instance was ""extremely clever."" He turned to Kundnani's description:

This new ""identitarian"" narrative makes the defense of Western civilization and Enlightenment values from invading Muslims and Islam central to its appeal. The new internal enemy are the multiculturalists instead of the Jews. This is consistent with a larger conservative narrative of the ""clash of civilizations."" One consequence of this new narrative is that the Jews and Israel are now potential allies. But this new narrative is entirely consistent with the central argument of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview.

Indeed support for Israel has a double appeal: First to fight Islam second to provide cover for continued anti-Semitism on the right. The older narratives haven't gone away just because new ones have emerged. For some ""cosmopolitans"" may have replaced Jews on their enemies list. For others that's just rhetorical code.

As for Carlson's bromance with Orbán Scaminaci said:

Tucker Carlson is following a well-worn path. Orbán embraced this ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview and made it the centerpiece of his political strategy. Orbán and [Benjamin] Netanyahu were allies and white nationalists found encouragement in casting Israel as a white-settler enclave worth defending. When Donald Trump went to Poland in July 2017 he delivered a ""Camp of the Saints"" or ""Great Replacement"" speech.

There's another dimension to the story not yet mentioned the ""Eurabia"" variation of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview as explained by Scaminaci:

Trump and Orbán were following the path laid out by Egyptian-Jewish author Bat Ye'or in the 1990s. Ye'or in her ""Eurabia"" writings brought Jews and Christians together to fight against a Muslim invasion of Europe. Ye'or made common cause with proponents of the Serbian genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina as did William Lind the originator of fourth-generation war. This Serbian genocidal policy was then imported into the Republican Party and the Christian right. Tucker Carlson is just the latest in a long line of Bat Ye'or followers.

Kundnani's description of the evolution of neo-Nazi narratives into ""counter-jihadist"" narratives was framed in a European context where multiparty democracies allowed extremists to use existing party structures to claw their ways into the political mainstream. America is locked into a two-party system that presents a different dynamic and Nazi ideology was never strong in the U.S. So the lines weren't as clearly drawn and the evolution wasn't as obvious or direct. But a similar story can be told about American politics as well Scaminaci said:

By now everyone is familiar with Lee Atwater's observation that the Republican Party used sanitized and abstract concepts like taxes rather than more crass and vulgar white supremacist terminology. GOP rhetoric from the 1980s up to Trump used sanitized code words to appeal to ... voters feeling their status was being threatened from below or they were being abandoned from above by Democratic Party elites. Trump dropped the dog whistles [and] never abandoned his central narrative that his key strategist Steve Bannon had borrowed and pushed into the conservative media ecosystem namely the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview. Trump may not be a true card-carrying white nationalist but he's close enough that they immediately recognized him as a kindred spirit.

The ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview provides a new framework for conservatism an overarching narrative that connects things together more tightly than postwar conservatives ever managed in the past. If ""invading hordes of immigrants"" are the enemy and falling white birthrates are key to the problem then the right's misogynist agenda and its xenophobic agenda are much more tightly linked than ever before.

Connections with Christian nationalism — an Old Testament-based worldview fusing Christian and American identities — are similarly strengthened. A 2018 paper "" Make America Christian Again "" which I wrote about here in 2018 explained that ""Christian nationalism … draws its roots from 'Old Testament' parallels between America and Israel who was commanded to maintain cultural and blood purity often through war conquest and separatism.""

In short all the major electoral facets of American conservatism are more tightly unified by the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview than they ever were or ever could have been in the days of William F. Buckley or Ronald Reagan. What's more the practical need to suppress voters of color becomes a central ingredient.

As Scaminaci put it: ""The underlying motivation of the Great Replacement and voter suppression is the same: Nonwhite voters are inherently illegitimate because they vote for an illegitimate political party that itself poses an existential threat to Western civilization or America or White America or White Americans because it conspires with external nonwhites to destroy the country.""

So the Great Replacement that has actually taken place is the replacement of the ideas ideals and mores of conservatism. As debased and depraved as those had already become they have now been supplanted by much darker principles which have deadly real-world consequences and pose an existential threat to what remains of American democracy.

""The right wing wants to use the language of liberal democracy and of the Enlightenment"" Scaminaci said in conclusion ""but the right wing is intellectually incoherent"":

It no longer has a governing philosophy. Thus it must make its appeals to resentments to frustrations to anger and to fear using liberal language in defense of Enlightenment values — while their arguments make little or no sense and cannot withstand scrutiny. But there is an underlying logic and that is the logic of the ""Camp of the Saints"" worldview. And they continue to develop rhetorical and narrative strategies to make that worldview palatable and electable.

Those rhetorical and narrative strategies will necessarily involve doublespeak of which Tucker Carlson is a master. For example in June David Neiwert author most recently of "" Red Pill Blue Pill: How to Counteract the Conspiracy Theories That Are Killing Us "" called out Carlson for inverting the reality of demographic change in the Mountain West in a further extension of replacement theory.

Carlson had suggested on his prime-time show that Montana Idaho and Nevada now face ""similar problems"" to the demographic change right-wingers view as catastrophic in California: ""The affluent liberals who wrecked California aren't sticking around to see how that ends. They're running to the pallid hideaways of Boise and Bozeman distorting local culture and real estate markets as they do it.""

Neiwert responded that as ""a fourth-generation Idaho native with family in Montana I can tell you that this is a complete inversion of the historic demographic reality in those places"":

It could only be accurate if viewed from a very short-term perspective — and even then it's wrong. Idaho and Montana have only become deep-red Republican states in the past decade or two. Prior to that they were classic ""purple"" states electing a mix of Democrats and Republicans. What changed that was an in-migration of right-wing voters .

We can expect more such gaslighting arguments in the days ahead. The far right now finds itself deeply at odds with the Western values it pretends to defend. Even if it has convinced the vast majority of conservative voters to go along it can only hope to gain and hold power by standing those values on their heads — including most fundamentally the biblical value of not bearing false witness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3JlbW90ZS13b3JrLW1heS1ub3ctbGFzdC1mb3ItdHdvLXllYXJzLXdvcnJ5aW5nLXNvbWUtYm9zc2Vz0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvcmVtb3RlLXdvcmstbWF5LW5vdy1sYXN0LWZvci10d28teWVhcnMtd29ycnlpbmctc29tZS1ib3NzZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remote work may now last for two years worrying some bosses,"With the latest wave of return-to-office delays from Covid-19 some companies are considering a new possibility: Offices may be closed for nearly two years.

That is raising concerns among executives that the longer people stay at home the harder or more disruptive it could be to eventually bring them back.

Many employees developed new routines during the pandemic swapping commuting for exercise or blocking hours for uninterrupted work. Even staffers who once bristled at doing their jobs outside of an office have come to embrace the flexibility and productivity of at-home life over the past 18 months many say. Surveys have shown that enthusiasm for remote work has only increased as the pandemic has stretched on.

""If you have a little blip people go back to the old way. Well this ain’t a blip"" said Pat Gelsinger chief executive officer of Intel Corp.  whose company has benefited from the work-from-home boom. He predicts hybrid and remote work will remain the norm for months and years to come. ""There is no going back.""

Return dates have been postponed repeatedly. On Thursday Apple Inc. told corporate employees that its planned return to U.S. offices would be delayed until at least January. Companies such as Chevron Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. have postponed September returns while tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. have pushed them to early next year. Lyft Inc. said it would call employees back to its San Francisco headquarters in February about 23 months after the ride-sharing company first closed its offices.

Prudential Financial Inc. delayed its office reopening from September to October at the earliest though Rob Falzon vice chair of the company said that date could change too depending on health conditions.

Prudential plans to allow for a mix of in-person and remote work once U.S. offices reopen. But the longer people stay at home the more Mr. Falzon worries about employees feeling disconnected. ""My single greatest concern is around talent"" he said. ""As individuals disassociate themselves with their organizations from a cultural standpoint it becomes increasingly easy for them to make decisions to leave and go elsewhere.""

Already many employees are ""bombarded"" with messages from recruiters and friends attempting to lure them elsewhere he said. ""When they’re in the workplace I think they have a broader sense of connection to the platform to the culture of the organization—their fellow employees their teams—that makes them less inclined to want to leave"" Mr. Falzon said.

JOB POSTS REQUIRING COVID-19 VACCINES SOAR: REPORT

Even so what many have concluded over time is that their companies can operate largely effectively while remote executives and workers say. After months spent hunched over kitchen tables some employees say they have settled into a more comfortable rhythm of remote work. Others have finally sprung for more ergonomic desks or chairs at home. As more time passes until offices reopen it could become difficult to convince existing employees to willingly upend their new lives and return to pre-pandemic schedules in offices executives say.

Perceptions of remote work have shifted as the pandemic has gone on. When professional-services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP surveyed employers across the U.S. in June 2020 73% of respondents said they deemed remote work successful. By January 2021 when PwC released updated data that figure rose to 83%. Now more workers also say they want to stay at home full time. In new data released by PwC on Thursday 41% of workers said they wished to remain fully remote up from 29% in the January survey.

Some employers including Gusto a payroll benefits and human-resources technology company say they have reduced any anxiety about office reopenings by providing assurances that employees will be able to largely select how they work—and change their minds over time.

The company earlier this year allowed most employees to select what it calls a work ""persona."" Those who want flexibility could commit to using an office two to three days a week with the freedom to work from home the rest of the time. Others could ask to stay fully remote. Roughly 64% of the company’s more than 1400 employees chose flexible schedules while 35% decided to go remote. A small number of employees such as those who work in facilities or security will need to be in offices full time.

Danielle Brown the company’s chief people officer said employees will be able to change their work style and she foresees a process similar to that used during annual enrollment when employees decide on benefits for the coming year.

Because it was made clear that employees weren’t locked into a choice many felt a sense of relief and empowerment Ms. Brown said.

The prospect of two years out of the office still concerns many employers though if only because it is harder to get a sense for how employees are feeling now. Conning a Hartford Conn.-based institutional asset-management firm recently told U.S. employees that they won’t be required back in offices even on a hybrid schedule until January at the earliest.

Chief Executive Woody Bradford said the company will be increasing training for managers over the coming months and encouraging them to communicate more with employees setting up informal outdoor lunches and dinners when possible to help create a sense of connection.

""I think that’s going to be really important so people don’t feel like they’re just locked in their basements"" Mr. Bradford said.

Mr. Bradford said he has heard from some employees that they are happy with their new routines and reluctant to give them up even a few days a week.

""There are people who have been working from home for like all of us a long time and say that because it’s habitual we’re used to it and change is difficult"" Mr. Bradford said.

He is sympathetic to those arguments but also tells employees that they must think of the organization as a whole. ""An individual may be very productive at home but the new employee who is trying to learn the culture and trying to develop through apprenticeship may really suffer too much"" he said.

Employers have tried a variety of tactics to ease the transition back into offices. Some like law firm Schwabe Williamson & Wyatt PC based in Portland Ore. have held soft reopenings giving workers a chance to get accustomed to commuting wearing dress clothes and interacting with colleagues in person again. ""It takes a lot longer"" to prepare for work than many may remember said Graciela Gomez Cowger the firm’s CEO. ""You’re out of practice. Just putting on a good shirt and getting dressed is a thing.""

Others have provided detailed descriptions of the new office environment and protocols to try to ease concerns. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. began bringing employees back into its offices in the United Arab Emirates last summer. The company found that many employees initially were uncertain and anxious about what awaited them in offices said Coni Judge a senior adviser for culture and employee engagement.

Company leaders attempted to demystify the corporate environment through messages graphics and animations explaining new safety protocols. The company held town hall sessions before and after return dates to hear concerns and to answer questions. It focused on both the length and color of messages sent to employees. ""People are in different psychological and physical states and it’s important to recognize that"" Dr. Judge said.

Many workers are still eager to see offices repopulated said Ms. Cowger the CEO of the law firm Schwabe which employs about 400 people across the Pacific Northwest. Her firm delayed its mandatory office return until at least November though Ms. Cowger said she eventually wants employees back in offices some of the time to help local cities recover economically and to ensure colleagues learn from each other.

""We can’t keep our office closed indefinitely"" she said. ""We just can’t.""

By Ryan Satin

FOX Sports WWE Analyst

John Cena’s historic WWE career has been filled with iconic moments and he'll undoubtedly add another to the list on Saturday when he takes on Roman Reigns for the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam in Las Vegas.



From his TV debut to most recently making a surprise return at Money in the Bank Big Match John has always delivered memories that will last a lifetime for the WWE Universe – but which are his best?

This difficult question was posed by the WWE on FOX account this week and you all came through with answers so we sifted through them to come up with a list of five you’ll hopefully be satisfied with.

5. John Cena’s United States Title Open Challenge

ADVERTISEMENT

After defeating Rusev for the United States Championship back in 2015 John Cena announced he’d defend the title on Raw in a weekly Open Challenge that led to exciting matchups against Superstars such as Cesaro Sami Zayn Dean Ambrose Stardust Xavier Woods and more.



This not only elevated the US title but also helped younger talent get an opportunity to work with one of the top stars in the company.



Additionally fans were given an incentive to tune in every week knowing they’d see one of the company’s rising stars on the opposite side of the ring as a bonafide legend (who raised his game in the process).



4. First World Title win at WrestleMania 21

Regardless of your opinion on the match itself John Cena’s first world title win has to be included for its sheer importance to his legacy.



The victory over JBL at WrestleMania 21 allowed Cena to transcend to the next level and establish dominance that would continue for the rest of his career.



Plus Batista defeating Triple H that night in similar fashion signaled a change in WWE going forward – with two new Superstars being given the ball to run with – so it’s a fairly-significant moment in wrestling history.

3. Ruthless Aggression

Who could ever forget John Cena‘s WWE debut?



Answering an open challenge from Kurt Angle and telling the Olympic gold medalist that he possesses ""ruthless aggression"" is one of those iconic moments that will not only go down in history as one of Cena’s greatest but also as one of the all-time best SmackDown moments too.



John’s gimmick would eventually morph into the character we all love but this put him on the map in a big way and let it be known from the start that Cena had potential to become the face of the company.



2. Cena Beats The Rock at WrestleMania 29

John Cena may have been the top guy in WWE at this stage of his career but he still lived in the shadow of greats who came before him.



That’s what made his years-long feud with The Rock so special.



Yes it’s fun to joke around about how ""Once in a Lifetime"" became twice but Cena needed that win the second time around to prove he was on the same level as other WWE icons – which is why it ranks so high for me.



In a way it’s almost similar to the match he has scheduled for tonight against Roman Reigns only with reverse roles this time around.



1. The Royal Rumble Return

John Cena’s greatest moment most certainly has to be his surprise return during the 2008 Royal Rumble.



Cena was thought to be injured at the time so no one expected him to be the number 30 entrant in the match and every single fan inside of Madison Square Garden lost their freaking mind when his music hit.



You couldn’t have paid for a better reaction.



The shock factor that comes with the Royal Rumble’s number 30 entrant is already fun for fans but a wild Cena returning in that spot was one of those lightning in a bottle situations where everything played out perfectly to illustrate the magic of a WWE surprise.

While Munster is a genuine game-winner on his best day he admitted in an interview with News Corp that his form post-Origin was not up to standards.

“Cameron Munster says he can change his ways” Fox League’s Yvonne Sampson said of the interview.

“He spoke about the perception with the NRL that he is a grub. He spoke about the fact he felt he had a poor Origin series he had multiple frustrations had lashed out and felt he was getting a reputation.”

A foot injury contributed to Munster’s drop-off while the Storm five-eighth was also fined for lashing out with his foot at Liam Martin and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.

In the end Munster admitted the pressure got to him.

“It was a whirlwind Origin series” Munster told News Corp.

“There were high expectations from a lot of people for me to perform after what I did last year then I didn’t perform this year.

“There was a lot of pressure going into the games.

“It was a bit of a let-down and I got a bit frustrated. I was being called a grub a lot around the game. That was on me.

“I just want to make sure I play some clean football at the back end of the year and play the footy I know I can play. I don’t want to get into any of the grubbiness.”

Michael Ennis told Fox League on Saturday night that he “loved the honesty” from Munster and could relate to leaving the field with a sense of regret.

“I love Cameron Munster as a player he loves the big games and is a ferocious competitor” Ennis said.

“He’s probably done some things he’d like to take back. I’ve been there so I know the feeling.

“But sometimes the battle gets to you. He obviously sees there are areas in his game he wants to change he doesn’t like that.

“As long as it doesn’t affect his performance that is the big thing. He’s shown that post-Origin he’s really starting to hit his straps for Melbourne he really is.”

That was evident on Thursday night as Munster starred in a second-half comeback to down the Titans 34-20.

After a relatively quiet first 40 minutes Munster led from the front in the second finishing with a try assist two linebreaks five tackle busts 69 run metres and a try.

The 26-year-old revealed a Bellamy spray was behind the turnaround.

“We got a bit of a rocket at halftime from ‘Bellyache’ so I put it on myself being in the spine and the most experienced player” Munster told News Corp.

“He gave everyone a rocket but especially me. I don’t know if it’s me or what but every time he sprays everyone he looks at me.

“I can really turn it on and show what I can do in big games but I need to make it consistent each and every week.”"

Though part of land has been earmarked in the Knowledge Park proposed in 300 acres on Hill No 4 of Madhurawada a senior official of APIIC told Bizz Buzz that as of now they have not received any intimation on their decision to opt out of setting up of campus in the city.

Franklin Templeton India was in trouble for sometime after which it closed six mutual fund schemes citing redemption pressure and lack of liquidity. When contacted Rushikonda IT Park Association (RITPA) vice-president O Naresh Kumar said on Sunday that ""as there is no progress in their project till date for all practical purposes they have dropped their investment plan in the city in a big way.""

According to sources the insistence by the YSRCP Government to allot land at a concessional rate and the changed economic scenario and their scaling down operations in India have led to backing out from establishing big ticket projects with a promise to recruit high-end business professionals.

During the TDP regime a GO was issued allotting land at the rate of Rs32.5 lakh per acre. ""Now we are giving the same land at Rs1 crore"" the APIIC official pointed out. In the proposed knowledge park the government has given land to Adani Group for establishing a data technology centre and business hub. A notification was issued sometime ago seeking expression of interest for development of sentinel towers by APIIC and an industry enablement centre.

The area designated for Knowledge Park is close to Rushikonda IT Special Economic Zone and Kapulappada where 200 acres of developed layout proposed for IT City during TDP regime may be used for construction of some of the buildings required for making Visakhapatnam the executive capital of the State. At the time of its operations at Tech Mahindra building here in 2018 Franklin Templeton management had declared that the Vizag facility will serve as a Center of Innovation and one of the key tech hubs for Franklin Templeton Investments globally focusing on building core competencies in investment management data science with a view to gain information advantage and drive investment out-performance.

♦ During TDP regime Franklin Templeton was allotted 40 acres at Rs 32.5 lakh per acre for setting up Center of Innovation in Visakhapatnam

Rising copper prices on a global economic recovery helped a South Korean non-ferrous metal product maker Poongsan Corporation improve its earnings while hurting profits of LS-Nikko Copper Inc. the country’s only copper refining company. Poongsan makes sheets rods and coins with copper LS-Nikko supplies.LS-Nikko has been suffering from falling refining margins on intensifying competitions against Chinese producers while Poongsan is expected to report record earnings this year thanks to rising inventory valuation gains on rising copper prices.Poongsan the country’s No. 1 copper processing company logged 106.4 billion won ($89.9 million) in operating profit on a consolidated basis in the second quarter about a quintuple of 21 billion won a year earlier. Its first half operating profit stood at 168.9 billion won already topping 121.2 billion won profit for the whole of 2020.The London Metal Exchange’s copper cash official price was at $9346.5 per ton as of Aug. 17 up 42.4% from a year earlier although its rising momentum slightly eased from May when it was exceeded $10000 a ton. Copper is regarded as a leading indicator as its demand is influenced by plant facilities construction materials vehicles and machinery business.Poongsan is predicted to report an operating profit of more than its all-time high of 250 billion won for this year on healthy demand for copper products according to the industry sources.On the other hand LS-Nikko a joint venture between LS Group and Japan Korea Joint Smelting (JKJS) is suffering from rising copper prices.LS-Nikko’s earnings in the first half were weaker than a year earlier according to a company source. The company in which LS Corp. owns a 50.1% stake does not announce quarterly results as it is not listed. Last year LS-Nikko reported 228.5 billion won in operating profit down 27.5% from 2019.Its refining margins are often decided when the company signs annual contracts with copper miners such as BHP Group and Freeport-McMoran that always have an advantage in price negotiations.LS-Nikko’s business conditions are deteriorating as China is building large copper refineries to raise its self-sufficiency to 100% from the current 80% intensifying price competitions hurt the margins. It is hard to raise copper prices to buyers such as Poongsan since LS-Nikko usually inks supply deals for a long term such as one year.LS-Nikko aims to overcome such difficulties by introducing a smart factory that use big data and artificial intelligence (AI).Its Chief Executive Officer Doh Suk-goo said it plans to maximize efficiencies of storage transportation and production to cut smelting costs.The company adopted manufacturing enterprise system (MES) and advanced planning & scheduling (APS) last year. It is expected to cut 130 billion won in costs by about 2030 through the smart factory.Kyung-Min Kang at kkm1026@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAyMS0wOC0yMS9jb25nby1pbml0aWF0ZXMtcHJvYmUtb2YtY2hpbmEtbW9seXMtdGVua2UtY29wcGVyLWNvYmFsdC1taW5lLTEwMTc1ODA5OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Congo Initiates Probe of China Moly’s Tenke Copper-Cobalt Mine,"(Bloomberg) — The Democratic Republic of Congo established a commission to ensure China Molybdenum Co. is complying with its contractual obligations related to the giant Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt project.

The office of President Felix Tshisekedi authorized the investigation earlier this month into mineral reserve data and the financing costs for the China Molybdenum (CMOC) project according to documents seen by Bloomberg News and verified by the presidency. CMOC disclosed a $2.5 billion investment Aug. 6 to more than double production at the mine. The operation is already one of the world’s biggest sources of cobalt a key mineral in electric-vehicle batteries.

“The goal isn’t anything new or to attack foreign investors” Andre Wameso Tshisekedi’s deputy chief of staff for economic and financial matters and a member of the commission said by phone Thursday. “If we find nothing the contract will stay as it was established with its initial inequalities. But if it’s changed disfavoring the DRC we’re ready to go in another direction.”

A CMOC media representative said the company has no comment.

Tenke produced more than 180000 tons of copper and 15000 tons of cobalt last year. CMOC wants to add 200000 tons of copper and 17000 tons of cobalt capacity by 2023. World cobalt production totaled 140000 tons in 2020 according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

“The mine has a lot more reserves than what was in the original contract so it’s quite logical that we should review what equitably belongs to each according to the contributions of each” Wameso said. “If the conditions have changed in terms of something that wasn’t there at the initial time we must review the agreement on the basis of reality.”

Congo last renegotiated the Tenke deal with former owners Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Lundin Mining Corp. in 2010 when the government increased the shareholding of state mining company Gecamines to 20% from 17.5%. The amended contract also required the Tenke joint venture to pay Gecamines a $1.2 million royalty for each additional 100000 tons of copper reserves discovered beyond 2.5 million tons.

Those terms could be up for negotiation if the commission finds that the current arrangement is out of balance Wameso said. The project’s financing terms which were increased in 2010 to Libor plus 600 basis points from Libor plus 200 basis points will also be reviewed by the commission according to the documents. Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate an interest rate benchmark and a basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

The Tenke venture is required to find more advantageous financing terms if it can according to the 2010 amended contract. The current interest rate “eats at profits” and reduces the taxes and dividends paid to Congo Wameso said.

We have seen breathtaking views heard interesting stories searched for eateries and overnight accommodations and happened upon crazy roadside attractions. We’ve been at the top of tall mountains and down in deep gorges and caves. We’ve had a few small world experiences when we ran into people who were from near where we live. One thing that stood out and has on every trip we’ve ever traveled be it in this country Canada Europe or South America is that the world is overflowing with good kind caring helpful people.

We drove away from Freeport Maine over Highway 1 on Day 18. In less than 30 miles we saw three offbeat finds the sort of thing that appeals to us. The first was The Big F Indian a 40-foot tall 1500 pound Native American statue. Down the road a few miles in Yarmouth I spotted “Garmin” on a sign and then saw a three-story globe through the window. Because of my curiosity my husband turned around. As I was taking pictures from the parking lot I met a man who was about to enter the building. He told me the building had belonged to Delorme the company that makes atlas and gazetteer books. Garmin a company that is known for GPS technology acquired Delorme in 2016. I went inside to get a closer look at the model of planet Earth. Former Delorme CEO David Delorme designed Eartha a globe weighing 2.8 tons and measuring over 41 feet in diameter making it the world’s largest rotating and revolving globe. Eartha was completed in 1998 after two years of construction and planning.

After traveling a few more miles down Highway 1 we came upon a salt marsh which we never would have noticed had the man in the Garmin International parking lot not told me about it. A salt marsh is a coastal wetland. When salt water is brought in by the tides it floods and drains salt marshes. The soil is made up of decomposing plant material or peat which is usually several feet thick and deep mud.

Len Libby Candies in Scarborough came up next. I had read in Roadside America about a 1700 lb chocolate moose that resided inside the chocolatier’s building therefore we had to stop. A very large map of the United States was painted in red white and blue on the asphalt parking lot. Once inside the building we sought out Lenny the Moose the world’s only life-size chocolate moose. We found him and a few smaller chocolate friends including Libby the Black Bear and her cubs Cocoa and Chips in a room with a constant 68 degree temperature. The bears are made of solid dark chocolate with Libby weighing 380 lbs and the cubs each weighing 80 lbs. Lenny was unveiled on July 1 1997 after being sculpted onsite in four weeks from the finest milk chocolate. He stands in a blue-tinted white chocolate pond. I would have thought my sweet-craving chocolate-loving husband (so much so that when he gets cut he bleeds syrup) would think this a terrible waste of all of that chocolate but apparently not since he purchased a Lenny the Moose tee shirt and hat.

Continuing down Route 1 we drove into the city of Saco Maine where we were suddenly surrounded by many very large brick structures with row after row of small windows. Each building appeared to be sound and well-maintained. I did a little research after we passed by these buildings a second time.

Saco Manufacturing Company which made iron products built a massive seven story cotton mill in 1826. After a fire in 1830 the business reorganized as the York Manufacturing Company and opened Mill No. 1 in 1832. By the turn of the century the company was running eight cotton mills. Now one of the largest cotton milling complexes in the US it employed 9000 people. Other industries that made machinery and parts used by York began to open in Saco. After being acquired by Bates Manufacturing in 1945 most of the mills were shuttered in the 1950s and the textile machine manufacturers relocated to another state. Textile manufacturing in Saco came to an end after 175 years when the last mill closed in 2009. Some of the larger buildings and several smaller ones have been taken down in the last ten years.

I was impressed to find that some of the old buildings have been converted into one two and three bedroom apartments with green building standards and solar-powered hot water systems. Another serves as an educational facility and others house offices artist studios and restaurants.

While looking at a map Fred found an area that he thought may have access to the water. We aren’t swimmers and I am not that sunny sandy beachy woman that just needs “to get my feet in the sand” but my spouse likes to see the water. On our way to the waterfront location which was in a Saco neighborhood called Camp Ellis we noticed a sign advertising lobsters. This was a residential neighborhood the houses were close together and there was no place to park near the sign. After Fred got his water fix we pulled over at the end of the driveway of the house with the lobster sign where three men were visiting outside. We did what we do best that is had a conversation with the men. One of the men a lobster fisherman named Seth Dube sold cooked lobster curbside. He was proud that a Trump rally took place last September on the Camp Ellis pier where Eric Trump spoke to a few hundred lobster fishers as well as others.

We came upon Cape Porpoise Motel about 20 miles from Camp Ellis. Since we like to support small business and the vacancy sign was lit we decided to look at a room something we started doing about 50000 miles earlier even in the nicest hotels. A note on the office door directed prospective guests to call a phone number. A pleasant male voice on the other end of the line told us there were no rooms available therefore we drove away. Before we had traveled 2 miles my phone rang with that same man telling us he and his wife had had a miscommunication on the status of their motel’s weekend occupancy. There were two rooms available so we turned around and were glad we did.

Nunan’s Lobster Hut was a short walk down the street. Although the Nunan Family has been catching lobsters since the early 1930s the family-run restaurant wasn’t opened until 1953. As we entered it was obvious by the look of the interior that the family had added rooms at least twice as their business had grown. The two back rooms had open trusses holding up the roof. Strings of bare lightbulbs were strung though out this area which may have started out as storage but had become a display area for antique and vintage fishing-related items. Among them were nets floats and lobster cages. The walls were covered with news articles and pictures indicating that many famous people had eaten there over the years. Hugh O’Brien of 50s and 60s Wyatt Earp fame and Paul Newman’s photos were among them. A July/August 2012 edition of Yankee Magazine with Nunan’s story was part of the mix.

The next day we headed northwest still on Route 1. Being a 35-year employee of Erie’s GE Locomotive Division when my husband spotted the sign for Seashore Trolley Museum he had to turn around and check it out. The museum claims to be the first and largest electric railway museum in the entire world.

Displays of restored trolleys fill three buildings. More transit vehicles are parked outside and vintage bus and trolley rides are available on the grounds.

We continued on the route and then wound through a residential area until we arrived at Nubble Lighthouse. This was my third visit in under 6 years although I’m not a big lighthouse enthusiast. Whether having an interest in lighthouses or not when you are nearly 600 hundred miles from home and are near a lighthouse you stop even if you have seen it twice before.

Our last stop in Maine was at the Kittery Trading Post which sells nearly everything associated with outdoor recreation. The purpose of the stop was to get a pressed penny for our collection.

We had dinner and spent the night in Haverhill Massachusetts. Fred looked at a map while waiting for dinner. A woman at a nearby table told her husband “He’s got a map!” She later told us she didn’t know when the last time was that she saw a map. I would have gladly shared our endless map supply which is furnished by AAA.

It's not yet known whether Carthy is ill or injured but the 27-year-old lost 2:50 on stage 6's uphill finish in Cullera after struggling mightily in the final kilometres of Thursday's stage won by teammate Magnus Cort.

Carthy had come into the race among the major GC favourites after his podium spot last year. Earlier this season he finished fifth at the Tour of the Alps before riding to eighth overall at the Giro d'Italia.

He came into the Vuelta in good form having won the final stage of the Vuelta a Burgos at the summit finish of Lagunas de Neila despite finishing 41st overall.

EF Education-Nippo's best-placed rider on the general classification is now fellow Briton Simon Carr who joined the team from Delko this season. He lies in 23rd place at 2:53 behind race leader Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2ZpdG5lc3MtdHJhY2tlci1mZWF0dXJlcy0yMzM2MjU4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which hardware features do you actually need on a fitness tracker?,"Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

Feature creep is a common problem in the tech industry. Companies want to offer more bullet points than their rivals and in many cases that actually does result in superior products. But it also keeps prices artificially high and sometimes makes devices unnecessarily complicated — consider the sheer number of options once crammed into flagship Samsung phones. The more complicated something is the more likely it is to break be harder to use or cost a fortune.

That’s increasingly true with fitness trackers to the point that newcomers may have no idea what technologies actually do much less which ones they need. Before shopping it’s wise to come armed with a list of mandatory hardware features versus those that are merely nice to have.

Must-have features for any fitness tracker

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

The most critical item is a heart rate (HR) sensor. Motion sensors convey a general sense of fitness but tend to be biased towards cardio workouts like running and walking providing only the roughest possible calorie burn estimate. Comparing resting and active heart rates can help people understand their overall fitness level and heart health. On devices like the Apple Watch HR can even provide warning signs of atrial fibrillation i.e. irregular heart rhythm.

Maximum consumer-level accuracy for HR can be found via an optical armband or an ECG-based chest strap. You can easily skip those if you want smartwatch functions however. In fact there are some very reliable wrist-based options from makers like Apple Garmin Polar Suunto and others.

Next on the priority list is a rugged or durable design. At a bare minimum a device should be IPX4 water-resistant which means it can resist sweat and light rain. More realistically you should demand at least an IP68 rating to protect against dust submersion or taking a shower. You’ll want a 5ATM rating (or higher) if you intend to wear a tracker while swimming which you can find on most fitness wearables nowadays. While many wearables have water resistance ratings that hasn’t always been the case. Keep this in mind if you’re buying an older model.

Battery life should be considered according to personal needs. For general-purpose smartwatches 24 hours is typical and sufficient — you’ll just have to charge every day. If you want to try sleep tracking it’s better to find something with at least 48 hours preferably closer to five days. If you frequently participate in marathons or week-long camping trips it’s time to start looking at brands like Garmin or Coros which offer devices with weeks of power. A few Garmin watches even include solar charging which doesn’t enable infinite life but can stretch it out.

Essentials for select people

These days GPS location tracking is almost non-negotiable for users into running hiking or cycling. Depending on your home turf you may also want support for the Galileo (European) and GLONASS (Russian) satellite networks. Note that if you’re planning to navigate phone-free you’ll want a tracker with offline maps which can mean more expensive devices from brands like Garmin and Suunto. Related: How do GPS GLONASS and BeiDou work in wearables?

Cellular can be handy but it’s less important than you might think. If you’re out with your tracker chances are you have your phone too. If you don’t you’re probably on a run or a ride and offline caching of music podcasts and/or workout data may be enough. Cellular is most useful to people who can’t bring their phone yet need to stay in constant contact or be linked to live navigation data. If communication is vital you’ll also want phone notification support and possibly the option to reply directly to messages.

A pulse oximeter (a.k.a. an SpO2 or blood oxygen sensor) is normally just a perk despite the recent hype for it in the industry. The tech measures oxygen saturation in the blood which can be useful to athletes gauging performance through a statistic known as VO2 max. A few companies namely Fitbit and Withings are turning to sleep apnea detection. Otherwise an oximeter is only good for specific medical concerns — if saturation regularly falls below 90% it’s time to see a doctor.

A compass altimeter and/or barometer are all more widely equipped and should generally be sought after for the sake of accurate elevation and movement data. They’re especially valuable when you’re trekking in the wilderness and need to know which direction to head in before a storm rolls in. They can be ditched though if you’re into stationary activities like weightlifting or yoga.

Pure luxuries

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

Something hyped on a few recent wrist trackers is ECG (electrocardiography). Chest straps employ ECG to measure general heart rate activity. Still in practice wrist-based implementations are only useful for catching extreme heart rate variability and/or atrial fibrillation (AFib) requiring you to sit still for several seconds with your finger on a node. Don’t worry about ECG on your wrist unless you suspect heart problems.

A few trackers offer on-device workout coaching which is an admirable idea but not for everyone. First off any coaching-capable tracker — requiring a display adequate processor power and storage — will still have limited animation capabilities and a small screen size. If you’re just starting it’s preferable to work with an in-person trainer to establish form or combine a structured workout plan with video tutorials. Veterans will already know what they’re doing and have bigger goals — you won’t see Fitbit teaching people how to squat 400 pounds. Integrated coaching works best in the middle ground where people have learned basic concepts but need a push to make the most of them. An exception to this is any Couch to 5K/10K/Marathon-style program. Running form isn’t that complicated at the amateur level so progress is more about pacing and conditioning.

A few trackers offer native workout coaching which is an admirable idea but not for everyone.

Sleep tracking has three hardware requirements: motion sensors HR sensors and (as said earlier) enough battery life to last the night. This falls under the “luxury” category because the only people who need it are those trying to diagnose restlessness. Even for the average person wearing a tracker to bed can offer a superior wake-up experience. Some devices can be set to wake you in a light sleep phase and even if they can’t a vibrating wrist will definitely get you out of bed faster without disturbing anyone. Garmin offers a related software metric called Body Battery which combines HR stress and activity data to score energy reserves.

A mic for voice assistants is only meaningful if the rest of your tech is hooked into the same platform. An Alexa or Google Assistant user for example could turn on the lights music and fan in their home gym with a single command. If all you’re doing is stopping and starting workouts it’s not worth spending a premium on voice tech by itself.

Final shopping tips

Adam Sinicki / Android Authority

Hardware features alone shouldn’t decide what you buy. Once your requirements are established the next steps are to consider reviews brand reputations and the quality of associated phone apps. There are many cheap generic fitness trackers on Amazon but a more expensive model from a popular brand will pay off in terms of durability and app support. Android users for example should insist on something hooked into Google Fit.

Indeed the app experience is essential — data is meaningless as a confusing jumble of statistics. A quality app rates your fitness in practical terms explains what different figures mean and challenges you to do better. The best apps guide you on a long-term journey offering tips and workout plans you’ll eventually graduate from. We suggest test-driving the apps for any devices you’re considering or at least checking out their reviews and screenshots.

While brand names can cost more seeing through feature creep may still save you some cash. It can for instance be tempting to buy the most powerful tracker within your budget but even pros know that some accessories are overkill.

“It’s a very prestigious project and a technical breakout for Turkey that will introduce a lot of new technologies for the whole defence industry” said Zengin vice president of the National Combat Aircraft project.

“There will be a very high percentage of local parts in the aircraft.”

The TF aircraft being developed by Turkish Aerospace is arguably the jewel in the crown of an industry that is widely viewed as one of Turkey’s foremost sectors. It featured prominently at the International Defence Industry Fair in Istanbul this week.

The fighter which will replace the Turkish Air Force’s ageing F-4 and F-16 jets is due to be unveiled to the public in 2023 the centenary of the founding of the Turkish republic and is expected to be operational two years later.

“All the missile systems will be from local companies” said Zengin pointing to rows of missiles produced by Roketsan and Tubitak under the plane’s wings.

“The final objective is to have an aircraft that is 100 percent Turkish although initially it will use an F110 engine” he added referring to the GE Aviation-designed engine built under licence in Turkey.

The introduction of the TF – previously known as the TF-X until passing the experimental stage – has gained added urgency after Turkey was kicked off the US-led F-35 stealth fighter project.

Ankara was removed from the programme in 2019 after it acquired Russian S-400 missile defence systems that the US claimed threatened the F-35’s secrets.

It had ordered more than 100 of the jets and invested at least $1.2bn in developing the fighter with other Western allies.

Washington later imposed sanctions targeting the Turkish defence industry over the S-400 purchase although these seem to have done little to dent Turkey’s race to produce cutting-edge weaponry.

Turkey has hosted the defence fair every two years since 1993 and this year saw more than 1200 exhibition stands from 53 countries take part catering to delegates from 83 nations.

A huge exhibition hall on the western outskirts of Istanbul was given over to the four-day event where the merchandise on display ranged from infantry boots to 2000-pound (907kg) bombs and towering armoured personnel carriers to sniper scopes.

Foreign generals their chests bristling with medals rubbed shoulders with young Turkish men in jeans and T-shirts eager to try out the handguns on offer and pose for photos clutching assault rifles.

When Al Jazeera attended on Friday two government ministers – Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and Minister of Industry and Technology Mustafa Varank – toured the exhibits followed by a trail of bodyguards officials and journalists.

“The Turkish defence industry continued to grow stronger even under the conditions of COVID-19” said Murat Ikinci general manager at Roketsan the largest supplier of missiles to the Turkish military and a key player in Turkey’s space programme.

“Now it’s time to show our power to the whole world.”

Speaking at the opening of the fair on Tuesday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underscored the importance placed in the industry.

“As a country that was forsaken at the most critical moments of its fight against terrorism and unable to acquire any of the products it needed while its borders were under threat we were compelled to take steps to meet our own needs quickly” he said.

The value of defence projects has risen from $5.4bn in 2002 to $55.8bn last year according to the government’s Defence Industries Directorate while defence and aerospace exports rose from $248m to $3.1bn between 2002 and 2019.

This growth has been driven by a desire to be “independent of foreign countries and foreign policies” according to Gurkan Cetin who leads the robotics and autonomous systems project at Havelsan.

“Turkey has experienced some trouble getting some weapon systems and components in the past and this made us leap forward to provide what we need ourselves” he told Al Jazeera.

The US a leading supplier of Turkish weaponry imposed an arms embargo following Turkey’s 1974 invasion of Cyprus and more recently several NATO countries blocked defence sales after Turkey launched an operation against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria in 2019.

The expansion in the defence sector’s financial muscle has been accompanied by a growing sense of pride in the proven effectiveness of Turkish weapons systems in Syria Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh.

“Many Turkish weapons systems have been tested in combat which is important because it shows what they can do in the field” said Zengin.

Turkey’s aerial drone project in particular has caught the eyes of the world with Qatar Ukraine Morocco Azerbaijan Tunisia and fellow NATO member Poland ordering armed UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) with a proven track record against Russian-made armour and air defence systems.

Defence analyst Arda Mevlutoglu pointed to the “unprecedented” use of drones in coordination with artillery manned combat aircraft and electronic assets in recent conflicts.

Missile-laden drones were “extremely effective” against tanks artillery and fixed positions with the added psychological advantage of publishing images of drone strikes on social media he added.

All this adds to Turkey’s sense of growing self-confidence in the realm of war.

“We aren’t trying to sell anything here today” one employee manning the Turkish Aerospace exhibit said. “We’re just here to show the world what we can do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYWJyaWNhdG9yLmNvbS9hZGRpdGl2ZXJlcG9ydC9uZXdzL2FkZGl0aXZlL2NoaW5vb2staGVsaWNvcHRlci10YWtlcy10by10aGUtYWlyLXdpdGgtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LWNyaXRpY2FsLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtcGFydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinook helicopter takes to the air with first flight-critical 3D-printed part,"A recently completed engine demonstration proved that a Boeing Chinook heavy-lift helicopter can be fitted with more powerful engines—in this case GE Aviation’s T408s.

But that wasn’t the demo’s only achievement. Boeing also installed a 3D-printed aluminum transmission housing—reportedly the first flight-critical part on a rotorcraft.

Using AM technology for the gearbox housing reduced the long lead time needed with traditional manufacturing and enabled design enhancements that improved quality reports Boeing. The 3D-printed transmission housing is expected to promote greater use of AM in the aircraft industry.

“AM allows a level of creativity in design that is not possible with traditional methods and is being used to optimize the design of better aerospace products” said Melissa Orme vice president of Boeing Additive Manufacturing. “We’re continuously looking to identify opportunities where we can employ additive manufacturing to improve product performance through streamlining the vehicle reducing its weight and providing more durability.”

Joining Boeing in the multiyear project were the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation & Missile Center (DEVCOM AvMC) and GE Aviation. The success of the project demonstrates how integration of more powerful engines on the H-47 Chinook could support future aircraft capability and Army Aviation modernization efforts while reducing technical and integration risk according to a GE press release. The twin 7500-shaft-horsepower T408 engines offer a 54% increase in power over the Chinook’s current engines.

The demo team conducted 18 ground tests from late 2019 into early 2021. Despite travel restrictions posed by COVID-19 the team completed all required ground tests before the first flight in September 2020. The flight-test program explored the T408-powered Chinook’s capabilities at three different gross-weight configurations airspeeds up to 140 knots turns at bank angles up to 60 degrees and altitudes of 4000 ft. Results of the flight demonstrations will be used to inform future Army plans.

“The T408 program is a great example of how AvMC’s collaboration with industry partners is producing new capabilities for our aviation warfighters” said Col. Justin Highley commander of Systems Integration and Demonstration AvMC Technology Development Directorate for Aviation. “Integrating a new engine onto a production aircraft was a large undertaking but the team rose to the challenge and met all the program goals. I am particularly proud of the resilience they showed in completing the final integration and testing in a COVID environment which is a testament to this team’s dedication to our soldiers.”",,,,,,,,,

During our interview I confess in passing to having an unhealthy attachment to my iPhone checking it every few minutes like a compulsive tic (sound familiar?) Lembke is having none of it. She wants me to abstain from using it for at least 24 hours by locking it in a drawer and going out. The first 12 hours will be filled with anxiety and Fomo but as time unfolds I’ll experience a sense of “real freedom” will gain insight into my relationship with my digital companion and will “resolve to get back to using it a little differently” she says speaking with a soothing yet firm tone.

I’d do well to heed her advice. As the chief of Stanford University’s dual diagnosis addiction clinic (which caters to people with more than one disorder) Lembke has spent the past 25-plus years treating patients addicted to everything from heroin gambling and sex to video games Botox and ice baths. The bespectacled 53-year-old psychiatrist has written an influential book about the prescription-drug epidemic delivered Ted Talks on America’s opioid crisis and appeared as a talking head in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma to discuss the drug that is social media. She’s a whiz on why we get hooked on things – and how we can enjoy pleasurable things in healthier doses.

Her new book Dopamine Nation emphasises that we are now all addicts to a degree. She calls the smartphone the “modern-day hypodermic needle”: we turn to it for quick hits seeking attention validation and distraction with each swipe like and tweet. Since the turn of the millennium behavioural (as opposed to substance) addictions have soared. Every spare second is an opportunity to be stimulated whether by entering the TikTok vortex scrolling Instagram swiping through Tinder or bingeing on porn online gambling and e-shopping.

“We’re seeing a huge explosion in the numbers of people struggling with minor addictions” says Lembke.

That has consequences. Although we have endless founts of fun at our fingertips “the data shows we’re less and less happy” she says. Global depression rates have been climbing significantly in the past 30 years and according to a World Happiness Report people in high-income countries have become more unhappy over the past decade or so. We’ve forgotten how to be alone with our thoughts. We’re forever “interrupting ourselves” as Lembke puts it for a quick digital hit meaning we rarely concentrate on taxing tasks for long or get into a creative flow. For many the pandemic has exacerbated dependence on social media and other digital vices as well as alcohol and drugs.

Addiction is a spectrum disorder: it’s not as simple as being an addict or not being an addict. It’s deemed worthy of clinical care when it “significantly interferes” with someone’s life and ability to function but when it comes to minor digital attachments the effect is pernicious. “It gets into philosophical questions: how is the time I’m spending on my phone in subtle ways affecting my ability to be a good parent spouse or friend?” says Lembke. “I do believe there is a cost – one that I don’t think we fully recognise because it’s hard to [see it] when you’re in it.”

She wrote Dopamine Nation because she believes her recovering patients – whether 60-something Jacob who built a masturbation machine to satiate his sex habit; teenaged Delilah who couldn’t get out of bed unless she was high on cannabis; or Chi who bought thousands of cheap consumer goods online just to experience the thrill of opening the package – have “acquired a wisdom we all could benefit from”.

Applying lessons learned from inside her Silicon Valley office which is furnished with a painting of giant peaches and a colourful coffee-stained tapestry she’s urging us to make space in our brains to let our thoughts wash over us rather than constantly seeking stimulation. It might seem a little less fun and it will involve tolerating discomfort rather than seeking refuge in shiny things but this “new form of asceticism” is she promises the “path to the good life”.

To understand addiction you must first understand dopamine dubbed “the Kim Kardashian of molecules” owing to its mainstream prominence. The chemical sometimes referred to as the “feelgood” hormone features in countless song lyrics and its molecular structure – resembling an insect with antennae and a long tail – has even become a popular tattoo (which proves people will get anything inked on their biceps).

With cocaine you run out of money but TikTok is indefatigable

Rather than giving us pleasure itself as is commonly thought dopamine motivates us to do things we think will bring pleasure. As the brain’s major reward and pleasure neurotransmitter it’s what drives us to seek pizza when we’re hungry and sex when we’re aroused. Scientists use dopamine to measure “the addictive potential of any experience” writes Lembke. The higher the dopamine release the more addictive the thing.

We experience a hike in dopamine in anticipation of doing something as well as when we do the thing itself which makes us want to continue doing it. As soon as it’s finished we experience a comedown or dopamine dip. That’s because the brain operates via a self-regulating process called homeostasis meaning that “for every high there is a low” says Lembke. In this comedown state “we really want that second piece of chocolate or to watch another episode” she says but if we’re not severely addicted the craving soon passes.

Although dopamine was only identified by scientists in 1957 seeking pleasure is hardwired into our brains. With addiction about 50% is down to genetic disposition with the other 50% coming from environmental factors such as access says Lembke. Our brains haven’t changed much over the centuries but access to addictive things certainly has. Whereas our ancestors put all their efforts into seeking a mate and tasty food we can find those and much more besides with the click of an app.

When we binge on pleasurable things homeostasis means “our brain compensates by bringing us lower and lower and lower” says Lembke. Each time the thing becomes less enjoyable but we eventually become dependent on those stimuli to keep functioning. We spiral into a joy-seeking abyss. The digital world enables bingeing on a previously unseen scale because there are no practical limitations forcing us to pause. With substances you eventually run out of money or lines of cocaine (even temporarily) but Netflix shows or TikTok feeds are indefatigable. Often you needn’t do anything: the next hit automatically loads on your screen.

As well as compromising our attention spans Lembke says our obsession with instant gratification means we’re constantly living in our limbic brain which processes emotions rather than in our pre-frontal cortex which deals with future planning and problem-solving and is important for personality development. When we’re confronted with a complex or unsettling issue in our work or social lives our digital companions are always there to help us escape the stickiness of life with an easy distraction. (And the version of life presented on screens removes all rough edges: faces are filtered and beautiful there are no awkward silences and if we don’t like what we see we can simply click on another tab.)

“It’s very different from how life used to be when we had to tolerate a lot more distress” says Lembke. “We’re losing our capacity to delay gratification solve problems and deal with frustration and pain in its many different forms.”

Dopamine has been dubbed 'the Kim Kardashian of molecules' owing to its mainstream prominence

Want to kick your habit? Like my phone-in-locked-drawer situation you should start with a period of fasting from 24 hours up to one month (the longer the better). Make sure you can’t access the thing during the first 12 hours when cravings are most acute – willpower is only so strong.

The purpose of that time away says Lembke is to reset our brain’s pathways and gain perspective on how our dependency affects us. The goal is generally not to banish it forever but to figure out how to enjoy it in moderation – that most elusive of things. Some will realise they cannot enjoy it without going too far but usually “self-binding” techniques should help with finding a balance. You might try putting barriers between you and the vice like removing all screens from your bedroom putting your phone on airplane mode or committing to only using the thing at certain times like at weekends. These will be more manageable after your initial fast. It’s “easier to go from abstinence to moderation than from excessive consumption to moderation” says Lembke.

It’s crucial to take time to just be. “As soon as we’re done with this interview you’ll check your phone and I’ll check my email” says Lembke. “We’re not going to let ourselves process this experience in a way that unfolds naturally.” Scientific studies have observed the importance of “resting mental networks” meaning that in between activities people demonstrate “a synchronicity between different parts of the brain that has its own rhythm and breathing” she says. It’s likely that this state contributes to original ideas and a general sense of wellness. Like the Dutch practice of niksen which involves setting aside time each day to do nothing it’s about being still with your thoughts.

Many of these ideas are familiar: we’ve all heard about digital detoxes and mindfulness practices but unlike many spiritual gurus Lembke is straight-shooting. She is not promising sunshine and rainbows. Yes it’s natural and healthy to pursue enjoyment but our consumer culture has created an expectation “that life is supposed to be so fun!” she says. “And really it’s not. Life is a slog and I think if we could admit that and take comfort in knowing we’re not alone in the day-to-day struggle paradoxically we would be happier.”

We’re losing our capacity to delay gratification solve problems

It’s a sobering thought. Because the bounty of high-octane stimuli enables us to instantly boost our mood – something previous generations couldn’t do to the same degree – we’re under the impression we can fully control when we feel joy. In reality our drip-fed tech-fuelled bliss is fleeting and often less than blissful. The main message is to stop hunting for pleasure all the time.It’s too much of a good thing and all that.

Lembke is sanguine that we can beat our digital dependencies by embracing a more monastic mindset. She advocates replacing some pleasure-seeking vices with“painful” pursuits. When we do things that are challenging – going for a run having an ice bath talking to a stranger reading a book on philosophy – instead of receiving a dopamine boost beforehand we experience it afterwards. “Doing things that are hard is one of the best ways to pursue a life worth living because the pleasure we get afterwards is more enduring” she says.We tend to forget that earned highs are that much sweeter.

Even if the idea of swapping an episode of Mare of Easttown for a jog sounds cruel just opening yourself up to the realisation that you shouldn’t expect to be dazzled 24/7 seems like a feasible shift in thinking. As does letting your mind wander uninterrupted with increased frequency. Just remember: it all starts with a phone in a drawer.

When he shows pictures of celebrities like Kendall Jenner or Miley Cyrus to his students on a screen they immediately recognize them. But faced with photos of policymakers like Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi the children stare blankly.

That ignorance is no joke to Adams he writes in his new book “Hollowed Out: A Warning About America’s Next Generation” (Regnery Publishing) out now.

“We need to brace ourselves for what lies ahead. I write this book as an alarm bell … a project born out of worry concern and frustration.”

A National Teacher of the Year nominee Adams frets that today’s youngsters are “barren of the behavior values and hopes from which human beings have traditionally found higher meaning … or even simple contentment.” Adams calls them “hollowed out” a generation living solitary lives hyperconnected to technology but unattached from their families churches or communities. He cites statistics showing teen depression rose 63 percent from 2007 to 2017 while teen suicide grew 56 percent. Tragically he writes suicide has become the second leading cause of death for the young.

3 Teacher and author Jeremy Adams

While teachers once helped students become their “best selves” by putting the focus on curriculums lesson plans and test scores he writes that’s given way to trying to “understand” young people through programs emphasizing suicide and depression awareness human trafficking concerns or bullying gangs and shootings.

Adams blames the dissolution of the American family for this shift with marriage rates down and the number of traditional two-parent homes plummeting. Although studies have shown that regular family dinners leads to less youth “smoking binge drinking marijuana use violence school problems eating disorders and sexual activity” most of Adams’ students say they eat dinner alone each night focused not on family but the device in their hand.

“The neglect of family life is one of the greatest causes of the hollowing out not only of students but of American life” Adams writes.

3 Adams writes that kids easily recognize celebrities but have little familiarity with our country’s leaders — and most couldn’t pass a citizenship test. Alamy

He also bemoans the evaporation of religious life. While only 2 percent of Americans identified themselves as “atheists” in 1984 that number was 22 percent by 2020. A college religion professor notes that when he discusses Matthew from the Bible many students think he’s talking about Matthew Perry of “Friends.” And Luke? His students assume it’s the guy from “Beverly Hills 90210.”

Religion has been replaced by “a mass culture of ‘banality conformity and self-indulgence’ ” Adams writes not to mention an obsession with technology. He notes that in the 1970s more than 50 percent of high schoolers hung out with friends “every day” but by 2020 that number had dropped below 33 percent. Modern high schoolers regularly forgo traditional activities like Friday night football games to hunker down alone “watching Netflix Hulu or Disney+.” That helps explain why in 2012 49 percent of teens ranked “in person” as their favorite way to talk but in 2018 only 32 percent did.

Modern students constantly text during classes Adams says or watch streaming services during Zoom meetings living in a state that psychiatrists call “continuous partial attention.” Studies show the average Gen Z student uses five electronic devices and has an 8-second attention span which results in “lower grades diminished ability to concentrate and stunted academic achievement.”

Adams predicts that today’s young people will be unprepared for the future. In 2014 a US general was quoted saying “the quality of people willing to serve has been declining rapidly” with 71 percent of current 17- to 24-year-olds ineligible due to obesity criminal records or mental health or drug issues. Meanwhile a recent survey highlighted that while 70 percent of senior citizens could pass a US citizenship test less than 20 percent of those under 45 could Adams writes.

Not that today’s youngsters seem to care.

“I never hear young people professing love for their country” Adams writes. “I used to. But not lately. That is when I really think teachers have a front row seat for America’s decline.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvZGlnaXRhbGZvdW5kcnktMjAyMS1zaGFkb3ctb2YtdG9tYi1yYWlkZXJzLXBzNS1hbmQteGJveC1zZXJpZXMtcGF0Y2gtdGVzdGVk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shadow of Tomb Raider's PS5 and Xbox Series patch tested,"A surprise update recently arrived for Shadow of the Tomb Raider giving the best of both worlds for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles: a high resolution that looks great on 4K displays in addition to a 60fps target. And if the consistency of the frame-rate isn't good enough for you the legacy 1080p performance mode remains. In our opinion the revised quality mode is the one to play and the differences in how PS5 and Xbox Series X deliver it is intriguing.

At the base level Shadow of the Tomb Raider on Xbox Series consoles now enjoys an official 'optimised for Series X/S' patch label suggesting a native app while the upgrade is still flagged as a PlayStation 4 title when running on PS5. However it's pretty clear that despite the new labelling on Xbox the game is still running on the older XDK - it hasn't been ported to the new GDK and so doesn't tap into the more advanced features of the RDNA 2 GPU. We can ascertain this simply because the game looks and runs exactly as it did via Microsoft's FPS Boost upgrade: performance is identical resolutions are the same - 2016p on Series X 900p on Series S. The difference for Microsoft machines is that a progression bug introduced by FPS Boost is now addressed. In effect FPS Boost is made official by Square-Enix and the bug is gone.

The changes for PlayStation 5 running the game under backwards compatibility are more interesting. The resolution mode operates at 1872p with a 30fps cap on PS4 Pro and until the patch arrived it was the same on PlayStation 5. However Square-Enix has switched things up now: Pro is still running at 1872p but the PS5 runs at 2160p with performance enhanced via the accelerant that is checkerboard rendering. It's an interesting choice by the developer - the suggestion is that 60fps could not have been achieved by retaining the original release. Checkerboarding lowers the pixel count but allows the PS5 to deliver a higher level of performance.

Although the resolution mode targets 60fps - and does a pretty good job overall - neither PS5 or Series X can lock to it so the 1080p performance mode still has a role to play albeit of reduced significance. It essentially removes all of the remaining GPU-level bottlenecks and gets a flatline 60fps the only remaining dips to performance coming from minor blips linked to camera cuts during cinematics. Many games do this: it's a means to start rendering effects like motion blur and even physics effects with an extra frame to buffer and ensures even TAA treatment to all frames.

As for how Series X and PS5 compare in their respective resolution modes the Microsoft machine is pushing many more pixels than its Sony counterpart giving a marginal lead overall in image quality. Meanwhile PlayStation 5 gets significantly closer to the target 60 frames per second struggling only in areas with a lot of transparency effects - the flood sequence early on in the game is the ultimate workout.

Series X is basically the same but with less stability and more performance drops. Again alpha effects are the primary culprit: the crash of waves and even transparency-heavy woodland areas see the console play out continuously in the 50s. It's great to see the resolution stay in line with the Xbox One X version but you can't help but feel it pays a price for it - though if you're playing on a variable refresh rate display the impact is diminished.

We took a look at that here along with a huge array of other FPS Boost titles released in the same batch.Watch on YouTube

In comparing the two consoles in resolution mode we're given an interesting contrast. There's no doubt that PS5 delivers smoother performance: the 4K checkerboard technique works well and generally allows for a tighter lock at 60fps. Series X has a clearer image - one closer to a true 4K in raw detail but in motion the detail break-up you experience with PS5's checkerboard rendering is disguised by the game's TAA and motion blur. It's a strong use of the technique that gets it close enough to pass as a native presentation. The savings PS5 also gets in frame-rate terms can be stark too. At some points we're seeing a lead of around 10fps in PS5's favour and it rings true as a more optimal 'up to' 60fps experience.

Of course we should mention Xbox Series S too. The reality of this version is that it hits 60fps with any issue whatsoever at least from the first few hours. Even the worst hit areas in Series X do not trouble the Series S. It's a superb lock at 60fps but the 900p resolution is a bit of a downer: it's not that you get aliasing artefacts or shimmer you just get a reduction in clarity. It's a bit tooblurry. The net result isn't all too flattering to look at on a big 4K screen though at the very least a smoother frame-rate is locked down. Really though a 1080p60 option would have been a good bonus.

Ultimately this is an interesting patch. On Xbox Series consoles Shadow of the Tomb Raider patch 2.01 essentially makes the FPS Boost upgrade official delivering identical performance but addressing the progression bug. Meanwhile the changes to PS5 are more substantial - it's one of the few backwards compatibility upgrades we've seen that actually changes resolution in addition to removing the frame-rate cap. Checkerboarding works well in both cutting down resolution with a minimal hit to image quality while at the same time allowing the console to power on to a mostly locked 60fps. Regardless of platform though a great game has received an even better way to play - and if nothing else it's a new excuse to play it if you haven't already or to revisit it if you have. The game still looks stunning and benefits tremendously from the performance upgrade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsam91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9yZXZpZXctY2FtZXJvbi1tYXRoaXNvbi1haXJzLWhpcy1maXJzdC1zY2VuZXMtYXMtZHJldy1jYWluLW9uLWdlbmVyYWwtaG9zcGl0YWwvYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Cameron Mathison airs his first scenes as Drew Cain on 'General Hospital',"Cameron Mathison as the new Drew Cain.

This week acclaimed actor Cameron Mathison aired his intense scenes as the new Drew Cain on the ABC daytime drama “General Hospital.” Digital Journal has the scoop.

Sam (Kelly Monaco) received a phone call from Drew from a private/unknown number and the man on the phone claims that he is Drew and that he needs her help. She doesn’t know what to make of the situation because she believes that Drew has been dead for two years.

Drew swears to Sam that it really is him and that he doesn’t have much time and then the phone line goes dead. Then he is thrown into a prison cell by a guard named Russel (played convincingly by Josh Murray) who informs Drew that the jail cell is the last place he is ever going to see.

On the following day Russel tells Drew that “The Boss” won’t be happy that he was trying to escape. Drew makes an offer with Russel and suggests he doubles his salary if he can help him get to the nearest airport and if he reveals to him who has been holding him prisoner all of these years.

Russel states that there is no amount of money that is was worth double-crossing “The Boss.” Drew is hopeful that Sam will be asking questions about his sudden disappearance and if he could really be alive.

The audience then sees flashback scenes when Drew’s daughter Scout is born and Cameron Mathison really tugs at the heart in those heartwarming scenes when she was a newborn in the hospital. For Scout’s sake he promises to do everything in his power to get back home.

Russel returns with bad news for Drew. He tells him that “The Boss” wasn’t happy about his attempt to escape. Russel also threatens that Sam will be dead before she leaves the United States if she tries to find Drew.

Drew and Russel have a fight but Russel ends up victorious this time and he tells Drew that one day he will get him very angry that he will snap his neck; however fortunately Drew stole Russel’s pen and he will use it to pick the lock on the cuffs so that he can get out of them.

Will Drew Cain get out of this foreign prison and somehow make his way back to Port Charles? Only time will tell. Tune in to “General Hospital” on ABC to see how this storyline will unfold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTM3MzYyMDk3L3d3ZS1tdXN0YWZhLWFsaS1oZWVsLWNoYXJhY3Rlci1zdGVyZW90eXBlcy1tYW5zb29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE's Mustafa Ali﻿ on playing a heel without negative stereotypes,"WWE's Mustafa Ali was unveiled as the leader of heel faction Retribution last July and although the group are no longer together he's still playing a bad guy on Raw.

Recently Ali has been seen forming an alliance with Mansoor and trying to turn the young Superstar against the rest of the WWE locker room.

Speaking exclusively to Digital Spy ahead of WWE SummerSlam Ali explained why it was important to him to make sure his character avoided any negative stereotypes that may have been seen in the past.

WWE

""For me the biggest thing is I don't want to be a heel or be portrayed as a bad guy because of where I'm from because of what my name is or because of my religion"" Ali said.

""I think those are detrimental to society because I grew up with that feeling I grew up with the feeling that I had to hide who I was. I had to hide what my religion was because anytime I saw someone on TV that looked like me they were being portrayed in a very negative stereotypical way.

""That had real implications on my life it still does to this day. I feel like I'm always fighting that. So with that being said I do feel like doing a bad guy role or a heel role is perfectly fine as long as I'm not reinforcing those negative stereotypes.""

Speaking about his current character Ali said: ""It's nothing more than someone that's bitter and jaded and that's a real life thing. We all can relate to someone that's just mad and he blames everyone.

WWE

""That's my current role. Everyone knows I'm very talented but I'm yet to win a championship I've been seldomly featured on pay-per-views. So I'm using all that real-life stuff as fuel for this character.""

Describing his character's relationship with Mansoor Ali continued: ""He has this one little tiny soft spot in his heart for Mansoor because he sees himself in Mansoor and he doesn't want Mansoor to suffer the same fate that he did.

""But Mansoor's just like 'Everything's great!' And in reality Mansoor's hoping he's able to pull Ali out of this funk and bring Ali back to this light back to this babyface good guy role. So I think it's a super interesting dynamic.""

WWE

Reflecting on his past as a babyface compared to his current role Ali added: ""I did enjoy my time as a babyface. I feel like I had a real connection with the fans and people could see that was the authentic version of me.

""But at the end of the day you have to kind of figure out where you lie as far as trying to get yourself on TV each week. I feel like with this heel character my options are far more open as far as what I'm able to talk about and I'm a very good talker.

""When you're a good guy sometimes you're very limited in what you can say but when you're this jaded bitter kind of like an a-hole you're mad at this guy and this guy and then you can kind of just go off and for some reason that just seems so click with people at the moment.""

Share this obituary

Don passed away peacefully surrounded by family in Seattle Saturday afternoon August 21 2021 at the age of 95. Don was a quiet kind loving man and the most nurturing of fathers- a man ahead of his time.

Don was born July 6 1926 in Helena Montana to William A. and Vivian (Sires) Wirth. Don had four brothers and one sister and many fond memories of his childhood in Montana including many family outings in the country. One memorable adventure was when Don got stuck on a ledge while climbing Mt. Helena not being able to go up or down. Perhaps the many hours spent singing in the Cathedral of Saint Helena choir contributed to his eventual deliverance.

Don's family moved to Seattle after the outbreak of WW2. Don was a proud WW2 veteran. He enlisted in the army at age 17 and was training for the upcoming Battle of the Bulge. He would have been deployed but for a benevolent sergeant who pulled him out to train as an MP. As an MP Don was stationed near Hitler's Eagle's Nest as the Allies took over Germany.

After moving to Seattle Don attended O'Dea High School and then Seattle University. While in college Don worked as an elevator operator at Swedish Hospital where in his elevator he met a lovely RN named Alice who became his future wife.

Don and Alice married in 1948 and had 4 children and later 7 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. They spent 10 happy years in San Diego and then returned to Seattle and Queen Anne Hill remaining there for the rest of their 69 year marriage.

Don had a long career as an accountant working for Boeing Ryan Aircraft General Dynamics and King County Wa.

Don was a devoted Catholic and long time member of St. Anne's Parish in Seattle. Don's interests included reading every book he could get his hands on taking long walks with Alice watching sports on television listening to all types of music from opera to ""The Ink Spots"". Don enjoyed working in his yard and was known in his Queen Anne neighborhood as the only man who did yard work while wearing a shirt and tie no doubt owing to his accounting background.

Don is lovingly remembered by his children Patty Weeks (Brian) Jeannie Greaves (Rick) Don Wirth Jr. (Sandy) and Alice Finston. He was much loved by his grandchildren Tom Anne Adam Mike Dave Gina and Garet. Family was the most important part of Don's life. He was a devoted husband and a loving father. He will be missed.

We would like to thank Amor and her team at Magnolia Home Care for the wonderful care they gave our dad during his last years.

Instead that amount of money was used to fund the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics A-12 Avenger a proposed attack aircraft that never even got off the ground.

Not to be confused with the Lockheed A-12 program from the 1960s this project was born in the early 1980s as part of the U.S. Navy’s Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program. The goal was to develop a replacement for the Grumman A-6 Intruder with an aircraft that would utilize stealth technology.

By late 1984 design contracts were awarded to two different teams: one at McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics; and the other at Northrop Grumman and Vought. After the latter team dropped out in 1988 it was left to McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics who selected to develop the new aircraft.

Named the Avenger II in honor of the Grumman TBF/TBM torpedo bomber used during the World War II the A-12 was to be an all-weather carrier-based stealth bomber. It would incorporate more advanced stealth characteristics than were used in the F-117A as well as a significantly greater payload capability.

It was designed as a twin-seat aircraft that would be capable of reaching a maximum speed of 580 mph and have a strike radius of nearly 500 miles. As a flying-wing design the A-12 Avenger II featured a relatively small fuselage and minimal tail surface which significantly reduced drag. The basic version was also developed to operate as an anti-ship and close air support aircraft. Initially the Navy sought to acquire around 620 of the A-12s while the United States Marine Corps wanted an additional 238 aircraft and the Air Force even considered purchasing another 400 to replace its aging F-111 Aardvarks.

If the total 1258 aircraft had been built then the Avenger II would have the United States military’s most plentiful aircraft after the Army’s fleet of UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.

An A Not F

Intended to serve aboard carriers the flying wing wasn’t large in size—just slightly over 37 feet long with a wingspan that was only about 70 feet. That would have enabled two of the aircraft to still sit side-by-side on adjacent catapults on a carrier flight deck. Its sharp triangular shape earned the A-12 the nickname “the flying Dorito.”

While it could fly faster and further than the aircraft it was meant to replace the compact size of the flying wing A-12 meant that it could only carry around 5150 pounds of internal ordnance—a far cry from the 18000 pounds carried by the Intruder. Instead of packing a hard punch the A-12 Avenger II was really meant to strike targets without warning rather than to blanket a target in a bomb run.

The Navy even opted to utilize the “A” prefix to further demonstrate that the aircraft’s primary role was to be used against ground targets despite the fact that the A-12 was to be armed with two internally-stored AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles. However stealth not dogfighting abilities was still meant to be the aircraft’s primary defense.

Crash and Burn

The program appeared to be going smoothly but in fact it was behind schedule and way over budget. One issue was that the aircraft was simply too heavy and its designers were unable to reconcile that issue. Officials at the Pentagon essentially buried their heads in the sand refusing to believe the project wasn’t actually on track.

The use of composite materials was an issue as was the maintainability. Eventually the Department of Defense (DoD) declared that the contractors simply could not complete the program as planned and then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney canceled it outright on January 7 1991.

That wasn’t actually the end of the matter either. The contractors were ordered to return about $2 billion spent on the program which McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed. Legal issues dragged on for more than a decade and only after reaching the United States Supreme Court the DoD was ordered to return the money to the contractors.

When the contract was canceled by the program thirty years ago it was the largest contract termination in DoD history—but by one estimation the A-12 had become so expensive that it could have consumed up to 70 percent of the Navy’s aircraft budget within just three years.

The news was accompanied by a sudden rush of hand-wringing over the fate that awaits the Afghan people. ""The Taliban insists it has changed. Afghanistan's future hinges on whether that's true"" read one headline in the Washington Post.

But over the last 20 years the future and well-being of ordinary Afghans — continuously bombed starved and displaced by all sides and all armies — have been buried under different headlines. It took a nationwide resurgence of the bearded brutal  cruelly misogynistic Taliban — picture-perfect antagonists for American audiences — to wrench Afghan civilians from the bottom of the priority pile as if life in Afghanistan before last weekend had been a rosy affair.

In addition to watching in horror as the Taliban made themselves comfortable in Kabul's presidential palace much of this coverage bemoaned the war's tactical failures. It was viewed in other words not as a catastrophic decision to have been made in the first place but as a logistical embarrassment.

Yet this meandering ineffectual deadly war — the longest in American history — was a grand victory for one behemoth sector of manufacturing that thrives upon tactical failures and stalemates: the military-industrial complex .

Mainstream coverage of Afghanistan this past week touched a bit on military spending but generally omitted the vast profits accumulated since 2001 by big guns like Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and Raytheon as well as hundreds of smaller and lesser-known defense contractors.

Instead such reports framed the American occupation as a moral imperative. Ever since George W. Bush swaggered into what some call the Heart of Asia — mountainous gorgeous ever-antagonized — the invasion unlike that of Iraq has been seen as a flawed but justified battle against evil: the Taliban al-Qaida and terrorism.

The initial poster boy for military action of course was Osama bin Laden. But when he escaped into Pakistan — on horseback the story goes — a mere two months after the U.S. started dropping bombs the war was repurposed as a ""feminist mission … to liberate Afghan women from their burqas"" as Arundhati Roy put it in 2002. When the Taliban were beaten out of governance the mission changed again — this time to one of grueling corruption-prone  glacially incremental reconstruction. The U.S. would build Bush said at the time ""an Afghanistan that is free from this evil and is a better place to live."" What this really meant whether or not he knew it was fresh billions — and steady billions — for the Pentagon State Department contractors mercenaries and a host of Afghan warlords and politicians .

The war was ultimately a colossal financial operation with an unfathomable toll in taxpayer dollars and human lives. That it accomplished virtually nothing of political or civic durability only confirms this.

""Largely out of sight our gargantuan military machine is also increasingly out of mind especially when it comes to the ways in which it spends and misspends our money"" Andrew Cockburn wrote in Harper's in 2019.

Indeed the $2.26 trillion that the U.S. spent on Afghanistan is hardly a comprehensible number — its scale obscures the venality at play. But if we hone in on days and months on individual multimillion-dollar contracts awarded to companies supplying explosives helmets boots and armed security guards we can see what the spoils of war really look like.

One only needs to spend a few minutes perusing the Department of Defense's contracts page to get a sense of how much money U.S. taxpayers were allotting daily to the war as recently as July 30. So far this year the Pentagon has given away $225.83 million in contacts for work exclusively intended for Afghanistan and another $498.08 million for work partly in Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly these are small sums in comparison to earlier years when military operations were thriving. In just August and September 2015 the DOD signed away $672.95 million solely for America's ""forever war.""

Days selected at random show us where our money was going in Afghanistan in lieu of strengthening our own schools health care infrastructure and social services:

On Dec. 31 2014 DynCorp International LLC was awarded $100.78 million to train police and army officers at the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior.

On June 22 2016 ​​Harris Corp. received $1.7 billion for ""radios ancillaries spare parts and services.""

On Feb. 14 2017 Propper International Inc. was awarded $32.46 million for ""hot weather combat boots."" A week later Wolverine World Wide Inc. received $17.99 million for ""tan temperate weather combat boots.""

On April 28 2017 ORC Industries Inc. was awarded $20.49 million for wet weather ponchos.

On July 3 2019 AAR Defense Systems & Logistics received $209.96 million to train recruits for the Afghan Air Force among other tasks.

On April 30 2020 L-3 Fuzing and Ordnance Systems Inc. won $64.97 million for an order of multi-option fuzes to trigger mortars.

""I don't think I could overstate that this was a system just basically designed for funneling money and wasting or losing equipment"" said a U.S. veteran with Joint Command which oversaw training of Afghan forces in a wrenching interview with Michael Tracey last month.

The veteran's frustrating (and not at all uncommon) experiences testify to Andrew Cockburn's assertion that ""if we understand that the [military industrial complex] exists purely to sustain itself and grow it becomes easier to make sense of the corruption mismanagement and war and understand why despite warnings over allegedly looming threats we remain in reality so poorly defended.""

To publish tactical analyses by people like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin a former director of Raytheon while ignoring the vast profits accumulated by that company from never-ending wars symbolizes the ingrained failure of the mainstream press to scrutinize our political leaders in ways that matter. When Austin pressed President Biden to preserve a military presence in Afghanistan for example the New York Times reported it with no apparent irony.

Austin was just one of a sizable number of establishmentarian voices urging that the occupation be prolonged in one form or another. Former Secretary Hillary Clinton warned of ""huge consequences"" if troops were to be withdrawn. Former Secretary Condoleezza Rice sagely recommended a sustained counterterrorism mission. Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff foresaw ""some really dramatic bad possible outcomes.""

Jim Mattis who took a short break as a director of General Dynamics to serve as Trump's defense secretary warned that withdrawal from Afghanistan could leave the U.S. vulnerable to threats of terrorism. In the less than two years that Mattis served in Trump's cabinet General Dynamics was awarded $277.66 million for work either fully or partly in Afghanistan.

When we lose sight of the bigger picture — of history cycles agendas and consequences — we can find ourselves seduced by the smaller picture: a bombing here an atrocity there a rifle-toting militant sitting behind an ornately carved presidential desk. We forget who attacked whom first. Who funded whom. Who profited. Who lied. In isolation sensationalized increments capitalize upon our outrage preserving axioms and insulating institutions.

In its editorial last week condemning the fall of Kabul the New York Times solemnly referred to the 20-year occupation as ""a story of mission creep and hubris but also of the enduring American faith in the values of freedom and democracy."" The paper of record's editorial board dwelled on American soldiers lost not Afghan civilians slaughtered. It reserved its rancor for the ""militants"" overrunning the region not the foreign militaries that precipitated its bloody unraveling. It went so far as to lionize the U.S. military as a ""logistical superpower"" able to ""move heaven and earth."" The chaotic scenes of Afghans swarming an American military plane at the Kabul airport the Times observed  ""seemed to capture the moment more vividly than words: a symbol of America's military might flying out of the country even as Afghans hung on against all hope.""

Other influential newspapers also missed the point. The Washington Post questioned Biden's foreign policy credentials — not because of his instrumental support for the catastrophic invasion of Iraq but because of his ""cold"" and ""harsh"" decision to pull out of Afghanistan. The Post worried that Biden's ""callousness … will make it hard to gain allies in the nation's next conflict"" (my own disbelieving italics). It quoted Rep. Michael Waltz a Florida Republican and U.S. Army veteran saying ""Who's going to trust us again?"" — as if the U.S. foreign policy record thus far had been a model of trustworthiness. It even devoted front-page attention to Sen. Lindsey Graham's fears that a Taliban victory might pose new terrorist threats to the United States. That same day the AP reported  Gen. Milley warned senators that the rise of the Taliban might indeed endanger the United States in unforeseen ways.

Neither the AP nor the Post noted that such new ""threats"" usually prompt new bonanzas for defense contractors and new catastrophes for the unlucky civilians who pay the ultimate price for campaigns launched in the names of ""security"" and ""freedom.""

The Wall Street Journal  the AP and others peppered their reportage with (doubtlessly factual) indictments of the Taliban's brutality and its history of violently subjugating women. But the antagonisms ended there. There was no mention of the fact that in 2019 U.S. and Afghan forces killed more civilians than the Taliban did. Or that U.S. and Afghan forces are under investigation by the International Criminal Court for war crimes including rape and torture. Or that a staggering number of deaths and injuries have been inflicted by U.S. drone operations and airstrikes throughout the region. Or that the National Security Agency had been spying on virtually every Afghan with a cell phone. Or that the U.S. decision to re-destabilize the country critically exacerbated the refugee catastrophe (with roughly 6 million Afghans displaced so far). Also swept under the carpet were the Afghanistan Papers  leaked documents that revealed U.S. officials had blatantly lied and fudged reports about the progress of their trillion-dollar project for years.

When it comes to foreign policy American lawmakers seem to be feminists and freedom fighters only when it's convenient. Otherwise human rights and democracy serve as buzzwords and stratagems too easily wielded by a military establishment that believes global problems require military solutions which in return require half of Congress' discretionary spending.

When it comes to the media establishment's selective criticisms of tragedies like Afghanistan and the broader role of the U.S. military — not to mention its often inglorious and sometimes depraved history — it ends up doing the bidding knowingly or otherwise of the world's most moneyed military-industrial complex.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lzdGVyZ3VhcmQuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcDAxMzc1MDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawrence Decker Winiarski Sr. Obituary - Eugene Register-Guard,"Lawrence Decker Winiarski Sr.

Larry cherished and reminisced about those in his and Flora's families.

Larry was born on July 10 1940 in Tegucigalpa Honduras to Walter and Alice Winiarski. Walter was a mining engineer and Alice was a school teacher. In 1941 they moved to Leavenworth WA. In 1947 they settled in Kellogg ID where Larry graduated High School. In 1962 he received a B.S in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Idaho. While working at General Dynamics in San Diego he met Flora Lester a mechanical engineer from North Carolina. They soon married. In 1964 Larry Flora and one child moved to Corvallis where they had two more children. In 1971 Larry earned his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University developing a formula to measure flow through a ""Pulse Jet"" an engine with no moving parts. Before and after he graduated he worked for the EPA. Larry and Flora both engineers purchased land in the coast range outside of Corvallis and Flora designed their home. Sadly in 1979 Flora died. Larry prayerfully found his vocation in dedicating his knowledge creativity and technical skills to help others.

Through the efforts of organizations and the like-minded Dr. Larry Winiarski became best known worldwide for the ""rocket stove"" concept a set of designs and principles for a stove to burn efficiently and safely. This appropriate technology decreased labor saved resources lessened costs and substantially reduced smoke implicated in health issues. Rocket stoves are adopted for and produced in businesses and millions of households. He taught combustion principles and stove construction in North / Central America Africa Haiti Tonga and Poland. Larry never sought riches but worked hard to disseminate rocket stove principles. He travelled and engineered for the poor. NGOs friends and colleagues--who do good work and many who have published articles--express being inspired by Larry's work and contributions to the world.

Larry was devoted to Nativity of the Mother of God Ukrainian Catholic Church in Springfield Oregon. He was a member of the Willamette Grange #52 and the Knights of Columbus. A widower Larry started folk dancing and enjoyed it even in later years. He created incinerators experimented with gasifiers; and met with persons who drive on wood. He was a Boy Scout leader and liked to ski bowhunt camp fish and snorkel in streams. He was the coach of the regional championship team of ""Olympics of the Mind"" in 1983. He very much liked to tinker meet people and teach his technical skills. He was proficient in Spanish.

While Häagen-Dazs ice cream is at the heart of the e-commerce and retail agreement the partnership also encompasses bread production and coffee along with warehouse logistics and joint environmental efforts to reduce the use of plastics according to a statement.

“After a half-year-long negotiation Häagen-Dazs will be the first brand under General Mills to join hands with Golden Field to exploit [the] B2B and B2C fields with the extensive influence of both parties in the food industry” the statement read.

It continued: “By taking advantage of both parties in branding product channel and supply chain the scope of this cooperation will reach all the sub-brands of Ting Hsin International Group.

“The bilateral in-depth collaboration will not only be conducted in specific areas but in offline retail as well. Häagen-Dazs will adopt a scenario-based retailing approach in restaurants and retail terminals and focus on offline experience such as cinemas and Häagen-Dazs’ stores to increase market share and create a closed-loop retailing model.”

Meanwhile James Chiu the president and managing director of General Mills in China said: “China’s market is the future growth engine for General Mills. We are honoured to reach a strategic cooperation [agreement] with the companies belonging to Ting Hsin International Group which we believe will open a window for us to explore the future lifestyle and consumption scenarios and is also a prudent attempt for Häagen-Dazs as an international brand to expand its channel in the Chinese market.”

Zhengzhang Lv the chairman and general manager of Golden Field added: “We are glad to join hands with General Mills and we will make full use of resources of Ting Hsin International Group to explore diversified cooperation models and new projects.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zYWxlcy1vZi10aGUtZXZlci1wcmVzZW50LWdyYW5vbGEtYmFyLXBsdW5nZS1hcy1wYW5kZW1pYy1zbmFja2luZy10dXJucy1zYWx0eS82MDAwODk4NDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sales of 'grab-and-go' granola bars plunge as pandemic snacking turns salty,"For Nomi Snacks a Minneapolis granola bar maker 2020 was supposed to be the year of new products new investors and growth. Instead the pandemic delivered its death knell.

""We had store expansions new retailers and some new varieties for vegan or plant-based consumers all ready to launch"" said Will Handke Nomi's co-founder. ""Then in March 2020 things took a pretty significant turn. It was a dramatic point.""

Snacking increased among the bored and anxious as people worked and schooled from home but the motivations for noshing shifted and so did the snacks.

Snack bars — a favorite of lunchboxes commutes and on-the-go lifestyles — saw near-immediate declines.

U.S. retail sales plunged nearly 7% in 2020 after several years of moderate growth according to IRI a Chicago-based market research firm.

Despite a slow rebound over the past year the segment is still marked by uncertainty and transition. Specialty players like Nomi which makes refrigerated and gluten-free bars were unable to hang on.

""As a startup looking to show growth trajectory the timing couldn't have been worse"" Handke said.

Even packaged food giants like Golden Valley-based General Mills suffered a 2% sales decline in its snacks division amid an otherwise frothy year.

""Snack bars are energy on-the-go and people haven't been on-the-go so predictably the category as a whole has not fared well"" General Mills chief executive Jeff Harmening told the Star Tribune this summer.

It's not that people weren't and aren't snacking during these strange times. In fact data shows they are snacking more. But when where and what they are reaching for has shifted.

Salty snacks like chips and ready-to-eat popcorn surged as screen time increased a recent report by the NPD Group found.

Still the changes in consumer whims have not been uniform.

""Snacking more so than meals is highly vulnerable to lifestyle changes"" Melissa Abbott a vice president at the Hartman Group wrote in an email. ""Sudden changes in daily routines and general outlook on life can then have a strong effect on snacking habits.""

Some people flocked to products with purported health benefits like immunity-boosting or high-protein foods including some snack bars. Others particularly early in the pandemic malaise sought comfort in indulgent sweet treats.

The pandemic also favored large established food companies as many retailers and distributors reduced the number of products they sourced in favor of bulking up on their bestsellers.

Many small players like Nomi lost grab-and-go sales in skyways and convenience stores. Its New York City distributor which supplies snacks to thousands of bodegas and small storefronts throughout Manhattan cut one-third of its offerings — including Nomi's products.

""If you were a startup at that time there was pretty much no way you would survive in that [bodega] business"" Handke said. ""Pretty much the only ones they were carrying were the big brands like Chobani and Clif Bar that they could trust to sell.""

There was also a flight to value as the economy convulsed with uncertainty.

""It didn't matter if you had lost your job or not people were fearful"" Handke said. ""People went back to what they know. We were really a premium alternative.""

Larger companies with their diverse product portfolios and hefty balance sheets can typically absorb short-term setbacks better than startups. So when the rebound arrives they're ready for it.

Estimates for 2021 suggest a partial rebound in volume sales for snack bars.

""We started seeing some growth in bars and single-serve packs as people were grabbing for portion control later in pandemic lockdown"" said Darren Seifer a food analyst with NPD Group.

A year into the pandemic Harmening of General Mills said its Nature Valley business had improved significantly compared to the rest of the snack bar category.

Looking ahead NPD Group forecasts the snack bar category will actually grow 2 to 3% over the next two years said Seifer ""but of course that depends on the delta variant.""

Nomi and some other startups didn't have the cushion needed to survive the pandemic's economic whiplash.

After an initial two-week sales bump in March 2020 fueled by frenzied shoppers stocking their refrigerators and pantries the small company's sales plummeted. Nomi lost a third of its revenue from 2019 to 2020 dashing hopes of raising additional capital to support its growth and future plans.

Nomi's five founders are recalibrating their dreams. Four already have found new jobs — some at other local food companies.

As for Handke: ""I think I'm going to take a pass on the food industry for a while.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZjY2luY2lubmF0aS5jb20vbmV3cy9qb2huLWR1cmJpbi1jaGllZi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLW9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FC Cincinnati taps John Durbin for newly created Chief Commercial Officer role,"Jeff Berding co-CEO of FC Cincinnati announced John Durbin will join the team as Chief Commercial Officer effective August 22 2022. Durbin returns to his home state of Ohio from Pegula Sports and Entertainment in New York to help FCC achieve its vision of being a world-class multifaced sports and entertainment group.

Berding created the Chief Commercial Officer role for the enterprise to establish a solid organizational foundation on which the FC Cincinnati of today can scale. Durbin will oversee all aspects of the organization’s sales team and marketing strategies leading and managing staff for several departments including Ticket Sales and Service Partnerships Consumer Products Business Intelligence as well as Brand Marketing and Communications.

“We want to better serve our fans and create a better fan experience as we continue to build the FC Cincinnati enterprise. I am delighted an experienced talented strategist like John Durbin will relocate to Cincinnati to join our leadership team” said Jeff Berding co-CEO. “John’s successful branding and marketing campaigns for Pegula Sports and Entertainment resulted in increased fan engagement and revenue across their sports properties.”

John Durbin comes to FCC from Pegula Sports and Entertainment where he served as Senior Vice President of Marketing and Business Strategy. Over the last three years under that title he served in several roles with the Buffalo Bills Sabres Bandits and additional Pegula-owned properties. Most recently he oversaw Marketing Ticketing and Community Relations for the Buffalo Sabres in addition to leading long-term strategic planning projects. Prior to his role as Senior Vice President Durbin held other marketing leadership roles in the organization.

“FC Cincinnati has shown a dedication to delivering a top tier fan experience and a commitment to bettering the Cincinnati community. I’m thrilled to be joining the team at such a key time for the organization. There’s a strong foundation in place and I look forward to helping advance FCC into the next phase of its history” John Durbin said.

Durbin began his career as a media buyer and planner for Starcom Media in Chicago where he worked on such clients as the US Army Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Kellogg’s kids brands. He then moved into a creative role with the Publicis-owned Denuo; a consulting agency that specialized in emerging trends of marketing.

His work on Mercedes-Benz was shortlisted for four Cannes Lions in 2011.

Prior to moving to Buffalo Durbin obtained his MBA from the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon and holds a bachelor’s degree in Communications from Boston College.

Additionally he has served on the Steering Committee for the National Sports Forum beginning with the 2017 event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ldy13aW5lLXNob3Atb3duZXItYnJpbmdzLWVjbGVjdGljLXRvdWNoLXRvLXRpbnktZHVuY2Fucy1taWxscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New wine shop owner brings eclectic touch to tiny Duncans Mills,"We don’t know who the big spenders are this cadre of America’s wealthiest who gather each year at the Bohemian Grove for a sometimes-controversial men’s-only summer encampment but now we know something of their taste.

Alice Hunter the new owner of Sophie’s Cellars in Duncans Mills hand selected 23 cases of wine for the Bohemian Grove delivering them July 2.

“It was a nice order” she said with a broad smile. “It was a smaller group this year but the men did gather in July.”

Hunter offers a glimpse into the closed-door Bohemian Grove annual gathering on a private 2700-acre property in Monte Rio along the Russian River where well-heeled power brokers converge most summers. Many flock in on their private planes and are whisked to the rustic campground by limousine to meet their cohorts. Replacing pinstripe for khakis they meet while sipping on some of Sonoma County’s finest boutique wines.

Hunter’s order included Rockfish Pinot Noir Cazadero Winery Chardonnay and Sassoferrato Rosé of Grenache. While she declined to disclose the amount of the sale she laughed and said it didn’t eclipse the $20000 order previous Sophie’s Cellars owners John Haggard and David Defries once took from a Grove member.

“I heard about that $20000 afternoon” Hunter said about that record transaction. “What a blessing for them. If that were to happen to me that would be wonderful. John and David had a good relationship with the Bohemian Grove and I’m excited to continue that relationship.”

“Outrageously prosperous” is how Defries once described the Bohemian Grove traffic and its impact on sales with $400 to $600 bottles often snapped up. A Grove member he said could buy in one day what they had sold in a month.

“People ask me ‘Do you have that relationship with the Bohemian Grove?’” Hunter said. “‘That’s how John and David made it.’”

While Hunter said she expects to prosper from Bohemian Grove sales she said she has a broader mission for the wine shop. She purchased Sophie’s Cellars in March because she wants to make it a gathering spot for wine-lovers. While a nearby sign on Highway 116 reveals Duncans Mills’ population is 85 people Hunter said the wine shop is perfectly positioned for those on their way to the coast.

“Traffic has been good and sales have been good” Hunter said. “I probably see 75 to 100 people in a week. It was a healthy business even through COVID. … I like to think that people are rediscovering Duncans Mills which is just seven minutes from Jenner.”

Imbued with both charisma and calm Hunter is an ebullient yet relaxed host. On this day she’s clad in bluejeans a gray sweatshirt and sandals.

With a different approach than the previous owners Hunter said she wants to tap into the social aspect of wine. She’s creating a wine club with a holiday party in the works. She also envisions bringing in winemakers and poetry readings and having live music on Sundays.

“I don’t want it to become a tasting room” she said. “My idea is to introduce new wines but not necessarily the intricacies of the winemaking process.”

A hold over from the previous owners is Locals Night on Fridays from 5 - 7 p.m. Hunter said.

“I carried on that tradition but you don’t necessarily have to be local” she said. “I don’t check ZIP codes.”

Hunter has wines from about a dozen producers on her shelves with bottlings that range in price from $25 to $80. Current labels include Starfish Rockfish Balletto Colagrossi Cazadero and Lotus. She plans to expand to about 20 labels with the goal of rotating in a new producer every week.

While her focus is local wines Hunter plans to pepper in limited selections from other regions like Washington State and Oregon.

In the past the shop had white walls and granite counters but Hunter has opted for a more colorful approach. One wall is painted turquoise and the shop is filled with eclectic furniture with a punch of color. It seems like a general store of sorts with an assortment of items made by local producers such as jams candles hats and soaps.

Behind the counter is a lamp with a ceramic base in the form of a woman in a lace gown.

“This is my Sophie” Hunter said. The original Sophie the shop’s namesake was Defries’ spaniel.

The whimsy continues outside the shop on a patio filled with more funky furniture under multicolored umbrellas where visitors can hear the trickle of traffic on Highway 116 while looking out into an adjacent cow pasture.

Jason Pace was taking in that view recently. The resident of the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco drove up with a friend to stay at an Airbnb in nearby Cazadero.

“The wine is delicious and I like all the eclectic space — all the different chairs on the patio” Pace said while drinking a Love Wins Sparkling Wine and nibbling on a selection of cheeses. “Even the cows in the pasture are fun.”

Hunter offers a range of upscale cheeses from Spring Hill Jersey Cheese including Mike’s Firehouse Jack Smoked Yellow Cheddar Asiago and a Cheddar Style Goat Cheese.

After working for more than a decade at Sebastopol’s Marimar Estate Hunter evaluated what she loved most about being a manager first for the tasting room and then for direct-to-consumer sales. She realized it was interacting with wine club members and capitalizing on retail sales.

“When I turned 50 in December I had a moment when I asked myself ‘What am I going to do?’” she said. “I didn’t want to spend the next 10 years in meetings and in front of the computer. … My focus here is more on celebrating family and friends meeting new friends and having them come back.”

General Motors has already spent $800 million on recalls of the Chevrolet Bolt EV due to defective battery cells that caused fires but the price has gone up once again. On Friday the automaker announced it would funnel an additional $1 billion into additional voluntary recalls of the electric sedan “out of an abundance of caution.”

The Bolt EV was issued its third recall in a year on Friday following one in late July and another from November 2020 as defective battery cells were causing some builds of the vehicle to catch fire. GM and its battery supplier LG Energy Solutions stated that “the simultaneous presence of two rare manufacturing defects in the same battery cell” could cause a fire if the battery pack is charged fully.

GM advised customers to do the following:

. Customers should whether or not they received the current software update return their vehicle to the 90% state of charge limitation using Hilltop Reserve mode (for 2017-2018 model years) or Target Charge Level (for 2019 model year) mode. If customers are unable to successfully make these changes or do not feel comfortable making these changes we are asking them to visit their dealer to have these adjustments completed. Additionally we ask that customers charge their vehicle after each use and avoid depleting their battery below approximately 70 miles of remaining range where possible. Out of an abundance of caution customers should continue to park their vehicles outside immediately after charging and not leave their vehicles charging overnight.

GM’s Q2 2021 Earnings Call stated that it had spent $1.3 billion in recalls in Q2 with $800 million of that going toward battery bugs in the Bolt. As a precaution GM is now applying additional models to the recall:

“General Motors is voluntarily expanding the current Chevrolet Bolt EV recall to cover the remaining 2019 and all 2020-2022 model year vehicles including the Bolt EUV. In rare circumstances the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects – a torn anode tab and folded separator – present in the same battery cell which increases the risk of fire. Out of an abundance of caution GM will replace defective battery modules in Chevrolet Bolt EVs and EUVs with new modules with an expected additional cost of approximately $1 billion.”

The new recall population includes the following:

9335 (6989 in the U.S. and 1212 in Canada) – 2019 model year Bolt EVs that were not included in the previous recall

63683 (52403 in the U.S. and 9019 in Canada) – 2020–2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs and EUVs

The batteries will be replaced and come with an 8-year/100000-mile limited warranty (or 8-year/160000 km limited warranty in Canada).

With the additional $1 billion going toward Bolt recalls GM has spent $1.8 billion on the battery replacement offensive for the vehicle. It’s a good precaution but it sure is getting costly for the legacy car company. GM also provided new instructions for customers in the new recall population:

1. Set their vehicle to a 90 percent state of charge limitation using Target Charge Level mode. Instructions on how to do this are available on chevy.com/boltevrecall. If customers are unable to successfully make these changes or do not feel comfortable making these changes GM is asking them to visit their dealer to have these adjustments completed.

2. Charge their vehicle more frequently and avoid depleting their battery below approximately 70 miles (113 kilometers) of remaining range where possible.

3. Park their vehicles outside immediately after charging and should not leave their vehicles charging indoors overnight.

A total of 6480 workers cast their ballot. There were 2623 votes in favour of the agreement 3214 against and 39 spoiled ballots. As a result the current collective agreement will be scrapped.

Workers will not lose any of their rights and their benefits and working conditions will remain the same until new representatives are elected.

""The union should now get to sign a new collective employment agreement”

explained Héctor de la Cueva general coordinator for Mexico’s centre for employment and labour relations research (CILAS) at a press conference.

The victory is unprecedented for the workers at the GM plant which employs close to 7000 people. The workers had reported serious irregularities in the voting process during the initial ballot in April this year and lodged the first-ever complaint under the rapid response mechanism provided for in the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA).

To ensure a free safe and transparent voting process free from harassment and intimidation the Mexican and US governments agreed to repeat the vote in the presence of independent observers from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Mexico's National Electoral Institute (INE) alongside federal work inspectors from the country's labour ministry.

Many of Mexico's democratically run unions – including the federation of independent unions in the automobile automotive parts aerospace and tyre industries (FESIIAAAN) the “Generando Movimiento” union the new central union of workers (NCT) and the Los Mineros union – set up camp outside the plant to show their support for the GM workers during the voting process.

At the international level IndustriALL Global Union affiliates in the United States and Canada as well as the regional network of GM workers followed this key vote closely and were very happy with the outcome.

IndustriALL Global Union's general secretary Valter Sanches says:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JvYmVydGJyeWNlLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvZ21zLTE4LWJpbGxpb24tY2hldnktYm9sdC1yZWNhbGwtc2hvd3Mtd2h5LWF1dG9tYWtlcnMtZXYtcm9sbG91dHMtY291bGQtYmUtb24tZmlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's $1.8 Billion Chevy Bolt Recall Shows Why Automakers' EV Rollouts Could Be 'On Fire',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2021/08/22/gms-18-billion-chevy-bolt-recall-shows-why-automakers-ev-rollouts-could-be-on-fire/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JvYmVydGJyeWNlLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvZ21zLTE4LWJpbGxpb24tY2hldnktYm9sdC1yZWNhbGwtc2hvd3Mtd2h5LWF1dG9tYWtlcnMtZXYtcm9sbG91dHMtY291bGQtYmUtb24tZmlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In response the fintech community can help by delivering innovations that can help mitigate the levels of waste wreaking havoc on our planet- and to help meet the climate targets set out by the Paris Agreement. One of the most significant developments is a move to digital payments. Günther Vogelpoel CEO of fintech Recharge.com explains.

Plastic payments pollution

Since the 1950s humans have created over 8 billion tons of plastic with under 10% of it ending up recycled. As the world increasingly migrates online with digital transformation trends only accelerating due to the COVID-19 pandemic more companies are investigating how to use digital means to reduce their carbon footprint.

Every year about six billion plastic cards are pushed out into the environment with most of them made by unrecyclable PVC plastic. Although Mastercard analysis shows that this is less than 0.015 per cent of the volume of plastic manufactured each year it is a cost that is becoming increasingly unnecessary as digital options become more available.

The inefficiency of physical plastic cards is only more apparent when taking into account that it costs approximately 7 dollars to issue one plastic card and about 5.7 million tonnes end up in landfills every single year. Once there it takes not years but decades for them to break down into microplastics.

Credit card microplastics

These microplastics are tiny plastic particles that end up being ingested by humans and could cause a range of health problems such as reproductive harm obesity organ problems and developmental delays in children.

While only 34% of Generation X and 23 per cent of Baby Boomers were reportedly willing to pay more for sustainable goods Generation Z (those born since 1997) have a completely different mindset. This collective mindset is spearheading the quest for a greener planet.

62% of Generation Z prefer to buy from sustainable brands which are in line with similar findings for Millennials (those born in the 1980s). As Generation Z enters the workforce and millennials continue to rise through business ranks these new generations are beginning to influence the way companies manage their overall environmental impact.

More digital-first than their predecessors these younger generations can see that people increasingly use their mobile phones to travel learn shop and share. Mobile devices are increasingly an indispensable fixture of modern life. In fact the number of smartphone subscriptions around the world is currently over six billion and is set to grow by several hundred million in the next few years.

Disruptive digital payments

Digital trends like these disrupt industries like the branded payments sector a billion-dollar global industry. The digital disruption is driven by the rise of e-wallets and alternative payment the growing need for digital cross-border transactions all whilst traditional players are still predominantly offline.

Whether bought directly by consumers or sent from a friend or family member - branded payments are the financial infrastructure that can cater to the daily needs of billions of people around the world who remain un- or underbanked without access to traditional financial means. Branded payments form the economic infrastructure for their daily needs whether they use mobile call credit or prepaid payment cards.

Branded payments can also ensure budget control and privacy allowing people to recharge their smartphone gaming entertainment or prepaid money credit. It is becoming easier than ever to recharge from anywhere at any time using a range of payment methods.

There are 1.6 billion plastic gifts printed in the US alone each year requiring 900 tons of plastic to create them. This equates to 33260 tons of CO2 being released into the atmosphere.

As the plastic pollution continues to haunt us card manufacturers worldwide are competing to design new cards that are more ecologically friendly. However the overarching aim should be to eliminate first-use plastic which becomes easier when digital options are presented as the default preferred option.

The tech sector is booming in the metro Atlanta region. The city of Alpharetta with nearly 700 technology companies within city limits is the reigning epicenter of innovation for the North Fulton area today.

Karen Cashion

Alpharetta’s evolution from a small farming town in the 1980s to a thriving tech hub was no accident. More than two decades ago hundreds of miles of fiber optic cables were intentionally laid throughout Alpharetta and Georgia Power created a series of redundant power networks in the city. This infrastructure combined with the largest suburban office market in the metro Atlanta area has since attracted a wealth of Fortune 1000 companies to Alpharetta. Enterprise tech companies such as ADP LexisNexis Risk Solutions Fiserv UPS Supply Chain Solutions Global Payments and Equifax are just a few of the city’s top employers.

The city’s large concentration of tech companies includes nearly 200 IT services companies more than 50 healthcare IT and medtech companies 45 fintech companies and more than 100 software companies. The city’s nearly two dozen data centers and virtual hosting companies in turn serve technology and other businesses both locally and throughout North Fulton and the Metro Atlanta region. (Statistical data courtesy of growalpharetta.com).

One of the drivers behind the city’s economic growth is its vast talent pool with 65% of Alpharetta’s residents holding a bachelor’s degree or higher – more than double the national average. According to the city Alpharetta’s daytime population of more than 122000 equates to 4632 workers per square mile besting some of the largest markets in the country including Denver Houston Charlotte Nashville Austin and even Atlanta.

But the tech industry in Alpharetta is linked by more than just the city-wide fiber optic network and its diverse workforce. In partnership with the Alpharetta city government Tech Alpharetta has helped to connect Alpharetta’s tech companies and create a flourishing local tech ecosystem while simultaneously working to grow more tech innovation companies and jobs for the region.

Tech Alpharetta hosts educational and thought leadership programs for area technology executives and professionals throughout the year. These programs (more than 40 were held in 2020) serve the North Fulton community while helping to connect the community’s tech companies. The organization also engages local executives from many of these companies on its Strategic Board of Directors which helps to guide Tech Alpharetta’s growth and to provide infrastructure recommendations to the city. Since its establishment in 2012 the board’s recommendations have led to the launch of Tech Alpharetta’s Innovation Center the creation of the city’s economic development website and other notable accomplishments.

Tech Alpharetta’s Innovation Center serves as an incubator in downtown Alpharetta and its 17 graduates have created nearly 600 new jobs. (Photo courtesy of Tech Alpharetta)

Tech Alpharetta’s Innovation Center is an extremely successful tech startup incubator in downtown Alpharetta. The incubator’s 17 graduates have created nearly 600 new jobs in the City of Alpharetta and roughly 1000 overall for the state of Georgia. To foster growth for its startups Tech Alpharetta provides programming and resources and connects them to area enterprises to help spur collaboration and potential partnerships beneficial to both parties.

Tech Alpharetta’s engagement of local tech companies and their executives helps to make Alpharetta and indeed all of North Fulton ever more attractive to existing and prospective tech companies and to the skilled tech employees sought by those businesses while its incubator and programs attract and foster new companies and innovation. Successfully connecting our ever-evolving tech community is a responsibility that we take very seriously and one that will be key to driving the continued growth of this dynamic tech ecosystem.

For Paysafe this latest acquisition not only boosts its growth opportunities in Germany a critical market for its international merchants it also creates revenue-generating opportunities to cross-sell viafintech’s alternative banking and payments solutions to its merchants around the world.

Paysafe’s core purpose is to enable businesses and consumers to connect and transact seamlessly through industry-leading capabilities in payment processing digital wallets eCash and open banking solutions. It offers over 70 payment types in over 40 currencies around the world.

viafintech was founded in 2011 and integrates with digital banking apps to offer an innovative “mobile ATM” concept which enables consumers to make deposits or withdraw cash from their digital bank accounts at a nearby retail store using a barcode; something that is becoming increasingly popular in the region as bricks and mortar bank branches close and fast-growing challenger banks and digital wallets disrupt the market. viafintech solutions are also used widely for bill payments and credit payouts as well as for online shopping in general supporting millions of consumers in the region who don’t have bank accounts or who simply prefer the heightened security of using eCash to pay online.

Headquartered in Germany where it has a market leading position it also has a presence in an additional five European countries with plans to expand further. It operates via a network of 20000 points of sale with over 20 well-known retail partners and also has deep relationships in the banking bill payments and eCommerce industries.

The combination of viafintech’s established banking framework and market leadership in Germany and elsewhere in Europe together with Paysafe’s diverse payments portfolio and international merchant base is expected to create compelling growth opportunities for each organisation both within Europe and beyond.

As part of the deal the viafintech team including viafintech’s managing directors Sebastian Seifert Achim Bönsch and Andreas Veller will become part of Paysafe’s expanding eCash and open banking solutions’ team which is headed up by Paysafe eCash CEO Udo Müller.

This latest acquisition builds on Paysafe’s recent Latin American acquisition agreements with PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay and allows Paysafe to solidify its position as a global market leader for eCash and open banking solutions where multiple payments players are competing to gain a stronger foothold in the emerging open banking ecosystem and the provision of alternative payment methods (APMs). On completion of the three acquisitions the Paysafe eCash business will be able to offer eCash and open banking solutions in over 60 countries with over one million distribution points.

Following the sale of their shares to Paysafe viafintech’s majority shareholder - Glory Ltd. a global leader in cash technology solutions - will enter into a new strategic partnership with Paysafe. The two companies have signed a referral agreement that enables Glory to offer paysafecard one of Paysafe’s leading eCash solutions as a form of payment within its in-store payments kiosks and in turn for Paysafe to offer Glory’s cash technology solutions to its merchants around the world.

Meanwhile GRENKE BANK AG which has been providing viafintech’s German bank license and proven regulatory framework since 2017 as well as being a shareholder of the company will continue to provide the same banking service going forward.

Udo Müller CEO Paysafe eCash and Open Banking commented:

“We are very excited to welcome a star player like viafintech into the Paysafe family. We believe the team are perfectly positioned to take advantage of the shift away from the legacy banking system in Germany and beyond as more and more challenger banks enter the market and consumers opt to use mobile-based solutions for banking and payments. By combining viafintech’s leading solutions with our existing eCash and APM portfolio we are well positioned as an essential payments partner to challenger banks around the world as consumer banking habits continue to evolve.”

Sebastian Seifert Co-founder and Managing Director of viafintech added:

“We are delighted to become part of the Paysafe Group and believe this move will enable us to build on our business achievements to date and accelerate our future growth as Europe’s number one non-banking cash-in / cash-out infrastructure further fuelling the shift away from legacy banking and driving more financial inclusion in general.”

The transaction is expected to close over the coming months subject to customary closing conditions and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Until that time the two organisations will continue to operate independently.

New Delhi: As the craze for cryptocurrencies is increasing across the globe investors looking for superior returns are swiftly lapping up lesser-known digital tokens which carry higher risk.Despite the market volatility in April-May some altcoins have delivered eye-popping returns to investors rallying as much as 50000 per cent in the last one year.Sharan Nair Chief Business Officer of CoinSwitch Kuber says investors are aiming to extract huge benefits from these cryptocurrencies just like it happened with bitcoin in the initial days.

Mike Brooks

This past week in North Texas the biggest bang for your musical buck could be found Saturday night at Arlington’s Globe Life Field: Chris Stapleton’s All-American Roadshow. Before a scarcely masked audience of 40000 a quartet of A-list country artists doled out roughly five hours’ worth of sonic riches. (Certainly those filing into Globe Life Field got more for their money than the folks filling up AT&T Stadium next door where the Dallas Cowboys stumbled through yet another preseason loss this one to the Houston Texans.)Saturday’s extravaganza was a bargain delayed in its delivery: Stapleton had initially scheduled his stop for November 2020 but the pandemic had other plans.“How many of you bought this ticket two years ago?” Stapleton asked the room early in his set to raucous cheers. “Well here we are finally.”Stapleton’s set a breezy 90-minute showcase was a muscular reminder of how far he’s come in a pretty brief period of time. His last trip through town in June 2018 was next door at AT&T Stadium — to that point the list of artists who have performed at both Arlington sports monstrosities has to be extremely short.Just six years ago he was packing out Dallas bar City Tavern ahead of the Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony at AT&T Stadium. Now Stapleton can stand center stage as an enormous tin can of a room sings his lyrics back at him full force.If the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter was at all thrown by the scale which included gigantic video screens flanking the stage tucked deep into centerfield it didn’t manifest itself in the music. (That said it was clear the impact a full stadium had as he paused a few times to “take this in” including snapping a photo: “I’m gonna take a picture of ya” he said lifting his digital camera up. “I’m gonna remember this moment.”)With his wife Morgane Stapleton providing her otherworldly vocal accompaniment — the pair’s acoustic rendition of “Maggie’s Song” from his latest record was gorgeous and wrenching — and Mickey Raphael joining throughout on harmonica Stapleton and his bandmates plowed through bluesy folky soulful tracks.Highlights included the set opening “Whiskey and You” and the scorching one-two punch of “Arkansas” and “Midnight Train to Memphis” — that are often classified as country on account of Stapleton’s pungent Kentucky accent than anything else.It's mildly strange to think of such intimate raw-nerved songs as being stadium fodder yet Stapleton pulled it off making the cavernous room seem cozier than its steel-clad surfaces felt. From first act to last the sound system fought a mostly losing battle with the myriad hard surfaces inside Globe Life Field introducing a vicious echo and loss of vocal and instrumental nuance inherent in every stadium concert experience.There was no questioning the country bona fides of the evening’s penultimate act. Willie Nelson arguably the only name on the bill whose reputation befits such a massive space walked on stage to a standing ovation.The 88-year-old Texas icon settled onto a stool strummed the opening chords of “Whiskey River” on his well-worn guitar named Trigger and the scent of marijuana seemed to arrive instantaneously. It felt as much as anything can in these upside-down times both unifying and liberating.Apart from the stool which Nelson perched upon throughout the hour-long set there weren’t any other apparent concessions to aging unless you count the number of songs on which his son Lukas Nelson took lead vocals. Seated alongside him Lukas kept a watchful eye on his father all night leaning in to harmonize or take the band through covers (Stevie Ray Vaughan’s “Texas Flood” Kris Kristofferson’s “Why Me”).Nelson making his first local appearance in over two years and visibly coughing at several points roused to life in spots; “Roll Me Up and Smoke When I Die” followed by “Still Not Dead” was a highlight as was the unbearably poignant sight of father and son trading verses on Pearl Jam’s “Just Breathe” — but often seemed to be at something of a low ebb.Regardless it remains a joy to bask in Nelson's presence and be reminded of the extraordinary durability of his classics (“On the Road Again” “You Were Always on My Mind” and “Still is Still Moving to Me” were aired out Saturday). He’ll be back in our neck of the woods in November playing the considerably smaller Billy Bob’s Texas.Jamey Johnson’s 35-minute set was as direct and satisfying as his flinty deeply felt songs. The singer-songwriter easily filled the enormous space with cuts like “Keeping Up with the Jonesin’” “Between Jennings and Jones” and his smash hit “In Color” which he turned into an extended sing-along with the crowd.Johnson backed by an octet of musicians that included a trio of horn players capped his time on stage with an appropriately rowdy tribute to the recently deceased Tom T. Hall tearing through “Faster Horses (The Cowboy and the Poet)” with palpable enthusiasm.British singer-songwriter Yola whose last visit to North Texas in February 2020 found her at the Kessler Theater worked through most of her just-released sophomore album during her dynamic 30-minute performance. (If you were stuck in traffic and missed out Yola will be back in March headlining Deep Ellum’s The Studio at the Factory.)Confidently stepping up to the challenge of filling such a huge room with her vivid blend of folk country soul and pop (the punchy take on her single “Diamond Studded Shoes” nearly lifted the roof off) Yola firmly set the tone for what was to come. Call it an early confirmation of this night being both money and time well spent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2ZpbmRpbmctam95LWluLWJhc2ViYWxsLWNvdWxkLWJlLWtleS10by1uaWNrLXNvbGFrLWxvY2tpbmctZG93bi1sb25nLXRlcm0tcm9sZS13aXRoLXJhbmdlcnMv0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yYW5nZXJzLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvZmluZGluZy1qb3ktaW4tYmFzZWJhbGwtY291bGQtYmUta2V5LXRvLW5pY2stc29sYWstbG9ja2luZy1kb3duLWxvbmctdGVybS1yb2xlLXdpdGgtcmFuZ2Vycy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding joy in baseball could be key to Nick Solak locking down long-term role with Rangers,"BOSTON — The Rangers on Friday recalled employee Nick Solak which reminded the baseball lover in Nick Solak of something: It was the second anniversary of his first major league callup.

It brought him great joy.

The aim for Solak now is to blend the great joy he gets from the game with the work he puts in. At times season as Solak aimed to lock down a long-term role with the Rangers the work became the obsession and the joy was absent.

“I’m happy excited and ready to play” he said as he stepped back on to the field then surveyed Fenway Park for the first time as a major leaguer. “To be here in this spot — in Fenway Park — is pretty special. I’m in the big leagues. I’m happy to be here.”

And then he rattled off one of those baseball love stories of which he has a million. One time he’s talking about the autographed photo of White Sox outfielder Scott Podsednik he had in his room as a kid. This time he’s reminiscing about his first trip to Fenway as a college student at Louisville in 2014 to see the Yankees’ Derek Jeter on his farewell tour.

When he talks about the place the game holds for him it’s clear there is a passion. But what happened over the last 12 months is that the passion may have led to anxiety over performance and that led to declining results and ultimately a month-long demotion to Triple-A Round Rock. He crushed Triple-A pitching. There is nothing for him to work on to hit minor league pitching.

That didn’t mean there weren’t any projects though. Namely there was this: He simply can’t let big league pressure eat him up.

“I think it’s always going to be something I work on” Solak said before going 2 for 5 and driving in the Rangers’ first run in a 10-1 win Saturday. “I love playing. I want to play well. But I want to have as much fun as I can being at the park.”

Solak said that multiple conversations with Rangers personnel over the last three months led him to shift his focus a bit from stressing over the opportunity to embracing the experience. Who exactly told him this?

“Pretty much everybody” he said. “That’s been a consistent. I love so many things about being here and being at the park. That’s what I’m trying to get back to.”

Also it couldn’t hurt if he could get back to squaring up fastballs. When he came up in 2019 he hit .391 against fastballs in his six-week audition to put himself in the picture for 2020. That dropped to .265 in last year’s tumultuous 60-game season.

This year he got off to a hot start against the fastball after a rough spring but the pitch mix to him changed at the end of April coincidentally enough when Boston came to town. Over the next 10 weeks he hit just .183 against the pitch. His exit velocity dropped from 93 mph to 85 mph on fastballs. He was late and making softer contact.

The Rangers reasoned he was trying to see balls longer thus getting his swing started late which led to overcompensations and diminished his ability to drive the ball. They gave chances to Andy Ibáñez and Yonny Hernandez who combined to hit .207 with a .266 OBP at second base while Solak was gone. The Rangers went 7-18 in those games. The plan was to bring Solak back no later than Sept. 1. But when Charlie Culberson came up with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 the Rangers accelerated Solak’s return.

On Saturday he returned with a smile. Yes he popped up and grounded out against fastballs. But he also caught up to one and banged it off the Green Monster for a double one of those moments of pure joy in a game too often about failure.

It’s one of those moments Nick Solak hopes he can more properly enjoy now.

If he can there might be a lot more of them too.

Briefly: RHP Kohei Arihara out since May with an aneurysm in his shoulder pitched two scoreless innings in a rehab outing for Double-A Frisco on Sunday on 28 pitches. He is expected to make one more start for Frisco before being returned to the active roster on Sept. 1.

As the head of private equity firm The Abraaj Group Naqvi was a pioneer in the field of impact investing which sought to make money for investors while doing good for the world. He spent the week rubbing shoulders with some of the world’s richest and most powerful people including Bill Gates Bill Clinton and then-Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

But as he sought to impress the world’s movers and shakers one of his employees was about to bring it all down write Simon Clark and Will Louch in their new book “The Key Man: The True Story of How The Global Elite was Duped by a Capitalist Fairy Tale” (Harper Business) out now.

It turned out Naqvi had allegedly taken around $780 million from his funds $385 million of which remains unaccounted for. He is facing a potential 291 years in jail. And all because “while Arif was in New York the employee broke ranks and sent an anonymous email to investors … [warning] about years of wrongdoing at Abraaj.” It was a bombshell that led to the “largest collapse of a private equity firm in history.”

But how did one man spin a story that allowed him to con some of the world’s smartest investors?

Naqvi was born in 1960 in Karachi Pakistan where he went to the city’s highly selective grammar school. He later attended the London School of Economics.

In 2003 he established Abraaj after raising $118 million much of it from “Middle Eastern governments royals and traders” and announced his intention to invest in ways that would help conquer global poverty.

In April 2010 he was invited by President Barack Obama along with 250 other Muslim business leaders to a Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship. There Naqvi gave a speech about the importance of impact investing and how a billion children would need training and jobs in the coming decades.

“It can only happen” Naqvi told the gathering “through entrepreneurship.”

Two months later the US government invested $150 million in Abraaj.

Naqvi did put his money where his mouth was — to a point.

After taking control of his local electric company Karachi Electric in 2008 Naqvi made the electricity more reliable and the company profitable. But he also reduced the workforce by 6000 employees leading to riots.

Meanwhile he distracted the West with massive charitable grants.

“Arif gave millions of dollars to universities around the world including Johns Hopkins University in the United States and the London School of Economics which named a professorship after Abraaj” the authors write. “Following in the footsteps of billionaire philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates Arif started a $100 million charitable organization called the Aman Foundation to improve health care and education in Pakistan.”

But Naqvi also enjoyed the high life flying around on “a private Gulfstream jet with a personalized tail number — M-ABRJ — and sailed on yachts to meet new investors who could help increase his fortune.”

By 2007 Naqvi had moved into “a palatial new mansion in Dubai’s luxurious gated Emirates Hills district … known as the Beverly Hills of Dubai.”

He was a regular at Davos and similar conferences where he became friendly with the likes of Gates who was the guest of honor at a dinner at Naqvi’s home in 2012.

“Bill and Arif had much to discuss” the authors write. “They agreed that their charitable foundations would work together on a family planning program in Pakistan. Arif seemed to be precisely who Bill was looking for. He was wealthy and concerned for the poor.”

Naqvi was granted a $100 million investment from the Gates Foundation to supposedly invest in hospitals and clinics in emerging markets. This investment in the new Abraaj Growth Markets Health Fund helped Naqvi attract $900 million more from other investors.

“This is a significant co-investment partnership” Gates said about the deal. “It is also an example of the kind of smart partnerships that hold huge promise for the future.”

In reality Naqvi had already started misusing the money with a “secretive treasury department” that not even most of his employees knew about the authors write.

“Abraaj was really made up of a tangled web of more than three hundred companies based mostly in tax havens around the world.”

It was required by regulators to keep millions of dollars in a bank account for emergencies but the account was usually close to empty the authors write.

“Just before the end of each quarter when Abraaj Capital had to report to the regulator Arif and his colleagues moved money into the account to make it seem like it contained the required amount. A few days [later] they emptied the account again.”

“They are manipulated beyond anything you have seen in a fund and easy to discover. Don’t believe what the partners send you.” anonymous email that blew the lid off Naqvi’s scheme

Abraaj’s employees also frequently raided one fund to pay dividends on others in “a crude kind of fraud known as a Ponzi scheme” the authors write.

On Jan. 9 2014 — around the time Naqvi served alongside Richard Branson as the headline attractions at an Oxford forum on social entrepreneurship — a manager in his finance department wrote to him that “we will have a deficit of $100 million by January 15th.”

Naqvi “had to choose between telling investors and lenders the truth and pretending everything was going according to plan. He chose the path of deception” the authors write.

In 2015 Naqvi “paid himself $53.75 million” and also “kept $154 million of the proceeds of [a] share sale to spend as he saw fit and deprived his investors of their gain” the authors write.

Not long after a fund manager at the Gates Foundation Andrew Farnum started to get suspicious. Despite The Abraaj Group showing no movement on previous investments the organization was still asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional investment from Gates.

In September 2017 Farnum wrote an email asking for the location of Gates’ current funds and how they were invested as well as a schedule of upcoming investments.

“Andrew’s tone was polite but the implications of his questions were ominous” the authors write. “He was asking Abraaj to prove it wasn’t misusing the money of one of the world’s richest men.”

While Abraaj sent vague assurances and old bank statements Farnum pressed on for more details.

One week later the anonymous Abraaj employee sent the incriminating email to the fund’s investors revealing the organization’s shady dealings.

“Do your due diligence properly and ask the right questions. You will be amazed at what you discover” the email read.

“The areas you should focus in are like unrealized gains valuations — they are manipulated beyond anything you have seen in a fund and easy to discover. Don’t believe what the partners send you … Don’t believe what they tell you and check the fact. Protect yourself.”

Immediately the walls caved in.

6 Gates Foundation exec Andrew Farnum pressed Naqvi to prove a return on their $100M investment. LinkedIn

“The investors no longer trusted Abraaj and wanted their money back. The trouble was Abraaj didn’t have it” the authors write.

The Gates Foundation hired a forensic accounting team to investigate Abraaj’s books. Throughout all this Naqvi was still meeting with potential investors trying to raise $6 billion for a new fund.

Around this time Naqvi appeared in a televised debate on global health care at Davos with Gates.

“Bill shifted uncomfortably in his seat and pursed his lips” the authors write. “Whenever Arif attempted to make eye contact or engage him in conversation Bill looked the other way.”

In October 2018 the authors published an article exposing Abraaj’s alleged misdeeds in the Wall Street Journal.

“At least $660 million of investors’ money was moved without their knowledge into Abraaj’s hidden bank accounts” the authors reported. “Then more than $200 million had flowed from these accounts to Arif and people close to him.”

Finally US prosecutors accused Naqvi of running a criminal organization. On April 10 2019 he was arrested at London’s Heathrow Airport and his extradition has been ordered so he can stand trial in New York for fraud.

Despite the paper trail Naqvi has “maintained his innocence” as he remains under house arrest in London while awaiting a decision on his appeal. His company’s name has been removed from the professorship at the LSE.

In the meantime his shocking story serves as a cautionary tale to wealthy — but gullible — investors seeking to fix world poverty.

Poor people the authors write would have “benefited more if Arif had carried his millions to the top of a tall building in Karachi and thrown them into the sky letting the wind scatter dollar bills across the city.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW1hZy5jby51ay8yMDIxLzA4L21vcmFsLWNhcGl0YWxpc20tZG9lc250LWV4aXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moral Capitalism Doesn't Exist,"Oscar Wilde famously said that a cynic ‘knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.’ Mark Carney’s book Value(s): Building a Better World for All repurposes this aphorism to describe how society operates today. He argues that markets are largely incapable of valuing—and hence protecting for future generations—the civic and natural systems on which we depend: health care education trees aquifers tillable land etc. Carney comes with Harvard and Oxford credentials and a long tenure in the money business behind him having spent thirteen years at Goldman Sachs and well over a decade in the world of central banking. As such he offers an insider’s view of what ails modern capitalism. Whatever merits his diagnosis may have his prescription won’t do ordinary people any good. The publication of Value(s) came with praise from Britain’s former chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and—inevitably—U2’s Bono. According to the Observer’s Will Hutton Carney’s principled rejection of ‘free-market capitalism’ constitutes a ‘landmark achievement’ that will ‘help arm the best in business finance and government and disarm the worst.’ This is a book by a thought leader written for the benefit of his fellow thought leaders. The casual reader might learn a few things but overall there is precious little insight into how we can overhaul a ‘market society’ to promote the flourishing of the many over the enrichment of the few.

Long Road to Neoliberalism Born in the Northwest Territories Carney grew up in Edmonton Alberta. In one of his book’s rare but telling personal asides Carney describes himself while on a speaking tour to schools in deprived areas of northern England as a man from the ‘far North of Canada’. This self-portrait is presumably crafted for the purpose of seeming ‘relatable’ but it falls flat on that score. Carney rose to global fame as the governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2012 before becoming governor of the Bank of England a post he held until February 2020. He is currently the UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance and has been touted as a potential successor to Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Few central bankers current or former get the same kind of press as Carney. His tenure at his first major post coincided with the Great Recession that had a devastating impact on much of the world but only put an inconvenient dent in the Canadian economy. In Britain he endeavoured to steer monetary policy during the lead-up to the Brexit referendum of 2016 and its aftermath — a much more turbulent voyage. The heft of Value(s) comes largely from parts one and two which provide a history of theories of value and money as well as an overview of the crises unfolding from 2008 to the present. Carney as a historian is clear and concise. His writing of recent history also benefits from his front-row seat to the panicked machinations of the financial system. Carney is keen to explore objective theories of value which hold that goods and services derive their value from how they are produced. Proponents of these theories have included Adam Smith and Karl Marx both of whom argued that labour was the ultimate measure of value. Carney contrasts such objective theories of value with subjective theories whereby value ‘is in the eye of the beholder.’ Exchange value Carney explains determines underlying value. Value in this analysis is determined exclusively by the market. This is the logic that has emerged triumphant in our neoliberal era. ‘It is as if the price of everything is becoming the value of everything’ Carney writes haphazardly touching upon the original eloquence of Wilde. As Carney points out the company Jeff Bezos founded Amazon is worth $1.5 trillion—probably more since Carney sent his book to press—while the Amazon rainforest has no measurable value despite acting as a carbon sink for the planet and hence constituting one of the vital lifelines in preventing catastrophic climate change.

A Moral Critique of Capitalism Carney is not a free-market fundamentalist. Central bankers are most tested when financial markets are sputtering or outright crashing. They are Carney explains ‘lenders of last resort to banks in order to prevent temporary liquidity shortages from turning into solvency crises.’ He understands all too well that unregulated financial markets will periodically implode and cause human misery as a result. He is very proud one senses to have acted as a public servant when intervening in overheated markets and stopping crises from becoming catastrophes — that is for financial markets themselves. Pulling back from the day-to-day demands of central banking Carney’s concerns are now even broader: There is a growing sense that this basic social contract is breaking down. That unease is backed up by hard data. Within societies virtually without exception inequality of outcomes both within and across generations has demonstrably increased. Carney wants our economies to be redesigned according to values of ‘fairness solidarity resilience responsibility sustainability humility and dynamism.’ He quotes Rabbi Jonathan Sacks who asks ‘How can we learn to be moral again?’ This is the moment at which some readers might throw up their hands. When was the capitalist economy ever moral in the first place? Carney cites the detailed research of Thomas Piketty on the relatively low levels of taxation in the nineteenth century which meant that governments provided little more than ‘nightwatchman’ functions to their citizens (police court systems armies general administration and not much else). Curiously despite his focus on inequality elsewhere in the book Carney entirely sidesteps Piketty’s more famous analysis of twentieth-century capitalism which led him to formulate the famous equation r > g — when the rate of return on capital r is greater than the growth of the economy g inequality in society increases. Piketty has argued that economic growth outpaced the rate of return on capital during capitalism’s post-WWII golden era thereby delivering rising prosperity to millions. Governments flush with money were able to provide social goods to all classes. Huge numbers of people enjoyed better life prospects as a result. In France for example as Piketty has shown ‘between 1950 and 1983 incomes were rising steadily by almost 4 percent per annum for the immense majority of the population. On the contrary it was the highest incomes which had to settle for a growth of barely 1 percent per annum’ (italics added). Similar trends were at work across all western countries — in the UK Canada United States and so on. Carney is not prepared to face the reality of our current predicament as evidenced by the vast growth in returns to the rich compared with the postwar era. How could Bezos Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg and their fellow billionaires be convinced to become less rapacious and share more with everyone else? Why would the top 1 percent settle for 1 percent annual growth in returns on capital investment? And if they won’t settle for less why would their bankers? Carney writes in a moral register but capitalism is not swayed by moral arguments. In a world fast reaching planetary limits to growth bemoaning the lack of fairness in a system designed to lavish its spoils on elites seems deliberately obtuse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS1hbmQtZWNvbm9taWNzLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvanVzdC1ob3ctbWlnaHR5LWFyZS1hY3RpdmUtcmV0YWlsLXRyYWRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just how mighty are active retail traders?,"J UST TWO years ago the future of investing seemed to involve fewer and fewer people. Retail investors were piling into “passive” index funds which track a broad basket of stocks for a tiny fee. Active fund managers whether swaggering hedge-fund gurus or staid mutual-fund bosses were in retreat as index and quantitative funds swelled. More automation seemed inevitable. A future in which human investors vanished altogether replaced by slick powerful machines swapping shares at near-lightspeed seemed just around the corner.

That is not quite how things have turned out. A mass of active retail traders have been romping around the American stockmarket for more than a year. They piled into short-dated derivative bets on Tesla an electric-vehicle maker and bid up shares in Hertz a car-rental firm after it went bankrupt. Early this year came their pièce de résistance: a frantic rally in the shares of GameStop a video-game retailer which rose by 2000% in a little over two weeks. So volatile was the share price and so large the flows that the stock-settlement system nearly broke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS05OTE0NDY3L1RvcC1kZWFsbWFrZXItaGlyZWQtR2VvcmdlLU9zYm9ybmUtZmFsbHMtcml2YWxzLmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtOTkxNDQ2Ny9hbXAvVG9wLWRlYWxtYWtlci1oaXJlZC1HZW9yZ2UtT3Nib3JuZS1mYWxscy1yaXZhbHMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top dealmaker that hired George Osborne falls behind rivals,"All go: At one stage George Osborne was reported to have nine jobs all at the same time

He's the former Chancellor who gave up editorship of the Evening Standard and a string of high-profile jobs to make his fortune in the City. But George Osborne's new career as an investment banker appears to have got off to an extremely slow start. Robey Warshaw the high-profile firm he joined in April has so far missed out entirely on the summer takeover boom in the City according to analysis by The Mail on Sunday and data firm Refinitiv.

Research shows the prestigious boutique adviser hasn't worked on a single publicly announced deal since Osborne officially started work there. Robey Warshaw's last publicly announced deals were in March when it advised National Grid on its £14.2billion purchase of electricity giant Western Power Distribution and £3.9billion sale of Rhode Island-based The Narragansett Electric Company.

Since then private equity companies have swooped on dozens of companies – most recently supermarket chain Morrisons and British defence group Ultra Electronics.

That has left Robey Warshaw tenth in the Refinitiv merger and acquisition league table for topearning corporate finance advisory firms in deals involving British companies this year. In previous years it has appeared higher alongside US giants Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. This year has been one of the busiest for UK takeovers since the credit boom of 2007. Morrisons is in a £7billion tussle between a private equity consortium led by ex-Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy and a group of investors backed by SoftBank an investment group led by maverick Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son.

Meanwhile FTSE 250-listed defence group Meggitt is the focus of a £7billion dogfight between two US engineering giants: Parker Hannifin Corporation and TransDigm.

And FTSE 100-listed cybersecurity firm Avast recently agreed to be bought by US business NortonLifeLock for £6.2billion.

Goldman Sachs is top of the table. The US bank – whose London-based dealmaking department is led by financier Anthony Gutman and Mark Sorrell son of WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell – has advised on 65 deals worth £89billion.

JPMorgan is second and Bank of America third in the Refinitiv rankings. The top British advisory firms are NM Rothschild in fourth and Barclays in sixth.

A source close to Robey Warshaw pointed out that most of this summer's deals have been for 'mid-sized companies' and are being led by private equity investors adding: 'That's not what Robey Warshaw really does – it mainly works for extremely large publicly-listed corporations. It's still very early days [for George Osborne]. Big deals can take years to put together.' Osborne is understood to be on leave after the birth of his month-old son Beau.

Professor Scott Moeller a former Deutsche Bank investment banker and now head of the M&A Research Centre at The Business School at London University added: 'There has been a tendency this year for buyers to tighten their relationships with the banks financing the deals. This is not something that boutiques [such as Robey Warshaw] can provide as they don't have the balance sheets to [finance] deals.'

Osborne joined Robey Warshaw to great fanfare after editing the Evening Standard and working one day a week at fund management firm BlackRock for £650000 a year.

At one stage in 2018 he reportedly had nine jobs including chairing the Northern Powerhouse Partnership think tank and advising Exor the owner of Juventus the Italian football club.

Osborne was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016.

Robey Warshaw was set up in 2013 by Sir Simon Robey a former Morgan Stanley banker and former chairman of the Royal Opera House and Simon Warshaw a former UBS banker.

The firm has worked on some of the largest takeover deals of the past decade. It advised SAB Miller on its £75billion takeover by brewing titan Anheuser-Busch InBev and resources firm BG Group on its £47billion sale to Shell.

Robey Warshaw also advised Comcast on its £30billion takeover of Sky three years ago and the London Stock Exchange's £20billion takeover of data group Refinitiv.

Last year the three main partners – Robey Warshaw and Philip Apostolides – shared a reported £17million in remuneration. Since 2013 the trio have shared more than £200million in remuneration.

Senior City bankers said Osborne was brought in to use his network of contacts to lure foreign firms interested in buying British businesses. He could yet be in line for similar rewards if he's successful. Robey Warshaw declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzbWludG1lZGlhLmNvbS90aGUtZXZvbHV0aW9uLW9mLXNwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLXNwb25zb3JzaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The evolution of sports betting sponsorship,"In the past few years there have been a lot of new trends and innovations coming up in the sports industry. Through the advancement of technology the industry has started coming up with new ways to involve fans with the sport to improve their viewing experience.

One of the most talked-about trends in recent times is the introduction and advancement of sports betting sponsorships. Earlier viewers sports organizations and even the government used to consider sports betting as taboo and were against its usage.

But now things have changed people and organizations from all around the world have started accepting sports betting to some extent. Many of the leagues and teams have started considering sports betting as one of their important revenue verticals or sources.

Teams and leagues have started partnering with various betting platforms and have granted them the rights and titles of official betting partners/sponsors.

Most betting operators are now well-regulated corporate citizens that operate only within jurisdictions in which they are licensed pay taxes in those jurisdictions and support responsible gaming. In many cases there is a natural synergy between these legitimate operators and the sports they support with sponsorship revenue being a key contributor to the ongoing success of some sports.

However sports betting systems have their flaws in a report published by the Sorbonne University and International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS) in 2014 it was estimated that criminal groups were laundering US$140 billion a year by match-fixing and illegal betting with 53% of illegal bets coming from Asia.

Though the relationship between betting operators and sports teams athletes and events has grown stronger in the last few decades it has further led the governments and organizations to bring in strict laws to regulate the sports betting operators.

The industry can witness an increasing number of betting partnerships taking place across various sports all around the world. Its scope is now not only just limited to football the industry has seen betting partnerships expand it to other medieval sports such as lacrosse boxing etc as well.

There are sponsorship deals that allow the betting company to associate its brand with the sports teams often including pitch-side advertising or presence on official websites.

Those betting and gaming operators might be the title sponsor of the event itself advertising during the commercial breaks of the program you’re watching or sponsoring the so-called ‘bumpers’ leading into those commercial breaks. They might also be taking ‘inventory-share’ on the advertising hoardings at the game on screen or having their logo on the shirt of the team playing in the game you’ve perhaps tuned in for.

These betting and gaming companies go to lengths to reach their target audience. Through all the advertisements and marketing strategies the betting operators can expand their marketplace and in return helps increase the fan engagement experience.

This leads us to the question that ‘Then what is in it there for the teams or leagues?’ Well it is the money that these betting operators bring into the revenue streams of the teams and leagues. These sponsorship deals run into billions of dollars when counting in Europe and the US sponsorship deals.

Sports teams have to pay technical staff and player salaries and also has to spend money attracting new players. Access to good training equipment and resources also requires a lot of money.

Sponsorships deals have been very useful for sports teams following the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. Without gate ticket revenues many sports teams immediately fell into hardships. Sponsorship deals with these betting operators have kept most of the teams operational and prevented their total collapse. In some countries betting companies are keeping the entire sports leagues running.

In many cases the teams or leagues also have different betting partners for different regions of the world.

Talking about the industry players in the sports betting circuit we can see some companies like DraftKings Betway Bet365 BetMGM dominate the segment. Many of these companies have signed exclusive multi-year agreements with the league or teams which have provided them with the exclusive rights to be their official betting partners for the coming years.

These betting operators are even changing the landscape in the sports media industry. Traditional sports media companies for their part are trying to play the sports betting game as well. Networks like ESPN Fox and CBS have formed advertising partnerships with sportsbooks launched their sports betting studio shows and experimented with alternate gambling-driven game broadcasts.

The sports betting industry is expanding a lot new players have started coming in which will see the betting industry boom in a couple of years. Goldman Sachs even predicts that the sports betting market will be worth almost $40 billion by 2033. But all in all it would be important to see how these betting operators can grow ethically without disturbing the authenticity of these various sports competitions held across the world."

By John Lyons

You will see based on the above map issued by the National Hurricane Center as of 8 p.m. on Saturday Aug. 21 that the forecast track has moved just a few miles east. This forecast gives us two fairly significant changes.

It keeps us on the west side of the storm which will hopefully reduce the amount of wind damage and also the amount of blackouts.

It shows the righthand turn happening comfortably to our north which would also be good news for West Hartford and surrounding communities.

I want to address both of those but a key messaging point I want to get across is don’t necessarily trust the storm. It’s clearly giving the computer modeling systems mixed signals so things can and will change.

Again don’t trust the storm.

To my first point when talking about a hurricane it’s easiest to talk about it in terms of a clock or compass. The section between 12 and 3 o’clock (northeast of the center) is the worst section to be in. The section between 6 o’clock and 9 o’clock (southwest) is more favorable. Overall the western side of the storm is less severe than the eastern side.

If the most current forecast track holds the bulk of our exposure to it will be in that favorable southwestern position relative to the center.

We are still at very high risk for tremendous rain – and we need to be fully prepared for that.

The second point about the storm slowing and making that eastern pivot we’ve been talking about further north is also potentially favorable for us.

The area south of the eye or center of the storm is typically much less severe than all other points relative to the center. If the turn does happen in New Hampshire it will shorten the duration for West Hartford significantly. And we will be in the southernmost quadrant of the storm. We could even see breaks of sun if the turn happens far enough north.

There is also some good news. While traveling on the Mass Pike and I-84 today I personally saw hundreds of utility trucks heading in our direction. Clearly the power companies are taking the storm very seriously. Other residents who were driving their children to college reported seeing utility trucks in Michigan and Pennsylvania headed in the direction of Connecticut.

Latest take on timing:

Overnight Saturday clouds will continue to thicken and lower and rain will start a few hours before dawn.

From about mid morning Sunday on we will be in the worst of it with winds and heavy rain. Hopefully if this forecast holds Sunday night things will start to quiet down and by Monday morning we actually see some breaks in the clouds. Certainly I hope that we see only some light showers and strong breezes.

Things to worry about: another shift to the west and/or that pivot happens further south. That would increase the severity of the storm during the brunt of it and increase the duration.

Cross fingers!

As of 5 p.m. Sunday the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Henri was located 20 miles SE of Hartford CT and about 100 miles NE of New York City moving WNW at 7 mph. A decrease in forward speed is expected with the storm possibly stalling near the Connecticut-New York border Sunday night then moving across northern Connecticut or southern Massachusetts by Monday afternoon.

The storm left over 100000 without power after making landfall on the coast of Rhode Island near Westerly with 60 mph sustained winds closing bridges swamped roads and left many people stranded in their vehicles due to heavy rains.

There were no arrests or scuffles at either incident nor at a Fairfield meeting where police were called. That’s unlike what’s happened at several similar disputes in other states were individuals or small groups have disrupted meetings to protest mask mandates.

Police in Joliet Illinois arrested an unmasked man Monday when he repeatedly refused to leave a school board meeting where masks are required.

Earlier this year 11 anti-mask protestors were arrested after screaming obscenities and disrupting the school board in suburban Salt Lake City and others have been charged after deliberating refusing to wear masks at Rhode Island and New Hampshire meetings.

CNN this week aired video of anti-mask protestors without masks screeching at Louisiana’s state school board ultimately that board simply ended its meeting. The Mount Vernon Washington school board took its meeting online after an unmasked protestor persistently refused to follow rules.

In Bristol a few dozen people arrived without masks when the school board convened at Bristol Central High School and refused repeated requests to put them on The Bristol Press reported. Several said they were there to speak against the mandate that all students wear masks when classes resume.

Police were called and officers told the crowd that masks were necessary inside the school.

“Our officers told the crowd that the board would stop the meeting if they didn’t put on masks. We’re always looking for compliance and not to escalate” Police Chief Brian Gould said. “But the crowd refused to mask up.”

Superintendent Karen Carbone told police she wanted no arrests and did not want anyone physically ejected from the building so officers stood by as several board members walked away from their chairs and ultimately decided to suspend the meeting.

Gould said police will be available at the board’s next meeting and are prepared — if Carbone wants — to remove people who don’t comply with rules.

Carbone would not answer questions Friday but said in an emailed statement “There was no indication that our families and community members would not follow the statewide mandate that all individuals wear masks in school buildings regardless of their vaccination status.

“We have held regular board meetings as well as committee meetings throughout the pandemic without any issues. I have the utmost confidence that our Bristol community will continue to demonstrate civility and kindness towards one another in these unprecedented challenging times” she wrote.

The Wednesday night incident triggered social media complaints from local Democratic leaders who blamed the Bristol Republican Town Committee for promoting an “UnMask Our Kids” rally at a local bar and pizza lounge two nights earlier. The local GOP denied it orchestrated what happened and wrote “We do not instruct people when it’s okay to make public comment and when it is not. We do not demean them when we disagree.”

The Region 17 school board earlier this month abandoned its meeting after nearby protestors with bullhorns made enough noise to disrupt conversation. State troopers were called but the board decided to leave the building.

Fairfield Patch reported that police were called Tuesday night when a small group disrupted a Fairfield school board committee discussing mask policy. The meeting went on however."

But life nature and pandemics had other plans. For Hasbro the delay was tougher to work with. Having developed the Eternals figures for Marvel Legends over the course of the previous year they had them ready to go. But unlike the Black Widow toys they would not see early release to promote a movie nobody could see for another a year. However fully finished samples from the factories in Asia leaked and have shown up online over the past few months. Superhero Hype and other similar sites do not publish unauthorized photos but now that Yahoo finally gave the figures a formal unveiling we can too.

Initial Marvel Legends figures for the line will include a full movie wave of seven figures plus two standalone extra figures (probably store-exclusive) and one oversized creature. The basic wave will feature Ikaris (Richard Madden) Sersi (Gemma Chan) Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) Druig (Barry Keoghan) Sprite (Lia McHugh) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) as the build-a-figure. Ikaris will not include a Gilgamesh part but will get an extra swap-out laser-eyes head. Angelina Jolie’s Thena and Salma Hayek’s Ajak sell separately and the Deviant General Kro is the big figure. Unlike with many Marvel Legends waves there will be no obscure comics characters filling out the lineup. This is what happens when the principal cast features ten heroes.

Early leaked images suggest shiny metallic finishes on all the characters’ armor; a nice otherworldly touch. For more official images check out the gallery below. Yahoo suggests that they will remain at last year’s price point of $19.99 rather than the recently hiked $22.99. If true that provides essential relief to fans who have to have them all. Expect them to arrive in stores and online starting Oct 1.

Will you collect the Eternals figures? Let us know in comments!

The sweetest place on Earth celebrated its 115th season with brand new offerings like The Chocolatier. But aside from chowing down at the new restaurant this year we tried out something that is new to us- the Hersheypark cabanas. I'm going to share with you why we are loving the cabanas at Hersheypark aka one of the best kept secrets at the park.

10 Reasons Why We Love The Cabanas at Hersheypark

The cabanas at Hersheypark might be one of the best kept secrets. Sure you know they are there but if you're like me you might not realize what you're missing out on. Trust me it goes way beyond a shady spot on a hot day.

Private Cabanas

Let's start out with the most obvious perk- a private cabana. When the park is at it's busiest or you're just wishing you could step out of the crowd and into a shady spot the cabanas are the place to be. They fit up to 7 people with plenty of seats for everyone. A ceiling fan is installed in each one giving you and your family a nice spot to cool off.

Free Hersheypark Tote Bag with Goodies

Your group will receive a Hersheypark tote bag complete with a Hersheypark towel for each guest as well as sunscreen. They are nice bags too perfect for holding all those souvenirs or wet bathing suits.

Free Lockers

You know I strongly recommend getting a locker when visiting Hersheypark. Included with your Cabana rental is a regular sized locker. The lockers are located near the private bathrooms and since it's for cabana guests only no need to fight your way through crowds to get to your stuff when you need it. Having the cabana space meant a regular size locker was fine since our larger items like our backpacks we could keep with us.

Private Bathrooms

I know your ears perked up when I said private bathrooms. Yes you read that right. There are lockers for cabana guests only and they are glorious. They include showers to rinse off chlorine and there is never a line ladies!

Special Waterpark Access

No need to walk all the way around to get to the Boardwalk or the Shore. Cabana guests have access to the waterpark via a special bridge. Walk right across and you are right by the Shore.

Private Lazy River Entrance & Exit

Have you ever had to wait in line for the lazy river on a hot day? Well as a cabana guest that's not even a thing. From the cabanas there is a private entrance and exit into the lazy river which means no waiting in line to cool off and no hunting for a tube. A Hersheypark employee is there waiting to hand you a tube that is your ticket to relaxation.

Order Food To Be Delivered

Hungry? When your cabana host or hostess comes by to check on you (which they do throughout the day) you have the option to order food from The Boardwalk Beach Club. Place your order with your host(ess) and it will be delivered to your cabana. They simply add the amount to your tab which you pay out once you checkout for the night. It's not just burgers and fries either salads appetizers and yes adult drinks are all on the menu.

Not feeling this menu? No worries. Go grab your park favorites and bring them back to eat.

Included Fridge

Condiments for that food you ordered can be found inside the included fridge. This was perfect for us because we could also keep the food from going bad while the kids popped in and out living their best lives. I like not wasting food don't you?

Free Water and Unlimited Soft Drinks

Also in that fridge are 12 bottles of water. Don't worry if you run out. You can either purchase more or get water from the private soda machine located in the cabana area. This soda machine is included with your rental which means if you love your soft drinks this will be your fave spot.

No Need To Rush Out

The cabanas at Hersheypark are open one hour after The Boardwalk closes. That means you have time to peel out of the wet bathing suits change and gather your things without feeling rushed to do so.

Tips for making the most of the cabanas at Hersheypark

All of that sounds lovely right? There are just a few more tips I have to help you make the most out of your cabana rentals at Hersheypark.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW5ubGl2ZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDgvbmV3LWxvb2stbWlsdG9uLWhlcnNoZXktcmV0dXJucy10by1mb290YmFsbC1maWVsZC13aXRoLXNhdHVyZGF5cy10cmktc2NyaW1tYWdlLXZzLWNhcmxpc2xlLXNoaXBwZW5zYnVyZy5odG1s0gGjAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC9uZXctbG9vay1taWx0b24taGVyc2hleS1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWZvb3RiYWxsLWZpZWxkLXdpdGgtc2F0dXJkYXlzLXRyaS1zY3JpbW1hZ2UtdnMtY2FybGlzbGUtc2hpcHBlbnNidXJnLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New-look Milton Hershey returns to football field with Saturday’s tri-scrimmage vs. Carlisle Shippensburg,"Every season represents a new beginning of sorts and that’s certainly true when it comes to Milton Hershey’s storied football program.

It is a great resource because of two main factors:

It allows you to narrow your search based on hotel brand

It shows your hotel options overlaid onto Google Maps so you get a great idea of where each hotel is located

And if I am so lucky as to find a lower rate offered by an Online Travel Agency I might be able to make a successful Best Rate Guarantee claim to save even more money.

I am NEVER actually booking via Google Hotels however. But once I have chosen a hotel I can go to my preferred cashback website and click through to the hotel chain’s website in order to book as normal.

What’s Going on with Hilton and Google Hotels?

As I was looking at hotels in London England for a possible trip in the fall something strange appeared. Hilton hotels appeared to be much cheaper than similar quality hotels…

When I looked at the detailed rates offered Hilton was clearly offering BY FAR the lowest room rates when compared to the major OTAs such as Expedia and Priceline.

Clicking through to the Hilton website I find this…

Instead of showing the best rates for an overnight stay – what nearly everybody is looking for – these Hilton hotels are showing their Workspaces rates (Day Use only).

This makes Google Hotels close to useless for searching for a Hilton hotel for an overnight stay!

Bottom Line

I hesitate to call this a SCAM when it might just be an IT glitch. (the same doesn’t happen when searching major US cities)

But if Hilton hotels are attempting to game the Google Hotels algorithms in order to appear cheaper than the competition that is certainly something to be aware of…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3Rvcmllcy5oaWx0b24uY29tL2Zvb2QtYmV2ZXJhZ2UvaGlsdG9uLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtbWlkYXV0dW1uLWZlc3RpdmFsLWluLXN0eWxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marrying Innovation and Tradition: Hilton Celebrates Mid‑Autumn Festival in Style,"Creative excellence and culinary craftsmanship displayed across Hilton’s hotels in South East Asia with a unique take from each country

Hotel operating giant Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is planning to open a Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel -- the group's highest standard of accommodation -- in Osaka by 2025 ahead of the world exposition in the city according to sources familiar with the matter.

Hilton will build Japan's first Waldorf Astoria hotel near JR Osaka Station in western Japan anticipating a recovery in travel demand among wealthy people in a post-coronavirus era the sources said. The chain is also planning to open a hotel of the same brand in Tokyo's Nihombashi district in 2026.

In addition to the Waldorf Astoria hotel Hilton is also considering launching its upscale Canopy hotel brand in an area formerly used for a freight station in Osaka. The hotels will be constructed together with offices and apartments they said.

Hilton has pointed out that Japan lacks high-end accommodation that caters to affluent visitors from elsewhere in Asia and demand for such hotels will continue.

""We had been considering the establishment of a luxury hotel brand in the Kansai area expecting demand to grow substantially"" said a source familiar with the matter.

Marianne Ayala/Insider



Retailers are voicing concerns that e-commerce has prompted a spike in professional shoplifters boosting high-value items to sell online.

Brick-and-mortar advocates are arguing that online sellers need to take more action to stop theft.

But critics say some anti-theft measures could hurt small online sellers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Among well-lit rows of drills lawn care equipment and power washers all still carefully packaged a small American flag hangs over a shelf of Milwaukee Tools a Home Depot-exclusive brand.

Without context it looks like it could have been any Home Depot warehouse. But this video footage viewed by Insider doesn't depict a fulfillment center or even the stock room of a Home Depot store. It captures a secret California warehouse stocked with goods stolen from the home improvement giant. It was shot by one of Home Depot's own organized retail crime investigators in 2020 as police served a search warrant on the storage facility. All in all the warehouse contained millions of dollars in stolen products.

That's just one snapshot of a crime wave that's been building for years. Back in 2011 the FBI posited that ""organized retail crime"" was a $30 billion industry. And industry operators say the problem has only grown since then. A 2020 survey from the National Retail Federation found that organized retail theft has seen a nearly 60% increase from 2015 now averaging $719548 for every $1 billion in sales.

Retailers are now sounding the alarm on spiking theft statistics and the role of e-commerce platforms as ""fences."" Traditionally fences have taken the form of pawn shops or flea markets but the rise of online shopping has turned this on its head. Brick-and-mortar retailers complaining that thieves are increasingly hawking pilfered products online but e-commerce platforms argue that regulating sites will just stifle competition.

Police seize items including some stolen from a Home Depot.

Retail companies have implemented a number of initiatives to combat these targeted thefts. Recently Home Depot released power tools that won't work unless they're properly scanned and activated at the register via Bluetooth technology. The retailer is also looking to continue to introduce technology to combat theft rather than locking up products. Stores have experimented with lockable cart wheels that freeze up if a person shoves a cartload of goods outside without paying. Others resort to controversial facial recognition tools often in addition to other security measures to assist in identifying thieves. Critics say that without regulation this technology could end up violating human rights.

Jason Brewer the spokesperson for the Buy Safe America Coalition a lobby group for the retail industry spoke with Insider about the efficient intricate shadow businesses of professional shoplifters.

""This is a professional criminal"" Brewer said. ""They're not looking to steal food for dinner or something they need because they can't afford it. They are stealing specific items that they know they can resell online.""

Brewer said that organized retail crime rings vary in terms of their size origin and specialty. He said that some could be connected to larger organized crime outfits. For those major players organized retail crime is yet another business in a portfolio that may also include narcotics sales human trafficking and gunrunning. Smaller rings could just be a group led by a figure that can convince desperate people – sometimes impoverished unhoused and drug-dependent persons – to steal in exchange for a small cut of money. Shoplifting ring ""CEOs"" will pass down a product list to low-level members who then must go out and steal those items in order to get paid.

""The leaders don't really care what happens to the runners"" Scott Glenn Home Depot's vice president of asset protection told Insider. ""They're just paying them a hundred bucks a day but the runners will bring back thousands of dollars worth of product that then gets resold for profit.""

But despite their ubiquity Glenn said it is important not to underestimate shoplifting groups. He said that they can be helmed by ""good administrators"" and function somewhat akin to shadow businesses. Glenn said that in some cases these professional shoplifters will steal ""right up to that felony threshold"" without ever crossing the line.

Most states have a felony theft threshold meaning that a person who steals money or property valued over a certain amount can be charged with felony rather than misdemeanor theft. The NRF notes that these syndicates often look for ""a mix of valuable high-end products and cheap but easier to fence everyday necessities.""

""They know that nothing's going to happen if it doesn't pass that certain level"" Glenn said. ""They'll steal up to that amount and they'll go to the next door and they'll steal up to that amount.""







'It really hits retailers from multiple directions'

Brewer and Glenn said the proliferation of e-commerce has also led to a boom in criminals fencing stolen goods online. Glenn said that not all online sales platforms ""have the same level of control and vetting"" when it comes to merchants while Brewer said that no online platform is currently doing enough to combat crime.

And all this means that retailers feel they are battling exponential growth in organized theft that everyday shoppers are likely not aware of. In the 2020 NRF survey 59% of respondents said they'd spotted stolen merchandise from their company being sold on websites – that's up 9% from 2018.

Brewer also said that online platforms need to do away with anonymity for sellers in order to combat organized retail crime. The Buy Safe Coalition is backing the INFORM Consumers Act a bill that would force online platforms to authenticate ""high-volume third-party sellers.""

""If the marketplaces have to start verifying the people selling on their platform and providing that information to the public it's going to be a lot harder for people to sell stolen goods"" Brewer said.

Online platforms have pushed back against the idea that they're allowing thieves to run rampant on their sites. eBay has touted its efforts to remove suspicious listings as well as its initiatives to protect copyright and trademark owners community members dealing with unsafe goods and third-party brands.

""eBay is fully committed to providing a safe and secure online shopping experience to millions of people globally and we have zero tolerance for criminal activity on our platform"" an eBay spokesperson told Insider. ""We believe collaboration and cooperation between law enforcement retailers and marketplaces is the best way to combat fraud and organized retail crime.""

An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that the company in 2020 invested $700 million and a workforce of 10000 to ""prevent fraud and abuse in our store.""

""Amazon does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods in our store and we work closely with law enforcement retailers and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable including withholding funds terminating accounts and making law enforcement referrals"" an Amazon spokesperson told Insider.

The Makers and Merchants Coalition a trade group that represents third-party online sellers has come out against the INFORM Act. It argues that there ""is no need to require private citizens to disclose their personal information to the public to sell a small number of products online.""

""The true mission of the INFORM Act is to eliminate big-box retail's competition by hurting small sellers"" spokesperson Katie Wright said in a statement sent to Insider. ""The Act does nothing to stop stolen goods at their main source brick and mortar retail stores but does threaten to compromise the safety and personal information of small online sellers who use larger marketplaces to sell their products.""

Wright said that online marketplaces already ""collect personal information from sellers as one of the many measures taken to prevent the sale of millions of stolen and counterfeit products every year.""

But Glenn and Brewer stressed the threat that organized retail crime posed. Both said that when desperate professional shoplifters could pose a physical threat to shoppers and retail employees. Glenn said if left unchecked mass theft could push higher prices onto consumers while Brewer said that smaller stores could shutter.

""Not only is the retailer having the merchandise stolen from them but then somebody is competing with them online by selling the same product for half the price because it's stolen"" he said. ""So it really hits retailers from multiple directions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZW50YWwtY2Fycy1wYW5kZW1pYy1lY29ub215LXNob3J0YWdlLWNvdmlkLTIwMjEwODIyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rental car prices skyrocket as the pandemic causes supply shortages,"Maureen Curry with her own car at her home in Downingtown. Curry and her family had difficulty securing a rental car for a recent trip. Read more

Maureen Curry wanted to rent a seven-passenger minivan or SUV in July for a trip to her son’s Marine Corps initiation at Quantico Va.

She’s a rental-car veteran: The 55-year-old Downingtown woman and her husband Rick had rented vehicles more than a half-dozen times a year over the last eight years as their two older children traveled off to colleges and set up apartments saving wear and tear on their own vehicles.

But this time Curry said none of the big rental companies had any vehicles available for the trip. And she had been shopping two months in advance.

“I’ve never ever had to make a reservation for a vehicle more than two days in advance” Curry said “and never had difficulty getting a vehicle before this occurrence.”

It’s no secret that getting a rental car has become tricky in some locations and very expensive in many others.

According to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index average daily car rental rates have almost doubled from $89 a day over Independence Day 2020 to $166 during that same time period in 2021. But some destinations are getting hit much harder with daily prices reportedly ranging from $250 to $600 or more at some airports across the country.

Sue Spinney vice president for ground transport with the Expedia Group said in an email that a comparison of searches for rental cars showed interest more than doubled jumping 115% from June 2019 to June 2021.

The rental-car shortage gained a national audience July 8 after singer-actor Audra McDonald known recently for her role as Liz Reddick in the legal drama The Good Fight posted her frustration on Twitter when she discovered Hertz had no cars in Atlanta tweeting: “lt’s the hunger games out here.”

Jessica Caldwell analyst for the automotive industry go-to site Edmunds explained the tsunami of bad events that befell the rental-car industry.

First came the pandemic and the country went into lockdown. Because so much of rental-car business involves vacationers and business travelers once those industries dried up rental car companies faced a cash-flow cliff.

Executives had to sell off unused vehicles in some cases as part of bankruptcy restructuring.

This business decision seemed wise at the time. Hertz which also owns Thrifty and Dollar brands reported that between April and June last year utilization of its U.S. cars was a dismal 28% versus 82% during the same period in 2019. The 2020 plummet came despite its rental fleet shrinking by almost 50000 cars compared with its 554794 vehicles the prior year. So obviously some of these cars had to go.

And so they did — from 516726 vehicles at the end of 2019 in the U.S. to 298183 at the end of 2020 according to Hertz a 40% reduction in a year. The company achieved utilization rates of about 75% by both the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 according to Hertz.

But Caldwell continued the trouble didn’t stop there. In 2021 the spread of vaccinations had Americans eager to get back on the road and demand for rental cars increased. At the same time consumer demand to purchase vehicles also skyrocketed in part because people were wary of mass transit in the pandemic. Car sales after wobbling in spring 2020 went through the roof by the end of the year — and stayed there.

And finally came the computer chip shortage. Cars couldn’t be finished for lack of computer chips and with a shortage automakers are not interested in fleet business.

“In terms of automakers wanting to sell cars their first priority is retail consumers or people like you and me and secondly is their fleet customers” Caldwell said. “I think rental cars are kind of at the bottom of that list; those are generally the lowest margin in terms of their profit.”

Caldwell shared the experience of a colleague at Edmunds who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Hawaii.

Talia James-Armand Edmunds’ associate director of public relations and communications said finding a three-row SUV for five nights in the Aloha State became an impossibility. Her party settled for a Dodge Grand Caravan but it came at a cost.

Five days with the car cost $2100 James-Armand said or $400 a day compared with about $90 when she’d taken a trip to the Big Island in 2018.

“Finding lodging was no issue but finding a rental car was kind of a nightmare” James-Armand said.

A new wrinkle that may change the rental car market yet again is the coronavirus delta variant and the new masking and travel advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jana Tidwell AAA MidAtlantic manager of public and government affairs said AAA always emphasizes that travelers follow the CDC guidance if they decide to get out of town.

“It feels as though we are having a very different conversation about travel today than we were having just two or three weeks ago” Tidwell said.

She expects demand to drop after Labor Day after a summer season when travel demand was down just 2% overall from 2019 according to AAA’s figures. Business travel has not rebounded in the way leisure travel has Tidwell added.

Keli Laverty of West Chester wanted to explore Glacier National Park in Montana for a week and needed an eight-passenger vehicle for a week-long trip in late August.

“It was really impossible to find a car” said Laverty 43. She particularly worried that she’d reserve the large vehicle her family needed only to be stuck with a sedan.

She learned of the online car-sharing marketplace Turo which is like Airbnb but for cars. There car owners offer up their private vehicles to people looking to rent. Laverty was able to find a Ford Expedition in time for the trip even canceling a minivan also reserved through Turo that would have ended up being a real squeeze.

Various reports found some travelers renting U-Hauls or Home Depot pickups. And even this has had a trickle-down effect.

Curry of Downingtown tells how her daughter Anna Curry 24 recently moved from Wissahickon to Manayunk. She rented a U-Haul as she’d done several times before. But this time the younger Curry hit a snag.

“She paid more and she had to travel farther to get the vehicle” Curry said.

And like traveling itself venturing into the unknown for a rental car — such as on Turo — can have its upside.

Laverty and her husband Nate also 43 had an unusual adventure while on their trip. The group spent an afternoon at a waterfall where people could dive.

Nate and a friend watched another park patron jump into the 50-degree water but not surface. They waited and finally decided to jump in for a rescue. They managed to save the man but in the confusion Nate Laverty forgot the key in his pocket to the Expedition the group had rented on Turo. When they returned to the vehicle the soggy fob wouldn’t start the car.

The owners told the Lavertys that they would travel to the park pick up the car with a spare key and get it to them after the vacationing group hiked an hour and a half for cell service and over the phone explained that they needed the car the next day.

Keli Laverty said that the help from the car owners was an unexpected perk of renting through Turo. “I think the personal communication and the kindness of strangers to help us out essentially make a bad experience better” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2hhbGxvd2Vlbi1zdWNjdWxlbnQtcGxhbnQtMzY5NjYyMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get Into the Halloween Spirit With This Cauldron Succulent,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/halloween-succulent-plant-36966225 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2hhbGxvd2Vlbi1zdWNjdWxlbnQtcGxhbnQtMzY5NjYyMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vcmV0YWlsL25ld3MvZHJpdmUtdGhydXMtYXJlLWdldHRpbmctbGFyZ2VyLWFuZC1sYXJnZXItd2l0aC1uby1lbmQtaW4tc2lnaHQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU1MzU3MzQuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5pbi9yZXRhaWwvbmV3cy9kcml2ZS10aHJ1cy1hcmUtZ2V0dGluZy1sYXJnZXItYW5kLWxhcmdlci13aXRoLW5vLWVuZC1pbi1zaWdodC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU1MzU3MzQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drive-thrus are getting larger and larger with no end in sight,"Taco Bell just announced plans for a four-lane drive-thru slated for summer 2022.

just announced plans for a four-lane drive-thru slated for summer 2022. Competing chains are already adding lanes to drive-thrus Taco Bell just upped the ante.

Drive-thrus became crucial to fast food during the pandemic and chains continue to invest in them.

Taco Bell just released plans for a four-lane drive-thru set to open next summer and it's making the inevitable clear: drive-thrus are just going to keep getting bigger.

The new drive-thru concept will be owned by one of the biggest Taco Bell franchisees in the country with three lanes dedicated to mobile orders alongside a fourth traditional lane. A contactless food delivery system that ""defies gravity"" will transport orders from the kitchen above down to cars through a lift system.

The concept immediately inspired memes and comparisons. So far it's been compared to an EZ Pass highway toll booth a bank and even the color scheme from the Ryan Gosling movie ""Drive."" The comparisons are funny and frankly the drive-thru does look like a bank but the concept itself is less ridiculous than it seems at first.

Looking back drive-thrus getting bigger seems inevitable. Back in 2019 fast food brands ramped up a kind of drive-thru arms race; McDonald's rolled out new technology to decrease wait times while traditionally drive-thru-less chains like Chipotle ramped up Chipotlanes. At the same time Starbucks and Dunkin' were each experimenting with drive-thru pickup for mobile orders.

The pandemic sped everything up. Suddenly drive-thrus weren't just a way to do business they were the primary way customers felt safe visiting restaurants amid closed dining rooms and health concerns. Typically drive-thrus account for 70% of sales at fast-food chains. But in 2020 chains like Wendy's and McDonald's said it was closer to 90%.

To accommodate growing drive-thru traffic they simply had to get. bigger. Chick-fil-A has been opening double-lane drive-thrus across the country. Starbucks has followed this example as part of its initiative to close lower-performing stores and focusing on mobile and drive-thru locations. The coffee chain has started installing double lanes too.

McDonald's which already has some double-lane drive-thrus also released a concept for on-the-go stores focused on takeout and delivery orders with extra lanes for customers who ordered through the app. Like the Taco Bell concept McDonald's suggested some orders would even be delivered by conveyor belts.

Shake Shack 's design for its first-ever drive-thrus planned to open sometime in 2022 skips the traditional single lane step altogether. Instead the burger chain is jumping right into the multi-lane designs that are growing more popular in the industry with three lanes to accommodate mobile and on-site orders.

""Why not test out something like this? They can learn an awful lot and maybe this is the way the market will trend in the long run"" Mark Kalinowski founder of Kalinowski Equity Research told Insider. ""It's a futuristic way of thinking and restaurants are getting more willing to be a little different.""

The COVID-19 pandemic and its variants are still ongoing but many places in the US have attempted to return to normal life. The reign of drive-thrus is nowhere near over though as McDonald's Starbucks and Taco Bell all emphasized how crucial they are to business in just the last few weeks.

Americans have rediscovered their love of drive-thrus and they're not going back."

Carol Miller and Alex Mooney have displaced Rep. David McKinley as the wealthiest members of West Virginia’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation according to their 2020 personal finance disclosures filed earlier this month.

All three are Republicans. Miller 3rd District is tops with an estimated net worth of $75.21 million. Mooney 2nd District is second at $14.7 million. McKinley 1st District is third at $10.4 million.

As we reported last week Sen. Joe Manchin’s estimated 2020 net worth was $8.6 million and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s was $2.53 million.

As we stated last week The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probable range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

Here’s a look at each member of Congress.

Carol Miller

Miller has an asset range of $15186062 to $340390006. Her liabilities range from $4365006 to $200800004.

Using the formula that puts her range of worth at -$185613942 to $336025000. From that her estimated net worth comes to $75205529.

Members of Congress are required to report their own and their spouse’s assets. The bulk of Miller’s assets come from her husband’s (Matt Miller) ownership of five Dutch Miller auto dealerships all valued at more than $1 million. In addition he has ownership interest through MFM Realty of the five dealership properties with four of those valued at more than $1 million and one valued at $100001-$250000.

Open Secrets notes the challenge of estimating spousal assets valued at more than $1 million because House reporting rules don’t require a maximum range. For those assets Open Secrets sets a cap of $50 million for its formula and we used the same figure.

Out of curiosity we also calculated an estimated net worth by setting that cap at $5 million. Even with that lower cap Miller still comes in at the wealthiest of West Virginia’s five with an estimated net worth of $30.2 million.

Miller and her husband also hold a variety of stock assets. They have pharmaceutical stock: Abbott AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb CVS Health Johnson & Johnson McKesson Merck Pfizer and Viatris.

Their tech holdings include Apple Microsoft Cisco and Oracle.

Examples of other holdings are: Altria (tobacco products) Coca-Cola Dominion Energy Energizer (batteries) Hormel Foods (Spam) McDonald’s Yum! (KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut) and Proctor & Gamble.

Stock portfolios are subject to frequent trades and updates logged on Periodic Transaction Reports; the companies cited here and for the others are on their annual filings.

Miller’s liabilities include two mortgages a farm loan two loans for the dealerships and a business floor plan loan.

As we reported last week Manchin ranked 67th most wealthy for both houses of Congress in 2018 (the last year for which Open Secrets evaluated and ranked all 535 members) and 19th in the Senate. Capito was 169th and 46th respectively.

Miller wasn’t in the U.S. House in 2018 but plugging her current estimated net worth into the 2018 list would put her at 11th overall and ninth in the House.

Alex Mooney

Virtually all of Mooney’s worth stems from one asset: his wife’s (Grace Mooney) TIAA retirement annuity valued at $5000001-$25000000.

Mooney himself holds nine Maryland Supplemental Retirement Plan 401K funds. All but one of those are valued at $1001-$15000. The ninth is valued at $1-$1000.

His combined asset range is $5009011-$25136000. He reports one liability a home mortgage valued at $250001-$500000.

Using the formula Mooney’s range of worth is $4509011-$24885999. That puts his estimated net worth at $14697505.

In 2018 his wife’s retirement annuity wasn’t factored in and his estimated net worth was just $137005 ranking him 287th in the House and 360th overall.

David McKinley

In 2018 McKinley’s estimated net worth was $6739056 placing him second after Manchin and above Capito Mooney and then-Rep. Evan Jenkins. Jenkins now state Supreme Court chief justice ranked fourth among the five with an estimated net worth of $920023.

For all of Congress in 2018 McKinley ranked 82nd overall for net worth and 59th in the House.

For 2020 McKinley reported assets of $5016118-$15796000. He reported no liabilities.

His estimated net worth came to $10406059.

He and his wife Mary hold a broad array of assets. Stock holdings include Abbott Laboratories Apple Costco Dollar Tree Home Depot Intuit MasterCard Microsoft Starbucks Sysco (food distributor) Tractor Supply and UnitedHealth.

Many of their assets are packaged into IRA accounts and a Black Rock-managed set of exchange-traded funds called iShares.

They own a rental property in Wheeling worth $1000001-$5000000 and co-own with other family members 90 acres of Preston County timber land valued at $15001-$50000.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

Others need more action and can’t imagine being on the water without doing something exciting like watersports or fishing. These are the folks who would be thrilled by this new pontoon boat that is designed for performance with advanced digital features and incredible horsepower.

HP

Manitou is a BRP brand so you can expect high quality from a company that specializes in adventure vehicles from ATVs to boats. The newly-launched 2022 Manitou lineup has something for everybody from the entry-level Aurora LE pontoon boat to the top-of-the-line luxurious Manitou XT The LX model is the sport version that’s ready for adrenaline-pumping fun out on a lake whether you’re in the mood for some water skiing or just feel like having a fishing contest with your buddies. When it comes to performance there are two things that make the Manitou LX stand out.First the hull is built with the V-toon technology based on a specific size and positioning of the center tube and lifting strakes. Basically what this is supposed to do is allow the pontoon to move faster handle corners with better agility and be capable of the same performance even at high speed or in challenging conditions. Second if you’re up for it this year’s LX can crank up to 900 thanks to the new dual engines.To make things even more fun  there’s an upgraded sound system. The JL head unit and LED speakers placed on the wakeboard tower help get everyone onboard in party mode. And speaking of the watersports tower it also comes with power controls and can be raised or lowered straight from the Garmin digital dashboard.The digital system not only allows you to control your boat through a remote key fob and your smartphone but it also makes navigating much easier due to the digital chartplotter (a device that combines GPS data with electronic charts).Pricing for the 2022 Manitou LX begins at $63940 with the option of upgrading to the limited package or the premium package for additional features like a storage compartment extra LED lights or color-matching fiberglass walls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYW9yYWNsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yMi90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkLWZhY2VzLXRoZS0xOTE0LWhwLXJpbWFjLW5ldmVyYS1lbGVjdHJpYy1oeXBlcmNhci1hdC10aGUtZHJhZ3N0cmlwLXNwZWNzLWNvbXBhcmlzb24tdmlkZW9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model S Plaid faces the 1914 hp Rimac Nevera electric hypercar at the dragstrip (specs comparison videos),"Rimac Automobili’s Nevera electric hypercar is currently on its world debut tour going from one country to the other since July. Rimac brought the Nevera first-production cars to the United States earlier this month to show off the car in different enthusiast events.

Utilizing the full potential of this opportunity the YouTube channel Drag Times took it to the dragstrip against none other than the silent ICE-slayer electric sedan the Tesla Model S Plaid. Now Plaid meets a worthy contender for the first time.

This is by far the world’s fastest drag race between any production cars either from the internal combustion engine (ICE) or EV universe. Model S Plaid held the crown for the quickest 0-60 mph production car with 1.99 seconds time before Rimac unveiled the Nevera electric hypercar with a 1.85 seconds 0-60.

But is Rimac Nevera a true production car? According to the Croatian automaker there will be only 150 units ever produced of this limited-edition two-seat electric hypercar. In contrast the Tesla Model S and its Plaid variant will be in production in an infinite number of units. Tesla Model S has been in production since 2012 and it’s here to stay in the foreseeable future.

That’s correct the limited-production Rimac Nevera costs $2.4 million USD — a price tag at which you can buy 18 Model S Plaid + a Tesla Model 3. The extra goodies and a better performance come at a hefty price tag most can’t afford.

Looking at the above specs comparison it is interesting to know that the Rimac Nevera with all its active aerodynamics has a drag coefficient of (Cd) is 0.3 — less than the Tesla Model S 5-seater family sedan’s significantly better 0.23 Cd. The Tesla design team should be proud of creating this ultra-aerodynamic design for a large luxury car.

The drag race battle

This first-ever drag race encounter between the Tesla Model S Plaid vs. Rimac Nevera took place at the Famoso Dragstrip in Bakersfield California. This is the same dragstrip where Jay Leno set the previous quarter-mile world record of 9.247 with the Model S Plaid.

This best of 3 race battle was won by the Rimac Nevera by 3-0 against the Model S Plaid. The result was pretty much imminent before the race looking at the performance specs (above).

Both cars were consistent in delivering performance at the dragstrip with the following results:

Attempt # Model S Plaid Rimac Nevera 1 9.272 s @152.68 mph 8.655 s @166.66 mph 2 9.312 s @151.34 mph 8.641 s @166.44 mph 3 9.294 s @151.75 mph 8.615 s @166.39 mph Drag Times / YouTube.

Perhaps the Rimac Nevera needs to face the Tesla Roadster with the 1.1 seconds 0-60 acceleration in the future.

A fun reversal of stereotypical American and German sports car roles

When it comes to acceleration power-to-weight ratios rule all

Admittedly a 2021 BMW M4 Competition facing a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach 1 in a heads-up drag race is a lopsided pairing. The Mustang which starts at $54595 including destination makes 480 horsepower from its 5.0-liter V8. The M4 Competition? 503 hp courtesy of its twin-turbo six-cylinder.

Even equipped with the quick-shifting 10-speed automatic transmission and wider stickier tires that come with its available Handling package the as-tested price for our 2021 Mustang Mach 1 test car is $65340.

That's roughly $10000 less than the M4 Competition's starting price of $75695. And this BMW M4 came outfitted with all the available performance goodies including carbon-ceramic brakes and bucket seats. The options bring its as-tested price to $101995.

Why drag race these two? Because they are two extremely fun-to-drive rear-wheel-drive coupes and we have an open slot on our impromptu drag strip. Wouldn't you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC90aGlzLTgwMC1ocC0yMDEzLWJtdy1tNS1mcm9tLWhhbWFubi1yZWFsbHktbWFrZXMtYS1zdGF0ZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 800 HP 2013 BMW M5 From Hamann Really Makes A Statement,"A 2013 BMW M5 outfitted with a very aggressive bodykit has just come across our desks after being listed up for sale through eBay.

Even though the M5 is one of the most potent super sedans out of the box the previous owner of this car thought it could do with some upgrades. As such it has been equipped with a bodykit from Hamann a German tuning company. This bodykit completely transforms the looks of the M5 although we’re not convinced it does so in a positive way.

Included with the kit is a revised front fascia and additional bodywork that tweaks the shape of the headlights. The M5 also features a distinctive hood while from the sides flared front and rear wheel arches really make it stand out. The alterations continue at the rear where there is a small spoiler above the rear window a decklid spoiler a distinctive bumper and a new diffuser.

The listing notes that the car also features forged wheels and blue brake calipers.

Interior modifications are just as comprehensive as those on the exterior thanks to bright blue leather that now adorns the seats door panels and center console. This M5 is also equipped with the optional 16-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system that includes a speaker that rises from the center of the dashboard.

The seller adds that the car’s 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine has been upgraded to 800 hp but fails to mention what modifications were made."

Never forget: IBM lambasted by ABS for failing to handle Census DDoS

On Monday IBM served the ASX with 17 recommendations and found a number of shortcomings in the project such as noting the trade platform was not ready for go-live.

""Factors that suggested the ASX Trade system was not ready to go-live considering ASX's near zero appetite for service disruption. This was the case even though the formal implementation readiness processes were completed and verified by multiple parties without objection to go-live"" IBM found.

""There were gaps in the rigour applied to the project delivery risk and issue management process expected for a project of this nature and risk and issue management project compliance to ASX practices project requirements and the project test strategy/planning did not meet accepted industry practices.

""It was not reasonable to expect the test plan used would meet the ASX's near zero appetite for service disruption.""

According to Big Blue there were seven factors that suggested the platform was not ready for go-live which included historical software product quality indicators additional testing needs being noted the quantity of open defects gaps in end-to-end test coverage proximity to year-end change freeze windows for participants risk likelihood ratings and a lack of evidence of challenges to the risk rating or to go-live.

""Last November's market outage fell short of ASX's high standards"" ASX MD and CEO Dominic Stevens said on Monday. ""We believed that the software was ready for go-live as did our technology provider Nasdaq. Clearly there were issues which was particularly disappointing given the significant progress we have made on resilience in recent years.""

IBM also concluded the project could have benefited from additional and independent scrutiny.

It determined there were gaps in the rigour applied to the project delivery risk and issue management process such as opportunities to identify additional risks being missed differences between project delivery risk templates and the enterprise delivery risk processes the project not receiving risk resources with greater experience in technical projects that it would have benefitted from and governance being shifted to a group that had a wide range of responsibilities.

""The shift diluted attention given to the project"" IBM said.

The review found some positives however with IBM saying the ASX met or exceeded leading industry practices in 58 out of 75 of the capabilities assessed.

""We acknowledge the findings in the report. It's pleasing that ASX met or exceeded leading industry practices in most areas. But the report does point to some important areas for improvement and we will address all of its recommendations"" Stevens added.

""ASX is well advanced in developing a detailed response plan for execution over the next 12 to 18 months and we'll commission the independent expert to review our actions to meet its recommendations. Our delivery of this program of work will be under the oversight of ASIC and the RBA.""

IBM said the project's business case development and project change management exceeded accepted practices; that the project was provided with and had access to sufficient financial time people and technological resources at all stages of delivery to meet its objectives; that communications with key stakeholders were appropriately managed by the ASX and said incident management actions taken by the exchange were appropriate.

The exchange in 2018 was asked to up its risk management practices following an ""unprecedented"" hardware failure in September 2016 that resulted in the outage of its equity market. According to ASIC the actions taken by ASX during the 2020 incident were appropriate and reflected the lessons learned from the 2016 incident.

""ASX takes the resilience and reliability of its markets extremely seriously. That's why we immediately engaged with our regulators to commission this external review and will address all of its recommendations. It's also why we've already taken action to change our project delivery practices"" Stevens continued.

""The changes we've made to our management structure are aligned to these objectives.

""Driving technological change is hard and creates transition risk. No market will operate without incidents or outages from time to time. Nevertheless all outages are regrettable.""

The regulators expect ASX to apply the insights from IBM's findings across the exchange to ensure existing and proposed projects including the CHESS replacement program are managed and implemented appropriately.

ASIC is also undertaking a separate investigation into the ASX Trade outage to determine whether ASX met its obligations under its Australian Market Licence.

In a major refresh of its Z Series chips IBM is adding on-chip AI acceleration capabilities to allow enterprise customers to perform deep learning inferencing while transactions are taking place to capture business insights and fight fraud in real-time.

IBM is set to unveil the latest Z chip Aug. 23 (Monday) at the annual Hot Chips 33 conference which is being held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company provided advance details in a media pre-briefing last week.

This will be the first Z chip used in IBM's System Z mainframes that won't follow a traditional numeric naming pattern used in the past. Instead of following the previous z15 chip with a z16 moniker the new processor is being called IBM Telum.

This will be IBM's first processor to include on-chip AI acceleration according to the company. Designed for customers across a wide variety of uses including banking finance trading insurance applications and customer interactions the Telum processors have been in development for the past three years. The first Telum-based systems are planned for release in the first half of 2022.

One of the major strengths of the new Telum chips is that they are designed to enable applications to run efficiently where their data resides giving enterprises more flexibility with their most critical workloads Ross Mauri the general manager of IBM Z said in a briefing with reporters on the announcement before Hot Chips.

""From an AI point of view I have been listening to our clients for several years and they are telling me that they can't run their AI deep learning inferences in their transactions the way they want to"" said Mauri. ""They really want to bring AI into every transaction. And the types of clients I am talking to are running 1000 10000 50000 transactions per second. We are talking high volume high velocity transactions that are complex with multiple database reads and writes and full recovery for … transactions in banking finance retail insurance and more.""

By integrating mid-transaction AI inferencing into the Telum chips it will be a huge breakthrough for fraud detection said Mauri.

""You hear about fraud detection all the time"" he said. ""Well I think we are going to be able to move from fraud detection to fraud prevention. I think this is a real game changer when it comes to the business world and I am really excited about that.""

Inside the Telum Architecture

Christian Jacobi an IBM distinguished engineer and the chief architect for IBM Z processor design said that the Telum chip design is specifically optimized to run these kinds of mission critical heavy duty transaction processing and batch processing workloads while ensuring top-notch security and availability.

""We have designed this accelerator using the AI core coming from the IBM AI research center"" in cooperation with the IBM Research team the IBM Z chip design team and the IBM Z firmware and software development team said Jacobi. It is the first IBM chip created using technology from the IBM Research AI hardware center.

""The goal for this processor and the AI accelerator was to enable embedding AI with super low latency directly into the transactions without needing to send the data off-platform which brings all sorts of latency inconsistencies and security concerns"" said Jacobi. ""Sending data over a network oftentimes personal and private data requires cryptography and auditing of security standards that creates a lot of complexity in an enterprise environment. We have designed this accelerator to operate directly on the data using virtual address mechanisms and the data protection mechanisms that naturally apply to any other thing on the IBM Z processor.""

To achieve the low latencies IBM engineers directly connected the accelerator to the on-chip cache infrastructure which can directly access model data and transaction data from the caches he explained. ""It enables low batch counts so that we do not have to wait for multiple transactions to arrive of the same model type. All of that is geared towards enabling millisecond range inference tasks so that they can be done as part of the transaction processing without impacting their service level agreements … and have the results available to be able to utilize the AI inference result as part of the transaction processing.

The new Telum chips are manufactured for IBM by Samsung using a 7nm Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) process.

The chips have a new design compared to IBM's existing z15 chips according to Jacobi. Today's z15 chips use dual chip modules but the Telum chips will use a single module.

""Four of those modules will be plugged into one drawer basically a motherboard with four sockets"" he said. ""In the prior generations we used two different chip types – a processor chip and a system control chip that contained a physical L4 cache and that system control hub chip also acted as a hub whenever two processor chips needed to communicate with each other.""

Dropping the system control chip enabled the designers to reduce the latencies he said. ""When one chip needs to talk to another chip we can implement a flat topology where each of the eight chips in a drawer has a direct connection to the seven other chips in the drawer. That optimizes latencies for cache interactions and memory access across the drawer.""

Jacobi said that the Telum chips will provide a 40 percent performance improvement at the socket level over the company's previous z15 chips which is boosted in part by its extra cores.

Each Telum processor contains eight processor cores and use a deep super-scalar out-of-order instruction pipeline. Running with more than 5GHz clock frequency the redesigned cache and chip-interconnection infrastructure provides 32MB cache per core and can scale to 32 Telum chips. The dual-chip module design contains 22 billion transistors and 19 miles of wire on 17 metal layers.

An Analyst Weighs In

Karl Freund founder and principal analyst of Cambrian AI Research told EnterpriseAI that the upcoming Telum chips directly target enterprise users with a wide range of useful capabilities.

""In addition to a new cache architecture that will significantly pump-up performance the Telum processor will provide Z customers with the ability to run real-time AI on the same platform that conducts the mission critical transactions and analyses on which enterprises depend"" said Freund. ""Until Telum Z applications could run machine learning on the Z cores or offload data to another platform for deep learning analysis. The latter introduces unacceptable latencies and significant costs as well as introducing entirely new and now unnecessary security risk.""

For customers these could be compelling improvements said Freund.

""I believe Telum provides the biggest reason we have seen in a while for applications to remain in the Z fold"" he said. ""Honestly enterprise AI is about to get very real with the Telum processor. After all the Z is the custodian of some of the most important data in an enterprise. Being able to run deep learning models directly on the Z will unlock tremendous value for Z clients value that has been hidden until Telum.""

What still needs to be determined he said is how it all will perform when the development work is completed. ""We need to see whether the small accelerator at 'only' 6 TFLOPS can provide adequate processing power to eight very fast cores needing AI services. However since the data involved here is highly structured numerical floating point or decimal data instead of images voice or video I suspect the accelerator will prove up to the task.""

More Details to Come Later

Jacobi said that IBM is not yet providing any additional system performance specifications until the company's engineers complete further optimizations of its firmware and software stacks that will run on the systems.

""We will provide more performance gains out of optimization across those layers of the entire stack when we get to that point next year"" he said.

""I will add that one of the unique things about our design … is that every core when it does AI … are performing a hybrid – they are performing the complex transaction work including the databases and the business logic and then switch over to perform AI as part of the transaction"" said Jacobi. ""When they switch over they can use the entire capacity of the AI accelerator and not just a sliver that is assigned to the core. It is a dedicated piece of silicon on the chip. And the core can access that piece of silicon and use the entire compute capacity of that AI accelerator. That is important for us to achieve the low latencies that we need to make it all fit within the transaction response budget.""

About That Z Series Name Change

The upcoming Telum chips will show up in IBM's Z Series and LinuxONE systems as the main processor chip for both product lines said IBM's Mauri. They are not superseding the Z Series chips he said.

So does that mean that z16 z17 and other future Z chips are no longer on the roadmap?

""No said Mauri. ""It just means that we never named our chips before. We are naming it this time because we are proud of the innovation and breakthroughs and think that it is unique in what it does. And that is the only thing. I think z15 will still be around and there will be future generations many future generations.""

Still to Come: New z/OS

To prepare for the arrival of the Telum chips IBM has already slated the debut of the next version of its updated z/OS 2.5 operating system for Z Series hardware sometime in September according to an earlier report by The Register. The mainframe operating system is expected to get more AI and hybrid cloud features as well as expanded co-processor support based on a preview of the OS that was unveiled in March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2libS1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLXRlbHVtLWNoaXBzLWFpbWVkLWF0LWFpLWluZmVyZW5jaW5nLXdvcmtsb2Fkcy1saWtlLWZyYXVkLWRldGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM introduces Telum chips aimed at AI inferencing workloads like fraud detection,"Image: IBM

Big Blue has unveiled Telum its first chip with AI inferencing acceleration that will allow it to conduct tasks such as fraud detection while a transaction is occurring.

""The chip contains 8 processor cores with a deep super-scalar out-of-order instruction pipeline running with more than 5GHz clock frequency optimised for the demands of heterogenous enterprise-class workloads"" IBM said.

""The completely redesigned cache and chip-interconnection infrastructure provides 32MB cache per core and can scale to 32 Telum chips. The dual-chip module design contains 22 billion transistors and 19 miles of wire on 17 metal layers.""

The chip was built on 7nm extreme ultraviolet technology created by Samsung and represents the initial involvement of the IBM Research AI Hardware Center.

In development for three years the first system using the chip is slated for the first half of 2022.

Senior technical staff member for IBM Z hardware development Anthony Saporito said the L2 caches can combine and form a virtual 256MB L3 cache and up to eight Telum chips could combine to form a virtual 2GB L4 cache.

""One of the key innovations here on the Telum design is we built an AI accelerator right onto the silicon of the chip and we directly connected all of the cores and built an ecosystem up the stack through the hardware design through firmware and through the operating systems and the software that enables bringing this deep learning into transactions all of the transactions"" he said.

""That part of the design is a really cool collaborative design that we did between the research group and the systems group and that directly connected design built for deep learning inferencing allows us to run at scale.

""Those thousands and thousands of transactions per second ... with this technology are able to do real-time deep learning inferencing fraud detection and analytics and gain insights as those transactions are running at the system and they're able to do that at scale and with all of the reliability and zero downtime that's critical to this platform.""

In May IBM Research created a test semiconductor with 2nm fabrication that Big Blue claimed would improve performance by 45% using the same amount of power or use 75% less energy when compared to 7nm-based chips.

The 2nm technology will go into production toward the end of 2024. Mass usage could come around 2025.

""This is exciting because most advanced manufacturing in the world is in about 7nm and some are in 5mn and we are here to show we could put together a 2nm transistor. That means this industry will keep going for the next decade that's what these results mean"" IBM Research vice president Mukesh Khare said at the time.

The CEO of Berry Oncology a subsidiary of Berry Genomics is overseeing China’s first and only large-scale forward-looking cohort study of early liver cancer screening based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. It is also one of the largest and fastest-growing prospective cohort studies of liver cancer in the world. Launched in 2018 the PreCar project (Prospective suRveillance for very Early hepatocelluar CARcinoma) involves approximately 10000 people (5000 liver cirrhosis patients and 5000 with hepatitis B virus). Berry Oncology has already committed over 200 million RMB (US $31 million) toward PreCar in the first phase and recently kicked off phase two. In addition multiple cancer screening research projects are underway.

In August 2020 Berry Oncology launched a liver cancer early screening product named “Lai Si Ning.” Based on Whole-Genome Sequencing Technology of cfDNA the liquid biopsy can achieve a 95.42 percent sensitivity while maintaining the specificity of 97.91 percent. (To compare the sensitivity of early liver cancer detection using traditional serum markers and imaging is only 63 percent.)

The company chose to focus on liver cancer because it is one of the more prevalent cancer types in China but the plan is to expand to additional tumor types. “In the next three to five years” says Zhou “we will deliver research results on the early screening and diagnosis of five to eight high-risk and high-incidence cancers in China and bring the tests to market.”

Established in 2017 with offices in Fuzhou and Beijing Berry Oncology’s mission is to “diagnose all cancers early treat all patients precisely.” Their current offering includes products and services for identifying companion diagnostics indicators monitoring response to treatment regimens and predicting the prognosis of targeted and immune therapies. They’re also developing solutions for cancer screening and early detection. Supported by the technological distribution and financial advantages provided by Berry Genomics Berry Oncology is quickly becoming a leader in cancer testing solutions.

Berry Oncology’s emphasis on catching early-stage cancer positions it to be a key contributor toward the goals of Healthy China 2030. In 2016 the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China laid out a blueprint of national health targets that align with the UN’s sustainable development goals. The State Council (China’s cabinet) followed the initiative with specific guidelines for its 1.4 billion people making it the world’s largest public health plan. It involves 15 major campaigns that shift the focus from treatment to prevention.

Early prevention and treatment of cancer is high on the agenda and the potential market value of multi-cancer screening in China is expected to reach 49 billion RMB (US $7.6 billion) by 2030. Screenings of single cancers such as colorectal and liver cancer have been the first to develop and hit the market.

Berry Oncology is leading the charge. The company is utilizing Illumina products to further its research in advancing early cancer detection.

“With Illumina’s sophisticated stable and efficient systems in genetic testing we have accelerated the implementation and application of our products in clinical practice in China especially in the field of tumor genetic testing” says Zhou.

“I have a dream that in the next few years the NGS-based early cancer screening will be incorporated into the Chinese clinical application process regulatory system and payment system.”

In August 2021 Berry Oncology completed a series B1 round of financing raising nearly 700 million RMB (US $99.15 million). For this genomics startup it’s full steam ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,

One secret to its success is a little more spiritual than you might have guessed according to CEO Pat Gelsinger.

In a recorded message that will play during an international conference on business and religion this week Gelsinger highlights the competitive advantage that comes from building a culture that celebrates personal faith alongside other employee traits. At Intel workers are free to “bring their entire self” to the office he says.

“When we take into account everyone’s nuanced differences we put our organizations in a position to capture truly sustainable business advantages” Gelsinger says.

Intel put itself in that position in part by enabling employees to form resource groups based on religion says Sandra Rivera the organization’s former chief people officer and current executive vice president in the same video. Currently Intel has seven such groups including one for atheists and agnostics she says.

The company champions “how important faith and belief is to our employees” Rivera says.

In so doing Intel improves the lives of more than just its workers argues Brian Grim the founder and president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation which organized the conference. He says leaders like Rivera and Gelsinger are paving the way toward a more peaceful world.

“Businesses that embrace religious freedom can change entire cultures” in addition to influencing faith-related laws he says.

Related The power of religious diversity in the workplace

The goal of Grim’s foundation is to push more companies to acknowledge and even celebrate their employees’ religious identities. One way they work toward achieving that is by handing out awards to business leaders who are modeling the right approach toward faith.

“Businesses can make a huge impact on people’s lives” Grim says.

This year Gelsinger and Rivera from Intel will receive one of three gold medals handed out during the Global Business & Interfaith Peace Awards which the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation puts on in cooperation with the Business for Peace Initiative of the United Nations Global Compact.

Other gold medalists include Dr. Judith Richter who runs Medinol an Israeli heart stent company and founded NIR School of the Heart to help high school students pursue careers in medicine and heal interreligious divides and King Husein the chairman and CEO of Span Construction & Engineering who helped lead a roundtable for business leaders on international religious freedom during the 2019 United Nations general assembly in New York City.

The awards are valuable because they help people understand that there are many different ways for business leaders to create a faith-friendly environment and champion religious freedom Grim says. No two honorees approach religious diversity in the same way.

At Intel Gelsinger Rivera and other company leaders lean most heavily on the employee resource groups that Rivera mentions in the video. Through these groups workers form connections that help them navigate challenges both inside and outside the workplace Grim says noting that he’s heard of a Christian Intel employee connecting with the Muslim resource group in order to prepare for a job-related move to a Muslim-dominated country.

At Tyson Foods on the other hand Chairman John Tyson who is one of this year’s silver medalists honors his employees’ religious identities by having full-time chaplains on staff Grim says.

The chaplains “fill a need that sometimes can’t be met outside of the office especially during COVID-19 shutdowns” he says.

Regardless of what form they come in faith-related resources for employees can help businesses recruit and retain great workers Grim says.

“It’s good for business. That’s ultimately why companies embrace this” he argues.

It’s also good for society says Husein who is being recognized for his advocacy work. He believes religious freedom activism that originates in the workplace has a more powerful impact than government-led efforts.

“I think if businesses can understand that (religious freedom is good for business) and embrace it and promote it within their own countries we then do not need the government to get involved” Husein says.

The Global Business & Interfaith Peace Awards event will take place virtually on Tuesday Aug. 24 at noon Eastern. Attendees will have an opportunity to interact with the winners.

My first impressions on it mostly discussed the design changes and high-level thoughts. Those haven’t changed. But I also made early observations about the 11th-gen Intel Pentium Gold processor noting that it impressed me.

Using the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook these last 14 days has only reinforced those thoughts. The Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook is shockingly fast for its configuration and $439.99 price tag on Lenovo’s site. This is surely a contender for “Chromebook of the year” in 2021 based on what you get.

Slight design improvements from last year’s model

I won’t spend much time discussing the design as I covered much of that in my first impressions earlier this month. If you missed those here are the main takeaways:

If you’re familiar with last year’s slightly smaller model you’ll see many familiar features. In fact this isn’t a radical redesign although moving up from a 13.3-inch display to a 14-inch panel does give a little more room in the chassis. This time around there are larger speaker ports alongside the keyboard for example. These house 2W speakers are tuned with Waves MaxxAudio. The sound quality isn’t bad and the loudness is high for a laptop of this size and price.

With the slightly larger screen the overall footprint of the 5i is a smidge larger than last year’s Flex 5. And of course this isn’t a Flex model so the display only folds back to around 130-degrees or so. The display panel is otherwise similar to the 2020 models which is to say they’re above average. And Lenovo gave the 2021 5i Chromebook a brighter 300-nit backlight for the IPS panel which is a welcome addition.

5i on the left Flex 5 on the right The size difference is magnified by a wide angle lens

The new chassis material adds rigidity and having USB Type-C ports on both sides of it is fantastic. Putting all of those on one side should be a criminal offense in my opinion. I liked the continued inclusion of a physical slider to disable the webcam. The webcam itself is average at best but serviceable.

The keyboard isn’t backlit on this configuration unfortunately. That’s the only issue I can find with it. It’s comfortable and responsive with good key travel. And the mylar trackpad has performed admirably as well. Indeed it’s far better than the clicky-sounding trackpad on the Flex 5. Oddly the trackpad is slightly offset from the center although that didn’t bother me.

With my WiFi 6 router I’m getting superb transfer speeds and I haven’t experienced any Bluetooth issues. Battery life is closer to that 8-hour mark that I figured not the 10 hours that Lenovo claims. Then again they use a standard controlled test. I simply used the device as I would daily so your mileage may vary.

Here are the rest of the hardware specifications for this configuration:

CPU Dual-core (four-threads) Intel Pentium Gold 7505 (2.0 GHz / 3.5 GHz) GPU Intel Integrated UHD Graphics Display 14-inch IPS 1920 x 1080 display matte finish

supporting PD 3.0 data and DisplayPort 1.4

headphone/microphone combo jack Battery 51 WHr expected run-time up to 10 hours Weight 3.1 pounds Software Chrome OS automatic updates through June 2029

I also have to admit: Even though it doesn’t appear on the specs I really like the LED battery indicator.

A portable Pentium powerhouse

I’d say the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook ticks off most of the main boxes when it comes to design run-time and a solid experience. When you add in the performance factor for the cost this Chromebook really shines.

To give you an idea of how the 11th-generation Pentium Gold inside the IdeaPad 5i Chromebook I ran a suite of benchmarks.

For comparison purposes I ran the same benchmarks on last year’s Flex 5 Chromebook with its 10th-generation Core i3. And mainly to see the progress Intel has made over the last few silicon iterations I included my daily driver. That’s the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 with an 8th-generation Core i5 paired with 16 GB of memory.

All tests were run on the latest Chrome OS 92 Stable Channel with hyper-threading enabled and in Guest Mode on a freshly booted machine. All flags were set to the default settings save for the hyper-threading option.

Looks like I need to update my daily driver!

The benchmark results although just a general performance indicator are striking.

The newest chip is a Pentium processor but handily beats a Core i5 that’s two generations old. And it fares better against last year’s Core i3 mobile CPU as well.

Put another way: This isn’t your grandpa’s Pentium. It’s a peppy little processor that keeps things moving nicely in Chrome OS. Dare I say this year’s Pentium in an entry-level Chromebook competes well against last year’s mid-range line?

I suppose that depends on how you view entry-level and mid-range Chromebooks. However a Celeron or Pentium has long been considered on the low end of that scale.

I don’t use many Android apps on my Chromebook these days but the ones I tested worked just as well as they do on my daily driver. Maybe even a little bit quicker to be honest although most are fairly “light” applications.

Another test that I don’t normally do is anything in Linux. But given the higher than expected numbers from the latest Pentium processor I figured to make an exception. For a super basic baseline test I installed Linux on all three devices. I then wrote a very simple Python script to print out the numbers 1 to 1000000 sequentially. The test then displays the time in seconds indicating how long the script took to run.

No it’s not ideal and it probably tests the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) of the processor more than anything else. Even so the results were surprising:

IdeaPad 5i 9.963 Flex 5 11.78 Acer Chromebook Spin 13 35.411 All times in seconds lower numbers are better

Again this is a super simple test but installing development tools and testing how long it takes to compile code is likely beyond the scope of most Chromebook users.

Should you buy the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook?

If you’re in the market for a higher-end Chromebook want a 2-in-1 device or desire a touchscreen this isn’t the Chromebook for you. Anyone else on a limited budget should definitely consider the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook although I’d recommend waiting for a sale.

It’s quite common for Lenovo to discount their laptops on a regular basis. But even at the full price it’s a great value based on my usage. Every day browsing Android apps and even some Linux usage are all enjoyable here.

This is definitely more of a mid-range performer even with the 4 GB of RAM that should suit most Chromebook user’s needs. As I mentioned earlier it’s a definite contender for “Chromebook of the year” based on the price and performance.

Note that I received some reports from readers last week that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook was discontinued. I reached out to Lenovo and that’s not the case. It seems like there was a bad link floating around on the web. The correct one is here.

Intel Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon CPUs Pack 4 HBM2E Dies With 8-Hi Stacks In A Chiplet Design Fused Together With Main Core Dies Using EMIB

We have already detailed Intel's Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon CPUs earlier but based on the new information published during HotChips 33 it looks like the blue team is disclosing a few more tidbits regarding its next-gen Xeon CPUs.

2 of 9

According to Intel the Sapphire Rapids-SP will come in two package variants a standard and an HBM configuration. The standard variant will feature a chiplet design composed of four XCC dies that will feature a die size of around 400mm2. This is the die size for a singular XCC die and there will be four in total on the top Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon chip. Each die will be interconnected via EMIB which has a pitch size of 55u and a core pitch of 100u.

The standard Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon chip will feature 10 EMIB interconnects and the entire package will measure at a mighty 4446mm2. Moving over to the HBM variant we are getting an increased number of interconnects which sit at 14 and are needed to interconnect the HBM2E memory to the cores.

The four HBM2E memory packages will feature 8-Hi stacks so Intel is going for at least 16 GB of HBM2E memory per stack for a total of 64 GB across the Sapphire Rapids-SP package. Talking about the package the HBM variant will measure at an insane 5700mm2 or 28% larger than the standard variant. Compared to the recently leaked EPYC Genoa numbers the HBM2E package for Sapphire Rapids-SP would end up 5% larger while the standard package will be 22% smaller.

4446mm2 Intel Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon (HBM2E Package) - 5700mm2

5700mm2 AMD EPYC Genoa (12 CCD Package) - 5428mm2

Intel also states that the EMIB link provides twice the bandwidth density improvement and 4 times better power efficiency compared to standard package designs.

Intel also detailed the package and die size of its flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU based on the Xe-HPC architecture. The chip will consist of 2 tiles with 16 active dies per stack. The maximum active top die size is going to be 41mm2 while the base die size which is also referred to as the 'Compute Tile' sits at 650mm2. The Ponte Vecchio GPU makes use of 8 HBM 8-Hi stacks and contains a total of 11 EMIB interconnects. The whole Intel Ponte Vecchio package would measure 4843.75mm2. It is also mentioned that the bump pitch for Meteor Lake CPUs using High-Density 3D Forveros packaging will be 36u.

Moving forward Intel has several next-generation solutions for advanced packaging designs such as Forveros Omni and Forveros Direct as they enter the Angstrom Era of transistor development.

This has meant a tremendous cultural shift for the company and its more than 113000 employees as they worked remotely over the past year and a half. Remote work was ""one of the biggest transformations of Intel's history"" Amber Wiseley senior director of global benefits at Intel told Insider adding that it taught the company to ""challenge assumptions."" Intel will now offer three work models to employees: fully remote fully on-site and a hybrid.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We've got a lot of factories and a lot of energy around our sites where we make our products and design our products"" Wiseley said. ""That's part of our culture and history. Now we have moved to this social experiment of working from home.""

Most of the $211 billion chip giant's employees currently work remotely although those who work in factories and labs must work on-site. Its number of on-site employees will likely grow as Intel announced earlier this year that it's investing $20 billion in building new factories in Arizona.

Intel currently doesn't have a specific return date but it plans to invite its employees back on site ""as soon as it's safe to do so"" Wiseley said. Employees will be invited back on site in phases based on COVID safety protocols in the geographic location.

Some roles like those in factories and labs will require employees to work on-site. Many of these employees are already doing that. Their work doesn't look much different from pre-COVID times although there are fewer people on site since some employees can work from home.

In addition employees will have the option to request to work fully remotely if they want although it will need to go through corporate guidelines. This depends on if their job can be performed fully remotely and if they are living in an approved location. There may be salary adjustments depending on location but it's a case-by-case basis Wiseley said.

Intel will also be rolling out a new hybrid option where employees can have more flexibility to choose whether they want to work remotely or in the office. In practice this would mean employees could be working some days on-site and some remotely. Wiseley expects that this option will apply to most of Intel's employees. The company also plans to enhance the way it uses its office space so that employees can work temporarily at other office locations besides their typical one.

""We're embracing the idea of employee choice"" Wiseley said. ""Being able to have more and more flexibility should just unlock productivity creativity and the ability to solve the most difficult problems.""

Having these three options could be a competitive advantage for Intel and help the company attract and retain talent Wiseley said.

""We're recognizing that we don't have a one size fits all approach and that we're going to do our best to embrace that diversity and meet our employees where they're at"" Wiseley said.

While the Xe infrastructure will of course be present in HPC applications thanks to Ponte Vecchio Intel is also releasing Xe HPG as Arc a gaming-focused GPU based on the same fundamental architecture. While STH is not a gaming-focused site we still want to cover this GPU as we suspect it will end up pulling double duty as a workstation-class card as well.

Intel’s first consumer Arc GPU will be running Alchemist Intel’s name for the specific microarchitecture used on these new GPUs. Alchemist is based on the Xe-core which is the fundamental building block of Intel’s Xe range of products.

Each Xe-core comes with 16 vector and matrix engines plus some cache and other logic. Intel previously defined their graphics solutions in terms of EUs or Execution Units. The company said that the execution unit name was too constraining for its next generation cores. New to the architecture are the matrix engines which Intel calls Xe Matrix eXtensions or XMX. The XMX engines are designed for matrix math common in AI or machine learning scenarios.

Intel can bundle varying amounts of the Xe-cores together along with some additional logic and cache to create a complete GPU. They have provided an example here featuring four Xe-cores though no word yet on the exact configuration of the Xe HPG line was given.

Of course all of the compute grunt in the world is for naught if you do not have software support to back it up. The vector engines on the Xe-core are fully DX12 compatible and Intel is including hardware-accelerated Ray Tracing Units along with each Xe-core as well.

One area that Intel is making an interesting push is with their Xe Super Sampling or XeSS technology. This is Intel’s upscaling technology designed to compete with NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). The basic concept is that rendering is done at a lower quality e.g. 1080p and then upscaled using an inferencing model to 4K. Ideally one gets the fast render times of lower resolution with the quality output of a higher resolution but slower render.

While Intel has been light with details so far all appearances are that the technology is more similar to DLSS than to FSR in that it incorporates both machine learning as well as a temporal component to the upscale. Additionally Intel is utilizing their XMX engines on the Xe-core to accelerate this process similar to NVIDIA using tensor cores for DLSS. One important similarity to AMD’s FSR is that supposedly XeSS will be compatible with both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs though without XMX engines in the GPUs performance is an even bigger question mark when talking cross-vendor support.

Intel is going to produce Alchemist at TSMC on N6 rather than try to produce it in-house on their 10nm (or Intel 7) process. TSMC’s N6 process is a more refined version of the 7nm process-node technology currently used by AMD’s RDNA2 GPUs.

Intel has also made a point to show that the Xe-core based GPUs will be scalable with an example given showing a 32x Xe-core design. Broad scalability of Xe-core GPUs could enable Intel to cover multiple market segments relatively simply but so far all we have to go on is their word and this picture in the slide deck.

Lastly Intel has chosen some very gamer-friendly names for their forthcoming GPU families. This first-generation product will be called Alchemist with future products called Battlemage and such. I almost feel like this slide should have come with its own RGB lighting but perhaps that is just me.

And with all of that said everything in this article is still a big question mark. Intel is still a ways away from the actual release of Alchemist and while rumors suggest Intel is roughly targeting an NVIDIA RTX 3070 in terms of performance we will not know for certain until someone actually gets their hands on one of these cards and puts it through its paces. Speaking personally I truly hope Intel knocks this one out of the park as additional competitive options in the GPU space will help the overall health of the GPU market."

The index was on track for its worst week since June at one point. In a relatively low-volatility market that's been backed by Federal Reserve policy for more than a year such a move can feel scary.

But according to three of Wall Street's most renowned equity strategists the pain may just be getting started.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Over the past couple of weeks Bank of America's Savita Subramanian Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson and Stifel's Barry Bannister — all the top US equity strategists at their respective firms — have issued specific correction calls. Each of their views is laid out below.

Savita Subramanian - Bank of America

Bank of America

Subramanian who is tied with Bannister for the most bearish top strategist on Wall Street with a 2021 S&P 500 price target of 3800 issued the most severe call. She said that the S&P 500 is due for about a 15% correction putting stocks close to bear market territory. The index closed at 4441.67 on Friday.

Subramanian's argument rests on the fact that she expects 10-year Treasury yields to rise to 1.9% by year end from their current level of 1.26%. The more attractive risk-free yield will pull away investors from riskier stocks she argues. In other words investors will have a increasingly enticing alternative to stocks the more rates rise.

Muted corporate earnings due to inflation and the economy slowing down are also risks she said. Plus stocks are overvalued by a plethora of measures — laid out below — signaling weak returns could be ahead.

Bank of America

Mike Wilson - Morgan Stanley

When Mike Wilson makes a correction call investors would do well to listen. Wilson has been a master of correction calls over the last year-plus (last year he broke down for Insider his process for making such forecasts). In 2020 he accurately called two pullbacks in stocks running up to the 2020 election.

In a Monday podcast Wilson again issued a call for a ""greater than"" 10% pullback in the S&P 500. He cited the prospect of the Fed tapering their asset purchases and what that would mean for valuations as well as slowing earnings growth.

""The combination of lower-than-consensus earnings next year and lower valuation leads us to believe there is very little upside if any to major US equity indices over the next few quarters"" Wilson said. ""In fact our S&P 500 target price for year-end is 4000 which is 10% below current levels. Between here and there we expect a greater than 10% correction.""

Barry Bannister - Stifel

Stifel

In a note to clients last week Bannister called for a 10% correction in stocks. He pointed to a list of signs that paint a dim picture for stocks.

The first is that economic activity measured by manufacturing output is due to slow down. Second he sees the global money supply shrinking as central banks begin to take their foot off the stimulus gas pedal. This typically is a drag on stock performance illustrated below.

Stifel

Third like Wilson and Subramanian Bannister sees corporate earnings beginning to drag. Finally rising bond yields and the US dollar growing stronger threaten to derail stocks' upward path.

The bigger picture

Again Subramanian and Bannister are the most bearish strategists on Wall Street each with end-of-year S&P 500 price targets of 3800. Wilson isn't much more bullish with his target of 4000.

Those targets fall below the still-bearish average Wall Street target of about 4240 according to Bloomberg data. They are also well below some of their more bullish peers like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin or Credit Suisse's Jonathan Golub who have price targets of 4700 and 4600 respectively.

But there's nuance to even the most bullish calls. Goldman Sachs for example said in recent weeks that the S&P 500 could correct almost 20% if 10-year Treasury yield rise in a quick and substantial way.

Big investors are also worried about the ongoing economic recovery a Bank of America survey showed this week.

It's been smooth sailing for stocks in 2021. But they will have to try to navigate a clear path through multiple storms brewing on the horizon from rising interest rates and Fed tapering to the Delta variant of COVID-19 and slowing economic growth.

Fairly broad consensus on Wall Street seems to be that stocks have hit a ceiling for the time being. Time will tell if that's the case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2FsbC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yMi9ob3ctYS1wYXltZW50LXByb2Nlc3NpbmctY29tcGFueS1ub3ctd29ydGgtYmlsbGlvbnMtY2FtZS10by10aGUtbGVoaWdoLXZhbGxleS1hbmQtd2hlcmUtaXRzLWhlYWRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a payment-processing company now worth billions came to the Lehigh Valley and where it's headed,"Second of two parts.

As a 15-year-old growing up in Far Hills New Jersey in 1998 Jared Isaacman was ready for something different. He had enough of high school and saw his three older siblings — all at least 10 years older — leading more fun and interesting lives than him.

Boy was that about to change.

As it was Isaacman was more focused on making money with a computer repair and web design company that he and a friend started. Looking to drum up business he got a job at CompUSA thinking a giant computer retailer wasn’t a bad place to find customers. Not too long after one of those clients a credit card processing services firm called Merchant Services Inc. extended the teenager a full-time information technology job.

So at 16 Isaacman left high school got his GED and went to work for MSI. He wasn’t there long but the job gave him exposure to the payments industry showing him how clunky and neglected certain parts of it were especially for businesses simply looking to accept credit card payments. As Isaacman often does he saw opportunity.

That same year in 1999 he left MSI and started United Bank Card in his parents’ basement beginning his journey to transform the payments industry as a teenager who couldn’t yet qualify for his own credit card.

Today United Bank Card through rapid growth many acquisitions and some name changes too is Shift4 Payments a company with 1500 employees including about 500 at its headquarters in a nondescript brick office building at Lehigh Valley Industrial Park III in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

The 38-year-old Isaacman who lives in Palmer Township remains at the helm as CEO leading a company that with 7000 sales partners annually processes more than $200 billion in payments for 200000 businesses.

Jared Isaacman founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments.

And while Shift4 has plenty of Main Street customers the company lives more on the complex end of the spectrum targeting businesses such as large hotel chains ski resorts sports stadiums and casinos. All told more than 21000 hotels and 125000 restaurants in the United States use at least one of Shift4’s products.

“If you can run your entire business on an iPad like a food truck then that’s Square country” Isaacman said. “Our customers need like 20 different types of software to function.”

Payment volume suffered early in the pandemic but Shift4 started to see some recovery in the restaurant space as early as April 2020 which allowed it to proceed with an initial public offering two months later. When the company went public Isaacman became a billionaire via his 38% stake in the company. Today Forbes puts his net worth at about $2.4 billion.

Beyond the world of payments Isaacman is an accomplished pilot rated to fly several types of commercial and military aircraft. That passion led him to build Draken International a defense firm that trains Air Force pilots that Isaacman sold two years ago to Blackstone for nine figures.

And as he runs Shift4 which now has a market capitalization of $6.5 billion Isaacman also is preparing to launch into space next month as the commander of Inspiration4 the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth.

Even for Isaacman accustomed to working day and night since he was 16 he’s having to use all hours of the night and weekends to balance the responsibilities. He told The Morning Call during an interview last month that his Shift4 executive team is getting emails from him at 2 or 3 in the morning as he rotates between the payments business and his space-training schedule. He’s also squeezing in time with his wife Monica and his two daughters ages 5 and 7.

As for what comes next?

“Right now I’m really just focused on this mission because it’s so damn important” Isaacman said. “And really there’s some pretty unbelievable things we’ve been working on at Shift4 too that I think can be pretty transformational over the next year. So those are all top of mind but I’m sure there will always be something that comes next. But we’ve got enough on the plate right now.”

Despite the national attention Isaacman has received over the last year — he was featured in Forbes last fall after taking Shift4 public and the Inspiration4 crew made the cover of TIME magazine — many Lehigh Valley residents may not even know his name or realize he calls this area home. Residents may have however heard the company’s Harbortouch product mentioned on “Bar Rescue” after host Jon Taffer in 2017 endorsed the company’s touchscreen point-of-sale systems.

In the Lehigh Valley Shift4 is a large employer but certainly not as immediately recognizable as PPL Corp. Air Products or Mack Trucks. And while Isaacman spends a good portion of his time here and is building a home in Lower Nazareth Township many Lehigh Valley business nonprofit and economic development leaders have had a hard time getting his ear.

“We’re very glad that he’s chosen the Lehigh Valley for both his business and his home” said Don Cunningham president and CEO of Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. “He’s an exciting guy with a great company. We’re hopeful that someday he’ll become involved in the Lehigh Valley community.”

How Shift4 came here

It wasn’t until 2011 when the fast-growing United Bank Card made the move to the Lehigh Valley from Hunterdon County New Jersey.

In the years prior the company grew rapidly gaining trade publication attention as early as 2003 and launching a pioneering free terminal program a year later.

By 2005 United Bank Card made its debut on the Inc. 5000 — the magazine’s annual list of the country’s fastest-growing private firms — at No. 19 with revenue growth of 2319% between 2001 and ’04.

The company made it to No. 6 in 2006 the year Isaacman was featured on “American Story with Bob Dotson” on NBC. The host told the story per a transcript of the segment of a 23-year-old entrepreneur who employed 125 people bought his dad a Ferrari for Father’s Day and donated $24000 to a homeless shelter.

Things were rolling by the time the company in 2008 launched its Harbortouch point-of-sale system which handled magnetic card swipes and also included software for inventory management and merchandise pricing.

Amid the growth Isaacman said it was an easy natural choice to come to the Lehigh Valley.

For one the company needed to access a talent pool which meant either going east or west. As it was many of the company’s employees already were making the trip from Pennsylvania which also offered lower costs for United Bank Card.

The Lehigh Valley also had another advantage: Lehigh Valley International Airport the place where aviation enthusiast and pilot Isaacman learned to fly.

So the firm set up its headquarters at 2202 N. Irving St. in Hanover Township adjacent to the airport. The state chipped in a $778750 funding package.

In 2012 following the success of the company’s Harbortouch point-of-sale system United Bank Card rebranded as Harbortouch.

“United Bank Card I picked that name in 1999 because it sounded like an established financial institution and I was 16 years old in my parents’ basement so I needed a name like that” Isaacman said. “The moment we started building our own hardware and software and had our point-of-sale capabilities by 2008 that was the last message we wanted to send.

“We didn’t want to sound like an old and crusty financial institution. We wanted to sound like we were fast moving and that we had this killer technology that was also safe” he said.

In fall 2017 the company by then known as Lighthouse Network searched for a new headquarters location in the Lehigh Valley to house its growing workforce. The company looked at locations in Allentown including The Waterfront but early in 2018 decided to expand in place in Hanover Township.

“The reason we’re in our present facilities now and making do is because we didn’t leave ourselves enough time to transition to another facility” Isaacman said.

Shift4 Payments has its headquarters in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

Even before that decision the company continued getting larger.

Harbortouch acquired MSI — Isaacman’s old employer — in 2014 and two years later gained an investment from private-equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners to accelerate its growth plans.

Several acquisitions followed none more transformative than the January 2018 purchase of Shift4 Corp. a Las Vegas payment processing company that served tens of thousands of clients across North America including Choice Hotels Caesars Entertainment and the PGA Tour.

“We went from being able to process payments from four different types of software to 350 types of software in an industry that was moving rapidly toward integrated payments and software” Isaacman said. “It was a very important deal for us.”

With that deal complete Lighthouse Network rebranded as Shift4 Payments — a name Isaacman hopes sticks.

“But yeah 21 years of history we’ve had a couple name changes but it’s all based on just the evolution of the business” he said. “We just didn’t stay still and do the same thing that made us special 20 years ago and hope that would still carry the day five years later. We just evolved.”

Pandemic hits

It was Thursday March 19 2020 when Shift4 sent its office employees home the day Gov. Tom Wolf ordered the closure of non-life-sustaining businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Isaacman remembers walking down the rows of empty cubicles at the Lehigh Valley office wondering “Am I ever going to see anybody back here again?”

For Shift4 it was a shock. The company had spent the last decade predominately focused on serving restaurants and hotels — some of the hardest-hit industries. As the situation worsened Shift4 delayed its long-planned initial public offering.

“You go from a business that you built in your parents’ basement to something that people are saying ‘Wow this thing could be worth billions and billions of dollars in the public markets’ to ‘Everybody go home payment volume is virtually nonexistent the world is shut down’ ” Isaacman said.

“And you’re like ‘What just happened?’ We went from something to nothing pretty damn fast.”

Business took a major hit by late March 2020 when Shift4’s end-to-end payment volume — the dollar amount of card payments it authorizes and settles on behalf of merchants — tanked 70% according to the company’s annual report.

To bolster its finances Shift4 furloughed about 25% of its employees instituted a hiring freeze and reduced salaries for management.

At the same time the company raced to roll out new solutions for its customers especially restaurants as the world pivoted from dine-in to takeout and delivery.

For three months it waived online ordering mobile payment and gift card fees for restaurants. By the end of April it launched a free solution that enabled restaurants to publish an online ordering website in less than an hour. And by late June it introduced technology that allowed consumers to pay their bill at restaurants retailers and hotels by scanning a QR code on the receipt or terminal and completing the transaction on their phone.

Slowly but surely payment volume started recovering.

“What we saw even starting in the first week of April 2020 is people got to eat” Isaacman said noting the company logged year-over-year volume growth in June 2020 as it won market share from competitors.

And during the third quarter last year Shift4 reinstated “substantially all” of its workforce. It lifted the hiring freeze in August 2020 and fully reinstated management salaries in October.

Those optimistic signs early in the pandemic allowed Shift4 to move forward with its IPO in early June 2020 only a couple of months later than planned.

The company’s IPO was priced at $23 a share. Shift4’s shares opened the next day at $33.10 a 44% jump.

Where is it headed?

Shift4’s stock price has increased since eclipsing $100 in April and now trading around $80.

The company has continued to grow acquiring VenueNext in March for $72 million in cash and stock and bolstering Shift4’s presence in sports stadiums entertainment venues and theme parks. Shift4 also has inked deals this year with the San Diego Padres and the United Center home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks.

Shift4 Payments rings the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on June 3 in celebration of the one-year anniversary of its initial public offering.

And on June 22 Shift4 said it processed $1 billion in weekly end-to-end payment volume for the first time. For reference Isaacman said the company’s first billion-dollar year was 2004 and to hit $1 billion in just one week in 2021 means Shift4 has reached a compound annual growth rate of more than 26% for the last 17 years.

Shift4 also is coming off a second quarter in which it beat Wall Street’s expectations: The company logged gross revenue of $351 million net revenue of about $136 million and reported its first quarter of positive net income at $4.5 million.

Isaacman however is quick to point out the company on an earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or EBITDA basis has been profitable since 2004.

Shift4 also reported record quarterly end-to-end payment volume of $11.8 billion nearly three times the comparable period last year and more than double the same period in 2019.

That growth outpaced the roughly 30% jump in spending during the quarter — as compared to 2019 — from Visa and Mastercard users in the United States pointed out Darrin Peller managing director at Wolfe Research.

It’s even more noteworthy he noted when considering hotels a big business for Shift4 haven’t fully recovered yet.

For 2021 Shift4 is now forecasting end-to-end payment volume of $46 billion-$48 billion.

“In our view they’re doing very well and gaining quite a bit of market share” said Peller who analyzes the payments processing and IT services industries and covers Shift4.

And that growth should continue to funnel into the Lehigh Valley.

Isaacman pointed out he’s in the midst of a home construction process in Lower Nazareth that has been ongoing since before his 7-year-old daughter was born.

“So I’m very committed to my home being in the Lehigh Valley area and that Shift4’s headquarters will be in the Lehigh Valley area” he said.

But Isaacman hinted that it may not always be in its spot at 2202 N. Irving St. The company’s annual report shows that its lease at its 45840-square-foot headquarters expires Aug. 31 2025.

He admits the company’s Lehigh Valley office is “suboptimal” forcing Shift4 to pick up space in the general vicinity as needed. Shift4 he said also is thinking about what the post-pandemic workspace will look like.

“One of our hubs will always be here and I just can’t see us continuing for the long run to do this makeshift setup we have today” Isaacman said. “It’s going to be either some sort of a new build or a consolidation into a more modern fun facility for our employees.”

Thinking about where the company is many expansions later is still difficult for Isaacman to fathom. He reflects constantly going back and reading emails he wrote 15 or 20 years ago to replay a certain decision and think about what he could have done differently.

But there’s still no way the 16-year-old ambitious entrepreneur in his parents’ basement all those years ago could have guessed his future self would be a billionaire or a pilot readying to venture into space.

“I couldn’t have imagined that I would be sitting here in this situation I’m in today a year and a half ago let alone five 10 15 years ago” he said. “But I also would say I wasn’t either driven or motivated in any of those periods of times to be a billionaire or go to space. It was just ‘What is the challenge that we’re undertaking right now and how do we succeed at it?’

“It’s just that as you grow as an organization the challenges become bigger and the results if you do succeed become grander.”

Since the year began more than 50 cryptocurrency and blockchain-related projects have risen to the much-coveted unicorn status with market analysts predicting more to come.

A unicorn is a company that has been valued at more than one billion dollars by venture capitalists. A few examples of unicorns in the mainstream include the likes of Airbnb Uber and Elon Musk's Space X that have all managed to garner a valuation in the tens of billions.

In the crypto sphere Coinbase the giant United States-based crypto exchange is a keen example of how fast companies in the crypto industry can rise to prominent status.

With the likes of Amber Group Blockchain.com and OpenSea coming to the fore to join the exclusive club of companies valued at over $1 billion analysts predict that the list will continue to grow as mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain increases.

BlockFi

Kicking off the list is BlockFi. This New Jersey-based financial services company for crypto users managed to close its Series D funding round at a whopping $350 million in March this year setting its value at $3 billion.

Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017 BlockFi has had an impressive round in terms of funding considering the company only managed to raise $50 million in its Series C funding round last year.

BlockFi offers a variety of products to retail crypto investors including a crypto exchange and an interest-bearing account as well as crypto loans issued at low interests. The startup boasts of being one of the few crypto exchanges that feature zero commissions and transaction fees.

With these perks BlockFi has seen its user base grow from about 10000 at the end of 2019 to more than 250000 retail clients and 200 institutional investors and counting. Considering its latest funding round BlockFi’s raised equity now stands at about $450 million since its inception.

Bitpanda

Next up is Bitpanda. Formerly known as Coinmal this Austria-based startup and crypto brokerage service hit a $1.2 billion valuation after a Series B funding that saw the start-up raise $170 million.

The funding series was led by Valar Ventures a New York-based venture capital firm that was founded in 2010 and features support from partners such as DST Global. Valar Ventures has been increasingly dipping its toes in crypto startups and is also an investor in trading app Robinhood.

Riding on the growing popularity and acceptance of crypto not to mention the crypto bull market that often increases the revenue of crypto market-infrastructure providers Bitpanda's latest round is a step forward from its Series A round nine months ago when the startup raised $52 million.

According to Bitpanda CEO Eric Demuth the company has been profitable for the past four years of its existence thus highlighting to investors a notable ambition for the company's aim at becoming Europe's leading cryptocurrency payment and exchange platform.

“We are profitable and we have been for four years but in September we changed strategy and wanted to become ‘the’ investment platform for all Europe” Demuth said.

The Bitpanda CEO also noted that the company is looking for more partners to access more capital and top talent. In terms of quality of services Bitpanda is considered to be a reputable and fast service not to mention a cheap alternative for crypto traders and investors.

Fireblocks

The first quarter of 2021 also saw crypto and blockchain infrastructure provider Fireblocks raise $133 million in its Series C funding round.

The startup which helps companies by removing the complexities of working with digital assets has gone further and added $310 million after its Series D round on July 27th.

Fireblocks' most recent fundraising has catapulted the company's valuation to $2.2 billion in just five months. Considering its latest financing the New York-based startup has managed to raise a total of $489 million since its inception.

Fireblocks has seen its user base grow since the start of the year from about 150 to 500 clients. In addition the company’s annual recurring revenue has also increased by more than 300% in the last two quarters of 2021.

The firm's CEO and co-founder Michael Shaulov said that they “expect to end the year up 500%.”

Considering the company’s annual recurring revenue in 2020 saw an increase of 450% compared to 2019 2021 has seen a valuation boost for the company.

“We’ve already adjusted our revenue prediction for 2021 three times” adds Shaulov in regards to the boosted valuation.

Bakkt

After going public via a merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings in January 2021 Bakkt's valuation was set at $2.1 billion.

The Bitcoin futures exchange backed by Boston Consulting Group and Microsoft received $207 million in cash and an additional $325 million from other investors not to mention $50 million from Intercontinental Exchange.

The money raised by Bakkt is expected to finance the company’s move toward a focus on consumer applications for digital assets. According to reports more than 400000 customers had pre-registered for the Bakkt app as the platform supports more than 30 loyalty programs.

The company offers crypto trading and payments features with a fully regulated Bitcoin derivatives futures and options market.

CoinDCX

Recently Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX announced that it has raised $90 million in a Series C funding round.

The Mumbai-based startup will go down in history as India's first crypto business to reach unicorn status following the investment round that was led by B Capital Ground as well as the participation of Block.one Polychain Jump Capital and Coinbase Ventures.

So far CoinDCX has gathered more than 3.5 million users with intentions of using the funds from its latest fundraising to speed up the user onboarding process up to 50 million users in India.

In an announcement CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta said that the firm “will be joining hands or enter into partnerships with key fintech players to expand the crypto investor base set up a Research and Development (R&D) facility strengthening the policy conversations through public discourse working with the government to introduce favorable regulations education and amping up hiring initiatives.”

This move by CoinDCX comes at a time of great regulatory uncertainty from the Indian government in regard to it stance on cryptocurrencies. While regulatory framework proposals have been submitted by various market players the Indian government has long condemned the use of crypto.

Blockchain.com

Formerly known as Blockchain.info Blockchain.com is a widely popular crypto wallet and exchange that has grown significantly since its early inception back in 2011.

Boasting over $800 billion in crypto transactions to date Blockchain.com raised $120 million in a funding round bringing the platform’s value over $1 billion.

Blockchain.com started as a blockchain explorer that allows access to Bitcoin's (BTC) blockchains and all its transactional data ranging from fees to the number of confirmations for each transaction as well as wallet addresses.

The platform currently serves over 30 million active users and has since seen its user base triple over the past year. Blockchain.com has developed support for the exploration and exchange of other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin.

Soon after raising $120 million Blockchain.com proceeded to raise another $300 million in March setting its value at a whopping $5.2 billion. This was part of the company's Series C round that saw the participation of venture capital firms such as DST Global VY Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Institutional capital ready to dip toes in crypto

With every bust and boom cycle of Bitcoin the crypto market will continue to grow as market experts predict that the unicorn herd is set to expand even further in 2021.

Early birds and first movers in the crypto space are starting to reap their fortunes after years of toil through the many phases of crypto volatility.

As more firms continue to reach unicorn status evidence of the crypto market moving slowly but surely into maturity has become evident. There is a clear increase in the flow of institutional capital into the crypto space and with that it is only a matter of time before crypto goes mainstream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbWFyay13YWhsYmVyZy1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXBhaWQtMzAtbWlsbGlvbi1uZXRmbGl4LXNwZW5zZXItY29uZmlkZW50aWFsLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Wahlberg Reportedly Got Paid $30 Million for Netflix's 'Spenser Confidential',"Mark Wahlberg was paid $30 million for his starring role in the 2020 Netflix action comedy ‘Spenser Confidential’ according to a new report.

As the enemy seized province after province government soldiers shed their uniforms and ran. On paper the army had hundreds of thousands of well-equipped fighters. In reality its few loyal commanders had to buy ammunition from crooked supply officers and pay in cash for artillery support. The special forces fought well but regular troops were often commanded by politicians’ incompetent relatives. Soldiers went unpaid as officials pilfered military budgets. Citizens stayed loyal to their families and clans not to a corrupt government that was as likely to shake them down as to help them. The state was a Potemkin village constructed to please its American sponsors. When they left it fell.

So it went in South Vietnam in 1975 and again last week in Afghanistan. The similarities between the two collapses are striking. They go beyond intelligence failures mendacious speeches and abandoned allies. Ultimately both states fell because they had been hollowed out by corruption an ancient disease of governance to which America’s nation-building projects are prone. (Think also of Iraq Kosovo Bosnia and Haiti.) Political scholars once considered corruption a minor issue but many now see it as crucial to understanding not just why America’s proxies fail but how states work in general.",,,,,,

Jamshedpur Aug 21: The placements for the batch of 2018-22 at the Adityapur-based National Institute of Technology ( NIT ) began on an impressive note.

Initial figures suggest that the tech cradle of national repute is heading for another successful placement year.

Data available from the institute’s Training and Placement Cell revealed that in the last one fortnight ever since the online recruitment process began at the end of July around 120 students from various streams of engineering bagged plum jobs.

The batch-size for placement comprises over 500 students.

Placement of over 100 students within a fortnight of the beginning of the recruitment process is a record in the history of NIT. And this has happened against odds- the Covid-induced pandemic and lockdown restrictions in the state and other parts of the country.

Samsung R&D Bangalore’s Rs 35 lakh annual package stood out as the best offer so far for the batch. The second best offer of Rs 32.20 lakh was that of e-tailer giant Amazon.

Deloitte a leading MNC which provides consultancy topped the list of mass recruiters.

It recruited 33 students offering them an annual salary package of Rs 8.6 lakhs.

Amazon emerged as the second mass recruiter. It headhunted 32 candidates from various streams.

Business applications company Tekion by selecting 24 students emerged as the third mass recruiter offering the candidates an annual package of Rs 30 lakh per annum.

Qualcomm a US-based MNC took 14 students offering them an annual salary package of Rs 23 lakh.

Lowe’s India a business analytics company selected nine students offering them an annual CTC of Rs 19.34 lakh.

Exxon Mobil a petroleum and chemical manufacturing company took eight students offering them an annual salary of Rs 11.5 lakh.

The average CTC of computer science students was more than Rs 25 lakh per annum while the average CTC of electronics and communications engineering stream was more than Rs 22 lakh per annum. The overall CTC was more than Rs 17 lakh per annum.

Professor-in-charge of NIT’s Training and Placement Cell Prahlad Prasad said ” The placement process begun well. It was a record of sorts as this was for the first time over 100 students got recruited in such a short period of time.”

He went on to say that the companies which so far participated in the placement process were recruiting more students compared to last year.

” The placement process will continue for one year. We are expecting the participation of around 160 companies. Looking at the current trend of recruitments we are hopeful of achieving 90 per cent placements by October” he added.

Gunjan Kumar a B.Tech student who completed his internship at Intuit and was offered an annual salary package of Rs 35 lakh thanked the placement cell.

“All credits go to the training and placement cell team for this remarkable achievement. The constant motivation and guidance of our director Prof. K K Shukla also resulted in this year’s record placement so far with good salary offers” he said.

Gunjan was born and brought up in Ranchi. His father Vinay Kumar is a lab technician and his mother Shiwani Kumari Mehta works as a teacher in a government school.

Beyer

For the Victorville Daily Press

One great thing about traveling (actually there are many great things) is learning new stuff. Everyone should like learning new stuff. If not stay in bed.

Being a meatasaurus I occasionally enjoy a good buffalo burger fries and a cold libation for lunch. I learned in Custer State Park however that I was wrong — it’s bison not buffalo I’m consuming.

It seems many people myself included have mistakenly believed buffalo and bison are one in the same. After all both animals are big and both have big heads — not as big as those on Mount Rushmore but bigger than the average cloven-hooved herbivore.

From my research when the first Europeans stepped foot on the soil we now call the United States roughly 60 million of these big-headed bovines roamed the plains. Since the explorers had never seen a bison they assumed the foreign animals were like the South Asian water buffalo or the African Cape buffalo.

But here are the differences: Bison have a hump near the shoulders and buffalo don’t. The hump allows the bison’s head to act as a plow in the deep snow of the American plains during the long winters. Both bison and buffalo sport horns but the bison’s horns are shorter and sharper than the buffalo’s. The best difference though is the pretty cool beards bison grow. Buffalo by contrast can’t seem to grow anything but a couple of stray hairs on their chinny-chin-chins.

“Dude that is one hipster-length beard you got going” a buffalo was once heard saying to a bison.

“I’m also an artist” replied the bison.

“Goes without saying bro” the buffalo said.

And so traveling into South Dakota taught Laureen and me the tasty burgers we enjoy so much are bison burgers.

Anyway don’t get me started on the difference between buffalo wings and chicken wings. I’ve seen chickens fly but have not yet not seen a buffalo or bison take to the skies — a vision that could cause nightmares for the rest of my life.

Custer State Park is huge offering over 71000 acres of green grasslands sparkling lakes and rivers and tall trees dotting the hillsides. It’s South Dakota’s first and largest state park established in 1913 as a state Forest and Game Preserve.

The park is named after General George Armstrong Custer who spent his 1874 summer on an Army expedition in the area. This is rather ironic since the park isn’t far from the Crazy Horse Memorial.

Yes that Crazy Horse. The same who led a group of warriors against Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn — Battle of the Greasy Grass to the Lakota — in 1876. The whole thing ended very badly for the soldiers of Custer’s 7th Cavalry.

“I’d say that is a bit ironic” Laureen said.

“And the town of Custer isn’t far either” I said.

“That too is ironic.”

Ironic or not the large plot of land is beautiful to drive through. For that purpose an 18-mile road meanders through the park’s vastness. It’s a leisurely loop that allows visitors ample opportunity to see nature at its best: Trees being trees. Rivers being rivers. Creeks being creeks.

The point is made. There’s a chance too to see all sorts of wildlife thus the road’s name the Wildlife Loop.

Approximately 1500 bison roam all over the place and it takes a long time to count each one.

“Let’s see 1301 1302... Hey lookie a coyote” the official bison counter said. “Where was I? Shoot. One two…”

Other critters viewable from the loop include mule deer white tail deer river otters cougars pronghorn sheep Sasquatches and my ever-elusive nemesis: Bighorn sheep.

We saw all sorts of animals but no bighorn sheep. I believe I heard a couple of them laughing at me while I drove through a thicket of trees though it could have been the wind.

“He’ll think it was the wind” Ms. Bighorn said laughing.

Starting on Needles Highway (not the one on Route 66 near the Colorado River) we entered the park through marvelous and strange-looking rock structures. The towering pieces of granite and metamorphic rock form all sorts of twisted needles that point skyward. In fact they are referred to as the Cathedral Spires. The road is nearly two miles of narrow twisty asphalt that’s not for the faint of heart.

I discovered that these rocks were formed more than 2 billion years ago during the Precambrian Era. The granite that makes up the Cathedral Spires formed far beneath the Earth’s surface via magma as it slowly cooled and solidified.

Not exactly sure what that means but it’s science and backed by a bald man holding a hairless cat.

“Yes liquid hot magma was the key.”

We drove the loop navigating this hairpin and that hairpin through the needle-rock formations. It was as if we’d ventured to another planet. I kept expecting Captain Kirk around the next bend smiling that smile at Laureen.

I drove on.

Entering the green grasslands allowed us a chance to really see the enormity of this state park. Deer pranced. Elk danced. And mule deer stared. It seemed all the animals were told to be out during the day for us fee-paying tourists. It was beautiful.

Then we saw what we came to see with our own little eyes: Dozens upon dozens of bison walked here and there a couple miles southeast of Gordon Stockade.

These great big bison covered the hills. I followed a line of looky-loos onto a dirt path for a closer uh look.

It should be noted that signs posted everywhere in and outside the park warn visitors not to pet the furry cows.

As we slowed and got within a few feet of one bison the warning seemed legit. One massive bull moved up to a car next to us and started rubbing his goateed chin on the vehicle’s hood. Soon that wasn’t enough. The rest of his really big head got into the action. The car moved up and down and sideways too but he wasn’t done.

A tongue that must’ve been 30 feet in length slithered out and he started tasting the paint on that very hood which he had just spent the last few minutes massaging. The women in the vehicle must’ve thought it was funny at first since they were easily seen laughing.

That laughter stopped however when another bull approached looked at his brother bison and started the same routine. At that moment the women looked terrified.

“Maybe you should get out and shoo them away?” I asked Laureen.

She didn’t respond as she sat snapping photographs. I remained behind the wheel as any safety-minded driver would.

Five minutes later the bulls moved to greener pastures to the west of the road. The women escaped with their lives and a great story) albeit with a concave hood.

Fifteen minutes later all the bison had moved on and the traffic snarl ended. We were relieved. I wasn’t sure our rental car had bison insurance.

Later we found ourselves on the Iron Mountain Road heading north toward the tunnels that lead out of the park. Again there were twists and turns but nothing like the Needles Highway. Colorful rock strata showed us how this part of the country formed over millions if not billions of years. Custer State Park must be a hotbed for geologists.

As we exited the last narrow rock-carved tunnel the Mount Rushmore Memorial came into view as if framed by the tunnel itself. Breathtaking.

It was a great place to be in a rental car with our four canine companions. They slept almost the whole three hours it took us to drive through the park. It brought back memories of when Laureen and I traveled with our daughters when they were young.

Ah the memories of vacationing.

In 1917 South Dakota Gov. Peter Norbeck said “The state forest and game preserve will continue to be a place of increasing interest. It is a place of beauty and it is an inspiring sight to see our native wild game gazing quietly along the wayside.”

No better words could define Custer State Park. It’s a place of beauty serenity and nature at its best.

It’s definitely worth the drive — concave hood or not.

The former site of the city’s thriving iron ore industry has been completely transformed into a verdant forested oasis. And did you know there are three treehouses hidden throughout the park? Rising high above the treetop canopy these wooden structures offer fantastic views of the city and deep Alabama woods below. Here’s how to find and experience the whimsy of all three.

Haskell’s Hideaway

The most popular of Red Mountain’s three treehouses Haskell’s Hideaway is a 1.37-mile hike from the welcome center up the Smythe Trail then west. You can also access it from the Skyhy Ridge Walk trail that runs across the northern expanse of the park. Cross a long swinging bridge to a circular platform built around a tall tree soaring high into the sky. It’s the perfect viewing platform and a wonderful place for a picnic.

Riley’s Roost

Riley’s Roost is a little closer to Red Mountain’s main entrance at only 1.10 miles away via Shook Trail. Follow a twisted wooden bridge not of the swinging variety to a treehouse similar to Haskell’s Hideaway. One of the best things about Riley’s Roost is its adjoining hammock area where you can literally swing from the treetops.

Rushing Rendezvous

In the far eastern corner of the park you can check out the last of the Red Mountain treehouse trio. At 2.05 miles from the park’s welcome station it’s requires the longest walk but offers a huge payout in the form of gorgeous view via Grace’s Gap Overlook The treehouse and observation deck open onto a big clearing that perfectly frames a uninterrupted view of downtown Birmingham. Featuring a swinging bridge and multiple platforms there’s plenty of space to explore. If you plan to stay awhile to take in the views picnic tables overlooking the views are also available.

More to See

Once you’ve completed your treehouse tour the landmarks to see and places to explore are far from over. Here are some other must-visit spots within Red Mountain Park.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vcnZsaWZlc3R5bGUuY29tL2hpZGRlbi1nZW1zLWluLWNvbG9yYWRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Hidden Gems In Colorado,"Home » Blog » Destinations » 10 Hidden Gems in Colorado

|

From ghost towns and national parks to a psychedelic church Colorado has no shortage of unique finds and hidden gems.

I love to find places that other people do not know about. (Or at least not a lot of other people.) I have outline some of the most interesting finds I could track down in Colorado. There is something for everyone from rock climbers and history buffs to geology lovers!

The Best Hidden Gems in Colorado

The following is my guide to finding all of the beautiful and memorable places that the Centennial State has to offer! If after reading this post you'd like to read more about Colorado we got you covered there too.

What are some Cities to Visit?

Whether it is a tiny town or a big city you are sure to find some hidden gems in these Colorado places.

Elk in Estes Park

Known as the ghost town where Stephen King had an overnight stay that inspired him to write his novel The Shining this little city is big on spirit.

Whether you want to catch a glimpse of ghosts at the Stanley Hotel or see some gorgeous countryside Estes Park will not disappoint! Keep an eye out for the wandering elk!

The Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes Park is one of the 10 National Park Adventures Perfect for Winter. We recommend visiting Hidden Valley here for some great sledding. You can rent sleds have a picnic and even shake off the cold in a warming room.

Located near the breathtaking Pikes Peak this is one of the best places to take the family!

With over 60 different area attractions Colorado Springs is the perfect place for everyone. Ride a train visit a museum go to the park or take the kids (or your grandma!) to the zoo.

If you love the outdoors you can take a short hike or wander miles of trails. Or walk down the main street to find some delicious food to feed a range of palates.

If you're up for an RVing adventure you can drive to the summit of Pikes Peak. You'll have a 14150-foot view of the mountains and valley below.

The road up to Pike's Peak is very nice but there are some hairpin curves with little or no shoulder or guardrails. Driving up isn't really a challenge but the descent can be. There is a mandatory brake check and you'll want to use low gears to control your speed.

If you're wondering if you'd feel safe on the drive you can check out these photos and video of climbing Pikes Peak.

In the Mood for Some Hot Springs to Soak In?

You can't talk about hidden gems in Colorado and not mention hot springs. If you love a nice soak in a natural spring after a day of adventuring you will not want to miss these hot springs!

Located in the small town of Glenwood Glenwood Springs has the world's largest hot springs pool. If you love soaking in natural hot tubs this site is not to be missed!

This historic attraction offers guests three hot springs experiences to choose from.

First Glenwood Hot Springs Resort offers you access to the largest hot springs pool in the world.

Second located in close proximity to where the Colorado River flows the Iron Mountain Hot Springs opened in 2015 features 16 different soaking pools as well as a family pool.

Finally there is the Yampah Spa and Vapor Caves. This geothermal attraction is the only one of these natural wonders in all of North America! You can experience a natural (not man-made) geothermal steam bath. Sit in one of three underground chambers while mineral-rich steam envelops your body.

Visitors can find this hot springs spot nestled inside a gorgeous high mountain valley about seven miles from the town of Steamboat Springs.

Featuring a spectacular mineral spring with 104-degree mineral water to wash away all of your aches and pains. Soak after adventuring or all day long while surrounded by the area's gorgeous pine forests!

This small Rocky Mountains town is located in Grand County about 95 miles outside of the Denver area. While the hot springs are one of its main attractions their natural beauty makes it a great place to relax and unwind.

In the winter Colorado residents that ski and snowboard love to come and relax their tired toes after a day on the slopes.

While in town take in the Pioneer Village Museum located in the Hot Sulphur Springs schoolhouse. Or depending on the time of year enjoy a hike in the Arapaho National Forest.

How About Some National Parks to Explore?

Colorado is home to some pretty spectacular national parks!

Located in Montezuma County in southwest Colorado this national park was once home to Ancestral Puebloans. They thrived for over 700 years living on the mesas and in cliffs spread throughout the park.

Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park

Climb down ladders to visit some of the favorites spots including cliff Palace. Take in the gorgeous views at Sun Point Overlook or look at rock carvings at the Petroglyph Point Trail.

If you love history you will love visiting this national treasure. It's the largest archaeological site in the United States!

Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve can be found in southern Colorado. The park is open year-round.

People come from all over to visit its huge dunes like Star Dune. Visitors also like to come and see Medano Creek which in the right season created a beach at the base of the dunes.

You can't miss these gorgeous mountains located in northern Colorado. For all of you geography lovers this mountain range full of forests and other alpine tundra spans the continental divide!

Advanced sportsmen will love rock climbing the Keyhole Route which is a climb that crosses vertical facing rocks.

For a smaller adventure enjoy hiking the trail around Bear Lake or viewing Long's Peak the tallest mountain in the park.

Whatever adventure you choose you'll understand what John Denver meant by his song Rocky Mountain High.

Want More Unique Hidden Gems in Colorado?

The following are a few other attractions you might like to see when traveling through the great state of Colorado.

If you like to see places that are off the beaten path then take a side trip to see Bishop's Castle. It is one of Colorado's best hidden gems. This interesting attraction does attract a lot of visitors but has a unique and interesting history.

For almost 60 years Jim Bishop has been constructing his dream. An impressive monument built from iron and stone this castle is impressive.

Take a tour to see soaring towers and bridges with some of the best views around. And don't miss the Grand Ballroom and fire-breathing dragon.

The best part is it is free of charge! Truly click through to see it as you really need to see the images!

Located in Denver this may be the most colorful churches in the world. Inspired by psychedelic art the chapel headquarters were painted by contemporary artists.

The building was converted and opened in 2017 and houses a religious organization that uses cannabis as a holy sacrament. Church members claim that cannabis can help individuals elevate to a higher understanding of “self.”

I won't comment one way or the other on their beliefs but I will say the technicolored chapel is probably unlike any other you've seen.

Decoding Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Market Leadership and Innovation: Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) stands out in the financial technology sector with its robust suite of products and services. The company's revenue growth of 5.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as reported in the latest 10-Q filing is a testament to its strong market presence and the successful adoption of its solutions by nearly 1000 banks and over 700 credit unions. This growth is further bolstered by JKHY's strategic focus on innovation as evidenced by its significant investments in research and development which amounted to $35993 for the quarter. These investments are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and fostering long-term customer relationships.

ADVERTISEMENT

Financial Health and Profitability: JKHY's financial health is a cornerstone of its strength with a solid balance sheet and an increase in net income to $87099 for the third quarter up from $81549 in the prior year. This financial stability is supported by a disciplined approach to cost management as seen in the total expenses of $426463 which have been effectively controlled in relation to the revenue growth. The company's profitability is not only a sign of operational efficiency but also provides the necessary capital to reinvest in growth initiatives and shareholder returns.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Financial Sector Clients: A primary weakness for JKHY is its reliance on the financial sector with a customer base predominantly composed of banks and credit unions. While this focus has contributed to the company's deep expertise and strong market position it also exposes JKHY to sector-specific risks such as regulatory changes and economic downturns that disproportionately affect the financial industry. Diversifying its client portfolio could mitigate this risk and provide more stability during industry fluctuations.

Increasing Operating Expenses: Despite robust revenue growth JKHY's operating expenses have also risen with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This uptick in expenses particularly in selling general and administrative costs which climbed by 7.0% may squeeze margins if not carefully managed. JKHY must continue to seek efficiencies and control costs to maintain its profitability and invest in strategic areas.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in the financial services industry presents significant opportunities for JKHY. By continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence JKHY can offer innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of its clients. The company's commitment to research and development as indicated by the $35993 investment in the third quarter positions it well to capitalize on these technological trends and expand its product offerings.

Market Expansion: JKHY has the opportunity to expand its market reach by targeting larger financial institutions and exploring international markets. With its strong product portfolio and expertise in the financial sector JKHY can leverage its reputation to attract a broader clientele. Additionally strategic partnerships or acquisitions could accelerate this expansion and introduce JKHY's solutions to new customer segments.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The financial technology industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. JKHY faces the threat of emerging fintech startups and established technology firms that are expanding their financial services offerings. To remain competitive JKHY must continue to innovate and differentiate its products while delivering exceptional customer service.

Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns can significantly impact JKHY's client base leading to reduced spending on technology solutions and services. The company's dependence on the financial sector makes it vulnerable to such macroeconomic factors. JKHY must maintain a strong financial position and adapt its offerings to help clients navigate challenging economic conditions.

In conclusion Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) exhibits a strong financial performance with notable revenue and net income growth. The company's strategic investments in technology and product development position it well to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities. However JKHY must address its reliance on the financial sector and manage operating expenses to mitigate weaknesses and threats. By continuing to focus on innovation and market expansion JKHY is poised to maintain its leadership in the financial technology space and deliver value to its stakeholders.

She commissioned a song cycle that would be performed for her husband Charles an avid opera fan. But the people she commissioned for the job couldn’t create something that seemed right to her. So she wrote the words herself. With Charles’ help the song cycle evolved into a libretto called “Madame White Snake” based on the Chinese myth of a serpent that transforms into a woman. The tale familiar from Jacobs’ childhood in Singapore resonated with her as an immigrant who sought to break free from a conservative traditional upbringing and find her place in the United States.

“A lot of immigrant writers fall back on excavating what they know the roots that will give them some stability in terms of who they are by going back into their childhood memories into their cultural heritage” she said. “Part of my personal development was going from a girl who did not have a voice to finding that voice. And so in my mind I transformed that White Snake transformation and the fact that she was an indomitable spirit became synonymous with where I wanted to be.”

Encouraged by Charles Jacobs used her emboldened voice to cold-call Opera Boston and pitch the organization to stage the opera telling them that she realized she might seem like a crank but that it would be the best crank they would ever hear from. Indeed “Madame White Snake” premiered in Boston in February 2010 and won a 2011 Pulitzer Prize for its composer Zhou Long.

Charles died just two days before the production was staged at the Beijing Music Festival in October 2010. In tribute to him Jacobs attended the show. After mourning his loss she decided three years later to continue the creative work that they began together. As an outsider to the opera world she developed the concept for White Snake Projects a contemporary opera company that melds art and activism. Its latest production “Death by Life” which premiered online in May responds to the killing of George Floyd and features the words of incarcerated writers and a score by five black composers. Jacobs is driven to present diverse artists and reach diverse audiences as well as to use her platform to respond to current events with a social justice focus.

“Watching what is happening over the last four years and continuing into the present has been extremely stressful” she said. “There are so many issues that weigh on us today that require that people who make art or craft music put a different lens on it. So [activism has] become an imperative for us.”

Last year White Snake Projects pivoted from live opera to virtual performance with “Alice in the Pandemic” with a libretto by Jacobs. Credit: White Snakes Project

Jacobs came to the U.S. with her first husband when he was offered a position at Michigan State University. Though described by her parents as “rebellious” and “a handful” when she was younger as a newcomer to the U.S. Jacobs “was totally intimidated by all my American colleagues” she recalled. “They always seemed to be able to give an opinion about something whereas I never spoke back.” In Singapore she’d seen the hardships faced by women who couldn’t support themselves so she sought the financial security of a legal career becoming a partner with Goodwin Procter and serving as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. attorney’s office. One of the few female Asian American litigators at the time she faced the challenge of asserting herself in a courtroom against expectations and stereotypes.

“The fact that we can have a free conversation about everything that’s wrong is what makes this country right.”

Even though she has transitioned away from the law her career as an attorney helped hone her writing skills. Every word matters when you want to persuade a judge or jury she said. The words she chooses also matter for her mission now — to captivate an audience and effect change in society. Her heart sometimes breaks over the injustice she sees in the United States yet she can’t imagine living anywhere else: “The fact that we can have a free conversation about everything that’s wrong is what makes this country right” said Jacobs. She will continue to initiate those conversations. Because as she has learned how can anybody who has a voice not use it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvcmkub3JnLzIwMjEtOC0xOS1wcmljZWxlc3Mtc3BhY2Utd2hlcmUtbGFuZC1tZWV0cy1zZWEtaXMtc2xvd2x5LWRyb3duaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priceless Space Where Land Meets Sea is Slowly Drowning,"“To stand at the edge of the sea to sense the ebb and flow of the tides to feel the breath of a mist moving over a great salt marsh to watch the flight of shore birds that have swept up and down the surf lines of the continents for untold thousands of years to see the running of the old eels and the young shad to the sea is to have knowledge of things that are as nearly eternal as any earthly life can be.” — Rachel Carson

Rhode Island’s salt marshes are magical places. They are where land meets sea liminal areas where you can hear both the chirping of crickets and the caw of seagulls. Oysters and mussels sit warm in the brackish mud.

The Jacob’s Point Preserve on the Bristol-Warren line is one of these special places. It is the flagship property of the Warren Land Conservation Trust.

It was a breezy but warm fall morning and Scott Ruhren senior director of conservation for the Audubon Society of Rhode Island walked along the boardwalk that leads toward the 37.6-acre marsh which sits between the East Bay Bike Path and the Warren River.

As we walked he pointed out various native and invasive plants the skeletons of tupelo trees that remain after a 10-mile brushfire ripped through the marsh in 2008 and an old farming path that tramples through the rushing phragmites.

When we meandered into the coastal flatlands of the marsh Ruhren stepped off the path and headed over to a patch of rusty-red sea pickle. “This is edible” he said picking a few ends of the succulent plant. “It has a salty flavor and turns this beautiful red in the fall.”

Seaside goldenrod bends in the ocean breeze and Ruhren spotted what he thought could be the elusive and endangered saltmarsh sparrow flitting through cordgrass.

“This is one of the spots they’re doing incredibly well” he said. “But if the salt marshes go away and sea level rises faster it could disappear. It’s a sad story.”

But the saltmarsh sparrow isn’t the only species in danger if sea levels continue their accelerated rise. You see salt marshes are more than just diverse brackish ecosystems. They are more than stinky slimy mucky patches of water-land. They are also natural buffers that protect land from sea. They’re priceless.

“From a sea-level rise standpoint they absorb tons of energy” Ruhren said. “We have a couple coastal refugees around the state and after big storms like Sandy or Irene people always think the salt marshes are going to be wiped out but the natural salt marshes survive those events better than human landscapes. For example when Misquamicut was wiped out a lot of the buildings were gone but the marsh itself absorbed the impact. So it’s like the first line of defense for the inland habitats.”

But this defense is at risk. As sea levels rise and as human development hardens the land along the coast salt marshes are running out of room to adapt. They are on a path toward functional extinction. As they drown the vital services they provide — habitat storm buffering and carbon sequestration — will also disappear.

In fact the loss of coastal wetlands is one of the biggest causes of permanent landscape alteration in the United States. Rhode Island for example has already lost more than 50 percent of its original salt marsh habitats during the past two centuries because of human activities.

“We’re dealing with two things with salt marshes in Rhode Island” Ruhren said. “It’s all the manmade issues and disturbances and then the lack of sediment building up in the marsh like it normally would which is compounded by more frequent storms and sea-level rise.”

Salt marshes are getting squeezed out with sea water encroaching on one side and humans on the other. And Jacob’s Point while a relatively healthy example of a salt marsh has a history of human-induced degradation.

“The path that the Warren Land Trust uses to get out to the water was actually built by a landowner who lived up hill and he used to bring a seaplane in and bring in supplies that way” Ruhren said. “That path led to a lot of the problems on the marsh because there were stone culverts — probably early 20th century — and one by one the stone culverts started to collapse … and created an impoundment on the south side of the marsh. And what you want in a salt marsh is that twice day flushing of the salt water. If you don’t get that you start to get the degradation.” Development in and around salt marshes impairs their ability to naturally move when waters rise.

Another sign of human meddling that could have impacts in the future is the sprawling private neighborhood development up the hill from the salt marsh. Also called Jacob’s Point it’s an example of the hardening of the shoreline an area once wild being taken over by cookie-cutter houses with manicured chemical-green lawns.

It’s quite the contrast to the wild unkempt scraggle of the salt marsh below.

“I always like to use Connecticut as an analogy” Ruhren said. “When you drive up [Interstate] 95 they pretty much have a hardened shoreline all the way up. We’re trying to avoid that.”

To combat the further loss of these important coastal ecosystems various state agencies have worked together to assess and save salt marshes. In 2016 the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) released a Rhode Island Salt Marsh Monitoring and Assessment Program (SMMAP) that “presents a strategy for developing a comprehensive statewide monitoring and assessment program.”

In essence SMMAP is triage for salt marshes.

“A lot of the salt marshes have been assessed to try to determine which ones are worth saving” Ruhren said. “Because one that is so horribly degraded well it doesn’t pay to work on it.”

Besides building modern culverts and enhancing marsh elevation with dredge materials the best way humans can reverse the wrong we have wrought on salt marshes — and in the process help our species survive — is simple: preserve land.

“Ideally the best thing to do is to save land and land right from the marsh which is not always possible because it’s such a built-up shoreline” Ruhren said. “That allows for salt marsh migration because salt marshes naturally move and with sea-level rise if they don’t have a place to move inland they’re just going to be squashed and shrink and shrink more.”

They got the first one by themselves drafting Josh Jacobs in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.

In March Las Vegas landed Kenyan Drake in free agency. Earlier this month the Raiders signed BJ Emmons.

Jacobs advocated for those acquisitions.

“Players know players” Las Vegas coach Jon Gruden said on Tuesday. “P-L-A-Y-E-R-S. I call them players. They know players. Some of the guys I meet are ‘playahs.’ P-L-A-Y-A-H-S. When you got a real player that puts forth as much effort as -- and I mean relentless effort -- that Jacobs does he knows who works he knows who’s got talent he knows who’s tough because he’s top-of-the-line in all those categories so we listen to him.”

Emmons entered the NFL this offseason as an undrafted rookie from Florida Atlantic. But in 2016 Emmons and Jacobs were freshmen at Alabama.

In his first action for the Raiders last week Emmons ran for 45 yards and a touchdown on nine carries in Las Vegas’ 20-7 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in its preseason opener.

“This Emmons kid he went to Alabama” Gruden said after the game. “Jacobs is like his agent because Josh knew him in Tuscaloosa and he says ‘You better get a good look at this guy.’ And boy did we get a look at him tonight.

“He’s interesting. He’s big he’s fast he’s elusive and he’s got no mileage on him. He’s an unknown. He’s off to a good start also.”

Trey Ragas another undrafted rookie running back ran for 62 yards and one touchdown on 13 carries for the Raiders against the Seahawks.

Jacobs said Emmons and Ragas have a lot going for them and he’s helping coach up the rookies.

“They both nice man” Jacobs said. “The thing that I’ll say impressed me the most is them coming in and just how fast they’re picking up the playbook. You could tell that they’re really locked in and want to make the team and they give everything they’ve got every day at practice.

“They’re coachable guys too. You can go over there and talk to them and tell them about a mistake they made and they don’t make it twice.”

Neither Jacobs nor Drake played in the Raiders’ first preseason game. Las Vegas visits the Los Angeles Rams at 9 p.m. CDT Saturday to continue its preseason schedule which will conclude on Aug. 29 against the San Francisco 49ers.

“I don’t know how this preseason is going to go whether I’m going to play or not” Jacobs said on Thursday “but I’m ready for the season to start.”

In his two seasons in the NFL Jacobs has run for 2215 yards and 19 touchdowns on 515 carries and caught 53 passes for 404 yards. Although Jacobs earned Pro Bowl recognition last season the Raiders signed Drake to a two-year $11 million contract. Jacobs is entering the third season of a four-year $11.933 million deal.

Drake ran for 955 yards and 10 touchdowns on 239 carries and caught 25 passes for 137 yards in 2020 for the Arizona Cardinals.

While the acquisition of Drake may affect Jacobs’ opportunities in 2021 Las Vegas’ No. 1 running back wanted Drake on the team and envisions him as a key component to a breakthrough season for the Raiders.

“The sky’s the limit honestly” Jacobs said. “You see a lot of guys creating a lot of plays. You see Kenyan catching a lot of balls coming out of the backfield making some good runs and things like that. I think if we stay healthy it’s going to be a special year for both of us.”

Special to the H-T

Editor's note: In light of the recent surge in COVID-19 rates and the rise of the delta variant the Fifth House Ensemble has suspended its planned tour which means the performance of Undertale LIVE in Bloomington on Sept. 1 has been postponed.

The video game culture began on the couch. Taking it to the stage required getting off the couch.

It's a little like Richard Wagner meets ""Candy Crush."" But for this event coming to an outdoor setting Sept. 1 you won't need a Dual Shock 4 or set of Joy-Cons.

""Undertale"" (tale about monsters under the topsoil) is one of the most acclaimed video games of the past decade with almost 4 million fans around the globe. Toby Fox all by himself developed this indie fun-wonder which tells a story filled with heart about characters filled with quirks. Fox also composed the game's unorthodox music that furthers its tales: long ago monsters got sealed underground. Fox added a surprise; players can resolve each encounter nonviolently inviting us to have empathy for those we see as different.

""Undertale"" roared into the gaming scene in 2015. People knew about Fox's previous work on web comic ""Homestuck"" but the popularity of ""Undertale"" astonished. A game of adventure it topples players’ predictions by relying on role-playing.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

But who will play Fox's remarkable score Sept. 1? To the rescue comes the distinguished Chicago-based dectet (10 members) chamber group Fifth House Ensemble.

Fifth House launches artists' careers through entrepreneurship residencies and training programs working with the top U.S. music schools including those at Yale College Eastman Indiana University (Jacobs School of Music) and San Francisco Conservatory of Music.

What does it mean to be a 21st-century musician?

""Most people love classical music and just don't know it yet"" said cellist and founding member Herine Coetzee Koschak in a Zoom interview. ""This (collaboration) is about meeting people where they are."" In fact ""Undertale"" is Fifth House's second venture with video games; in this second one the audience gets to vote.

""It's retro-style"" Koschak said. ""And there's a lot of 8-bit (video games) in it. Fox' score is a blast to play. We use a lot of iPads.""

Alain Barker director of the Jacobs School of Music’s Community Engagement Initiative the program that is hosting the event said the program acknowledges the power and popularity of game theory. ""We are reimagining classical music in today's culture. Over the past 20 years we've been seeking ways to respond to trends and new audiences.""

IU grad and the initiative's lead administrator Lauren Bishop who along with Barker is collaborating with Fifth House left musical theater. Her new career is in vocal and audio engineering and business. ""We're going off the beaten path with this project. It's innovation through music.""

The Initiative improves lives in rural Indiana by connecting communities with the arts. The initiative allows Jacobs faculty and students to find solutions for problems facing rural communities.

Praised by The New York Times for its “conviction authority and finesse” the Chicago-based Fifth House Ensemble goes beyond chamber music to reach past what many people see as classical music's limits. The ensemble attracts theater groups video-game designers corporate innovators and folk bands to tell stories.

Reaching 17000 students each year through its educational programs Fifth House connects K-12 core curricula to custom-crafted interactive musical experiences. Students can not just share but lead.

But the name: ""Fifth House."" Turns out it's easier to say than the original (horoscopic) name ""Eleventh House"" Koschak said. Just as solfeggi (do re mi) is supposed to be easier to sing than the corresponding one two three simple pronunciation works. If you can say it you might remember to go to the (free) concert.

If you go

WHAT: ""Undertale LIVE"" at Indiana University. More than a concert a meeting place where fans join the quest by voting on each show’s storyline. Fifth House Ensemble Chicago-based lauded chamber group will play Toby Fox's score. For kids too. Hosted by IU Jacobs School of Music’s Community Engagement Initiative.

WHEN: 7 p.m. Sept. 1.

WHERE: Outdoor venue to be announced.

You’ve talked a lot with him through these negotiations. Do you agree with that?

I don’t know if I’m in any position to diagnose his mental acuity. But look I will say it’s not personal but everyone ages differently. It’s physiology or what have you. Everybody’s different. My father-in-law is the same age as Joe Biden and he acts as though he’s 20 years younger. He’s vibrant he works long days he still runs his business that he’s been running for many years. He’s on his A-game.

To be candid I don’t believe President Biden is. And it concerns me deeply. I take no pleasure in saying that because I think it’s a dangerous thing for the country. I think that our adversaries see him in the same way that many Americans do. And I think that’s a very dangerous thing for us right now because that’s why our adversaries are acting so provocatively. I believe in Reagan’s principles. He reminded us that we maintain peace through strength. And if America doesn’t project strength it’s a great concern to free people around the world. And you see the results.

Bade: What gives you the impression that Biden has lost a step a little bit with age?

You know I don’t want to violate any personal confidences or anything but I’ve had private conversations with him of course. But you don’t need to rely upon my reflection of a private conversation. You can see him in public in his public statements. And it’s important.

Lizza: One more thing about President Biden. POLITICO reported in a very important investigation that billions of dollars from Biden’s four big 2021 and 2022 legislative packages remain unspent. Have you thought about clawing back that unspent money from those four bills and what you might spend it on?

Well the principle of clawing back unspent dollars is an easy yes. But of course the devil’s in the details. I’m not sure what categories those are what accounts they’re in what it was dedicated for. If we have the ability to claw it back we could certainly use that money.

Right now we’ve got $35.5 trillion in federal debt. And we’re working every day on restoring the principles of fiscal sanity here. One of the things we’re trying to do for example is break up the governance by omnibus. We got a first stab at it. We broke the last spending package into two minibuses. And now we’re going to actually endeavor to do 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.

Bade: How are you going to do that when a bunch of your members are sinking rules left and right? You weren’t able to do all 12 bills last time. What makes you think you can this year?

Well the reason I’m such an optimist about this is because I handle this situation and this challenge like every other. We’re going to set up listening sessions when we get back next week to have everybody come in. We’ll begin with the topline spending numbers build consensus on that.

We’re going to do something that’s also innovative: We’re going to start with an actual number that everybody can agree to on the front end not waste time negotiating that. Then the appropriators can begin their process methodically taking each of the bills working that through the committee process.

I met with Tom Cole who’s our Appropriations chair and he says “We can do that.” We can produce those bills by the end of the summer and get them ready for movement on the floor. We’d like to do that and get it through the House and send it over to the Senate and then dare Chuck Schumer not to do his job. I think that that would be fun for the House to jam the Senate for a change.

Want to read more stories like this? POLITICO Weekend delivers gripping reads smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun every Friday. Sign up for the newsletter.

Bade: Tom Cole said that you were going to mark up the bills at the levels that have already been negotiated with Democrats not try to do this thing that McCarthy did where you cut like $100 billion or some such. Again you think conservatives are going to vote for appropriations bills at that level?

Well I can tell you I’ve talked to a number of House Freedom Caucus members Chip Roy and others and many of them have already said it’s the number that was already negotiated. I think it’s $1.606 or $1.621 trillion.

But there is a number that everyone has already agreed to. The thing that people rejected last time was the so-called “side deals” and “gimmicks” and all the other stuff on the outside.

Lizza: We want to ask you about some of your fellow leaders in Congress. Let’s start with Hakeem Jeffries the House Democratic leader. Like you he’s a religious man. Have you gotten to know Jeffries as a brother in Christ?

I have. Hakeem is a good man. We’ve worked well together. We have a lot more in common than people might think. You know he’s from New York and I’m from Louisiana. While we have lots of disagreements on policies and the fine points of policy I think you can appreciate people for who they are as a person. I think that’s what we’re called to do. And he and I both kind of share the worldview on that. I can appreciate that he’s a good family man. We have a lot in common in that regard. And he lost his father recently I lost mine three days before I got elected to Congress. We’ve talked about that.

We’ve talked about how he and I both came to our leadership positions in a rather circuitous fashion that neither of us predicted or expected in terms of timing and how we would be elevated as we were. He’s been here a little bit longer than I have been. But there are things that we have in common.

And I think what we’ve appreciated about one another is that I believe that when Hakeem Jeffries is telling me something I believe he’s telling me the truth. I believe he is a man of his word. And I think he believes that about me as well. That’s a big thing in Washington. You know trust is a rare commodity around here.

While we don’t agree on many things it’s really refreshing to sit across the table from someone who is your political adversary and know that they’re shooting straight. I wish that we could have a lot more of that around here because it would solve a lot of problems. Look I’m a Reagan Republican. I love the way he did the job. He was a happy warrior you know?

He was a hero to all of us. I think to all Republicans he’s still the standard-bearer. And the reason is because of the way he did the job. He’s very principled. But he didn’t hate anybody right?

Reagan and [Democratic Speaker] Tip O’Neill famously had this great relationship. And after his assassination attempt Tip O’Neill goes to the hospital and kisses him on the forehead. They didn’t agree on almost anything but they had respect for one another. And I think we’ve got to get back to that. I think America needs more of that.

The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy. They’re a fellow American. Our enemies are like Hamas and Hezbollah and the people who are trying to kill us. These are our political adversaries. The Founders anticipated that you have people with very different philosophical ideas very different principles and ideas about government but we would come here sit around a table and arm wrestle together and kind of get to a point of consensus so that we can govern the country. This system doesn’t work unless you understand the principles that undergird it. And I think restoring those principles is really important for this institution to endure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvdGJpLTMtY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1pbi1qb2huc29uLWNpdHktb3ZlcmRvc2Uv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS90YmktMy1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtbXVyZGVyLWluLWpvaG5zb24tY2l0eS1vdmVyZG9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TBI: 3 charged with murder in Johnson City overdose,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjhl.com/news/crime/tbi-3-charged-with-murder-in-johnson-city-overdose/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvdGJpLTMtY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1pbi1qb2huc29uLWNpdHktb3ZlcmRvc2Uv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS90YmktMy1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtbXVyZGVyLWluLWpvaG5zb24tY2l0eS1vdmVyZG9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Bob3RvLXBlZHJvLXBhc2NhbC1kYWtvdGEtam9obnNvbi0xNDUyMDAwMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Photo of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson Kissing Passionately on the Street Has Gone Viral,"

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

Ira Acree to serve on the board of the Regional Transportation Authority after a tense hearing that focused on the problems facing public transportation in Chicago.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th Ward) and Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd Ward) were the only members of the city’s Transportation and Public Way Committee on Wednesday to vote against Acree’s nomination which advanced on a voice vote to the full City Council. A final vote could come as soon as May 22.

Acree the politically connected pastor of the Greater St. John Baptist Church on the West Side faced unusually pointed questions from alderpeople who are under increasing pressure to make significant changes to the CTA which has yet to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The system which saw its ridership plummet during the pandemic as crime and violence increased is facing a $730 million deficit in early 2026 once federal relief expires.

Acree repeatedly struggled to articulate exactly what changes he would make if confirmed to the RTA board to serve a five-year term declining to answer questions about Johnson’s specific transit agenda and how he would implement it as a member of the 16-person board charged with financial oversight. Board members earn $25000 annually and meet once per month.

Acree could not answer Waguespack’s question about how he would address that massive budget gap which has sparked proposals to merge the Chicago area’s three separate public transit agencies — the CTA suburban bus system Pace and commuter rail system Metra — into a single agency.

The fiscal cliff looming for Chicago’s public transit system has been in the spotlight for months along with efforts to make CTA bus and train service more reliable and safer.

“Well No. 1 this is my first time hearing about a $735 million shortfall” Acree said repeating the incorrect budget deficit number mentioned by Waguespack.

The proposed merger would be a “serious undertaking” with arguments on both sides of the issue Acree said.

In addition Acree declined to tell Vasquez whether he thought CTA President Dorval Carter should be fired saying he would examine his performance if confirmed.

Acree told Vasquez he drove to City Hall to appear at his confirmation hearing to sit on the board overseeing the CTA Pace and Metra — although he added that he relied on the CTA as a teen and now uses it to get to the Loop to avoid paying for parking.

“I don’t have to use CTA” Acree said. “I’m fortunate to have a car. But I use CTA often when I come downtown because even though I am a working pastor these parking tickets are super high.”

Acree who endorsed Johnson during the 2023 election after backing former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2019 said if confirmed he would use his seat on the RTA board as an extension of his work as a civil rights leader.

“Instead of holding protests I’ll be on the inside and be very instrumental in making changes” Acree said adding that his “diverse voice” and “unique skill set” will be an asset to the board.

“This is an opportunity to help my city be better” Acree said.

Acree was a thorn in the side of former Mayor Rahm Emanuel leading efforts to reform the Chicago Police Department after a White Chicago police officer murdered Laquan McDonald a Black teen in 2014.

A longtime advocate for efforts to reduce gun violence Acree delivered the benediction at the January 2023 inauguration of Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

After Johnson’s election as Chicago mayor Acree unsuccessfully applied to replace him on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. That position is now held by Commissioner Tara Stamps who won the Democratic primary in March to serve out the remaining two years of Johnson’s term.

Acree is also a close ally of the Rev. Jesse Jackson who attended Wednesday’s hearing in a very public show of support.

Acree’s nomination exposed tension between two critical parts of Johnson’s political base: progressive Chicagoans who have championed public transportation as a critical function of city government and Black Chicagoans who wish to see longtime leaders elevated to positions of power.

Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th Ward) and Ald. Michelle Harris (8th Ward) passionately defended Acree’s nomination telling committee members that Acree would represent Black Chicagoans who live on the South and West sides.

Taliaferro said it was “absolutely wrong” to say that Acree was unqualified to serve on the RTA board despite his lack of transit experience or expertise.

“I need someone who is going to stand up for my community” said Taliaferro who proposed renaming a Chicago street after Acree in 2016. That proposal never came to a vote and the City Council soon after changed the rules to prevent the brown and white signs from honoring living people.

Acree is Johnson’s third appointee to the boards that oversee the city's public transportation systems and the second West Side pastor tapped by the mayor to oversee Chicago’s buses and trains without having transit-specific experience.

Without debate the City Council in April confirmed Johnson’s appointment of pastor Michael Eaddy to the CTA board. Like Acree Eaddy has no record on transit issues.

Johnson’s first pick for the CTA board urban planner and transit advocate Roberto Requejo took his seat Wednesday. Requejo served as the executive director of Elevated Chicago which advocates for residential and commercial developments designed to encourage residents to use public transportation.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2NvdmlkLXBwcC1sb2FuLWZvcmdpdmVuZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks Are Opting Out of the Government's PPP Loan Forgiveness Process,"At least three major banks have decided to opt out of a new process for getting Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven directly by the Small Business Administration The Intercept has learned leaving their small business customers with no other recourse if the banks refuse to forgive loans or drag out the process.

Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and PNC have all decided to opt out according to emails shared with The Intercept.

They are major players in the program which Congress created to offer businesses loans to spend on payroll and other qualified expenses to help weather the shutdowns. As of the end of May JPMorgan Chase was the top PPP lender followed by Bank of America in the No. 2 spot; PNC is No. 11. All told lenders representing just half of all outstanding PPP loan forgiveness applications have opted in according to the SBA.

PNC recently sent an email to Jesse Grund owner of personal training studio Unconventional Strength in Orlando Florida saying “Considering we have already built a streamlined end-to-end digital portal and associated review process for your PPP forgiveness application; we will be opting out of using the SBA’s forgiveness portal.”

Grund still hasn’t had his $5000 PPP loan forgiven and was instead told by PNC that his “Correct Maximum Loan Amount” was just $917 leaving him on the hook for the rest. “It’s PNC’s fault I got this money” he said. “Now you guys want to come back at me for it.”

Early in the pandemic small business owners were urged to flock to the Paycheck Protection Program. The loans were made with the promise that they would be forgiven and essentially turned into grants if used properly.

But many small business owners have struggled to get their loans forgiven by the banks that issued them. Banks were incentivized to issue PPP loans through the fees they generated but they don’t receive any fees to push forgiveness through and they’ve dragged their feet. Of the total PPP loans that have been issued less than half have been forgiven thus far.

In response the Small Business Administration the government agency tasked with running the program announced in late July that it would offer small business owners who took out PPP loans of $150000 or less a way to bypass intransigent banks and seek forgiveness directly from the agency. Congress had at one point late last year considered automatically forgiving all loans under $150000 but it never followed through.

But there was fine print in the SBA’s recent announcement that many may have missed: Banks actually have to opt into the direct process for small business owners to access it. And at least three major ones have refused.

“Forcing lenders to opt-in to the process could have been disruptive” said SBA spokesperson Terrence D. Clark in an email. He noted that lenders continue to opt in and that the agency is conducting outreach to encourage them to participate. “[W]e speak to lenders daily” he said. In a statement SBA Associate Administrator for the Office of Capital Access Patrick Kelley said “We encourage all lenders to opt-in to this tested portal.”

When asked for an explanation as to why the bank decided to bar its customers from the SBA’s direct forgiveness option a PNC spokesperson pointed to a statement that said “[L]enders that participate in the SBA’s forgiveness portal are still responsible for reviewing and issuing forgiveness decisions to the SBA. We would therefore still need to ensure borrowers meet loan eligibility and loan forgiveness requirements regardless of whether we chose to use the SBA forgiveness portal or not.”

Chase offered no explanation in its correspondence to its customers. In an email sent to a small business owner it said simply “[W]e’re continuing with our simple process and not participating in the new SBA direct program.” In response to a request for comment a Chase spokesperson said over email “Chase customers should submit their forgiveness applications through our platform” adding “We have a simple process that takes under 10 minutes to complete.”

For some business owners being cut off from the SBA’s direct program could mean they can’t get some or all of their loans forgiven at all. Some banks have been contacting small business owners in recent months and telling them that they shouldn’t have received the original amount they received — which the banks themselves approved — and requiring the owners to pay back the difference. But many told The Intercept that they used the money correctly and had fully expected to have their entire loans forgiven.

That’s what happened to Warren Davis owner of fundraising consultancy Warren Davis Consulting LLC who received his loan from Chase and was recently told the bank won’t let him seek forgiveness directly from the SBA. After the bank originally issued him a $6812 PPP loan he was later told he was only eligible for $1795.53 in forgiveness. Now he must pay Chase $460.01 on the first of every month with two years to pay the remainder of the loan off. “That loan payment is the second highest payment I now have besides my rent which is also due on the 1st” he said in an email. “I have tried trying to get answers numerous times from Chase with no luck over the months.”

In response to situations like Davis’s the Chase spokesperson said “Small businesses must meet the standards to qualify for forgiveness whether they go through their lender or directly through the SBA.”

When asked why Bank of America has opted out spokesperson Bill Halldin said “Because our portal is simplified and has been out there for six months” adding that if the bank opted in “we would have to develop a new interface.” The bank is reviewing whether to join the SBA’s process but “at this point our simplified portal is delivering what people want” he said.

But that portal is not delivering what Amy Yassinger needs. Yassinger owner of a music company that offers party bands for weddings in Illinois was encouraged by Bank of America to apply for a PPP loan early in the pandemic. The bank helped her with the process assuring her its underwriting team “would make sure everything was solid” she said in an email. She used the $38730 to pay employees as if they were working their regular slate of events despite widespread cancellations as well as to cover some nonpayroll expenses.

Yet 11 months after she got her loan the bank told her it would only submit $2436 to the SBA for forgiveness. “It was one thing to have my life completely gutted for over a year as my company was forced to cancel or postpone over 60 events in 2020” she said. “It is another to have Bank of America want $36000 out of $38730 back in the next 5 years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dpbGwtdGhlLW5ldy1jcm9wLW9mLWNyZWRpdC1idWlsZGVycy13b3JrLWFzLXByb21pc2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will new credit building products work as promised?,"A slew of fintechs are promising consumers that they can raise their credit scores without the need for a credit check or extensive credit history.

Varo’s credit-building program Believe will launch in the coming weeks. Chime debuted a no-interest secured credit card in June of 2020. Other companies like Extra and Grain offer revolving lines of credit that are linked to regular debit cards. MoneyLion extends a loan meant to bolster its users’ credit history. Esusu a service that reports rental payments to the credit bureaus has backing from the tennis champion Serena Williams; the NBA star Stephen Curry has invested in a startup called Kikoff .

There are other products with a niche. Step  a challenger bank touts credit-building benefits for its teen customers. Sequin a debit card that fronts money for purchases and repays itself from a linked bank account is targeted at women who founder Vrinda Gupta formerly of Visa concluded were disproportionately being rejected by credit cards or getting lower limits and higher interest rates.

Some banks have recently launched products along these lines. Others offer secured credit cards that may require a sizable upfront deposit.

All these efforts are designed to serve a wide range of customers who could benefit from boosting their credit scores from young consumers and immigrants establishing a credit history for the first time to military veterans who spent years abroad and retirees whose records may have stagnated to those recovering from past mistakes or misfortunes. And most have shortcomings or drawbacks for borrowers or for lenders which partially explains why they’re not more widely available.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s most recent report on this topic from 2015 found that 11% of the adult population in the U.S. was “credit invisible” or without records from the national credit reporting agencies and another 8.3% were “unscorable” because of insufficient or stale history.

Anecdotal evidence suggests this hasn’t changed dramatically in the past six years. “We survey our customers all the time"" and credit score help ""was one of the top two to three things they were asking for” said Aaron Plante vice president of lending products and banking strategy at Chime.

There is also room for improvement in these initiatives. Alex Johnson director of fintech research at Cornerstone Advisors says some of these products are loaded with fees and interest charges. Others such as credit-building cards or services that report rent and utility payments to the credit bureaus may not be as effective as the marketing hype leads customers to believe.

“Just because this stuff exists and could end up on a credit report doesn’t mean that a mainstream legacy lender sees the same empirical value in this information” said John Ulzheimer a credit expert witness and formerly of FICO and Equifax. “You can’t load up a credit report with gym memberships and Hulu and expect to have a FICO score of 800.”



Pros cons of credit-building tools

Credit-builder cards such as the one offered by Chime have their users set aside a sum of money each month that will be drawn upon to make payments often automatically. Unlike with traditional secured credit cards customers don’t need to hand over a large deposit initially and typically won’t need to pay interest or fees.

“The odds that they will spend more money than they have or miss a payment are extremely low” Johnson said.

Chime customers can move any amount they choose from their spending accounts to their Credit Builder secured accounts and charge up to this amount on their Credit Builder card. At the end of the month Chime automatically pays off the balance from the secured account if the customer enables automation and it reports the successful payment to all major credit bureaus. Credit Builder does not charge an annual fee or interest.

Millions of Chime customers are using this product Plante said.

The downside to such cards is that the repayment data is not as indicative to the credit bureaus of a customer’s “willingness to repay” because the regular risks and decision-making of repaying loans are taken out of the equation Johnson said.

That may not be a problem right now as these products are still new. “But as credit-builder products become more popular it wouldn’t surprise me if the bureaus and FICO which are constantly tuning models and approaches look at them and try to better understand how the data correlates to someone’s creditworthiness” Johnson said.

For Plante the upsides to the product are still key.

“The consistent thing we hear from the credit bureaus is this is bringing more people into the credit world” Plante said. “The credit invisibles now have a trade line.”

Another fintech trying to bring more people into the credit world is GO2bank  the digital bank belonging to Green Dot that serves low- to moderate-income customers.

Its secured credit card does not charge an annual fee and keeps the minimum deposit to $100 rather than the more typical minimum of $200. It also recently partnered with Experian to offer its customers glimpses of their FICO score credit monitoring the ability to lock and unlock their Experian credit files and access to Experian Boost which lets them improve their scores by paying bills like video-streaming services phones and utilities on time.

These additions are expected to launch later this year.

Most of these features can be assembled for free through other sources. For example consumers can sign up for Experian Boost directly. GO2bank and Chime are the only two neobanks to partner with Experian Boost so far.

Abhi Chaudhary head of direct to consumer at Green Dot said GO2bank sets itself apart by consolidating this suite of tools in one place.

“Our goal was to create a financial ecosystem for customers in one mobile app” Chaudhary said.

One potential issue with rent and utility reporting services is that lenders may not rely on scores that incorporate it. FICO 8 for example takes utility data into consideration but not rental data. FICO 9 incorporates both but is not yet widely used by lenders.

“The older credit-scoring systems specifically used in mortgage lending don’t see those cool things [like rent and utility payments] that consumers can add to their credit reports” Ulzheimer said.

Chaudhary still sees plenty of benefit in fostering responsible behaviors among his customers.

“Our intent is to ensure our customer’s credit profile is getting better and once it is getting better this is over time reflected in other models” Chaudhary said.

Other products such as credit-builder loans levy fees and interest. In exchange they say they help customers improve their credit scores while amassing a chunk of savings.

“I’m not a big fan of the credit-builder installment loans” Johnson said. “I don’t think it’s worth locking up that much money and paying interest.”

Johnson pointed out that banks have followed in the footsteps of fintechs by rethinking overdraft fees and granting customers early access to their paychecks .

“We will see a resurgence of credit-builder products and secured credit cards coming from banks in much the same way” he said.

Austin Capital Bank in Texas launched Credit Strong in 2019. It's a credit-building product that includes an installment loan and a federally insured savings account. With Credit Strong the $341 million-asset bank funds a loan and the proceeds are placed in the savings account. Users make fixed monthly payments that cover principal which is credited toward the loan and interest which compensates the bank for the product. There are no prepayment or early withdrawal penalties.

These payments are reported to all three credit bureaus and once the loan is repaid the savings are released.

“What they spend in credit building they will save in thousands of dollars of interest expenses over their financial life” said Erik Beguin the CEO and founder of Austin Capital Bank.

Credit Strong will report both positive and negative data which Beguin says is important. Anywhere between 3% and 7% of Credit Strong customers pay late.

Credit-building products ""that only generate positive payment history could eventually erode the reliability of the credit bureau data and underwriting models based on that data” he said.

Where banks might have edge over fintechs

Beguin said that there were two roads he could have taken: a secured credit card or an installment loan. He chose the latter because he wanted a product with no upfront deposit.

He also says that one of the major advantages his bank has over fintech credit-building products is robust know-your-customer checks.

“Weak KYC programs that are not subject to Bank Secrecy Act [rules] and federal examination could aid bad actors to manufacture synthetic identities at scale” he said.

Johnson predicts that more banks will start offering some of their own credit-building products to compete with the neobanks. This could be as simple as refreshing their secured credit cards.

“More than anything the biggest problem with secured cards is consumers can tell when the companies they are working with don’t want to work with them” Johnson said. “Secured cards always had that vibe like ‘Here are all our great cards we want you to have and oh yeah here is our secured card.’ ”

In contrast Chime positions its credit-builder card prominently on its website.

“It’s a subtle distinction but it matters” Johnson said.

The better approach for banks might be rethinking how they underwrite customers and incorporate alternative data. That would mean more customers get approved for regular products.

There are a few examples on the market. Petal has started selling its cash-flow-based underwriting technology to banks and fintechs in addition to offering its own credit card directly to consumers. TomoCredit launched a credit card in March that assesses creditworthiness exclusively on cash-flow data. Nova Credit helps usher immigrants into the American credit system by making sense of foreign credit bureau information for U.S. banks’ underwriting systems. American Express partnered with Nova Credit in 2019.

In May The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the largest U.S. banks will start sharing data on customers’ deposit accounts to expand access to credit. This pilot program grew out of Project REACh (Roundtable for Economic Access and Change) an initiative by the Officer for the Comptroller of Currency to promote financial inclusion. JPMorgan Chase is one bank involved with Project REACh. Mark Brucker chief risk officer at JPMorgan said the goal is to broaden access to credit responsibly.

“Depending on what we learn through this effort underwriting models may evolve in the future to account for new alternative data sources” Brucker said by email. “While we’re beginning with deposit account information as we gain experience we’ll consider expanding the techniques to evaluate other areas such as rent utilities and other payment information.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbmRzdGF0ZW55LmNvbS9wb3dlci1saXN0cy8yMDIxLzA4L2NvbW11bml0eS1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXBvd2VyLTUwLzE4NDU5Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Community Engagement Power 50,"Vanessa Agudelo Hudson Valley Manager of Member Engagement New York Immigration Coalition Vanessa Agudelo / Marco Chan @marcokikochan Vanessa Agudelo got her start in local politics as an environmental organizer fighting against the expansion of a local pipeline.

Negan's gonna Negan. So we learned on Sunday's season 11 premiere of The Walking Dead titled ""Archeron Part I"" as any worries that the kinder gentler Negan no longer had an edge to him were put firmly to rest. While Jeffrey Dean Morgan may not have taken a barbed-wire-covered baseball bat to Maggie's head he may have signed her death certificate nonetheless.

The episode ended with Negan—thinking Maggie (Lauren Cohan) was intending to kill him down in the subterranean tunnels of the D.C. Metro system as payback for murdering her husband—on top of a train car with a chance to assist Maggie up as zombies converged on her below. With Maggie pleading for help Negan stared down at her—almost frozen for a minute—before choosing to walk away and leave her to die. (The episode ended with the cliffhanger of Maggie being pulled down her fate in doubt until next week's resolution.)

But perhaps the craziest thing about the entire scene is the fact that it may not have even been Negan's most shocking moment of the episode because while challenging Maggie earlier about what he believed was her plan to kill him the former Savior leader roared back that he would not allow her to put him down like a dog ""like Glenn was."" It was a brutal choice of words considering Negan was the one who put Glenn down in a gruesome fashion and it was a choice of words that Jeffrey Dean Morgan actually fought against saying.

EW spoke to Morgan about that pivotal scene and the actor revealed in fascinating detail why he was reticent to utter that devastating line. He also took us inside Negan's final decision and why he ultimately left Maggie to die. Strap in for an amazing chat that not only provides a window into one of the show's most intriguing personalities but also showcases the fascinating relationship between actor and character. (Also read our episode Q&A with showrunner Angela Kang.)

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Tell me your reaction when you sit down to read the script for episode 1101 and you come to the line when Negan tells Maggie that if she wants to kill him to do it right there because he will not let her put him down like a dog ""Like Glenn was."" What did you think when you first saw that on the page and realized those words needed to come out of your mouth?

JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN: I fought it! That's the one line that I immediately called [showrunner Angela Kang] and I was like ""I can't say it. I can't f---ing bring up Glenn's name here."" And I was like ""Any goodwill that Negan has gotten on his side is going to go out the window the minute I say Glenn."" I tried to nix the line completely. I didn't think it was necessary. And I thought for sure they would let me change it. And so I filmed it three or four different ways. I tried everything else. I said ""Your husband"" and other stuff. but ultimately it was like ""Well let's just try the f---ing Glenn line."" And then of course when I saw the cut I was like ""Oh f---ers!"" [Laughs] They had to put it in.

But look I get it. I know why it was there to elicit the reaction exactly that you and I felt in seeing it. I always have said that regardless of what Negan does that is good there is still that Negan inside of him. And at this point in the story when that line comes out it's kind of that whole speech where I am like ""Why the f---are we following this woman? I'm living in her head and she's leading us to our deaths."" We have no idea what we're going to. Negan is the voice of reason suddenly. And had he not said that Glenn line the whole audience would've gone ""He's right! He's f---ing right!"" The minute I say that Glenn line 50% of them I lose immediately. It doesn't matter if he's right.

But it also lent itself to Daryl having his punch at me which we were kind of leading up to too. Because I think Negan is thinking the whole time that Daryl is in on this. And that really the only reason that he's there is to be killed. And he's sure that Daryl is in on it. So there's that little storyline going on there between the two of us as well. But yeah when I first read that line I was like ""Goddamnit!"" [Laughs]

Lauren Cohan told me you didn't want to say it.

We talked about it. Before I f---ing bitched I called LC and even she was like ""God dang it's a lot. Why would you do that?"" I was like ""I don't know. I wouldn't."" That's the thing is Negan is smart enough that he would except to elicit a reaction.

I legit gasped when he said it. I couldn't believe it. But I'll tell you why I like it and I was talking to Angela about this: A lot of times when you have a villain in a movie or on TV and they become reformed in some way usually that character ends up being sort of softened. The edges are taken away. And as we see with that Glenn comment what I like about it is that Negan may be a changed man in many respects but he's also the same man. He does still have that edge and that makes him dangerous. And from a viewer's standpoint that makes him exciting to watch.

Yeah and you're right. And that's why it is always going to be a fine line that we're walking with the redemption arc. It's like I started off saying: Negan will always be f---ing Negan. And I think that's really important to remember not just for our audience but for me. And so when I read these scripts I have to embrace the Negan as much as I would like to see a more solid change because I'm also trying to ingratiate myself into this group of people and have been for years and feel like Negan has earned his spot within this group. But what we find out in this first episode is that he hasn't. And in fact he will always be this outsider and it doesn't matter who he saves or what he does or who he kills. He's not going to be accepted.

And I think that that is the reality that has finally dawned on him in this first episode is that he's a dead man. And Maggie is going to kill him. And probably everybody else is in on it. So he's looking over his shoulder the whole time. And that also brings out the f---ing edge. He's going to go down f---ing fighting. We know that. He's not going to lay down even though he's like ""Let's get it over with now."" Had that taken a different turn where she pulls out a gun it would be interesting to see how that went down but I don't think he's ever going to let anybody shoot him in the head. He wants to survive which probably leads to your next question.

Yeah let's get to the final moment Negan climbs on board the metro car Maggie's climbing her leg is grabbed. She cries out to him for help and he pauses does nothing and then leaves her to die. Super huge moment and one where you have to convey a lot without saying anything. Tell me how you wanted to play that.

I thought personally that they may have held on it a beat too long. I would have almost liked it to be a faster beat but you want to convey in that moment that he's thinking do I save her? Do I not? I think his first reaction is to reach down and save her and then it doesn't take long to realize that what he's thinking about here is his survival. He is convinced that he is a dead man and that she is going to kill him with her cronies or whoever. And so it's a really easy thing. That's all I was trying to convey was the decision-making process that has to be there: Do I save her? Do I not? And I don't.

Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan on 'The Walking Dead'. Josh Stringer/AMC

Let's have the philosophical discussion. Is leaving someone to die just as bad as killing them?

Not in Negan's mind. I think there is a huge difference but I don't think he necessarily leaves her to die. I think it's like more like ""F--- it. You're on your own.""

I was going to ask you about that. Do you think he's hoping she dies or is it just ""I don't hope you die but I'm not helping you.""

Yeah I think that's it. He knows these people well enough to know that they are also all cockroaches just like him. They are survivors. I'm not going to go out of my way. I'm not going to risk my neck for yours right now. If you survive you survive. If you don't bully for me. And that's kind of the thinking there. When I'm looking at her and she's hanging on losing her grip there's no evil f---ing grin. There's no malicious f---ing twirl of the mustache. It's just like f--- it. He knows that there's a bullet with his name on it and he's not going to go out of his way. He's not going to risk his life for her. And that's sort of where he is.

Yeah that moment with your look on top of the train it's almost like a weird blank look. It's very emotionless and it's very much like you're calculating in your head what to do.

It's a very kind of blank look and that's what she's seeing too. I didn't want to convey anything. We had talked about is there something there? Is there a hint of a smile? And I was kind of adamant that there should be nothing. This is a situation that he's very cold about. It's very much like he is taking himself out of the situation and he does so mentally at that moment. And he just turns away. And very purposeful. And again I never know what they will edit and how they will edit it but I think they did a great job on that.

I actually watched these first two episodes—and I don't watch everything—and I really liked them. I think Kevin Dowling who directed it did a f---ing amazing job He is a guy I've worked with numerous times in my career but he's never done this show. And he did a killer job on these first two. And the writing I thought was f---ing great. There was a horror aspect to the show which I had missed desperately. It was really a great way to start this last year.

The recording obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration this week by The Drive reveals the sophisticated capabilities of the drone as it ran circles around police and federal helicopters in February.

The recordings show that pilots and air traffic controllers were baffled by the drone which they described as 'super sophisticated' and possibly satellite-controlled and hovered over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.

During the nearly 70-minute chase the drone often toyed with the pursuing helicopters by hovering directly over their rotors.

It was not visible with night-vision goggles and eventually exceeded the maximum flight ceiling of the helicopters escaping the pursuers.

'They can't tell if its a quadcopter or what. They assume it's a drone but they're following it' one controller is heard saying.

Crews are also heard saying that it was difficult to estimate the size of the mystery craft which was difficult to visually identify due to its high speed and maneuverability.

FBI officials told Tucson TV station KOLD that the drone 'orbited' the helicopter several times and led the copter on a circular hour-long chase

The tactical flight officer on the Tucson PD helicopter said in the report that the drone 'maneuvered all over the city' at over 10000 feet (file image)

As the chase wore on crew members repeatedly wonder aloud why the apparent drone's battery hadn't run out of power. 'This would be like no battery I've ever seen'

Another recording reveals a phone call between the Air Traffic Control tower at Tucson International Airport and the Tucson Police Department helicopter crew.

'Yeah was definitely a drone' one TPD helicopter crew member tells the controllers. 'I just couldn't tell you - I couldn't give you its dimensions as it was moving... too sketchy for us to.'

'From what I can tell just from its position light you know I would have to imagine it was larger than a quadcopter and I guarantee you it was nothing like a quadcopter from how long it was up' the crew member said.

'It has to be satellite-driven because there's no line-of-sight there's no cell phone coverage that could have dealt with that so it has to be satellite-driven which is pretty freakin' sophisticated' he added.

'I assure you it was not a quadcopter and it was the most advanced drone we've dealt with over the last decade here. Its abilities were pretty incredible um I just - I can't tell you exactly its size' the crew member said.

A report from Tucson police first revealed how the drone flew into the path of a US Customs and Border Protection helicopter on at 10:30pm on February 9 and orbited it several times.

It then fled at high speed leading the CBP chopper and another brought in from the Tucson Police Department in a circular hour-long chase.

At one point it even entered into restricted military airspace at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base which is about five miles outside of Tucson.

The FBI is now investigating the incident.

The drone never hit the CBP chopper but it 'was flying dangerous close' and sparked a chase as multiple law enforcement agencies tried to track it to find the people who were piloting it.

FBI officials told KOLD that the drone was capable of reaching 14000 feet and speeds over 100mph with a range of 70 miles.

The CBP was using an Airbus AS350 that night while sources close to The Drive said the Tucson PD Air Support was flying a Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger helicopter.

Following a records request The Drive obtained the Case Summary Report of the incident from the Tucson Police Department which goes into more detail about what happened.

The report reveals the drone was first seen by the police at the corner of East Ajo Way and South Palo Verde Road which is next to a fuel terminal operated by Kinder Morgan.

The drone also strayed into military airspace above fuel tanks at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base

The tactical flight officer on the Tucson PD helicopter said in the report that the drone 'maneuvered all over the city' at over 10000 feet.

The officer also said the drone moved 'in a manner to hamper [the TPD crew's] ability to track it visually.'

It then 'appeared to move in an erratic pattern as if the signal with its home station was getting weaker' when it was leaving northwest of the city.

The FBI previously said the drone made 'erratic maneuvers' and strayed into military airspace above fuel tanks at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.

From there drone flew towards the Tucson International Airport as the Tucson Police Department and CBP pursued the drone.

It then flew northwest out of the city and into the clouds where it vanished into the night.

It was last seen over 12000 feet high traveling over 74mph according to the police report. At that point the police and CBP needed to refuel their vehicles.

In another section of the report the Tucson PD's pilot expressed hope that the drone would run out of battery and land but 'unfortunately this was not the case.'

The pilot said the drone 'was very sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other uas [unmanned aircraft system].'

They added that it was 'obvious that the controller had clear sight of both the helicopters tracking it by the way it would orbit us and abruptly fly behind us and attempt to avoid our visual contact.'

Police tracked the drone for over an hour but never were able to get a reliable visual on it.

The intentions of the drone and where it came from remain unclear.

Officials previously described the drone as 'high-powered' and 'heavily-modified' but did not explain what modifications had been made to it.

The drone is said to have a single green light on its underbelly which was confirmed by the Case Summary Report.

The drone that flew into the path of a US Customs and Border Protection helicopter on at 10:30pm on February 9 (file image)

That made it challenging for the drone to be seen by the police department's helicopter spotter who was using night vision goggles.

It is also estimated to be between four and six feet in diameter and could have a four- or six-rotor configuration KOLD reported.

The drone's ability to fly as high as 14000 feet suggests it uses advanced technology not available on the commercial market according to The Drive.

The drone appeared to launch from an area about five miles south of Tucson and flew across Tucson and north over Marana Arizona the FBI said.

While the FBI is leading the investigation it's not clear if the US military was involved in any way in the initial incident or in the ongoing probe The Drive reported.

No video was recorded of the incident by the police department.

Similar incidents happened in the area have been reported in 2018 and 2019 according to The Drive.

In 2018 a Learjet reported a drone flying at 40000 feet above Southern Arizona and in 2019 a drone was reported flying over Arizona's Palo Verde nuclear power plant The Drive reported.

The FBI said no one was injured and no other similar incidents have been reported involving this specific drone but the operator(s) will likely face a federal criminal charge.

'While the drone did not come into direct contact with an airplane or cause a pilot to make an evasive maneuver the actions are illegal and extremely dangerous' the FBI said in its statement.

The 'unsafe operation of unmanned aircraft' became a federal offense in 2018 - with the passage of the The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act.

Andrew Rene Hernandez a 22-year-old Hollywood man became the first person charged under this law last year after he accidentally slammed his drone into an LAPD helicopter forcing it to make an emergency landing.

In January he pleaded guilty and in April he was sentenced to probation and fined $500.

The Federal Aviation Administration has noted evidence of a 'considerable increase in the unauthorized use of small inexpensive [drones] by individuals and organizations.'

Drone operators are required to register any drones that weigh more than 250 grams with the FAA according to the agency's website.

Drones under that weight limit and that are being used recreationally or as a hobby do not need to be registered with the FAA.

While some products remain tried and true over time there is a growing customer and consumer appetite for new and exciting products with modern attributes that keep our brands relevant and even create a need for new ones. Responding to consumer interests has driven the industry to develop products that are gluten-free non-genetically modified organic vegan paleo and keto diet-friendly free from allergens antibiotic-free contain sourcing claims and subjected to cold-pressed processing among a variety of other attributes. While designing for these attributes themselves does not drive a food safety risk the introduction of any new and novel ingredients to a system presents the need for sound practices and supplier approval requirements.

Consumers’ increasing awareness and interest in global cuisines additionally introduce opportunities for ingredients once deemed exotic to become mainstream. As a product developer sets out to design new products with these attributes or ingredients they may introduce a variety of new ingredients to a company’s supply chain and possibly create challenges for sourcing. There also may be a new management risk from a food safety and regulatory standpoint with ingredients coming from new suppliers or facilities all over the world.

Considerations for how ingredients will be sourced inspected or segregated and processed may have implications for the quality and safety of the finished product. It is important for the developers deciding which ingredients to use to be in communication with not only their procurement partners but also their food safety and quality partners to use ingredients from reliable and trustworthy suppliers from the beginning. As R&D projects move from benchtop samples to commercialization product developers must select appropriate raw materials to not only meet product design parameters but also adhere to relevant regulatory and company requirements such as any applicable regulations under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).

As a basic requirement of the Preventive Controls for Human Food regulations the performance and documentation of a thorough hazard analysis is the cornerstone of a food safety plan. A facility’s food safety team including the Preventive Controls-Qualified Individual and product development team must be aware of potential ingredients or future processing procedures that may introduce new or increased biological chemical (including radiological hazards) or physical hazards.

A manufacturing facility receiving the ingredients would also need to evaluate the hazard to assess the severity of any illness or injury if the hazard were to occur and the probability that the hazard will occur without preventive controls. For example a facility receiving ready-to-eat almonds that does not employ a lethality step as part of its process flow would need to perform a hazard analysis to determine if additional supply chain controls are needed. This is because raw almonds can be a source of Salmonella and almonds have been previously implicated in Salmonella-related recalls/outbreaks. If the receiving facility does not employ a process step that would control Salmonella in raw almonds (e.g. a validated roasting process) it will need to rely on the process preventive control at the supplier’s facility for treating the almonds to significantly minimize or prevent the potential presence of Salmonella. This means the receiving facility’s hazard analysis should reflect that Salmonella on raw almonds is a hazard requiring a supply chain-applied control (or preventive control).

Per FSMA a manufacturing facility’s supply chain control program [§ 117.420 (21 C.F.R. 17.410(a)(1)(2)(3)(4))] needs to have one or more of the following elements:

Use of approved suppliers Determination of appropriate verification activities prior to approving the supplier Continuation of verification activities at set frequencies Documentation of the supplier approval and all related verification activities

A FSMA-compliant supply chain program must be written. However it is a best practice to have a written supply chain program regardless of whether you are required to implement supply chain controls based on your food safety system. In some cases your supply chain program may have existed prior to FSMA regulations and in those cases you will need to ensure your program meets the requirements and update it as needed. This could get complicated considering the complexity of the supply chain system. In the subsequent sections of this article we list some important considerations for manufacturers when designing a robust supply chain program for their organization.

Supplier Approval under FSMA

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed two different pathways to complete supplier verification: under the Preventive Controls regulation (referred to as “Subpart G”) and under the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP). Subpart G outlines requirements stating that ingredient suppliers must be verified to ensure they are appropriately controlling hazards before they ship ingredients to a company that will not be controlling the identified hazard. An FSVP requires verification of suppliers and their food safety practices before they ship ingredients or products from a foreign location. The FSVP regulations are very similar to Subpart G requirements and may be used in situations where imported foods are not already verified under a U.S. food safety plan. However compliance with an FSVP is typically deemed equivalent to compliance with Subpart G. For the purpose of this article we will focus on Subpart G requirements.

The need for a FSMA-compliant supplier approval program is dictated by decisions made in the food safety plan specifically in the hazard analysis. If the hazard analysis indicates that a hazard requiring a preventive control is present the company receiving the ingredient has some decisions to make. They could choose to control the hazard themselves perhaps through a process preventive control like cooking for a microbial hazard. Or perhaps the company chooses not to control the hazard; if this is the case they must provide written disclosure of the hazard to their customer if their customer is a manufacturer processor or preparer. There is one additional option (the one most relevant to our discussion): The company can rely on their supplier to control the hazard. This piece is where adherence to Subpart G and a supplier verification program come into play.

Use of Approved Suppliers

If you are implementing a supply chain control in your food safety system you must procure your materials or ingredients in question from an approved supplier. A receiving company must approve suppliers in accordance with requirements of 21 C.F.R. §117.410(d) and document that approval before receiving raw materials or ingredients from those suppliers. Once a supplier has been approved it is important that the receiving facility develop written procedures for receiving ingredients from their approved suppliers. The procedures should demonstrate that the materials are received only from approved suppliers. The details of the approvals should include not just an approved company but also the location/address of the approved site. The receiving facility should also keep records on the materials they receive and suppliers from whom they received. Determining which suppliers to approve will be based on verification activities up front prior to ingredient receipt and then on a continuous basis based on ingredient risk.

Determination of Appropriate Verification Activities Prior to Approving the Supplier

Whether a supplier is approved will be based on verification of their ability to adequately control the hazards you have identified. There are many verification activities you can choose to approve a supplier. For example you may choose to use the results of an on-site audit of the supplier. You could also perform periodic sampling and testing of the raw material or ingredient based on the hazard identified. Another good choice may be to review relevant food safety records related to your suppliers’ controls for the hazard you identified. In this scenario you would review records related to particular lots of ingredients you are procuring and review the records generated for the preventive control that is controlling the hazard you identified as associated with the ingredient. You also have the flexibility to design your own verification activities. One common approach is to develop a supplier questionnaire which asks specific food safety systems-related questions of your supplier. You can decide based on their answers whether steps they take to control identified hazards are adequate. You are not limited to just one verification activity either. You should find the best approach or combination of approaches to ensure that your supplier is effectively controlling the hazard before you begin receiving the material.

Many food manufacturers have required a third-party food safety audit [typically a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audit] from their suppliers as part of their supplier approval program. In 2000 the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) was developed in response to several recalls in the industry and lack of consumer confidence in food manufacturers. This private organization benchmarked audit schemes to ensure they met the minimum requirements of the GFSI guidance documents. Several major retailers mandated that their suppliers be audited against a GFSI-recognized scheme. These schemes were more comprehensive and improved food safety standards of manufacturers thus becoming the audit of choice for customers manufacturers and suppliers alike.

Because they lack the resources to annually audit every ingredient supplier that requires a preventive control most manufacturers are requiring these suppliers be audited against a GFSI-recognized scheme. GFSI schemes review a supplier’s food safety/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan and associated food safety records. Many of these schemes are updating their audit to meet FSMA Preventive Controls requirements. When building a supplier approval program a risk assessment should be developed to identify those suppliers who pose a risk to your business and brand. The following criteria are some examples you may want to include in your risk assessment:

Food safety audit: Has the supplier been audited by your own company? If so what was the outcome of that audit? Does the supplier have a GFSI audit scheme? If so what were the nonconformances? Do they have just a GMP audit?

Country of origin: Are there supply chain geographic concerns such as is the manufacturing facility in country of use? Is it outside the country of use but doesn’t pose a supply chain concern? Is it outside country of use and does pose a supply chain concern?

History of food fraud: Has the supplier or parent company had a history of fraudulent intentional adulteration or substitution of an ingredient? What about the ingredient itself: Has there been known adulteration or substitution in the industry?

Recalls alerts and warning letters in the last 2 years: The number of recalls alerts warning letters or compliance and enforcement actions over a period may indicate a risk associated with a supplier.

End use of the ingredient: Does the use of the ingredient provide a validated lethality step or does the ingredient itself have no pathogenic microbiological risk? Does the use of the ingredient provide a heat treatment step but not validated lethality or does the use of the ingredient have no validated lethality step or validated lethality?

Chemical or physical risk associated with the ingredient: Are there any chemical or inherent physical risks associated with the ingredient? If chemical or inherent physical risks are associated with the ingredient does the supplier have good control measures in place to mitigate them? For example if aflatoxin is an identified risk in peanuts does the supplier have a blancher in their process and do they report aflatoxin results on a certificate of analysis (COA)? If there is an inherent physical hazard like cherry pits in cherries does the supplier have an X-ray machine in place to ensure removal of pits? In situations where there are inherent chemical or physical risks associated with the ingredient but the supplier has minimal or no control measures in place will the company receiving the ingredient apply an appropriate control?

Single/sole source: Determine if an ingredient is single sourced or procured through multiple suppliers or multiple supplying locations. If an ingredient is single sourced there should be only one supplier with one supplying location. The volume of the ingredient supplied may also be a factor that may affect the risk assessment. Each criterion should have a different risk weight associated with it depending on what you deem a higher risk to your company and brand. Remember that as the supply chain becomes more complex risk can potentially be added. For example if you are receiving an ingredient from a broker who in turn received it from an importer who received it from the supplier this may increase risk. You need to know who the actual manufacturer is for that ingredient. This risk assessment should help you identify risks so that you can manage and mitigate them. Just like any program this should be updated as risk levels change or new risks are identified.

Continuation of Verification Activities at Set Frequencies

Your verification activities don’t end after you have approved a supplier to provide an ingredient or raw material. You must then periodically verify your supplier and their identified controls. In general the nature of the hazard and your hazard analysis will inform what continued verification activities you will employ and how frequently you will be performing them. The greater the risk you identify the more stringent you should be assessing your supplier’s performance through your verification activities. For a FSMA-compliant program any ingredient or raw material with a SAHCODHA (serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals) hazard identified (or an ingredient/raw material that has potential of SAHCODHA) will have to include an annual on-site audit as verification. There is an exception to this requirement but it will require documentation that your approach whether it be other verification activities or less frequent auditing provides adequate assurances in place of the annual audit and a person who is qualified to make this decision has documented the justification.

Documentation of the Supplier Approval and All Related Verification Activities

It is likely that you will have some suppliers who fall under the FSMA requirement of a supply chain program while many other suppliers will not—perhaps they are not controlling a hazard on your behalf or maybe they fall under a different regulatory pillar (U.S. Department of Agriculture Seafood HACCP etc.). It is up to the company to decide how to handle these other suppliers whether they should fall under the same program as the FSMA-required supplier or be covered under a separate program. Regardless of which approach you choose careful consideration of your expectations for a supplier and documentation of your reviews and decision-making are vital.

It is also very common for a company with multiple individual establishments to maintain a supply chain program at a central site. Perhaps the corporate team conducts the hazard analysis supplier approvals and verification activities while providing details on approved suppliers and ingredients to the individual sites. The sites then ensure they follow a documented receiving procedure for ingredients review appropriate documents such as COAs where applicable at receiving and document their review of information. This approach may be more harmonized than having each site maintain a unique supply chain program individually.

Conclusions

In a rapidly evolving marketplace food companies need to meet the growing consumer demand for novel food products containing modern attributes to keep their brands relevant. Hazard analysis of ingredients in the development of such foods needs to be performed to identify any potential risk associated with the finished product. Manufacturers need to employ adequate supply chain preventive controls to significantly minimize and prevent the identified reasonably foreseeable hazards on their incoming ingredients where appropriate based on hazard analysis. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to develop a supply chain program and identify appropriate suppliers who meet the manufacturing facility’s expectations. The need for a FSMA-compliant supplier approval program is dictated by decisions made in the food safety plan specifically in the hazard analysis. A cross-functional team should be involved to ensure compliance with regulations as the different elements of the supply chain program are being developed. In this article we discussed several best practices for manufacturers when designing a robust supply chain program for their organization. Manufacturers should find the best approach or combination of these approaches to adequately ensure potential hazards if any of incoming ingredients are effectively controlled before they arrive at their facility. Robust food safety practices will ensure success for individual product launches as well as long-term success for food companies.

reportedly installed a soft-serve-ice-cream machine at his Beverly Hills home. Ice-cream company CVT Soft Serve posted on Instagram that Bezos is its first residential client.

Bezos appears to be a fan of soft-serve ice cream : He stopped by Milk Bar in New York in 2019.

How much do you enjoy eating soft-serve ice cream? If your name is Jeff Bezos the answer is apparently a lot.

The Amazon and Blue Origin founder has installed an artisan soft-serve machine inside his Los Angeles home according to an Instagram post this week from Los Angeles soft-serve-ice-cream company CVT Soft Serve.

""I just did an ice cream delivery to a guy that now has CVT on tap in his house 24/7"" the post reads accompanied by a photo of founder Joe Nicchi. ""Thank you Jeff Bezos for being our first residential #CVTeeny client.⁣""

He added: ""What. The Actual. Fuck?!?"" Vice was the first to spot the post.

The CVTeeny is a soft-serve-ice-cream machine designed to look like a food truck complete with a customizable ""license plate"" on the front. (We'll just have to guess at what Bezos chose for his plate.)

The machine dispenses vanilla chocolate and twist soft-serve according to the company's site.

While we don't know for sure which of Bezos' houses the machine was installed in from CVT's photo it appears to be his Beverly Hills estate. He purchased the home previously known as the Warner Estate in February 2020 for $165 million breaking the record for the most expensive home sale in California state history. He added an adjacent $10 million property creating a $175 million compound.

A spokesperson for Bezos did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the soft-serve machine.

Bezos has shown in the past that like many of us he's unable to resist the simple allure of soft-serve.

In April 2019 he was spotted with two of his children at New York City's Milk Bar a dessert spot and bakery founded by chef Christina Tosi. Page Six reported at the time that he ordered the company's famous Cereal Milk ice cream which is intended to taste like ""the bottom of your cereal bowl.""

Everyone remembers the moment they saw the classic Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on the road which has been around since 1936. But there’s a new peanut in town and it brings with it the Planters Nutmobile. And because I love unnecessary comparisons today we’re looking at these two food cars to see which is best. To do that we’ll be looking at what’s under the hood as well as what you’re paid to drive them.

The Wienermobile’s experience brings it many modern gadgets

Since its conception in 1936 the Wienermobile has had time to evolve into a respectably modern car. Most of the Wienermobiles shuffling around the states were built in 2004 but there are also a few from 1995 designed by Harry Bradley. Regardless these revivals of the Wienermobile have clocked thousands of miles and to do that they needed proven technology.

In terms of engine the Wienermobile has a 6.0L Vortec engine from Chevrolet fitted to such cars as the Chevy Silverado HD and GMC Yukon XL as well as others listed on GM Authority. But that power gives the Wienermobile a staggering 300 horsepower. Though the four-speed Chevy transmission is slightly dated and I’d imagine that even with all that power the Wienermobile wouldn’t be a screamer.

That said it’s packed with other comfort features including seating for six Hotdoggers. There’s also a removable sunroom (or bunroof) a backup camera and even solar panels. That way the Oscar Mayer jingle can be played without using any battery. Though we’d imagine hearing it on repeat would get old fast.

The Nutmobile is the newer kid in town but steps up to the plate

Mr. Peanut And The Nutmobile | Planters

Well we say newer but the Nutmobile was actually conceived in 1935. However it didn’t get revitalized unti 2002 where it debuted in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parage. The Nutmobile of today was built in 2014 and is 26 feet in total (one foot shorter than the Wienermobile). This odd peanut car was designed by TurtleTransit a company known for its promotional vehicles.

But despite promoting two different foods the Nutmobile and Wienermobile have the same DNA. Under the shell is the same 6.0L GM-provided Vortec engine but in the Nutmobile that manages anywhere between 322 and 360 horsepower. That’ll get the Nutmobile up to 80 miles per hour enough to pass other slowpokes on the highway.

Though the Nutmobile has one leg up over the Wienermobile: the interior. It’s a creative retro-themed environment with carpet on the walls. But what’s cooler is a full timeline on the ceiling of Mr. Peanut’s evolution (for context the character was created in 1919).

Which foodmobile is the best?

Oscar Mayer Wienermobile and Planters Nutmobile

At the end of the day it really doesn’t matter which mobile is best. Both are owned by Kraft Heinz and often tour together for large events. The deciding factor between these two food-themed cars all depends on which you like more: hotdogs or peanuts.

With that said if I had to drive one of these I’d say the winner is the wiener. But this is solely on the basis of aerodynamics engineering and style. Though Car and Driver did get a chance to meet with the Peanutters driving the Nutmobile who explained the driving conditions to be slightly treacherous. Though what would you expect from a 26-foot long peanut.

But unlike Planters Oscar Mayer is taking applications for new Hotdoggers. If it’s your dream to drive across the country in a fiberglass bun then send a cover letter to the good folks at Oscar Mayer. Who knows maybe you’ll end up bringing hundreds of smiles per mile to hungry patrons across the country.",,,

Jewel Cheryl Burke RaeLynn and more visited Kroger’s Wellness Experience to celebrate and encourage good health in both the mind and body.

The Cincinnati Ohio event kicked off the second day of activities on Saturday August 21 with cofounder Jewel 47 and her anxiety workshop. The “Foolish Games” singer led a discussion about how she manages her everyday anxiety and how to avoid it ruling her life. The packed session gave fans an opportunity to learn more about Jewel’s mental health and how to take charge of their own mental battles.

“No one owes me happiness” Jewel told her captivated audience. “I owe myself happiness.”

The musician discussed knowing when to push anxious thoughts aside and when to listen to them. She compared her anxiety to a car alarm during the session at The Wellness Experience by Kroger’s Inspiration Zone presented by American Greetings.

“When someone tries to break in your alarm goes off and it warns you. Anxiety is your body alarm. Your body and your brain have their own intelligence — they’re your alarms” she explained. “Your anxiety is telling you who the burglar is. Anxiety is your ally. Get close to your anxiety and your body alarms when they happen. They will teach you.”

Later the Inspire Lounge held the Different Abilities Better World session led by Allison Warrell star of TLC’s Big & Little. The bodybuilder shared her personal journey with health and fitness industry alongside Keep Her Wild skateboard collective founder Megs Gelfgot FitOps Foundation’s Bobby Somers and Devon Spivey.

Dancing with the Stars alum Burke also shared her personal experiences with mental health as a woman of color. The 37-year-old spoke during Mental Health in the BIPOC Communities session on Saturday alongside entrepreneur Morgan Angelique Owens.

The Wellness Experience wasn’t just about listening to advice and experiences of course. Attendees had opportunities to workout in the Active Zone presented by Blue Triton and the GoFit Roller Rehabilitation session in the Meditation Tent offered a chance to exercise with Nikki Walter. The fitness guru 40 led devotees through a targeted toning workout using the GoFit Roller.

To wrap up a fun and healthy weekend The Wellness Experience by Kroger delivered a country concert in the Fitness Zone sponsored by UnitedHealthcare. X Factor alum Willie Jones wowed audiences with his blend of country and hip-hop. The Voice alum RaeLynn who is expecting her first child with husband Josh Davis in September danced on stage with her baby bump proudly on display.

Joined on stage by Kroger’s CEO Rodney McMullen and Kroger Health’s president Colleen Lindholz Jewel gave festival-goers a special acoustic performance of both new and old songs — and gave more insights about her own wellness journey.

The celebration hits close to home for the “Foolish Games” singer who previously noted in a statement “This event harnesses the power of live music and free resources to promote health and wellness for all people. It’s an amazing opportunity to break down barriers and inspire mental physical and emotional health.”

Later on Lindholz and Brown shared tips and tricks for making informed choices about what to eat to prevent illness increase energy and transform one’s lifestyle. The vegan foodie has made a name for herself online sharing motivational morsels and healthy recipes with her millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram.

Friday’s festivities continued with a performance by up-and-coming artist Quinn XCII and local favorite Blessid Union of Souls in a fun-filled concert presented by Simple Truth. Former NBA player Brad Daugherty fielded questions from fans while YouTube star Summer McKeen hosted the Keen On Opening Act competition for aspiring musicians to earn the chance to open for Willie Jones and RaeLynn at the festival’s closing concert on Saturday August 21.

Elsewhere at the event TikTok sensation Joanne Molinaro proved going vegan doesn’t mean cutting out flavor sharing deliciously healthy recipes in the Food As Medicine Kitchen with Laura’s Lean.

When it comes to all around personal health staying active is essential. Tone It Up’s Stacey Thomas guided fans of all fitness levels in the festival’s Active Zone presented by Blue Triton.

Other inspirational activities included a panel with Alaska: the Last Frontier star Atz Kilcher who candidly spoke about depression substance abuse and the power of fitness with veterans and service members in partnership with American Greeting.

This year in the Western U.S. particularly in California Oregon and Washington forest chaparral and grassland landscapes have burned. Some ecosystems burn almost completely while others burn so that vegetation is hardly touched.

This is how natural wildfires function now exacerbated by human caused climate change with higher temperatures less rain more drought and high winds in ecosystems across the U.S. a mosaic of burned and unburned lands.

Large wildfires are not a new phenomenon. In October 1871 in Wisconsin a wildfire burned in Peshtigo when it was dry timber-framed buildings were the norm sawdust from lumber and sawmill activities covered the area and slash debris from logging was scattered around. This wildfire caused the deaths of 1200 people and killed an estimated 2 billion trees. Other large wildfires in Wisconsin occurred in 1863 1864 1868 1880 1891 1894 1897 1908 1910 1923 1931 and 1933.

Wisconsin is not alone in having past large wildfires. In October 1918 in Cloquet Minnesota a large wildfire killed 800 people burned 21 towns and caused significant property damage. What is called “The Great Fire” occurred in August 1910 and burned three million acres of forest in Idaho and Montana. The wildfires that occur today in California and other places are not new and oftentimes are not as large as wildfires that burned historically.

How have wildfires affected the over 163000-acre Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF 50 miles north of Houston Texas)? The Sierra Club has information it obtained from the U.S. Forest Service (FS) about wildfires in SHNF that covers the period 2016 through 2020.

What do we know?

1. 2016 11 wildfires burned 89.65 acres (about 0.055% of SHNF); 11 Compartments (each Compartment is about 700-1500 acres) had a wildfire; 11 fires (100%) were caused by humans; largest wildfire was 44.1 acres; smallest wildfire was 0.1 acre.

2. 2017 12 wildfires burned 90.25 acres (about 0.0554% of SHNF); 11 Compartments had at least one wildfire; 11 wildfires (91.67%) were caused by humans; 1 wildfire (8.33%) was caused by lightning; largest wildfire was 51 acres; smallest wildfire was 0.1 acre.

3. 2018 7 wildfires burned 4.5 acres (about 0.0028% of SHNF); 6 Compartments had at least 1 wildfire; 5 wildfires (71.43%) were caused by humans; 2 wildfires (28.57%) were caused by lightning; largest wildfire was 3 acres; smallest wildfire was 0.1 acre.

4. 2019 7 wildfires burned 52.05 acres (about 0.032% of SHNF); 7 Compartments had 1 wildfire; 4 wildfires (57.14%) were caused by humans; 2 wildfires (28.57%) were caused by lightning; 1 wildfire (14.29%) had an unknown cause; largest wildfire was 47 acres; smallest wildfire was 0.1 acre.

5. 2020 12 wildfires burned 78.46 acres (about 0.048% of SHNF); 11 Compartments had at least 1 wildfire; 7 wildfires (58.33%) were caused by humans; 3 wildfires (25%) were caused by lightning; 2 wildfires (16.67%) had an unknown cause; largest wildfire was 40 acres smallest wildfire was 0.1 acre.

SHNF does not have the number and size of wildfires that occur in the Western U.S. Our wildfires are in most cases caused by us. Because of the small fragmented and highly roaded nature of SHNF it’s relatively easy to access most wildfires and put them out. The FS has equipment and back-up support from local counties cities state agencies (like the Texas Forest Service) and other federal agencies to handle these wildfires.

Our climate which includes 50 or more inches of rain/year ensures that in many cases vegetation soil and leaf litter are somewhat moist. This does not mean we cannot have a significant wildfire. A significant wildfire occurred south of SHNF in the 2011 drought in the Magnolia Texas area. However the probability for a significant wildfire is low most years.

A program of prescribed burning to restore habitat for the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) helps control how much and what vegetation burns. Usually in SHNF 20000 to 40000 acres are burned each year with prescribed fire. This means that if a wildfire starts in an area that has had a recent prescribed burn there is less vegetation (fuel) available to burn and the wildfire is not likely to dramatically increase in size or severity.

A change the Sierra Club wants the FS to make is the use of wildfires to meet forest management objectives (RCW habitat and ecosystem improvement). Many wildfires can be allowed to burn safely to attain these objectives. Additional acres would be allowed to burn to provide habitat for the RCW and other wildlife with reduced fire hazards since less highly flammable vegetation would be available for burning.

The Sierra Club will continue its interest in FS wildfire management in SHNF. We look forward to additional input and conversations about prescribed burning so that RCW wildlife and human safety can all be provided.

The world's largest space show usually attracts 14000 participants to the 2500-acre resort for four days and pumps at least $30 million into the local economy by filling hotels restaurants tourist attractions and other businesses. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Colorado Springs-based Space Foundation to postpone last year's event until October 2020 and then rescheduled again for this month.

The symposium this year is expected to attract 7000-8000 participants with another 1000 expected to take part through the Space Foundation's Symposium 365 digital platform. The foundation has set a 75% capacity limit for any meeting or its expo limiting attendance to 900 at the symposium's main sessions in the Broadmoor International Hall and the number of exhibits in the new Bartolin Hall to about 250; all participants will be required to wear face masks while indoors.

""We are following masking and social distancing guidelines and have set lower capacity limits in all venues to provide a safe and successful Symposium environment"" said Thomas Dorame a Space Foundation senior vice president who oversees both the in-person and online event as well as the foundation's Space Report publication. ""We are proud to convene all three parts of the space ecosystem — military civilian and commercial — at this event. It is very powerful to bring this community together.""

Attendance at this year's symposium will be lower than previous events for two reasons — the symposium is sharing The Broadmoor with two other groups (normally the symposium is the only group in the resort) and international participants may not be able to attend in person due to pandemic-related travel restrictions and some are getting cold feet amid the rapid worldwide spread of the COVID-19 delta variant.

""The Broadmoor has been a fabulous partner by finding an open spot when we needed to reschedule the Symposium and showcase the global space ecosystem"" Dorame said.

Those who chose to participate online will pay less than a third of the in-person registration fee and will be able to watch a livestream broadcast of all sessions one-on-one interviews with speakers who will answer questions from online participants take part in virtual mentor moments to meet and network in online meeting rooms a daily broadcast of symposium highlights featuring some media members and archived content from previous Symposium 365 broadcasts.

The foundation has produced 34 virtual programs broadcast on its Symposium 365 platform which attracted 2000 participants for speakers that included the Air Force secretary and NASA administrator which were offered at no cost and up to 300 once the foundation began charging a registration fee in October. The foundation launched the virtual platform after the symposium was delayed a second time to ""reach our audience year around instead once a year for a week"" Dorame said.

Speakers scheduled for this year's event include NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and two of his deputy administrators Air Force Secretary Frank Kendell Vice Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Hyten Space Force Commander Gen. Jay Raymond National Space Council Executive Secretary Chirag Parikh United Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart L3 Harris Technologies CEO Christopher Kubasik SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell and six members of Congress including both Colorado U.S. senators.

Despite alarm about the spread of the delta variant leaders of space agencies in Canada and Europe plan to participate in a panel discussion on international space developments.

The symposium also marks the public debut of The Broadmoor's Bartolin Hall a nearly 171000-square-foot exhibit hall built to accommodate the event that replaces temporary facilities used for the past several years. The resort had completed the facility shortly before the foundation was forced to postpone last year's symposium as Colorado and other states imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the pandemic. The new hall allowed the symposium to provide wider aisles between exhibits for social distancing while increasing the number of booths by about 50.

""We have been about to do what the space industry always does — overcome challenges"" Dorame said. ""We had to delay one of our key events by 18 months and had to pivot to digital programs during the pandemic. The Space Foundation like many companies was significantly impacted by the pandemic — we were forced to do both furloughs and layoffs — but we are excited to get to this point.""

A smaller symposium still will be the largest convention held in Colorado Springs this year according to Doug Price CEO of Visit Colorado Springs. Conventions and meetings have slowly started to resume locally with hundreds of such events scheduled for the rest of this year and early next year he said. Price said he has ""high hopes"" for next year's symposium scheduled for April 4-7 that is expected to draw its traditional crowd of more than 14000 participants.",,,,,,,,,,,,

United & Leidos Partner to Commit up to $20000 to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society | DC United,"WASHINGTON D.C. (August 21 2021) – D.C. United and Leidos have announced that they have teamed-up to raise funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (National MS Society) via a club-driven “It’s in the Net!” fundraiser supporting legendary D.C. United and DC-area sportscaster Dave Johnson and the nearly one million people in the United States living with MS.

Beginning on Saturday August 21 with D.C. United’s match against Atlanta United and lasting through October 30 when the Black-and-Red host Columbus Crew SC United and Leidos will contribute $1000 when Johnson celebrates a goal scored by the club on-air with his famous line “It’s in the Net!” up to $20000.

“Dave is more than just the voice of our club his influence and commitment to building community for D.C. United supporters – new and old – is second to none” said Danita Johnson President of Business Operations for D.C. United. “We’re proud to be able to support him and a cause that is so near and dear to him.”

“My mother lost her battle with Multiple Sclerosis but with the support of the likes of Leidos and D.C. United I and millions of others are going to kick MS” said Dave Johnson. “As United Head Coach Hernán Losada preaches “Vamos Por Más” we will continue to go for more until we win.”

Johnson who has called D.C. United matches since Major League Soccer’s inception in 1996 shared his diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis in October 2019. He has long been a leader and vocal ambassador for the National MS Society and is registered for the Bike MS: Nation’s Capital fundraising effort that is set to take place on August 29.

“Leidos is honored to partner with legendary sportscaster Dave Johnson and D.C United in the fight against MS” said Melissa Dueñas Leidos senior vice president. “With Dave leading the way we hope to further groundbreaking research to find a cure.”

Quantic School of Business and Technology

“I am a hard-working professional who is adventurous driven and loves to take risks.”

City State Country: Canberra ACT Australia

Fun fact about yourself: I love all things water-sports whether it’s wakeboarding windsurfing water skiing or even the ‘frozen’ water-sports — skiing and snowboarding.

Undergraduate school and major: Curtin University of Technology Bachelor of Commerce Accounting and Finance

Current Employer and Job Title: Leidos Australia Project Manager

Why did you choose an online format like Quantic? I like working in a more agile sense learning iteratively at a different pace when it suits me. I live a busy life by choice. Between work socializing and board meetings it’s hard to find time to sit down and watch a long lecture or sit through a long class. This format helps me fit in studying in my personal time so that I have more of a work study and life balance.

I also chose the program for the community of other students and alumni around the world who I can connect and collaborate with. The diversity of thought is something I’m really excited to learn from and contribute to in group assignments and throughout this experience.

Notwithstanding the format and programming allows me to continue to work and invest in my career whilst I study and work towards achieving my MBA.

Aside from your classmates what was the key part of Quantic’s programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? I think it was the amount of information and how it’s structured along with being able to move at your own pace and start topics early if you desire. The information available to me was a key factor in my decision. The lessons are continually growing and updated. The fact that Quantic students are lucky enough to have access to this information even after graduation effectively allows me to continue to learn. With the rate at which our world is changing having access to updated and relevant information is incredibly important to ensure we are well informed and educated in respective matters.

Give us an example of a lesson you gained during your Quantic MBA and how did you apply it at work? I think a key takeaway from my experience to date is learning that the traditional methods aren’t always the best. It’s important to embrace changes and do things differently such as the way this MBA is being run.

Quantic is a highly competitive and only about 10% of students who apply to the MBA program are admitted. What advice would you give to someone who intends to apply to Quantic to increase their odds of being accepted?

I was very hesitant to apply personally but decided to give it a go. I think just giving it a go is important! In the past year I had done a significant amount of professional development in terms of taking industry courses and took advantage of every learning opportunity available to me. I think an attitude towards growth and development is key to display throughout the process. Also research as much as you can and don’t forget to do your business foundations courses.

What achievement are you most proud of as an MBA Student and why? I think just taking the risk and applying for the program. I was unsure whether I would get in.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career and why? In my professional career I think I’m most proud of the risks I’ve taken. I took a significant time off work to take an opportunity to study at Stanford University for a semester which proved to be one of the most rewarding experiences and changed my career path.

I also made a significant pivot having studied accounting and finance and then moving to the other side of the country during COVID to start a graduate position in project management in a city where I knew only one person. This experience spurred huge growth personally and technically and gave me the opportunity to grow and really kick start my career. I’ve also been recently nominated for an industry award which is very exciting to get recognition for all the hard work I’ve put in over the past 18 months.

What is your ultimate long-term professional goal and how has your MBA studies helped you make progress in this area? I don’t necessarily have a long-term professional goal. I think there is a beauty in the unknown and not having a set goal so to speak which enables you to explore opportunities you may not have previously considered. I’m very much someone who is driven to achieve although don’t have a specific goal so to speak in mind. I’m motivated by participating and working on projects that I’m passionate about with amazing and talented colleagues driving impact and being challenged to continually improve. Whether this is growing my leadership or technical skills I want to continue to grow and develop in all aspects of my life career or otherwise.

(Brian Hockensmith Photography / Courtesy PromoWest Productions)

The so-called secondary markets may not have the cachet of New York Los Angeles or Chicago but regardless of the term one uses to describe midsize and smaller cities they can be key cogs in the gearworks of live tours like the current Guns N’ Roses outing with robust ticket sales and an outsized economic and cultural impact.

When it comes to navigating the quirks of Albuquerque or doing business in Birmingham agents talent buyers and venue operators balance the challenges and opportunities present in their respective markets often thanks to years or even decades of experience bringing in bands comedians family entertainment and more.

CHART: Tickets Sold and Grosses From a Selection of Secondary Markets

So what’s a secondary concert market? There’s not a tidy list to go by but one thing we kept in mind as we picked markets for our chart and discussed in this story: They’re not stops on all the major national tours but they’re on some or most of them and competing for nearly all of them.

The markets discussed here fall between roughly a million and 2 million people in population. The vast majority accounted for 1 million to 4 million tickets sold 2015-19 according to Pollstar box-office reports. Total grosses varied more widely affected as you might expect by differences in the cost of living around the country.

Perhaps most important: This is not a complete list but a selection of markets that fit our criteria and allow us to tell the story of the issues that secondary markets across the U.S. are facing.

Factors from availability capacity past performance and personal relationships are all contributing factors in the calculus of tour routing says Todd Hunt formerly executive director of BancorpSouth Arena and Conference Center in Tupelo Mississippi and now senior vice president of Venue Coalition a group that helps smaller arenas and theaters book events.

“It comes down to whether the venue can sell tickets” said Hunt whose been a talent buyer for more than 30 years.

Knowing the strengths of respective markets is key he says but some things hold true regardless.

“Country is traditionally strong in secondary markets as are family shows” Hunt said. “Classic rock also works and we’re seeing an increase in urban shows. Typically the smaller the market the closer to the mainstream the show needs to be. It’s hard to sell niche acts at the arena level in markets with smaller population bases.”

Hunt says family shows like Disney on Ice Monster Jam Blippi and Baby Shark have done solid business so far in 2021 and have “led the way in terms of ticket selling success stories” as secondary market venues reopen and tours resume following the pandemic shutdown.

“We don’t like to think of ourselves as a secondary market. We like to think of ourselves as becoming a major — maybe not an A+ market but maybe an A-.” — MIKE GATTO COLUMBUS ARENA SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

Smaller markets actually enjoy some advantages over larger counterparts including lower costs for labor and media Hunt said.

And when a big act does come through it generates excitement that might be diluted in a bigger city.

“There’s also generally less traffic so events can stand out more as opposed to competing for attention in the larger markets” he said. “And during the pandemic many markets in the middle of the country weren’t saddled with the same restrictions that venues on the coasts endured. This allowed them to attract shows (and fans) that wanted to get back out on the road.”

Hunt says he never imagined a day when the entire touring industry would shut down and now knows “more about infectious diseases transmission rates sanitization air quality congressional lobbying efforts and many more topics” that weren’t part of his knowledge base prior to March 2020.

“I now know more than ever that live events are an integral part of our human existence” he said. “Months of living in our bubbles watching events on flat screens reinforced the notion that nothing compares to the live experience which is great news for our industry.”

Joining with other venues and promoters to package tour stops is another way for secondary markets to make themselves more attractive to agents some promoters and talent buyers say.

Ryan Northcott vice president of entertainment and development for LAFC and Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles suggests all venues but especially those in secondary markets are wise to make shows as turnkey as possible without adding additional charges “to have content come in and go right back out to the next town.”

A venue in a particular market that builds a reputation for marketing shows well has the upper hand over those that can’t step up to the plate in that regard according to Northcott who has booked arenas and stadiums in markets large and small and managed Citizens Business Bank Arena (now Toyota Arena) in Ontario California east of Los Angeles.

“You just keep your head on a swivel and you stay in the game” Northcott said.

“Those theater operators or club operators whatever it might be that are really engaged that really help out those are the ones that do best” he said. “Buildings in smaller markets may be where artists go to rehearse. You become a rehearsal house and that’s an opportunity. That artist is in your place you’re taking care of them you’re making them comfortable and you never know when an opportunity presents itself.”





INDIANAPOLIS

One of those markets that could be considered secondary in name only Indianapolis benefits from its central location between major tour stops in Chicago Detroit and Nashville. From Lucas Oil Stadium to venues like Ruoff Music Center (originally Deer Creek Music Center) in Noblesville the Crossroads of America as Indiana’s state capital is known gets its share of top acts says Dan Kemer former president of Live Nation’s regional office in Indiana and now vice president of programming at the Center for the Performing Arts in Carmel Indiana.

“We are very fortunate to be in a great area geographically for a lot of tours. We’re a few hours from Chicago we’re a few hours from Cincinnati a few hours from St. Louis and a few more from Cleveland and Detroit” Kemer said. “We’re in a unique situation in Indianapolis in that for a lot of tours whether it’s a primary tour or secondary route we have a lot of opportunities to pick up dates coming through here whether it’s artists working from the East Coast looking to get to St. Louis or Denver as a launching pad to get to the West Coast or north and south working their way down to Atlanta.”

Musical tastes in Indianapolis and across the Midwest have traditionally leaned heavily toward rock and country but times have changed Kemer says.

“I would say 20 years ago that was very relevant based on powerhouse radio stations in different markets whether it be in Indianapolis or Cleveland or Cincinnati but with terrestrial radio and Spotify and SiriusXM it really has leveled the playing field on different artists” he said. “You no longer have to wait to hear the top song in the Top 40 from a particular radio station.”

Still Kemer describes the dominant Midwest musical diet as “meat and potatoes.”

“They love their rock and roll their classic rock” he said. “Indianapolis in large part due to WTTS is a pretty dominant Triple A station in the country. You do see a lot more Americana that does very well in Indianapolis compared to other markets that may not have a strong Triple A station. You see an artist like the Avett Brothers. Huge here in Indianapolis and now with terrestrial radio they are doing great everywhere but Indianapolis was an early champion of the Avett Brothers.”

Eric Neuburger stadium director at Lucas Oil Stadium notes that “half the U.S. population lives within a one-day drive of Indianapolis” and for many of them country and rock still reign.

“So in addition to our strong local market we often host scores of traveling fans” he said.

“Our most successful concerts have been country music acts such as Kenny Chesney and broadly popular acts such as Taylor Swift and U2. Our biggest challenge for booking large concerts is our schedule full of football trade shows marching band competitions and other premier sporting events.”

The stadium’s connectivity with the Indiana Convention Center positions it “as a prime venue for the largest trade shows and conventions that Indianapolis hosts.”

“We’ve also found success with youth sports marching band and drum corps as well as traditional sporting events” Neuburger said.

Lucas Oil Stadium benefits from Indianapolis’ “large-market feel in a tight downtown footprint with walking access to hotels restaurants and other entertainment venues” he said.

“Our community was purposely built to host the world’s largest events without the need to rent a car” Neuburger said.

As for coping with the pandemic Neuburger says operations proceeded under CDC guidelines in what he described as “a measured approach” that saw Lucas Oil Stadium host the entire Big Ten Conference men’s basketball tournament (after it was moved from United Center in Chicago) and a large number of NCAA men’s basketball tournament games.

With protocols in place Indianapolis was able to successfully host NCAA March Madness “with roughly 25% of those games played at Lucas Oil Stadium including all Elite Eight and Final Four games” Neuburger said adding that “being flexible relying on long established relationships (and) mutual problem solving were the difference maker in event property owners choosing Lucas Oil Stadium for their most important events during the most challenging times.”

The stadium has a full calendar of music booked for the back end of 2021 and Neuburger says he and his staff “remain poised to adjust to whatever the pandemic throws at us.”



ALBANY NEW YORK

The Big Apple might get all the glory but New York is home to multiple other strong music markets. Among them is the state capital of Albany about three hours north of New York City which is one of the most reliable tour stops in the Northeast and sold 2.78 million tickets for a gross $137.9 million between 2015 and 2019 according to Pollstar data.

Key players in the capital city itself include Times Union Center the configurable arena that in recent years has hosted everything from televangelist Joel Osteen to the rapper DMX and the Palace Theatre a staple for major comics like Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock as well as esteemed musicians including Bob Dylan and David Byrne.

But $58.2 million of the market’s $137.9 million figure stemmed from Saratoga Springs the enclave of 30000 about 45 minutes north of Albany which is home to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. With rock and pop programming curated by Live Nation the amphitheater is hallowed ground for jam fans: The top 22 box office reports for the venue in Pollstar’s database are held by either Phish or Dave Matthews Band.

But the venue is also acultural and community institution bringing ballet classical jazz and world music to the 55-year-old amphitheater and local affiliates like Skidmore College and Caffè Lena the enduring 110-seat coffeehouse that once hosted folkies like Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan.

“This is one of the most culturally vibrant small cities anywhere in North America” said Elizabeth Sobol who took over as SPAC president and CEO in 2016. “It’s a really extraordinary place. with people who are just music crazy and 365 days a year there is a very thriving live music scene here that runs the gamut from jazz to funk to punk and rock to kind of everything.”

While SPAC’s rock programming garners much of the attention – and Sobol emphasized the boon to the local economy such high-profile touring artists provide – it’s more influential regionally than some amphitheaters elsewhere in the country. And she reminded while plenty of out-of-towners pour in for artists like Phish there’s still a sizable local clientele that attends both rock programming and more eclectic fare like New York City Ballet the Philadelphia Orchestra and Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival.

“There is not a single person you would meet on the streets in Saratoga that doesn’t have a memory — and 99.9% of them are fond fond deep personal memories – about SPAC” Sobol said.

In major markets like New York City “you put something really wonderful together and then it makes a tiny little raindrop in the ocean” she continued. “Here everything that we do is important to the community. You literally feel a community galvanized around an organization and that’s incredibly gratifying.”

Plus when attracting both fans and talent Saratoga Springs and the Albany market more broadly have some perks.

“You’re three hours from Boston three hours from Montreal and you’re 30 minutes from Lake George one of the most beautiful lakes in America and 45 minutes from 6 million acres of Adirondack parkland – and nobody knows that!” Sobol said. “How is it that people don’t realize this unbelievable incomparable confluence of awesomeness here in Saratoga?’”





KANSAS CITY MISSOURI

Shani Tate Ross vice president sales and marketing at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City Missouri says the variety of performance spaces available in that market — “from clubs and theaters/amphitheaters to T-Mobile Center and Arrowhead Stadium” — make for a robust live entertainment environment.

“From legacy and heritage acts to newcomers there are countless examples of artists from all genres — Maroon 5 Drake Ed Sheeran Taylor Swift all come to mind quickly — that have grown from playing 200 seat clubs to arenas and eventually stadiums” she said. “Kansas City is conveniently located at the intersection of North/South (I-35 & I-29) and East/West highways making it an easy stop for tours being routed from Canada to Texas and East Coast to West Coast.”

More than 9 million people are within a four-hour drive of Kansas City which is a gateway of sorts to and from other large touring markets like Dallas Denver St. Louis Chicago Minneapolis and others within an eight-hour drive Tate Ross said.

“At T-Mobile Center we have been fortunate to consistently book everything from rock to hip-hop classical R&B to family shows” she said.

“By drawing from the 3 million people in the metro (area) as well as being a destination for smaller cities nearby Kansas City is regarded as a hub in the Midwest” she said. “The last 18 months have been difficult for our industry. Moving forward emerging from the pandemic presents artists promoters and venues the opportunity to re-evaluate how to meet the needs of guests and fans based on new habits and consumption patterns.”

T-Mobile Center works with David Gerardi of Live Nation and Mike DuCharme of AEG Presents who also book the area’s amphitheaters including Azura Amphitheatre in Bonner Springs Kansas and the outdoor stage across from T-Mobile Center in the Kansas City’s Power & Light Entertainment District Tate Ross said.





COLUMBUS OHIO

“We don’t like to think of ourselves as a secondary market” Mike Gatto said. “We like to think of ourselves as becoming a major – maybe not an A+ market but maybe an A-.”

Gatto senior vice president at Columbus Arena Sports and Entertainment which oversees the Ohio city’s two arenas Schottenstein Center and Nationwide Arena has a point. With a population just over 900000 Columbus ranks as the Buckeye State’s most populous city and the 14th largest in the country while its metropolitan area tallies 2.1 million second to only Cincinnati within Ohio. From 2015 to 2019 4.16 million tickets were sold in the market for a gross of $238.6 million according to Pollstar data.

Columbus’ transformation into one of the Midwest’s strongest markets began in the ‘80s and Scott Stienecker who founded regional powerhouse promoter PromoWest in 1984 was instrumental in its evolution.

That year Stienecker who had recently graduated from Ohio State caught wind that the beloved 2000-capacity Agora Ballroom was set to close and intervened to save the venue. Rechristened as Newport Music Hall the room today touts itself as “the longest continually running rock club in the country” and has hosted a who’s who of rock and roll including Neil Young Pearl Jam and Green Day.

“Every band in the industry has played there” Stienecker said.

In 1994 PromoWest opened Polaris Amphitheater in Columbus in conjunction with Indianapolis’ Sunshine Promotions making the market more attractive for major summer tours.

“Columbus people would all drive to either Cleveland to Blossom [Music Center] or they’d drive to Cincinnati to Riverbend [Music Center]” Stienecker said. “Once we built Polaris Amphitheater Columbus went from secondary to almost a primary because it became a stop for all these big tours.”

Schottenstein Center and Nationwide Arena opened in 1998 and 2000 respectively providing the market with two modern arenas. By then Robert Sillerman and SFX Entertainment had purchased Polaris and when Stienecker learned the concert magnate was eyeing Newport as well PromoWest devised what eventually became Express Live! an innovative indoor-outdoor venue that offered a “bigger Newport” (2200 capacity) and a “smaller Polaris” (5000 capacity).

Opened in late 2001 the venue provided a middle tier between Columbus’ clubs and theaters and its arenas establishing the market as a viable stop for tours of all sizes.

The city’s arenas host multiple sports teams – Ohio State basketball and hockey at the Schott and the NHL’s Blue Jackets at Nationwide – but still find time for plenty of music. About a decade ago the two arenas united under the CASE banner joining forces to further increase the market’s appeal at the arena level.

“One of my goals for the last 10 years maybe longer is to make Columbus a must-play market” Gatto said. “We want to be the first play in Ohio and if there’s only one play in Ohio the only play in Ohio.”

Gatto cited a sold-out six-show Garth Brooks run that moved upwards of 90000 tickets at Schottenstein in 2016 as a career highlight as well as two-night stands by Taylor Swift (2015) and hometown heroes Twenty One Pilots (2019) at Nationwide.

“It’s pretty special when you get to do multiples in an arena” Gatto said. “Just people having the confidence in Columbus that we can sell two dates that we’re with the big boys like Chicago and New York and Dallas.”

CASE also stages shows periodically at the massive Ohio Stadium including The Rolling Stones in 2015 – “the most iconic rock band and the most iconic college stadium” in Gatto’s words.

In 2018 AEG acquired a controlling stake in PromoWest but Columbus isn’t AEG’s town; Schottenstein and Nationwide are both open shops partnering with Live Nation AEG Outback and Feld and promoting shows independently if the situation calls for it. Rock country rap and EDM are the four cornerstone genres in the market according to Stienecker.

“There’s a lot of rock history in Columbus” Stienecker said. “It’s a great music city.”





SAN ANTONIO

Steve Zito general manager of the Alamodome was at the stadium for eight years after it opened in 1993 before taking a job with the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA where he was involved in the development of AT&T Center which opened in 2002. Zito managed the arena its first four years before moving out of the market for 12 years when he ran Memphis’ FedEx Forum for five years and later spent six years with Andy Frain Services a crowd management firm. In 2018 he moved back to the Alamodome where he started a second stint as general manager.

“It’s a very competitive market I would say we are on the larger side of secondary markets but we’re also in Texas” Zito said.

“When it comes to stadium shows we’re competing with Houston and Dallas and then from the arena side same thing: Houston Dallas” he said. “Austin will enter that market with the new Moody Center. It’s a very competitive landscape here in Texas. Years ago there were more acts than there were venues and today it’s almost as if there are more venues than there are acts.”

San Antonio’s long history as a strong concert market dates back to the old HemisFair Arena the Spurs’ home from 1972-92 “which was a pretty busy venue” Zito said.

“San Antonio has a great reputation for rock and roll heavy metal Tejano and has proven itself to be a strong market for arena acts” he said. “Obviously the storied history of San Antonio the culture the Riverwalk — it’s an awesome city. The people here are so friendly. It’s a walking city. You can go from hotel rooms to the venues particularly downtown and the Alamodome. Everybody that comes here wants to come back. In some ways it’s a great kept secret and we keep letting the story out one show at a time.”

Those shows take place at a plethora of venues from the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts to the historic Aztec and Majestic theaters or the Paper Tiger club (formerly White Rabbit) among others.

Promoter Blayne Tucker owner of San Antonio bar The Mix said the market has improved over the past 10 years for emerging and independent bands but “overall there’s still a lot of work to do” to reach its potential in competing against Austin 80 miles away.

“It’s going to continue to be a challenge as long as (San Antonio) misses a lot of first looks on emerging artists on their first run in Austin” he said. Austin has one of the highest ticket presale rates in the country Tucker said and venues and promoters in Texas’ capital city are able to pay artists more money. San Antonio by comparison has a comparatively weak rate of presales.

“There’s a bigger risk and San Antonio has no Triple A radio stations whereas Austin has two” Tucker said.

“So what happens is an agent that sits in New York or L.A. will get an offer on a show and an agent will look at it and say ‘But we’re getting $500 in Austin. I don’t see why you’re only offering $250. You’re only 80 miles away.’ In reality it’s 80 miles away but they are two different worlds and markets. An agent doesn’t understand that. All they see is just the money in front of them.”

The disparity only grows when acts come through a second time commanding a higher price.

“Now that band is worth $1000 in Austin but they’re still only worth $250 in San Antonio and you don’t ever get to play catch up at that point” Tucker said.

Tucker would like to see more packaging of emerging acts for tours across Texas.

The Austin-San Antonio disparity “will continue to be a problem until there is a better level of communication between small club owners in both markets Tucker said.

“There’s some improvement but with things still under clouds of the delta (coronavirus) variant and all this other stuff it’s hard to get a good read on how things are going to be going forward.”

The ominous HH washed out what was supposed to be a triumphant night for NYC — more than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic shook the Big Apple — at the We Love NYC: The Homecoming Concert on the Great Lawn of Central Park on Saturday night.

Midway into the concert — as Barry Manilow belted out “I Can’t Smile Without You” — the heavens opened up and pre-Henri arrived several hours earlier than expected with the rain and lightning threat putting an end to what was turning into an epic event.

It was as if Mother Nature was saying it was “too soon” to be celebrating overcoming COVID with cases rising due to the Delta variant. Mother was very much telling us “We’re not home yet.”

In fairness when the star-studded concert — produced by music industry legend Clive Davis and concert-biz behemoth Live Nation — was announced last month by Mayor Bill de Blasio things seemed to be trending in a much more positive direction for New York but with COVID cases rising — even with some breakthrough positive tests among the vaccinated — there was some concern that we were not ready to be partying in the park like that quite yet even if proof of vaccination was required for entry.

But when the sun came out just before the concert started at 5 p.m. — with a yellow-dressed Gayle King pretty much symbolizing it — it truly seemed as if brighter days were ahead. The “CBS This Morning” host introduced the New York Philharmonic who added a level of gravitas and grandeur to the proceedings: We were coming together to have a serious moment of recognition of all that we had survived before all of the fun began.

Then when Andrea Bocelli — the Italian tenor who himself battled COVID early last year — sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” backed by the Philharmonic it rang a resounding note throughout Central Park. It was as if he didn’t even need a mic as he implored us to “Walk on walk on with hope in your heart.”

And as if to show us all the challenges that we have overcome the blind singer even played the flute before telling us “After a storm comes always the sun.”

After that emotional moment came Jennifer Hudson who fresh off of her Aretha Franklin biopic “Respect” opening last week showed that she was not to be outdone by Bocelli. Paying tribute to the Queen of Soul she performed “Nessun Dorma” the aria that Franklin famously sang at the Grammys in 1998 as a last-minute replacement for Luciano Pavarotti.

It was a regal performance for the ages — with a final high note would surely make it hard to top.

Still the concert was just getting started. And there were plenty of other early highlights from an ageless Carlos Santana “Smooth”-ing it out with Rob Thomas — and a Great Lawn full of concertgoers grooving in the grass — to Journey reminding us even in the face of a global pandemic to “Don’t Stop Believin’.”

And then came what in any ol’ regular Central Park concert might have been the finale: LL Cool J and a host of other New York hip-hop legends — including Busta Rhymes Fat Joe and Rev. Run of Run-DMC — rocked the stage in a performance that ran from Busta’s “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” and Fat Joe’s “Lean Back” to LL’s own classic “Mama Said Knock You Out.”

Then de Blasio came out to a chorus of boos before introducing the legendary R&B band Earth Wind & Fire. And the elements truly took over after their performance with Hurricane Henri stopping the night before the Killers Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon could even take the stage.

While CNN teased that the concert might begin again — perhaps with no audience and some holdouts who refused to leave — eventually Anderson Cooper called it a wrap: The Homecoming was officially gone. And in what is probably the worst-case scenario the drenched — and drunk — concertgoers flooded the subway many without masks wondering when they could feel home again.

Rain and thunder brought a halt to the city’s comeback concert at Central Park on Saturday night but not before more than two hours of revelry in the face of incoming Hurricane Henri.

Thousands of New Yorkers partied liked it was 2019 on the Great Lawn hitting a hopeful note late in the second summer of COVID until the storm arrived in the middle of Barry Manilow’s set.

Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon were among those yet to play before the weather took center stage.

Carlos Santana and Wyclef Jean perform during “We Love NYC: The Homecoming Concert” in Central Park on Saturday.

The show was meant to herald the return of New York City even as Henri barreled toward the Northeast. The wet weather arrived earlier than expected however.

“It sucks because we came to see Springsteen” said Adam Thayer a 38-year-old TV producer who lives on the Upper East Side as he stood near an exit. “It’s hit after hit but the one thing you can’t challenge is Mother Nature.”

Still he added “It was fun to see everyone out. It was kind of incredible.”

And John Assad 62 who traveled from New Hampshire to see the concert said he didn’t regret the trip. Walking toward Fifth Ave. through the rain he said even the shortened event was “wonderful.”

“If that’s all that was planned” he said “that would have been a great show.”

Organizers tried to wait out the weather before officially pulling the plug around 10:20 p.m. ending what had started as a festive event.

LL Cool J performed during the rain-shortened show.

Throngs of vaccinated music fans — some masked most not — filed into the 55-acre field long before the first act. Concert staff asked for proof of shots at the gates.

Concertgoers draped beach towels over the grass on a sticky hot evening in Manhattan. They scouted out spots in the shadow of a stage and light display that screamed “NYC” in imposing lettering.

Brooklyn-raised music mogul Clive Davis booked the show’s star-studded lineup a list that also included opera tenor Andrea Bocelli rapper LL Cool J and guitar genius Carlos Santana.

Bocelli one of the first acts sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” which became a pandemic anthem with its optimistic encouragements for the lonely. “We crossed a terrible storm this year” Bocelli told the crowd.

Not long after Santana performed a boisterous rendition of “Maria Maria” as New Yorkers swayed. Also on the bill were punk powerhouse Patti Smith and hip-hop star Wyclef Jean.

Davis 89 said ahead of the concert that the selections were intended to “do justice to the full range of great New York music.”

The event broadcast on CNN and branded the “Homecoming Concert” began at 5 p.m. culminating a week of concerts across the five boroughs in celebration of New York’s comeback.

Mayor de Blasio took the stage in a plastic rain poncho as concertgoers were asked to leave because of approaching bad weather.

The city coordinated the concert along with Davis and Live Nation an entertainment company. Many tickets were free though passes were tricky to acquire.

Mayor de Blasio proud of the city’s rebound from a crisis that in the spring of 2020 turned its streets grim and ghostly crowed for weeks about the concert. And he appeared fired up when he took the stage shortly after 7 p.m.

“This is the greatest concert in the history of New York!” de Blasio thundered. “Let’s thank the front-line workers of New York City who brought us back.”

Many celebrities made appearances. Stephen Colbert host of “The Late Show” was spotted dancing on the grounds with Sen. Chuck Schumer who lives in Brooklyn.

Balloons and beach balls bounced above the crowds on the Great Lawn. A palpable sense of joy overcame the ongoing threat posed by the ultra-contagious COVID delta variant. And locals came from far and wide to soak in the celebration.

Al Cartagena 55 traveled from the Throgs Neck neighborhood in the Bronx to see the concert which he said was a once-in-a-lifetime moment for him and his wife.

They dished out about $88 apiece for their tickets he said and took the subway and the bus to get to the park by around 2:30 p.m.

Early on it seemed music fans would see a full show. The sun peeked out from behind the clouds and washed Central Park in golden light.

But as the concert continued the skies above the park slowly darkened to an ominous shade of gray.

And by the time the Brooklyn-born Manilow wearing a white jacket and a black shirt regaled the crowd with a singing of “Copacabana” around 7:30 p.m. a sense of anxiety was growing in the park.

After he lurched from “Mandy” into “Can’t Smile Without You” his mic cut out and a voice over the loudspeaker asked concertgoers to head to the exits for their safety.

The mayor still sanguine came over the PA system and promised “We’re going to bring the concert back” while urging people to find cover.

But de Blasio’s optimism couldn’t ward off the incoming monsoon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2RldHJvaXQuZWF0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvOC80LzIyNjEwMjQxL21hZ2ljLWJhZy1tYXJibGUtYmFyLWZpbG0tbGFiLW1hc29uaWMtcmVxdWlyZS1wcm9vZi1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXRlc3QtZGV0cm9pdC1taWNoaWdhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Metro Detroit Bars Require Proof of COVID Vaccination or Test,"The Magic Bag Royal Oak Music Theatre The Masonic Temple Small’s bar the Film Lab and Planet Ant venues now require proof of vaccination status or a negative COVID test within 24 hours for entry to the entertainment venues. In Ann Arbor Michigan and State theaters will begin requiring all guests older than 12 to require the same as of Friday August 27.

Similar requirements will go into place on Wednesday September 1 at El Club which will accept a photocopy of a vaccination card as proof. Because El Club is an all-ages venue the new requirements extend to children younger than 12. Those too young to receive the vaccine must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test before entering the venue.

The recent moves by the venues for live music followed Detroit’s Marble Bar which on July 26 became the first to require patrons to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test to gain admittance to its venue. Several of the venues cited the Delta variant which is considered far more contagious as cause for new guidelines.

Live Nation one of the nation’s largest concert promoters also has new COVID entry guidelines for both artists and guests. It operates three venues in Michigan: The Fillmore and Saint Andrew’s Hall/The Shelter in Detroit and GLC Live at 20 Monroe in Grand Rapids. Live Nation shows aren’t limited to those venues so keep an eye on the rules when you buy tickets. AEG Presents the parent company for the Masonic and the Royal Oak theater also instituted a new policy for all of its venues nationwide. So far restaurants haven’t followed suit.

The Magic Bar which reopened in July 2021 after 16 months of a shutdown said on its Facebook page that the moves were to “protect staff the public and to alleviate anxiety” over the COVID-19 Delta variant “for the time being.” Magic Bag owner Carey Dengha returned to work and to singing with the Mega 80s in July after contracting COVID last spring the Oakland Press reported. He used his own funds to keep the club afloat while awaiting a federal grant.

Michigan COVID-19 cases continue to rise as state officials on Friday reported 4197 cases over the previous two days and a positive test rate of 8.4 percent. Approximately 41 percent of Detroiters had received at least one vaccine dose through August 12 compared to 59.2 percent in the state of Michigan.

In recent years hologram tours of music icons have been a growing industry. From Whitney Houston and Buddy Holly to Roy Orbison could Elvis Presley be next? A malfunctioning hologram of The King singing appeared in Blade Runner 2049 but what about in real life?

Well at this year’s Elvis Week Managing Partner of Graceland Holdings Joel Weinshanker shared that The King wasn’t a fan of the idea and so don’t expect a hologram tour anytime soon. Joel said: “It’s important that we establish and put forth things that Elvis would want. “The money doesn’t matter. We will not do anything that we believe Elvis wouldn’t want. “And that includes something like a hologram because I can tell you I chase people off with a stick who want to make a hologram of Elvis.” READ MORE: Elvis Presley CGI recreation movie scrapped for THIS reason

READ MORE Elvis movie: Graceland updates on Baz Luhrmann’s ‘lush’ biopic Joel continued: “Besides the fact that I don’t think they’re good the reason we won’t do a hologram is because Elvis had a conversation with three or four people and I’ve spoken with every single person in the room. “And it’s obvious that he didn’t like them never wanted to be one thought it was kitschy didn’t think it was real. “What he realised is there was no soul in it. At the end of the day there’s no soul in a hologram. It’s soulless. By definition it is. For me when I can watch Elvis when I can hear Elvis that’s Elvis. Everything else is a pale imitation.” Interestingly Priscilla Presley isn’t opposed to the idea if the technology vastly improves one day.

Elvis timeline

Appearing on This Morning in 2019 while promoting Elvis In Concert – Live on Screen Priscilla said of a potential hologram tour: “No it hasn’t progressed really to what I feel would be him. It’s very difficult to get his image.” “Very difficult because the way they do holograms is putting bits and pieces together. “But I think you’re seeing the real deal on this screen. I don’t think a hologram can really match what you’re seeing. “I haven’t really seen it that perfected. I’m not saying it’ll never be around because it may progress on everybody really. But right now it’s not in progress.” DON'T MISS

“All of that is coming out of this campus” said Richard Ambrose executive vice president of Lockheed’s space division of the company’s Waterton campus southwest of Denver’s suburbs. “It’s important to the local economy.”

It’s there about 6000 employees of the space division work to design test and build spacecraft integral to NASA’s future missions to the moon Mars and long-range space exploration. There are about 9000 space division employees who work from locations in Boulder the south metro Denver area and down to Colorado Springs. Lockheed has about 11000 employees statewide.

The campus also houses the $128-million 40000-square-foot GPS III processing facility where engineers will build up to 32 GPS III satellites for U.S. Space Force. It’s estimated there are more than 4 billion GPS users worldwide.

“This technology can be used for commercial civil and defense applications” Ambrose said.

Lockheed’s Waterton campus also houses the Space Operations Simulation Center a “ultra-stable test environment for precision instruments and accurate navigation systems used in space vehicles.”

“It’s the most sophisticated facility on the planet” he said.

Lockheed officials are looking forward to the Space Symposium returning to Colorado Springs Aug. 23-26.

“We enjoy coming together to have debates around space” Ambrose said. “That’s the core tradition. It’s a safe place for government academic and industry representatives to discuss the challenges. Over time its gotten a strong international flavor as well.”

Featured Local Savings

As opposed traveling around the country for meetings they enjoy the efficiency of having all those representatives nearby.

“We joke it’s like speed dating – we have like 15 meetings scheduled in two days” he said. “Plus as one of the largest space companies we feel an obligation to help move the space industry forward by helping small companies and students.”

“Capturing the hearts and minds of hearts and minds of young kids by bringing them understanding about the science is really important to us” Ambrose said.

In March NASA’s Perseverance Rover successfully landed on Mars protected by the Lockheed-built aeroshell. It’s the 10th one the company has produced for NASA. It carried rover safely through the Martian atmosphere at speeds of 12500 mph and temperatures as high as 2370 degrees.

Next on the horizon for Lockheed’s Colorado operations: teaming up with General Motors to build NASA’s next-generation lunar vehicle. Developing the vehicle is part of NASA’s Artemis program which hopes to land female and people of color astronauts on the moon. The program challenged the aerospace industry to design a lunar terrain vehicle to carry astronauts farther than the 4.7 miles previous rovers have traveled.

And the team is anxiously awaiting the return of Osiris-REx — short for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security-Regolith Explorer. It left Earth on Sept. 8 2016 aboard Centennial-based United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket. It ""kissed"" the Bennu asteroid in October to collect carbon-rich space dirt (regolith). It’s the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers program.

It’s scheduled to bring the regolith sample back to Earth in September 2023.

The spacecraft destined for the Trojan asteroid near Jupiter named Lucy could launch after Oct. 16 also on a ULA Atlas V rocket.

New Mexico State University

LAS CRUCES - Educational experiences transcend the classroom at New Mexico State University. Students have numerous opportunities to expand on their academic knowledge with programs such as cooperative education internships and education abroad.

For Paulina Galarza participating in the first cohort of the Lockheed Martin co-op program allowed her to experience an engineering work environment while she pursued her bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering. Working in the industry and with colleagues before graduation offers students valuable insight into life as a full-time employee.

“The biggest lesson I learned is that it’s very important to ask questions” Galarza said. “I always thought the questions would end after college but I was mistaken. Asking questions continues to aid my growing career. Additionally I learned the importance of working with others and actually asking for help with tasks.”

After the end of Galarza’s co-op position and her graduation in 2020 Lockheed Martin hired her as a systems engineer on the Double Eagle II program.

Galarza was one of 10 students in the 2019 pilot cohort which required students to pass a series of security clearances prior to a co-op position offer. The process takes approximately 12 to 18 months before students can begin working. The second cohort consists of 16 students and the third cohort is currently being selected.

“Providing the students an opportunity to test drive the work in this particular work environment allows them to exercise what they have learned in the classroom and gain valuable experience working in a diverse multi-generational environment” said Greta Burger systems engineering program manager at Lockheed Martin. “In many cases this type of opportunity can ultimately lead to a full-time position with the company.”

Burger said the collaboration with NMSU helps both organizations. The co-op program allows Lockheed Martin an opportunity to lessen the extended waiting period for the clearance level required and maximize cost saving.

“NMSU provides a great STEM pipeline for new employees in the Las Cruces area” Burger said. “By working with NMSU to develop the co-op program we are fulfilling a need for technical careers in southern New Mexico and providing a pipeline of prepared career-ready employees for our programs.”

“The academic knowledge gained through attending NMSU is a very important part of preparing for a long term career; however in today’s workforce employers are looking for graduates who have also participated in experiential learning opportunities such as co-ops internships education abroad and volunteering because those activities develop the ever important and sought-after soft skills that are extremely valuable when going into a highly competitive field” said Trish Leyba director of NMSU’s Office of Experiential Learning.

“Those soft skills include teamwork problem-solving adaptability communication skills time management interpersonal relations critical thinking and initiative to name a few. Students who engage in a co-op give themselves a greater advantage in building their careers post-graduation” Leyba said.

“I know a lot of students get internships or co-ops whenever possible but it’s okay to participate in experiential learning opportunities during your last summer or even last semester” Galarza said. “Experience is experience no matter when you were able to get it as long as you know what to do with it.”

For students considering co-op programs Galarza suggests contacting NMSU alumni who work at co-op participating companies for advice and valuable insights.

The two stealth fighters are considered the most advanced warplanes on the planet.

The National Interest interviewed a retired Marine Corps Officer and combat veteran David Berke in order to obtain answers to some of the most tantalizing questions on modern stealth jets.

Berke has over the years built a resume that truly deserves admiration. When posted on the Naval Ship the USS John C Stennis he was deployed twice in support of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan commandeering his F/A-18.

Later he got well acquainted with flying the F-22 while serving as the Division Commander in the Test and Evaluation Squadron.

Berke also had the privilege of being the first operational pilot ever to fly and be qualified in the F-35B serving as the Commanding Officer of the Marine Corps’ first F-35 squadron from 2012-2014.

F-22 Raptor Vs F-35 Lightning II

The EurAsian Times had earlier published a detailed comparison of the two stealth fighters.

While the F-35 is a single-seat single-engine stealth multirole fighter jet capable of performing ground attacks and air defense missions the F-22 Raptor is a single-seat twin-engine fifth-generation tactical fighter aircraft specializing in air dominance.

It was in the mid-1990s when the Joint Striker Program was initiated. While the first prototype called X-35 flew in 2000 the F-35 aircraft took its first flight in 2006. Since then the fighter leads the pack among the fifth-generation aircraft and is being used by 14 militaries across the globe.

According to Lockheed Martin as of June 2021 more than 645 F-35s have been delivered operating from 26 bases around the world. Over 1255 pilots and 10030 maintenance staff have been trained on the aircraft.

On the other hand F-22 Raptors are only meant for the US Air Force. The US has federal law over the export of the fighters with the US Government apprehending that such ‘awesome’ designs and technology could fall into the wrong hands.

Additionally the F-22 Raptor has many distinctive features that have been classified by the Pentagon so much so that even its pilots are barred to use its full capabilities in international drills even with close allies.

In terms of stealth technology the F-22 Raptors are considered the stealthiest fighter jets on the planet with the aircraft boasting an even reduced cross radar section than that of the F-35s.

Despite the F-35s being loaded with state-of-the-art features the fighters were built to carry out air-to-ground missions and therefore do not stand a chance against the Raptors when it comes to dogfighting given F-22s are an air-superiority fighter jet.

“The F-35 cannot match the F-22 as an air superiority fighter—it was never designed as such. The US Air Force’s initial plan was for the F-22 to be its high-end air superiority fighter while the F-35 was developed essentially as an air-to-ground strike aircraft capable enough to protect itself.

While the Raptor was designed with advanced stealth and super maneuverability the F-35s were designed to be stealthy with exceptional sensors but with aerodynamic performance only comparable to an F-16 and nowhere near the F-22 Raptor.

While some variants possess the ability of vertical landing/takeoff along with other features the Raptors still trump them when it comes to speed. According to Defense analyst Colin Ritsick writing for the Military Machine

“When it comes to sheer speed the F-35 just can’t keep up. But it wasn’t built to. The F-35 with its air-to-ground combat design is not designed for breakaway speed. It has a top speed of 1.60 Mach and less maneuverability than the F-22 in dogfight scenarios.

“The F-22 can ramp it up all the way to 2.25 Mach. It climbs at a rate of 62000 feet per minute whereas the F-35 climbs at 45000 feet per minute.”

However despite the mismatch in speed the F-35s can still hold their own against non-stealthy fighters.

“The Air Force expects that the F-35 with its stealth and sensors will be able to fill the gaps between flights of F-22s during a large-scale engagement. The F-35 does not have the sheer speed and altitude of the Raptor but it does have excellent sensors and stealth which does afford its decent capability against non-stealthy aircraft” added the National Interest.

What Did The US Veteran Pilot Have To Say

David Berke considers the F-35 the most prolific 5th-gen aircraft in the world. He also quashed concerns regarding similar aircraft being developed by China and Russia although he did recognize that these jets had similar technology and designs.

According to Berke the F-35 has emerged to be a quintessential jet not only due to its stealth capabilities but also numerous other notable modernizations like the information capacity which also deserve adequate recognition.

The development in the arena of information capacity has two layers to it. Firstly its ability to gather the breadth of information available coupled with a broad range of RF spectrum information Electro-optical infrared laser. It increases its ability to operate more broadly and widely than its contemporaries.

But in the era of supplementary navigation these features do not really hit the mark in assuring the unique selling points of the F-35. According to him what makes the F-35 truly unique is its ability to fuse and share the information acquired.

The F-35 offers an amalgamation of these add-ons increasing its sensing capabilities substantially. It offers a data network linked to numerous other F-35s making a vast array of information available to combatants.

It is also capable of combining that information to enhance and increase the fidelity of that information and then shares that with other aircraft in the link offboard sensors that are airborne offboard sensors that are on the ground etc.

He regards the F-35 to be a milestone in aerial combat capable of operating not just as a sensor in the battlespace but also as a quarterback of other systems. It also flaunts a qualified decision-making process both airborne and on the ground which remains unparalleled in the sky.

Its ability to operate in hostile environments coupled with its anti-access aerial denial makes it a stealthy machine to reckon with boasting the capacity to operate in places where the enemy or multiple enemies don’t want us to operate.

Moreover the F-35 is not just capable of independent action due to its unique sensing abilities. It is also capable of sharing data with all aircraft on the network. Its sensor suite advances its capability to disseminate the acquired information outside of areas which stand out of reach of generic aircraft.

The question over the acquisition of any defense machinery is not just its tactical and strategic abilities but also its cost-effectiveness.

Berke recalled his experience working as the only Marine to ever fly the F-22 Raptor and then the F-35. Over the years he had acquired extensive experience in flying fifth-generation jets that made him realize that high operational capability was tantamount to very high cost.

He certainly believes that it isn’t a cheap program. Though he doesn’t find it surprising that production costs have plummeted over the years which he attributes to technological developments and increasing efficiency.

But he doesn’t deem the cost of an aircraft to be a factor of paramount importance. He believes that the real question is how the cost compares to the capability stressing on the unique features offered by the jet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTYzMzIzL2FmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXdhci1taWxpdGFyeS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWNvbXBsZXgtc2NhbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The War in Afghanistan Was a Scam,"There’s a lot of anger and angst in Washington over the Afghanistan withdrawal at the moment as lawmakers of all stripes decry the treatment of those who have been left to face the Taliban; no small amount of effort is being expended to get would-be refugees out of the country. But a significant portion of the teeth-gnashing is in fact emanating from those furious at the slaying of a sacred cash cow. It’s little wonder: The mainstream media is flush with ex-generals and Pentagon habitués who took refuge in cable news green rooms during the war where they enjoyed lucrative second careers as the war industry’s “message force multipliers.”



So if it seems like this week the media has abandoned its pretensions of objectivity and neutrality to fervently plump the Forever Wars you’re not wrong. As Quincy Institute senior adviser Eli Clifton pointed out “The weapons biz also had [financial] ties to 2/3rds of the Afghanistan Study Group currently being cited by The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal editorial boards as offering an alternative to Biden’s withdrawal.” Dig into if you will this week’s Politico story about “Biden’s two tragic Afghanistan missteps” which was “presented by” Lockheed Martin. This has been one fearsomely vertically-integrated military engagement.



In the end this two decade–long calamity was the very thing General Butler described back in 1935: “Conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many” only “a small inside group” ever really knew what this war was about. You can at least credit Osama bin Laden for knowing the score: In one of his propaganda videos he mused about how easy it was to bait the United States into a fight leaving us to “suffer … economic and political losses” without achieving “anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies.” In Afghanistan the goals of all of the agitants were perfectly synergized.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL3RoZS13YXItYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4td2FzLWEtaHVnZS12aWN0b3J5LS1mb3ItdGhlLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY29tcGxleC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The war in Afghanistan was a huge victory — for the military-industrial complex,"Descriptions of Afghanistan's takeover by the Taliban have been packed with histrionic language: ""a stunning rout"" ( The Associated Press ) accomplished with ""breathtaking speed"" ( The New York Times ); a ""spectacular collapse"" ( The Washington Post ); ""a crisis that could have lasting humanitarian and national-security consequences"" ( The Wall Street Journal ).

The news was accompanied by a sudden rush of hand-wringing over the fate that awaits the Afghan people. ""The Taliban insists it has changed. Afghanistan's future hinges on whether that's true"" read one headline in the Washington Post.

But over the last 20 years the future and well-being of ordinary Afghans — continuously bombed starved and displaced by all sides and all armies — have been buried under different headlines. It took a nationwide resurgence of the bearded brutal  cruelly misogynistic Taliban — picture-perfect antagonists for American audiences — to wrench Afghan civilians from the bottom of the priority pile as if life in Afghanistan before last weekend had been a rosy affair.

In addition to watching in horror as the Taliban made themselves comfortable in Kabul's presidential palace much of this coverage bemoaned the war's tactical failures. It was viewed in other words not as a catastrophic decision to have been made in the first place but as a logistical embarrassment.

Yet this meandering ineffectual deadly war — the longest in American history — was a grand victory for one behemoth sector of manufacturing that thrives upon tactical failures and stalemates: the military-industrial complex .

Mainstream coverage of Afghanistan this past week touched a bit on military spending but generally omitted the vast profits accumulated since 2001 by big guns like Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and Raytheon as well as hundreds of smaller and lesser-known defense contractors.

Instead such reports framed the American occupation as a moral imperative. Ever since George W. Bush swaggered into what some call the Heart of Asia — mountainous gorgeous ever-antagonized — the invasion unlike that of Iraq has been seen as a flawed but justified battle against evil: the Taliban al-Qaida and terrorism.

Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter Crash Course.

The initial poster boy for military action of course was Osama bin Laden. But when he escaped into Pakistan — on horseback the story goes — a mere two months after the U.S. started dropping bombs the war was repurposed as a ""feminist mission … to liberate Afghan women from their burqas"" as Arundhati Roy put it in 2002. When the Taliban were beaten out of governance the mission changed again — this time to one of grueling corruption-prone  glacially incremental reconstruction. The U.S. would build Bush said at the time ""an Afghanistan that is free from this evil and is a better place to live."" What this really meant whether or not he knew it was fresh billions — and steady billions — for the Pentagon State Department contractors mercenaries and a host of Afghan warlords and politicians .

The war was ultimately a colossal financial operation with an unfathomable toll in taxpayer dollars and human lives. That it accomplished virtually nothing of political or civic durability only confirms this.

""Largely out of sight our gargantuan military machine is also increasingly out of mind especially when it comes to the ways in which it spends and misspends our money"" Andrew Cockburn wrote in Harper's in 2019.

Indeed the $2.26 trillion that the U.S. spent on Afghanistan is hardly a comprehensible number — its scale obscures the venality at play. But if we hone in on days and months on individual multimillion-dollar contracts awarded to companies supplying explosives helmets boots and armed security guards we can see what the spoils of war really look like.

One only needs to spend a few minutes perusing the Department of Defense's contracts page to get a sense of how much money U.S. taxpayers were allotting daily to the war as recently as July 30. So far this year the Pentagon has given away $225.83 million in contacts for work exclusively intended for Afghanistan and another $498.08 million for work partly in Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly these are small sums in comparison to earlier years when military operations were thriving. In just August and September 2015 the DOD signed away $672.95 million solely for America's ""forever war.""

Days selected at random show us where our money was going in Afghanistan in lieu of strengthening our own schools health care infrastructure and social services:

On Dec. 31 2014 DynCorp International LLC was awarded $100.78 million to train police and army officers at the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior.

On June 22 2016 ​​Harris Corp. received $1.7 billion for ""radios ancillaries spare parts and services.""

On Feb. 14 2017 Propper International Inc. was awarded $32.46 million for ""hot weather combat boots."" A week later Wolverine World Wide Inc. received $17.99 million for ""tan temperate weather combat boots.""

On April 28 2017 ORC Industries Inc. was awarded $20.49 million for wet weather ponchos.

On July 3 2019 AAR Defense Systems & Logistics received $209.96 million to train recruits for the Afghan Air Force among other tasks.

On April 30 2020 L-3 Fuzing and Ordnance Systems Inc. won $64.97 million for an order of multi-option fuzes to trigger mortars.

""I don't think I could overstate that this was a system just basically designed for funneling money and wasting or losing equipment"" said a U.S. veteran with Joint Command which oversaw training of Afghan forces in a wrenching interview with Michael Tracey last month.

The veteran's frustrating (and not at all uncommon) experiences testify to Andrew Cockburn's assertion that ""if we understand that the [military industrial complex] exists purely to sustain itself and grow it becomes easier to make sense of the corruption mismanagement and war and understand why despite warnings over allegedly looming threats we remain in reality so poorly defended.""

To publish tactical analyses by people like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin a former director of Raytheon while ignoring the vast profits accumulated by that company from never-ending wars symbolizes the ingrained failure of the mainstream press to scrutinize our political leaders in ways that matter. When Austin pressed President Biden to preserve a military presence in Afghanistan for example the New York Times reported it with no apparent irony.

Austin was just one of a sizable number of establishmentarian voices urging that the occupation be prolonged in one form or another. Former Secretary Hillary Clinton warned of ""huge consequences"" if troops were to be withdrawn. Former Secretary Condoleezza Rice sagely recommended a sustained counterterrorism mission. Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff foresaw ""some really dramatic bad possible outcomes.""

Jim Mattis who took a short break as a director of General Dynamics to serve as Trump's defense secretary warned that withdrawal from Afghanistan could leave the U.S. vulnerable to threats of terrorism. In the less than two years that Mattis served in Trump's cabinet General Dynamics was awarded $277.66 million for work either fully or partly in Afghanistan.

When we lose sight of the bigger picture — of history cycles agendas and consequences — we can find ourselves seduced by the smaller picture: a bombing here an atrocity there a rifle-toting militant sitting behind an ornately carved presidential desk. We forget who attacked whom first. Who funded whom. Who profited. Who lied. In isolation sensationalized increments capitalize upon our outrage preserving axioms and insulating institutions.

In its editorial last week condemning the fall of Kabul the New York Times solemnly referred to the 20-year occupation as ""a story of mission creep and hubris but also of the enduring American faith in the values of freedom and democracy."" The paper of record's editorial board dwelled on American soldiers lost not Afghan civilians slaughtered. It reserved its rancor for the ""militants"" overrunning the region not the foreign militaries that precipitated its bloody unraveling. It went so far as to lionize the U.S. military as a ""logistical superpower"" able to ""move heaven and earth."" The chaotic scenes of Afghans swarming an American military plane at the Kabul airport the Times observed  ""seemed to capture the moment more vividly than words: a symbol of America's military might flying out of the country even as Afghans hung on against all hope.""

Other influential newspapers also missed the point. The Washington Post questioned Biden's foreign policy credentials — not because of his instrumental support for the catastrophic invasion of Iraq but because of his ""cold"" and ""harsh"" decision to pull out of Afghanistan. The Post worried that Biden's ""callousness … will make it hard to gain allies in the nation's next conflict"" (my own disbelieving italics). It quoted Rep. Michael Waltz a Florida Republican and U.S. Army veteran saying ""Who's going to trust us again?"" — as if the U.S. foreign policy record thus far had been a model of trustworthiness. It even devoted front-page attention to Sen. Lindsey Graham's fears that a Taliban victory might pose new terrorist threats to the United States. That same day the AP reported  Gen. Milley warned senators that the rise of the Taliban might indeed endanger the United States in unforeseen ways.

Neither the AP nor the Post noted that such new ""threats"" usually prompt new bonanzas for defense contractors and new catastrophes for the unlucky civilians who pay the ultimate price for campaigns launched in the names of ""security"" and ""freedom.""

The Wall Street Journal  the AP and others peppered their reportage with (doubtlessly factual) indictments of the Taliban's brutality and its history of violently subjugating women. But the antagonisms ended there. There was no mention of the fact that in 2019 U.S. and Afghan forces killed more civilians than the Taliban did. Or that U.S. and Afghan forces are under investigation by the International Criminal Court for war crimes including rape and torture. Or that a staggering number of deaths and injuries have been inflicted by U.S. drone operations and airstrikes throughout the region. Or that the National Security Agency had been spying on virtually every Afghan with a cell phone. Or that the U.S. decision to re-destabilize the country critically exacerbated the refugee catastrophe (with roughly 6 million Afghans displaced so far). Also swept under the carpet were the Afghanistan Papers  leaked documents that revealed U.S. officials had blatantly lied and fudged reports about the progress of their trillion-dollar project for years.

When it comes to foreign policy American lawmakers seem to be feminists and freedom fighters only when it's convenient. Otherwise human rights and democracy serve as buzzwords and stratagems too easily wielded by a military establishment that believes global problems require military solutions which in return require half of Congress' discretionary spending.

When it comes to the media establishment's selective criticisms of tragedies like Afghanistan and the broader role of the U.S. military — not to mention its often inglorious and sometimes depraved history — it ends up doing the bidding knowingly or otherwise of the world's most moneyed military-industrial complex."

The improvement is quite necessary; the talk about it perhaps not so much.

Lowe may be his own harshest critic.

“Going through a season like this where I’m under-performing and is the team is under-performing as a whole it just takes a toll” Lowe said this week. “If I had to describe it I hate it so much. The mental aspect is something I need to work on. It hasn’t been pretty.”

Back to that in a minute. But first this breaking news: The Rangers won a road game Saturday and by a wide margin. Their 10-1 win over Boston which included a season-high 17 hits was the club’s second largest margin of victory. Only a June 11-run win at the world champion Dodgers was better.

Every Ranger had a hit Saturday including Lowe whose second-inning double was the first of the team’s season-high seven. Lowe eventually scored the first run too. But he also left runners stranded in three later at-bats. And a being a first-baseman means being a run-producer.

There are plenty of jobs up for grabs for 2022; the Rangers did not intend for first base to be among them. But five months into his first full season here we are. He simply has not hit for the power required of a full-time corner infielder. A sub-.400 slugging percentage simply isn’t acceptable at the position.

In particular he’s struggled with fastballs. While his strike-zone discipline and ability to hit offspeed pitches the opposite way have been assets his inability to pull fastballs for power has been his biggest flaw. He hasn’t pulled a fastball for extra bases since late April. He’s pulled just 10 fastballs for hits all year. Lately the situation has become even more pronounced. Lowe has not homered since July 2 regardless of pitch.

On Saturday the left-handed hitting Lowe was able to catch up to a second-inning fastball from Eduardo Rodriguez to double off the Green Monster to begin the Rangers’ first rally of the night. But he struck out in the next two at-bats with runners in scoring position.

It has been a season-long issue. He ranks 10th among the 21 qualifiers at first base in on-base percentage but is next to last in slugging percentage. And as a result 19th in OPS and sliding steadily.

The Rangers have worked with him on trying to get his bat started a little bit more quickly and to keep his top hand from rolling over during his swing. On Wednesday the first of two games this week he was out of the starting lineup Lowe spent batting practice with a bat placed in front of his feet to keep him from closing off his swing and robbing it of extra power. He took the extra step of taking batting practice with two different groups.

“There have just been some mechanical issues there when he tries to lift a ball or tries to pull it” Woodward said. “He kind of comes over the top which creates some inconsistencies with his path. He’s really trying hard to change some old habits. It’s going to take a little time to be honest for that to fully stick. But he’s got to be able to get the fastball in the air. I don’t really care if he pulls them; I just want him to drive them. To be a first baseman in this league obviously he’s got to be able to do that.

“I fully support any change or anything he wants to try in a game right now” Woodward added. “If you feel like you need to get out in front of a fastball or do something that may end up in three swing and misses I’m okay with that. Just as long as I know that he’s trying to create a solution for what he knows he has to do moving forward. Everybody’s got their own journey. This isn’t all sunshine and rainbows.”

It’s not the only project Lowe has been working on either. On Friday when he was also out of the lineup he spent most of the pre-game session working on picks at first base. According to Fangraphs he was at -3 runs saved at first base entering Saturday; only two full-time first baseman were worse.

“I’ll take this year as a learning experience” Lowe said. “But it’s a results-oriented game. I want the front office to see that I can do this job to prove that I can play here and help this team win. There is a month and a half left to do that. That’s what I want badly to do.”

Briefly: RHP Nick Snyder made his MLB debut in the ninth. After falling down 3-1 to his first hitter he came back with a 100.5 mph fastball and then got a grounder. He pitched a perfect inning crossing 100 mph four times. … For the second straight game DJ Peters made a sensational play in center field. On Saturday he went up against the wall for a catch of Rafael Devers’ long drive then made a strong throw from the warning track to double off Kiké Hernandez at first. On Friday he also made a leaping catch on Devers into the wall. … The Rangers signed RHP Buck Farmer to a minor league contract and assigned him to Triple-A Round Rock. Farmer 30 had a 6.37 ERA in 36 appearances (35 1/3 innings) for Detroit this year. … Red Sox officials made no decision on Saturday regarding Sunday’s game. Forecasts related to Hurricane Henri call for rain most of the day with winds in the range of 20-30 mph.

Bellmead City Manager Yost Zakhary said Harbor Freight has designs on the former Gold’s Gym space on North Loop 340 near the I-35 frontage road. The QuikTrip convenience store chain is leveling the old Luby’s cafeteria at that intersection and will begin construction in 90 days Zakhary said.

Abbott Travel Center is nearing completion at Exit 359 of southbound Interstate 35 where Numan Dharani and his business partners are placing a venue for both truckers and travelers. He will sell Exxon-branded fuel products and provide plenty of parking and separate fueling stations for 18-wheelers as well as showers and workout areas for drivers.

A convenience store will sell snacks drinks and novelty items such as souvenirs and fast-food kiosks will offer pizza chicken and tacos Dharani said. He predicts a soft opening in late this month or early next month.

Dharani said his family from the Bryan-College Station area felt such a center along the I-35 corridor represented a good business opportunity.

Truck wash

At New Road and Interstate 35 meanwhile a development group called Rodajo Inc. proposes to place a truck wash for 18-wheelers. Its request for the city to create a Planned Unit Development is wending its way through the permitting process. The Waco City Council approved the latest step on Tuesday city planning director Clint Peters said.

To be called a Landmark Express Exterior Truck Wash the facility would be “aesthetically pleasing” developers wrote in their submitted documents. The 6-acre site would have a deceleration lane detention pond and wash tunnel capable of cleaning a big rig in 7 to 10 minutes well below the accepted average of 45 minutes according to the paperwork. Developers estimate demand would have the wash cleaning 120 trucks every 24 hours.

Construction is estimated to last from December to July.

The truck wash would feature “state of the art water reclamation” and environmentally friendly chemicals according to the supporting documents.

Located at New Road and the northbound frontage road of Interstate-35 the wash would be situated across the interstate from an entertainment complex being developed that includes Topgolf Cinemark and Main Event.

Interestingly Rodajo Inc. lists the distribution centers and manufacturing plants in Waco that generate truck traffic and potential customers. The list includes familiar names such as Tractor Supply the Army and Air Force Exchange Service Mars Wrigley and Owens-Illinois among others. Even the Amazon fulfillment center under construction on Exchange Parkway is included in the rundown.

Lowe’s speculation

But the last name on the list may raise eyebrows. Lowe’s the home improvement chain has “a new distribution center opening soon.”

Sources including a couple in the real estate business said Lowe’s is rumored to have an interest in Waco. One agent said the grapevine he is plugged into suggests Lowe’s looked here and then moved on to another community. He stressed he personally does not know if Lowe’s left Waco behind.

No public announcement by anyone but plenty of speculation.

New CEFCOs

Temple-based CEFCO continues its push into Greater Waco having secured permits to place new convenience stores at 6201 Bagby Ave. near the new Amazon fulfillment center and at 101 W. Moonlight Drive in Robinson.

Earlier this year it opened a new larger store in the 4400 block of Lake Shore Drive where it leveled an older CEFCO location.

A Texas contracting company EBCO is building new CEFCO convenience stores around much of Texas according to its website.

“The fuel and convenience industry has been steadily growing for years but it’s the changing consumer landscape that has shifted customer expectations in this space and led to our growth” CEFCO said in a statement it released in response to questions about its expansion.

CEFCO has put greater emphasis on fresh-food offerings through its CEFCO Kitchen and launched a mobile app and new digital technology according to the statement.

CEFCO Kitchen offers made-to-order food such as burritos tacos and hand-breaded chicken tenders to name a few.

CEFCO said it will continue to evaluate opportunities in key growth markets.

Neighborly’s growth

Waco-based Neighborly a world leader in franchising home service brands has been named to Inc. Magazine’s list of the 5000 fastest growing private companies. A press release says it came in at number 4345.

Neighborly whose campus is located near Cameron Park has more than 4800 franchisees representing its 28 brands—among them Rainbow International Restoration Mr. Rooter Mr. Appliance Mr. Electric GroundsGuys and Shelf Genie according to the Neighborly website.

“Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing” Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk said in the press release.

Companies making the list are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2017 to 2020. They must be U.S.-based privately held for-profit and independent not subsidiaries of other companies as of Dec. 31 2020.

Last month it was announced that New York-based KKR a global investment firm would acquire Neighborly from another New York entity Harvest Partners. Neighborly was founded in 1981 by the late Don Dwyer operating for years as The Dwyer Group. There remains a Dwyer family member employed at Neighborly and another who serves in an advisory position.

“Arthur was very political and he was very right-wing” she explained.

“He was introduced to Ted Heath and to Margaret Thatcher and these were things he was massively proud of.”"

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3Jmay1icmFpbi13b3JtLWtlbm5lZHktc2F0aXJlLXBldHJpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | I'm the worm that ate part of RFK Jr.'s brain and I'm asking for your vote,Good afternoon fellow Americans from the interior of Robert F.

This will bring the group’s portfolio to 43 properties with over 7000 rooms in Turkey by the end of 2022.

The company recently announced two signings under its Four Points by Sheraton brand: the Four Points by Sheraton Istanbul Kagithane which is expected to open this year and the Four Points by Sheraton Elazig which is slated for a 2022 opening.

Marriott is also aiming to meet the demand for long-stay accommodations by debuting its Residence Inn by Marriott brand in Istanbul later this year. Residence Inn by Marriott Istanbul Atasehir will feature suites with fully equipped kitchens and separate living and sleeping areas.

According to the group its premium brands are a “strong driver of growth in the Turkish market”. Two new Autograph Collection hotels will open in Istanbul – The Burdock Autograph Collection this year and Orient Occident Hotel Autograph Collection in 2022.

The Delta Hotels by Marriott brand will also open a new property in Istanbul Levent by the end of this year while next year will see the arrival of a property under the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts brand with the Sheraton Istanbul Esenyurt opening.

Additionally the group has seen interest in its branded residences in Turkey which include The Ritz-Carlton Residences Bodrum – the company’s first standalone branded residences in the EMEA region. The company will open The Ritz-Carlton Residences Istanbul and The Residences at the Sheraton Istanbul Esenyurt in 2022.

Finally the company revealed that it has seen a growth in conversion opportunities – it has signed six conversion deals across the country in the past two years with five of these currently open – and increased interest in converting existing buildings into hotel accommodations. The company has signed four adaptive re-use conversions in Turkey which include the aforementioned The Burdock Autograph Collection.

Begum Kaya Director of Development Turkey at Marriott International commented:

A small list of hotels was excluded from this benefit even during the Marriott Rewards times. SPG had no exclusions outside of Design Hotels. These always appear to surprise many because they are not clearly identified except buried in the T&Cs.

Conclusion

If you look at the list of the excluded hotels they are big city ones likely full of at least previously business travelers and they love nothing else more than to charge a ridiculous amount of money for the breakfast buffet (most profitable F&B operation).

Why would you give it for “free” when you can give $5 worth of points and a large number of elite guests will go for the $50 breakfast expensable for most?

The hotel which is in Nakhon Ratchasima province has been closed since October 2020 after it suffered from the pandemic impact and the economic stagnation.

A fence was built around the front area of the hotel and security guards were hired to watch over for many months before the hotel was put up for sale at THB250 million.



Thai and Japanese investors have expressed interest in the property. But due to bank loan problems the hotel has not yet found a buyer.

The sale of appliances and equipment drew strong interest from the people and some 90 per cent of electrical appliances had already been sold.





The eight-storey Sripattana Hotel was ranked 3.5 stars. It has 183 guest rooms a banquet hall an outdoor pool a karaoke room a traditional massage spa and restaurants.



The hotel was founded by General Kris Sivara the former minister of defence and the former chief of the Royal Thai Army. The hotel opened its doors in 1967 and in 2011 Rathprateep Keeratiurai one of the Nakhon Ratchasima Chamber of Commerce founders made a contract with the owner to manage the hotel on behalf of Korat Sripatana Co Ltd.



Rathprateep had offered the hotel as a temporary Covid-19 treatment facility in March 2020 before the lease expired in September 30 and business was closed due to the impact of the pandemic."

View the current offers here.

There's an airline credit card that may draw snickers and laughs from some but others know how valuable its power can truly be in the quest for very affordable travel. This credit card allows you to earn award flight pool your points together and even achieve elite status solely based on spend. Although the affiliated loyalty program and the credit card have changed drastically this past year this card has literally opened up the country for my retired parents to see and do more than they ever thought possible on a minimal budget. (That is when the airline isn't experiencing multiple operational meltdowns.)

So what card is it?

The magical card is the Free Spirit® Travel More World Elite Mastercard®. While you likely don't have this card in your wallet it's key to earning free flights and money-saving status levels for those who are OK with flying Spirit Airlines — and who understand how to maximize the Spirit frequent-flyer program.

Spirit Airlines credit card basics

There are actually two different Spirit cobranded credit cards: The Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard ($79 annual fee) and the Free Spirit Travel Mastercard (no annual fee).

While the no-annual-fee card might sound enticing we recommend the higher-level card more unless you truly don't fly Spirit often at all. This is because the current welcome offer for new cardmembers includes a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year (and then after that the annual fee is $79). This will allow you to try out the card for the first year for the same no annual fee and see if the benefits are worth it for you and your family for the years following. You'll also earn 40000 bonus points plus a $100 companion flight voucher after spending at least $1000 on purchases within 90 days of opening an account.

Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard cardholders receive the following benefits too:

Spirit points will not expire for cardholders even without activity (benefit for both cards).

Redemption fee waiver for those with the Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard.

Points pooling for themselves and up to eight others (benefit for both cards).

25% rebate on inflight food and beverage purchases when charged to the cards (benefit for both cards).

Shortcut Zone 2 boarding (benefit for both cards).

Earn 1 Status Qualifying Point (SQP) toward status for every $10 charged to Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard.

Earn a $100 companion voucher flight each cardmember anniversary with Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard with $5000 in spending on the cards.

The information for the Spirit Airlines credit cards have been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

While these are overall decent benefits there's one that truly sticks out amongst the rest: The ability to earn 1 Status Qualifying Point (SQP) toward status for every $10 charged to the card.

One big complaint from most travelers is the pesky fees that go along with flying Spirit. While bag fees and seat assignment fees are starting to be a bit more standard these days Spirit even goes as far as to charge you to print your boarding pass during check-in and for soda while on board. You might even find out that the advertised cheap fare you found is triple the price once all of your necessary fees are added into the equation.

Fortunately though with the opportunity to earn SQPs the card on its own can help you achieve status and waive some of those fees. Spirit requires you to earn 2000 SQPs for Silver and 5000 SQPs for Gold status. And since one of the card perks is that you'll earn an additional SQP at a rate of 1 SQP per $10 charged to the card this means $20000 in annual charges on the card automatically earns you Silver status while $50000 in charges earns you Gold — with just credit card spend alone. Of course if you earn SQPs flying Spirit throughout the year as well this will lower the amount of spend required on the card.

Related: How much is Spirit Airlines' elite status worth?

While this is a lot of spend in a single year if you're able to achieve elite status you'll receive some great benefits and save a decent amount of money. Silver status includes perks such as free seat selection at check-in shortcut boarding and free same-day standby. More valuable Gold status even allows free seat selection at the time of booking (including the exit row) a free drink and snack on board a free first checked bag and a free carry-on bag.

Another huge perk of the credit card is that your points will never expire as long as your account is open. Spirit points typically expire in 12 months if there's no account activity (which is very short compared to other programs) so not having to worry about keeping your account active — especially if you aren't flying these days — can be significant.

Related: How to keep Spirit Airlines points from expiring

Perhaps even more valuable is that with so many unknowns right now cardmembers can book a flight at the last minute with their points and not have to pay a fee. Typically Spirit charges $50 if you redeem your points within 28 days from departure but this fee is waived for cardmembers. If you fly even just a few times a year and are more of a spontaneous traveler saving on that fee makes paying the annual fee on the card well worth it.

Stretching your points with the Spirit credit card

It used to be that cardmembers received a special perk of being able to book flights from just 2500 points each way. This was a great benefit that has now been extended to all Spirit travelers. And while Spirit has done away with their award chart there are still opportunities to fly Spirit at this low level. For example if you live in Houston you can easily fly Spirit to places like Las Vegas or Orlando for just 5000 Spirit points round-trip (if you're flexible with dates).

Or now that Spirit offers the opportunity to use Points + Cash you can book an award flight starting at just 1000 points plus a copay. This is great for folks who don't spend a lot on their credit card and want to redeem points for as little as possible.

Bottom line

Flying Spirit isn't for everyone and neither are the Spirit Airlines' credit cards. But if you like redeeming points for flights and are looking for the cheapest way to get from Point A to Point B I can't help but suggest at least considering this card option. I don't currently have the Spirit card myself but my semi-retired parents have had the Spirit card for years and are happily racking up points and memories by having access to inexpensive award tickets courtesy of their Spirit credit card.

On a recent flight comparison two of our TPG staffers flew on Spirit Airlines and compared the Big Front Seat to the economy experience. Both Nicky Kelvin and Stella Shon enjoyed their point-to-point no-frills flight and both agreed that they would fly Spirit again.

In a case like that having the Spirit credit card isn't crazy at all — it would be crazy not to have it.

The website which allowed sex workers to enter the so-called creator economy with its popular direct-to-consumer subscription platform did $2 billion in sales in 2020 and took a 20% cut of the action according to Bloomberg which first reported the news of the pivot away from porn.

Now OnlyFans plans to ban all videos featuring “sexually explicit conduct” starting Oct. 1. While the definition of sexually explicit content is still undefined (the company says some nude photos and videos will be allowed) hardcore porn on the platform seems unlikely to survive the new policy. It’s unclear if the new policy will make illegal content such as child pornography any easier to eliminate.

But the decision to remove OnlyFan’s most popular product was not a result of legal pressure according to the company. The decision was made in order “to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers” an OnlyFans spokesperson wrote by email.

The change marks a growing trend where financial services firms such as credit card and payment processors effectively decide what content is allowed or prohibited on internet platforms. For creators who depend on internet platforms for their income especially adult performers the sudden change represents a cautionary tale as the gatekeepers of the creator economy take shape.

Backpage and Pornhub fell first

Last year Visa and Mastercard cut ties with PornHub the online porn giant over allegations detailed by The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof that it didn’t aptly stop the spread of videos showing child abuse and non-consensual sex. PayPal had cut the site off the year before. After credit card companies cut ties the service turned to cryptocurrencies for transactions. Today PornHub users can only pay for exclusive content (similar to OnlyFans) with a direct bank account transaction or via cryptocurrency handled by the company Cosmo Payment. Something similar happened to Backpage an online classified ad business popular with sex workers which was cut off by credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in 2015 before being shut down by US authorities in 2018.

Adult performers claimed decisions like these don’t help abuse victims and further ostracize sex workers looking for legitimate platforms to make money. Alana Evans president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild (APAG) wrote on Aug. 20 that one of the “real reasons” that OnlyFans changed its tune was pressure from credit card company Mastercard. In the past Digital rights activists like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have claimed that payment companies are trying to police speech online while the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized PayPal and Venmo’s ban on sex work for endangering already vulnerable populations.

OnlyFans now faces similar allegations to those leveled against PornHub: A recent BBC investigation showed that OnlyFans gave repeated warnings to creators who posted illegal content but did not ban them on the first offense. So far Visa Mastercard and other credit card companies as well as the online payment processor Stripe which powers other creator platforms like Substack have maintained ties with OnlyFans.

But it was clear change was coming.

Mastercard announced a new policy directed at adult content due to take effect on October 15. Under the new rules adult sites taking Mastercard payments will need to prove the age and identity of anyone uploading or depicted in adult content conduct a pre-publication content review process and offer a robust complaint resolution and appeals process. “The ability to upload content to the internet has become easier than ever” the company stated in its announcement this April. “Now our requirements address the risks associated with this activity. And that starts with strong content control measures and clear unambiguous and documented consent.”

A Mastercard spokesperson said the company did not directly pressure OnlyFans to change policy and only found out about the decision through media coverage. “It’s a decision they came to themselves” said Seth Eisen a communications executive for Mastercard. Visa and Discover which are also payment partners of OnlyFans did not respond to a request for comment. Stripe which OnlyFans uses for payments to creators for non-adult content as Stripe explicitly bans pornography or other “obscene” content declined to comment.

OnlyFans later clarified that it would have been in compliance with the new Mastercard policies and instead blamed the banks for putting up unnecessary obstacles. OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely told the Financial Times that he would “absolutely” welcome porn back if banking policies changed. On OnlyFans creators upload videos of themselves or others and users can subscribe to creators’ pages with access to exclusive content for a fee (though some accounts are free).

Now the porn industry’s role in the creator economy which promised individual internet users can make a living by selling content directly to their fans is in jeopardy. OnlyFans briefly removed adult performers’ reliance on the industry’s gatekeepers but instead exposed their reliance on internet platforms and financial services companies.

This story was updated on Tuesday to clarify that Mastercard’s new policies were not the reason for OnlyFans’ decision according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua3MvMjU2MDMzL2liYmwtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1sYXVuY2gtc2hhcmlhaC1iYXNlZC1jYXJkc9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYW1wL2J1c2luZXNzL2JhbmtzLzI1NjAzMy9pYmJsLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtbGF1bmNoLXNoYXJpYWgtYmFzZWQtY2FyZHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBBL Mastercard launch Shariah-based cards,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/banks/256033/ibbl-mastercard-launch-shariah-based-cards on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua3MvMjU2MDMzL2liYmwtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1sYXVuY2gtc2hhcmlhaC1iYXNlZC1jYXJkc9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYW1wL2J1c2luZXNzL2JhbmtzLzI1NjAzMy9pYmJsLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtbGF1bmNoLXNoYXJpYWgtYmFzZWQtY2FyZHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2Vjb25vbXkvY29ycG9yYXRlcy9pYmJsLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtbGF1bmNoLXNoYXJpYWgtYmFzZWQtZHVhbC1jdXJyZW5jeS1jYXJkcy0yOTE2MjXSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy50YnNuZXdzLm5ldC9lY29ub215L2NvcnBvcmF0ZXMvaWJibC1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWxhdW5jaC1zaGFyaWFoLWJhc2VkLWR1YWwtY3VycmVuY3ktY2FyZHMtMjkxNjI1P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBBL Mastercard launch Shariah-based dual currency cards,"Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL) and global payment innovation pioneer Mastercard have introduced Shariah-based dual-currency debit credit and prepaid cards to advance the cross-border capabilities of the financial ecosystem of Bangladesh.

The dual currency cards allow cardholders to avail more secure online payment facilities through two-factor authentication where cardholders will receive a onetime password or OTP to verify their online transaction helping to reduce incidences of fraud.

At the virtual launching program on Sunday Planning Minister MA Mannan said as chief guest ""This is one of the high demand products (cross-border transaction) in the banking industry as we know the world is moving towards a cashless society rapidly.""

The cards can also be used to withdraw cash 24 hours a day 7 days a week at ATMs nationwide and internationally.

To enjoy all the benefits of the new cards cardholders should visit their nearest IBBL branch to endorse their passport for travel quota entitlement after which dual-currency transactions will be enabled on any existing Mastercard debit credit or prepaid cards issued by the bank.

To celebrate the launch IBBL and Mastercard are offering exclusive benefits and discounts on purchases made with Mastercard Titanium and Gold debit World and Gold credit or prepaid cards at Mastercard's network of more than 5500 partner outlets nationwide. The discounts are on dining lifestyle products travel and stays at hotels and resorts.

Deputy Governor of Bangladesh Bank Ahmed Jamal said ""Many Bangladeshi clients try to avoid bank earnings in the form of interest. That is why Islamic banking in Bangladesh is increasing day by day. But the Islamic banking sector was a little slow in moving towards Shariah-based cross-border transactions. Now they will enjoy this facility and it is a piece of good news for the banking industry.""

India had gone up against hosts Saudi Arabia earlier on Friday. The top two teams from the three-team group will go through to the main FIBA Asia Cup 2021 tournament which is now rescheduled to be held in Jakarta in July next year after the COVID pandemic-induced postponements.

During the first round of qualifiers India had finished third out of four nations in Group D with Lebanon and Bahrain qualifying for the FIBA Asia Cup. However their position enabled India to have a second shot at entry to the main tournament via the ongoing final round qualifiers.

World No. 78 India scored 445 points and conceded 523 in Group D while world No. 83 Palestine scored 516 points and conceded 473 in Group F during the first round of qualifiers.

Led by Vishesh Bhriguvanshi India have a strong squad with players such as Amjyot Singh Gill Muin Bek Hafeez Amritpal Singh and Aravind Annadurai. They are however without Princepal Singh who became the first Indian to win an NBA trophy - the NBA Summer League - with the Sacramento Kings earlier this week.

Palestine have veteran campaigners like Sani Sakakini and Kyndall Dykes in their ranks.

Thirteen countries have made it so far to the FIBA Asia Cup 2021. Two out of Saudi Arabia India and Palestine and one from Group G (Guam and Chinese Taipei) will complete the 16-team line-up.

The Kolkata-based Indian Super League team was trailing 0-1 at half time after Ibrahim Aisham had scored for the home side in the 25th minute.

But ATK Mohun Bagan struck in the 48th 63rd and 77th minutes through Liston Colaco Roy Krishna and Manvir Singh to emerge victorious on Saturday.

With two wins from two matches Antonio Habas’ side just need a draw in their last group match on Tuesday against Bashundhara Kings — on four points — of Bangladesh for a place in the Inter-Zone Semi-final.

Maziya join India’s another club Bengaluru FC in being eliminated from the competition. Bengaluru FC had played out a 0-0 draw against Bashundhara on Saturday after losing to ATK Mohun Bagan 0-2 in their campaign opener.

The home side opened their account for the campaign after 25 minutes when Cornelius Stewart led a quick counter-attack embarking on a solo run down the right before crossing for Ibrahim Aisham who swept home Maziya’s opener.

Five minutes later the Maldives side were close to adding a second in a similar fashion with Stewart again providing the supply down the right but this time he fed Hussain Nihan inside the box and the latter squared across the mouth of goal for Hamzath Mohamed who fluffed his lines.

Liston Colaco tested the goalkeeper with a well-struck free-kick from 25 yards out as ATK Mohun Bagan chased an equaliser but Mirzokhid Mamatkhonov was up for the challenge and parried away the effort to keep Maziya in the lead at the break.

The Indian side got their second half off to a flying start as halftime substitute Ashutosh Mehta produced an instant impact whipping a pinpoint cross from the right for Colaco who met it with a diving header into the back of the net to bring ATK Mohun Bagan level.

Four minutes after the hour-mark substitute Hugo Boumous executed a fine through-pass sending Colaco through on goal but the latter’s attempt was saved by the hosts’ Uzbek goalkeeper but only as far as the onrushing Roy Krishna who kept his composure to expertly strike on the rebound to give ATK Mohun Bagan the lead for the first time in the match.

France-born Boumous displayed his creative abilities once more with 14 minutes to go feeding Manvir Singh with an exquisite pass and the forward made no mistakes with only the goalkeeper to beat drilling it into the bottom corner to make it 3-1.

Habas later said a change in formation saw his side up the tempo in the second half as three players found the back of the net.

“We had some difficulties with the opponent because they scored first. After a change of system we became consistent and I’m very proud of my players” Habas said after the match.

“We have six points and no other team has that. (In this match) we had the possibility to draw but we didn’t have to think that way only the possibility for us to try to win and this will be our idea for the next match.”

Roy Krishna’s overall performance besides the second goal for ATK Mohun Bagan saw him being named the Player of the Match and the Fiji international said the team never doubted themselves despite Maziya taking the lead.

“We knew that we had the quality with the best players in our team and we trusted in the way we played” said Krishna.

“We knew we would get more chances and we just had to be patient. We hurried a lot (in the first half) but we played the way we wanted in the second half and got the goals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpc3RtYW5pYS5jb20vdGFsay90b3BpYyw1MTAwOTQuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liverpool v Burnley : English Premier League Match Team News Goal Scorers and Stats,"amasan1 at 21-08-2021 09:28 AM (2 years ago) (m)

Jurgen Klopp has a fresh roster issue hampering his preparations ahead of the visit of Burnley. On Saturday the Liverpool manager will be bereft of the services of two first-team players due to injury or other issues.

Date: Saturday 21st August 2021: 12:30 pmAnfieldMike Dean (England)Jurgen Klopp has a fresh roster issue hampering his preparations ahead of the visit of Burnley. On Saturday the Liverpool manager will be bereft of the services of two first-team players due to injury or other issues.

Andrew Robertson remains unavailable due to an ankle injury he sustained in pre-season. While the Scottish defender has started running he is still some way off being fit enough to return. The other absentee for Liverpool is Fabinho who is unavailable on compassionate grounds.



In Robertson’s continued absence Kostas Tsimikas will once again get a chance to impress from the left-back slot. On the opposite flank there is no looking past Trent Alexander-Arnold who will pose a lot of threat with his deliveries from the right wing as well as from set-pieces.



At the heart of the Liverpool defence Joel Matip will pair up with Virgil van Dijk with Alisson Becker a certainty in goal. Up ahead in midfield Jordan Henderson is likely to earn his first start of the season after going some way in getting up to speed this week.



The Liverpool captain will come into the side in place of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who failed to make much of an impression last week. Naby Keita and James Milner though will keep hold of their places with the two being the workhorses in the middle of the park.



Finally in attack the key decision for Klopp will be to pick three out of his four first-choice options. Diogo Jota started ahead of Roberto Firmino last week but the Brazilian forward ought to be recalled to the starting lineup with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane being the two wide men.

Probable Lineup (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold Matip van Dijk Tsimikas; Keita Henderson Milner; Salah Firmino Mane





Burnley

Unlike his counterpart in the Liverpool dugout Sean Dyche does not have any new issues to deal with ahead of the trip to Anfield. On Saturday the Burnley manager will have to make do without two first-team players with Kevin Long (calf) and Dale Stephens (ankle) both still sidelined.



Otherwise Dyche has a full strength squad at his disposal with Phil Bardsley now in contention to start after completely recovering from his injury. However Matt Lowton is expected to retain his place on the right side of the Burnley defence.



Charlie Taylor will take his place on the left flank while James Tarkowski and Ben Mee will form the central defensive partnership. Nick Pope will be the man between the sticks with the English international set to be a busy man in goal for Burnley.



As for the midfield unit Jack Cork ought to pair up with Ashley Westwood with Josh Brownhill being an option on the bench. Out wide Johann Berg Gudmundsson will get the nod on the right wing with Dwight McNeil a certainty on the left. Finally Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez will form the strike partnership.

Liverpool lost 1-0 at home against Burnley in the Premier League last season ending their 68-match unbeaten league run at Anfield. The Clarets last won successive away league matches against Liverpool in their first two attempts back in the 1894/95 and 1896/97 seasons.

Burnley have suffered 10 defeats in 14 Premier League matches against Liverpool (W2 D2) and a loss in this match would see the Clarets end up on the wrong end of a result in more than 10 Premier League games against an opponent for the first time also losing 10 against Arsenal Chelsea and Manchester City.

Liverpool have not suffered back-to-back home defeats in the Premier League against an opponent since losing three in a row versus Crystal Palace between 2014/15 and 2016/17. Alan Pardew who led Palace to the first two of those three wins remains the only English manager to win consecutive away Premier League games against Liverpool.

Liverpool have lost their first home league match in just three of the last 55 seasons and have won their first league game at Anfield in each of the last eight. Their last such defeat was against Chelsea in 2003/04. Burnley on the other hand have won their first away league game in just two of the last 14 seasons (D3 L9) beating Sheffield Wednesday in 2013/14 and Chelsea in 2017/18.

Liverpool are on the longest current unbeaten run in the Premier League (11) and have won their last six games in a row. The Reds have taken 29 points from their last 11 games (W9 D2) having earned just 10 points in their previous 11 in the competition (W3 D1 L7).



Prediction: Liverpool 2-0 Burnley

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

After at least five attempts to incorporate a window the Golden Arches will remain walk-in.

Proponents appeared at the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing July 21 advocating for elderly and disabled people or parents with kids in the car who could benefit from a drive-thru.

The board voted to continue the hearing to Aug. 18.

On Aug. 11 attorney Leah Rubega told Jeffrey Morrisette Westford’s director of land use management that McDonald’s would withdraw.

“On behalf of the applicant McDonald’s Real Estate Company I would like to request to withdraw without prejudice” she said.

“We greatly appreciate the (Zoning Board of Appeals) ZBA’s time and attention to this matter” she added. “We also appreciate town staff and your help throughout the process.”

When The Sun contacted McDonald’s an employee said it was “well above his pay grade” to comment.

The application would have allowed for a drive-through restaurant facility with two menu boards and two pre-browse boards.

Owners of the McDonald’s franchise chain Donny Wright Jr. and his mother Paula Wright own locations nearby and throughout New England.

The town’s zoning bylaw does not typically allow drive-thru facilities for restaurants.

Reasons for opposition included the fear of air pollution an unfair business advantage for those without a drive-thru vehicle emissions and traffic backups.

In 1993 the town successfully stopped a Walmart from coming into town with persistence from grassroots efforts and local residents.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLXBpZ2d5YmFja3MtdGVzbGEtZmlyZWJhdWdoLXN1cGVyY2hhcmdlci_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy1waWdneWJhY2tzLXRlc2xhLWZpcmViYXVnaC1zdXBlcmNoYXJnZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonalds piggybacks off of Tesla’s Largest U.S. Supercharger,"By

A McDonald’s franchise in Firebaugh California is piggybacking off of the Firebaugh Tesla Supercharger station which is the largest in the United States. Attracting customers to the Golden Arches isn’t too difficult to begin with especially when the fries are hot and the Sprite is cold. However Tesla owners may now have an extra incentive to visit the Firebaugh charger especially since McDonald’s is reminding drivers that one of their franchise locations may be the perfect place to charge your body (kind of) while you charge your car.

We all know McDonald’s is not the most healthy option on the long and winding roads of California but we do know that it is fast affordable and delicious a lot of the time. McDonald’s locations may be the perfect place to grab a bite and sit down outside of your car after a few hours of driving while your Tesla is charging nearby. The Firebaugh location is taking advantage of this mentality.

Reddit u/kesslertava posted a photograph of the Firebaugh McDonald’s with a banner outside of its parking spaces reading:

“Recharge with McDonald’s while you recharge your Tesla: Food delivered directly to your charge bay (place your charge bay in curbside #.)

This is quite the strategy that McDonald’s which stopped counting at 99 billion customers served in 1993 has employed especially as its location already makes it a favorable stop for hungry drivers. However piggybacking off the Supercharging process which has decreased in length several times over the years thanks to faster charging speeds is almost comical. Driving business from the Superchargers into the McDonald’s almost seems like the old dog is learning new tricks. McDonald’s has been around for decades but Tesla only for less than two decades.

However this McDonald’s location surely knows that catering to the Tesla owners who choose to charge up at the Firebaugh location are prone to spend their money at a location that acknowledges their presence.

We aren’t sure if this has driven business at this McDonald’s up through the roof. Still there’s a possibility that the location’s busiest hours may directly correlate to the busiest hours at the Firebaugh charger. Nevertheless McDonald’s also offers Tesla something: many locations and a lot of business. This could lead to an eventual partnership between the two companies for Superchargers much like WaWa and Target have already done with Tesla charging points.

McDonald’s has 13443 locations in the United States and not all of them will get Tesla Superchargers; maybe none of them will. But if they do it would offer Tesla an unbelievable range of potential Supercharger locations adding to the already 20000+ locations the automaker has established currently.

7-Eleven



Taco Bell just announced plans for a four-lane drive-thru slated for summer 2022.

Competing chains are already adding lanes to drive-thrus Taco Bell just upped the ante.

Drive-thrus became crucial to fast food during the pandemic and chains continue to invest in them.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Taco Bell just released plans for a four-lane drive-thru set to open next summer and it's making the inevitable clear: drive-thrus are just going to keep getting bigger.

The new drive-thru concept will be owned by one of the biggest Taco Bell franchisees in the country with three lanes dedicated to mobile orders alongside a fourth traditional lane. A contactless food delivery system that ""defies gravity"" will transport orders from the kitchen above down to cars through a lift system.

Taco Bell's new concept is set to open in summer 2022.

Taco Bell



The concept immediately inspired memes and comparisons. So far it's been compared to an EZ Pass highway toll booth a bank and even the color scheme from the Ryan Gosling movie ""Drive."" The comparisons are funny and frankly the drive-thru does look like a bank but the concept itself is less ridiculous than it seems at first.

Looking back drive-thrus getting bigger seems inevitable. Back in 2019 fast food brands ramped up a kind of drive-thru arms race; McDonald's rolled out new technology to decrease wait times while traditionally drive-thru-less chains like Chipotle ramped up Chipotlanes. At the same time Starbucks and Dunkin' were each experimenting with drive-thru pickup for mobile orders.

The pandemic sped everything up. Suddenly drive-thrus weren't just a way to do business they were the primary way customers felt safe visiting restaurants amid closed dining rooms and health concerns. Typically drive-thrus account for 70% of sales at fast-food chains. But in 2020 chains like Wendy's and McDonald's said it was closer to 90%.

To accommodate growing drive-thru traffic they simply had to get. bigger. Chick-fil-A has been opening double-lane drive-thrus across the country. Starbucks has followed this example as part of its initiative to close lower-performing stores and focusing on mobile and drive-thru locations. The coffee chain has started installing double lanes too.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider



McDonald's which already has some double-lane drive-thrus also released a concept for on-the-go stores focused on takeout and delivery orders with extra lanes for customers who ordered through the app. Like the Taco Bell concept McDonald's suggested some orders would even be delivered by conveyor belts.

Shake Shack



Shake Shack's design for its first-ever drive-thrus planned to open sometime in 2022 skips the traditional single lane step altogether. Instead the burger chain is jumping right into the multi-lane designs that are growing more popular in the industry with three lanes to accommodate mobile and on-site orders.

""Why not test out something like this? They can learn an awful lot and maybe this is the way the market will trend in the long run"" Mark Kalinowski founder of Kalinowski Equity Research told Insider. ""It's a futuristic way of thinking and restaurants are getting more willing to be a little different.""

The COVID-19 pandemic and its variants are still ongoing but many places in the US have attempted to return to normal life. The reign of drive-thrus is nowhere near over though as McDonald's Starbucks and Taco Bell all emphasized how crucial they are to business in just the last few weeks.

Americans have rediscovered their love of drive-thrus and they're not going back.

Even BTS-themed paper bags are a hot commodity among ARMYs. Here's what we know about this boy band's 2021 partnership with McDonald's.

McDonald’s has officially discontinued the 2021 BTS Meal. Still the products that accompanied this menu item are available for purchase via resale websites like eBay.

In fact the BTS Meal paper bags are still sold online including some used and “greasy” containers worth over $200.

McDonald’s released ‘The BTS Meal’ in May 2021

From Louis Vuitton to Samsung BTS often partners with large brands. In 2021 that meant a collaboration with the fast-food chain McDonald’s. As one of the largest chain restaurants this K-pop group brought the “BTS Meal” to fans across the globe.

The specifics of this meal varied based on location but generally speaking the BTS McDonald’s meal was the same for ARMYs regardless of geographical location. This meal included 10 or 9-piece Chicken McNuggets medium fries a medium drink and two dipping sauces.

Those sauces Sweet Chili and Cajun were new to customers in the United States and came with pink and purple packaging. This collaboration came with exclusively pictures and videos including the Behind the Sauce: Making of Film posted to YouTube during June.

McDonald’s employees wore BTS-inspired uniforms. There were also BTS x McDonald’s bags that came with the meal with ARMYs transforming them into phone cases and wall art.

As a result fans were selling these containers (and some packaging available in select countries) on platforms like eBay some going for hundreds of dollars.

Fans can buy the BTS Meal bags via eBay

In the United States BTS-specific Chicken McNugget containers and cups were not available. The McDonald’s bags dotted with the BTS logo and purple hues did come with meals at select locations.

Even weeks after McDonald’s discontinued the BTS Meal the paper bags are still available for purchase on platforms like eBay. Some fans sell them for as little as $0.99 while others sell used bags for as much as $200.

The sauces available exclusively with the BTS Meal are also available for resale via eBay with some fans selling cases of flavors like Sweet Chili and Cajun. As a limited-time offer these sauces are fairly rare and can cost about $20 for a set.

BTS x McDonald’s merchandise is still available for purchase

In addition to the two new sauces BTS released original merchandise in conjunction with their McDonald’s partnership. Thanks to a fictitious phone call between Jin and the fast-food company these products even came with photocards.

These t-shirts bags and crewnecks were only sold through the Weverse Shop as a limited-time offer. Later the K-pop group created the BTS X McDonald’s Collaboration Merch: Melting Collection sold exclusively through this website.

However some “Crew T-Shirts” worn by the actual McDonald’s employees while the BTS Meal was sold are available through eBay. As of August 2021 prices ranging from $7.99 to $99.95 depending on the seller.

“Butter” BTS’ single released just days prior to the BTS Meal is currently available on most major music streaming platforms including Spotify."

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

Yonhap



Six presidential hopefuls from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) have embarked on a collective online campaign following the opening ceremony of their metaverse camp last week.



Metaverse a combination of meta (meaning beyond) and verse (from universe) refers to a three-dimensional virtual shared world in which all activities can take place with the help of augmented- and virtual-reality services.



The DP has leased parts of ""Metropolis"" a metaverse program developed by South Korea's app-based home-finding platform Zigbang Co. to help each of the six candidates conduct an online election campaign without time and space restrictions.



The six candidates ― Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung ex-DP chief Lee Nak-yon ex-Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun ex-Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae Rep. Kim Doo-gwan and Rep. Park Yong-jin ― participated in the opening ceremony Friday from their offices and other places while DP Chairman Song Young-gil joined them from his office at the National Assembly.



Notably Kim who has self-isolated at home due to his son's COVID-19 infection was able to get together with his rivals at the ceremony though in the virtual space.



Moreover all the participants were seen as free from the coronavirus jitters during the online event as all but the Gyeonggi governor showed up without a mask.



In his congratulatory remark Song said that the ceremony was meaningful in that the DP's presidential candidates have entered a metaverse camp for the first time in Korean politics.



Song said he expects all the candidates to actively take advantage of the metaverse program with brilliant ideas.



In response all of the six candidates shared the view that the utilization of the unlimited online space in the metaverse camp seems to herald a new era in local political campaigning. (Yonhap)

The Giants didn’t have much of an opportunity to showcase Santoso — they have not attempted a field goal this preseason — so the head coach gave an unsolicited pitch that essentially welcomed any and all offers from teams that might be looking for a reliable player at the position.

""This guy has had a tremendous camp for us"" Judge said taking a hard sell approach. ""We’re happy we have Graham [Gano]. Graham is a phenomenal kicker but if we didn’t have Graham he would be our kicker. I have a lot of faith in him . . . This guy deserves to be on the field and he deserves to be one of the 32 [kickers in the league]. He has that kind of ability.""

As for potential buyers the Giants may be visiting one this week.

They are scheduled to work two joint practices with the Patriots that will serve plenty of roles for both squads but could also be a de facto tryout for Santoso. The Patriots will get a chance to see him kick in practices in person something teams trading for players rarely are afforded.

With the Patriots looking for help at the position and Judge’s evaluation carrying plenty of weight with them (he served as their special teams coordinator before becoming head coach of the Giants) it’s not absurd to imagine Santoso practicing in a Giants uniform on Wednesday then lining up in a Patriots jersey following a swap on Thursday.

Santoso spent last season on the Giants’ practice squad. The closest he came to regular season action was when Gano tested positive for COVID-19 during the bye week but Gano was able to return in time for the next game. Santoso also has a background as a punter making him more valuable in a pinch. At 6-5 and 258 pounds the joke on the Giants is that he can also play linebacker or tight end if he has to.

Of course those are only jokes until it actually happens.

As for Santoso not attempting any field goals despite handling all of the kicking through the first two preseason games Judge said the Giants have tried. They could have at least given him a chance at another extra point on Sunday but went for two points after a touchdown in the fourth quarter. The failed attempt left them trailing 14-13.

""There is no overtime in preseason and we didn’t want to come out of here kissing our sister so we just went ahead and went for two"" Judge said.

Ironically had they kicked the extra point and held the Browns to a field goal on the ensuing possession as they did they might have had a chance to send Santoso out to tie the score at 17 in the closing minute of the game instead of chucking a do-or-die pass from midfield.

Instead any team that wants to know about Santoso will just have to take Judge’s word on him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9idXNpbmVzcy9tZXRsaWZlY2FyZS1tYWtlcy0zMDQ0bS1uZXQtcHJvZml0LWluLXR1cm5hcm91bmQtYWZ0ZXItbG9zcy1wbGFucy1uZXctMTUwbS12aWxsYWdlL0NIR09EMkdZTEo1V1paUTc0UkhJUEFPTFVZL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metlifecare makes $304.4m net profit in turnaround after loss plans new $150m village,"The company is planning a $150 million village at the 20ha Clevedon site it has bought.

The company is planning a $150 million village at the 20ha Clevedon site it has bought.

Delisted retirement giant Metlifecare has made a big profit turnaround due to revaluations and bought a 20ha site at Clevedon where the $4 billion business plans a $150 million village.

Earl Gasparich who replaced Glen Sowry as the company's chief executive announced a $304.4m net profit after tax after last year's loss driven primarily by $335m revaluation gains when previously the assets were written down by $74.7m.

Gasparich previously CEO of Oceania Healthcare said the new village would be Clevedon's first and part of an active development programme with four large North Island villages planned or under construction.

Metlifecare was delisted from the NZX and ASX on November 3 after Swedish investment firm EQT Partners made a $1.27b takeover for all the shares via its Asia Pacific Village Group.

The company is one of the big six retirement village operators in New Zealand and its new project is at 17 Clevedon Kawakawa Rd 30 minutes south of Auckland.

Metlifecare which already houses 5500 residents plans 130 independent villas and apartments and a 60-bed hospital on its new site.

Gasparich said it had worked with iwi business association and community members on the design and resource consent process.

The company has 26 villages and is developing four new ones. Construction is under way at Orion Point and Fairway Gardens in Auckland a site has been purchased at Havelock North and now Clevedon is planned.

Last week the company reported a net profit after tax of $304.4m for the year to June 30 2021 up from last year's $33.7m loss. Statutory operating cash flow was $119.3m up from $116m. Total assets of $4.078b are up from $3.571b. Total equity $1.842b is up from $1.533b.

Net gearing remains almost static at 16.6 per cent compared with 16.9 per cent last year. During the June 2021 financial year the business opened its new Beachlands village Pohutukawa Landing.

Gasparich said the result reflected several achievements Metlifecare had made during the year although the company also noted the revaluation gains that boosted the bottom line so much.

""We are proud of the way everyone – staff and residents alike – have adapted and looked after each other's safety and wellbeing during a year of intermittent Covid-19 restrictions. Our strong operating performance has highlighted the wide appeal of Metlifecare's villages and aged care facilities where we experienced record levels of demand and strong occupancy across all of our villages"" he said.

Pohutukawa Landing opened in June he said.

Operating revenue was $143.5m 7 per cent higher than the June 30 2020 year due to continued growth in care revenue and higher deferred management fees he said.

This together with a 21 per cent increase in realised resales gains grew statutory operating cash flow to $119.3m for the year.

Metlifecare repaid its $6.8m wage subsidy received late in the previous financial year. The company believed this was the appropriate action given Metlifecare's financial position and reflected the spirit of the scheme.

Metlifecare plans 130 independent villas and apartments and a 60-bed hospital on the Clevedon Kawakawa Rd site. Image / Supplied

Reported net profit after tax of $304.4m was driven primarily by a fair value gain on its investment property portfolio of $335.5m the company said in its August 20 statement.

""The strong increase in the value of Metlifecare's investment property reflects the reversal of Covid-19-related property valuation assumptions applied in the prior year and completion of new developments at Pohutukawa Landing"" the statement says.

The company had $171m invested in development activities.

""We welcomed the first residents to our new Pohutukawa Landing village in Beachlands as well as making solid progress on five large-scale project developments. These developments include two new villages at Fairway Gardens (Botany Auckland) and Orion Point (Hobsonville Point Auckland) both due to open in FY22 and new homes and community amenities at Pohutukawa Landing and Gulf Rise (Red Beach Hibiscus Coast)"" Gasparich said.

""We are also looking forward to completing a multi-year regeneration project at Edgewater village (Pakuranga Auckland) in FY22 which will transform the site with a new community centre care home and independent living apartments.""

Metlifecare had further sites in Havelock North and south Auckland.

""Our goal is to significantly increase our build rate and we have made significant progress to deliver this. We look forward to sharing more exciting development and land acquisition news in the coming months"" Gasparich said last week.",,,,,,

Last updated on: August 21 2021 05:53h.

Two Deadwood casinos have partnered with BetMGM the iGaming and sports betting subsidiary of MGM Resorts.

BetMGM and gaming and hospitality group Liv Hospitality are teaming up for the pending arrival of legal sports betting within Deadwood’s city limits. The two entities say their partnership will result in the MGM betting platform operating inside Liv’s Tin Lizzie Gaming Resort and Cadillac Jack’s Gaming Resort.

Though sports betting is confined to Deadwood mobile operations will be allowed in the historic Black Hills Gold Rush town. BetMGM will offer sports betting kiosks and mobile wagering at the two casinos. BetMGM is operational in 10 states plus DC.

Tin Lizzie is the northern-most casino located on Deadwood’s historic Main Street. Cadillac Jack’s is slightly further north of Tin Lizzie along Main Street. They are two of the first gaming venues travelers see when arriving in town along US Route 14. Most visitors driving to Deadwood from Rapid City — South Dakota’s second-most populated city — come via the highway.

Liv Hospitality’s prime resort locations in Deadwood make it an ideal partner for us. Together we look forward to bringing the BetMGM sports betting experience to South Dakota sports fans” said BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt.

Cadillac Jack’s offers 240 slot machines and 22 table games. Tin Lizzie’s casino floor accommodates 220 slots and eight tables. Both properties are already offering BetMGM sports betting promos.

The first 250 people who create a BetMGM account at Tin Lizzie will receive $20 resort credit and are eligible for an up to $500 matching bonus on their first deposit. Cadillac Jack’s is presenting the first 250 to sign up for sports betting $15 in Cadillac Cash.

September Launch

South Dakota voters last November passed a ballot referendum that amended the state constitution to allow sports betting. The state legislature subsequently passed legislation and Gov. Kristi Noem’s (D) signed the statute in March.

South Dakota’s authorization of sports betting is limited to within Deadwood’s city limits. Native American casinos operated on sovereign land by tribes that have active Class III gaming compacts can also incorporate sportsbooks.

As dictated by the state’s sports betting bill — House Bill 44 — the South Dakota Commission on Gaming formed regulations to govern the expanded gambling last month. The state’s Legislative Interim Rules Review Committee unanimously approved the regulations during its August 2 meeting.

With the rules set the Gaming Commission is expected to issue sports betting licenses during its September 8 meeting to applicants that were deemed qualified.

NFL Sports Betting Kickoff

The South Dakota Commission on Gaming began fielding sports betting applications on July 1.

While the agency hasn’t confirmed which sportsbooks have applied for licenses the odds are strong that the list includes the industry’s major players. Along with BetMGM which made its application public by way of the Liv Hospitality partnership announcement it’s likely that DraftKings FanDuel and Caesars are in the pool.

If the Gaming Commission issues sportsbook rights at its September 8 meeting operators will be free to commence betting as early as September 9. That’s the same day the 2021-22 NFL season kicks off with the Dallas Cowboys playing at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEveW9yZGVuaXMtdWdhcy1iZWF0cy1tYW5ueS1wYWNxdWlhby1ieS11bmFuaW1vdXMtZGVjaXNpb24v0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yMS95b3JkZW5pcy11Z2FzLWJlYXRzLW1hbm55LXBhY3F1aWFvLWJ5LXVuYW5pbW91cy1kZWNpc2lvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yordenis Ugás beats Manny Pacquiao by unanimous decision,"LAS VEGAS — Although Manny Pacquiao hasn’t decided what his future holds the eight-division world champion realizes his 26-year professional boxing career might have ended Saturday night with a disheartening loss.

Yordenis Ugás is only seven years younger than the Filipino senator yet he’s just getting started after seizing this improbable opportunity to knock off one of the greats.

Ugás beat Pacquiao by unanimous decision in Las Vegas putting on an impressive technical performance on 11 days’ notice and retaining his WBA welterweight title.

“He’s a great competitor but I came in here to show I am the champion of the WBA” Ugás said. “A lot of respect for him but I won this fight.”

Ugás (27-4) capitalized on this chance as the late injury replacement for Errol Spence Jr. The Cuban veteran was slightly better than Pacquiao (67-8-2) throughout one of the most frustrating fights in the 42-year-old Filipino senator’s career.

“I did my best tonight but my best wasn’t good enough” Pacquiao said. “No excuses. I wanted to fight for the title in the ring and tonight the champion is named Ugas.”

A visibly disappointed Pacquiao said he hasn’t decided whether he will fight again after an unimpressive performance in his return from the longest layoff of his quarter-century in the sport. He also wouldn’t confirm whether he will enter the Philippines’ presidential race as is widely expected. He intends to make an announcement next month.

“In the future you may not see Manny Pacquiao again to fight in the ring” Pacquiao said. “I don’t know but I’m so happy for what I’ve accomplished.”

The 35-year-old Ugás threw roughly half as many punches as Pacquiao but his blows were more precise and more effective. Pacquiao was the solid favorite before the bout but he struggled to get inside on Ugás’ effective jab while Ugás landed his right hand to increasing effect in the later rounds.

Two judges scored it 116-112 for Ugás and a third had it 115-113. The Associated Press also scored it 116-112 for Ugás.

Pacquiao also said his legs were cramping from the second round onward. He attributed the problem to a combination of overtraining and age.

“I think it was too much hard work” Pacquiao said. “But I’m not young anymore. So I don’t know.”

The victory was the culmination of a lengthy journey for Ugás who defected from Cuba two years after winning a bronze medal in the Beijing Olympics. Ugás quit boxing for two years midway through the last decade but revitalized his career and then capitalized on this golden chance by earning his 12th victory in his last 13 fights.

Ugás was in the spotlight only because Spence was forced to drop out last week after discovering he had a torn retina during a pre-fight physical. Ugás had been booked for a bout on the undercard but he jumped at the type of showcase and payday that had been just out of reach ever since he left Cuba on a small boat bound for Mexico 11 years ago.

“I’m very excited but most of all I want to thank Manny Pacquiao for giving me this moment in this ring today” Ugás said through a translator. “We only had two weeks of training but I listened to my corner and it all worked out.”

T-Mobile Arena appeared to be essentially sold out despite the late opponent change and the crowd of 17438 was vocally behind its Filipino hero. Even after a lengthy layoff in the last stages of his career Pacquiao remains a surefire draw and a bankable star in a sport lacking both at its highest levels.

Ugás had a clear game plan on short notice working hard in the early rounds with an effective jab and body shots. Pacquiao was more aggressive and occasionally got the crowd to its feet with combinations but Ugás’ rangy jab stymied him.

Ugás’ confidence grew in the middle rounds and he responded to some action at the seventh-round bell with a defiant shimmy-shake of his shoulders in Pacquiao’s direction. Pacquiao constantly threw more punches than Ugás but they landed about the same number as Ugás showed off his defense and accuracy against Pacquiao’s activity.

Pacquiao caught Ugás with a combination in the 10th round and knocked him back as the crowd rose in excitement but Ugás recovered and rallied with big shots. Ugás also looked sharp in the 12th round peppering Pacquiao all the way to the final bell.

Pacquiao had won three straight bouts since July 2017 but he hadn’t fought since beating Keith Thurman in 2019 to win the WBA welterweight title.

The WBA’s decision irked Pacquiao who held various welterweight belts for a decade after he first moved up to 147 pounds in 2009 and stopped Miguel Cotto in arguably his single greatest performance.

The 38-year-old Guerrero (37-6-1) had a strong second round and persevered with a high punch volume to beat the 34-year-old Ortiz (32-7-3) who hadn’t fought in 42 months. Ortiz was charged with multiple counts of sexual assault in 2018 but the charges were dismissed late last year.

Manila Philippines – Manny Pacquiao the eight time world boxing champion and senator of the Philippines takes on Cuban Yordenis Ugás in Las Vegas on Saturday night in a high-stakes fight that could kick-start his campaign to be his country’s next president.

While 42-year-old Pacquiao has been focusing on politics over the last two years reclaiming his former boxing title as the welterweight champion of the world would serve as a reminder to Filipinos of the rags-to-riches life story of a man who won their hearts – and votes – during his athletic prime.

“The boxing fight is just a bonus” Monico Puentevella Pacquiao’s political spokesman told Al Jazeera.

“After the Las Vegas fight will be the biggest fight of his life in May of next year and if he wins [over Ugás] it will only add more mileage and inspire the people more to support him.”

The Philippines goes to the polls to choose a new president to replace self-styled tough guy Rodrigo Duterte in May 2022 and while Pacquaio has yet to say so himself his intention to run for the top job has long been an open secret.

“He’s all set to run. He’s been eyeing that for some time and he just wants to finish this boxing match. He told me to tell everybody categorically that he’s going to run” Puentevella said.

Until recently Pacquiao was well-positioned for a presidential bid. He became the president of Duterte’s political party PDP-Laban in December 2020 and it seemed the machinery behind Duterte was gearing up for Pacquiao. Duterte himself even referred to the boxer as “the next president of the Philippines”.

But Duterte who is only allowed to serve a single six-year term risks possible trouble when he steps down in less than a year.

An International Criminal Court complaint against him for crimes against humanity is moving forward and the court may order his arrest. Rights groups opposed to his violent “war on drugs” have also promised to lodge similar lawsuits with local courts as soon as he loses legal immunity.

Unable to run for a second term Duterte has said he wants to run for vice president and judging by his close allies’ recent actions has indicated he would prefer the top job remain in the family.

“The president is worried that if anybody aside from his daughter runs and wins [the presidency] the president knows he will be charged in the International Criminal Court” Puentevella said.

“So now to make sure he won’t end up in jail there’s no other political person who can help him except his daughter.”

Removed as party president

Beginning in June PDP-Laban members associated with Rodrigo Duterte began pushing for his daughter Sara Duterte to run as the party’s presidential candidate. Pacquiao opposed the idea ostensibly because Sara Duterte was not a member of the party.

“Let’s give others a chance” Pacquiao said in an interview with ABS-CBN News still not confirming whether he intended to run for president.

In mid-July as Pacquiao camped in Hollywood to train for his upcoming match PDP-Laban members loyal to Duterte met outside Manila and declared the party’s leadership posts vacant effectively removing Pacquiao as their president.

Pacquiao declared the meeting invalid and the party split with both men claiming legitimacy and numbers.

“Just as a show of force while [the Duterte faction] were having their meeting in a fancy hotel more than a hundred of our chapters met nationwide some along the streets some under a tree some in a small patio” PDP-Laban executive director Ron Munsayac who is loyal to Pacquiao told Al Jazeera.

“We just showed that the PDP-Laban grassroots members are alive and kicking and they want their voices to be heard. They are lucky to have a leader such as Manny Pacquiao who is giving them a voice inside the party” he added.

Whatever the mood in the party Pacquiao has lost any chance of getting Duterte’s backing for a potential run and that could undermine his campaign.

“Always the cards are stacked against the one fighting the administration” said Clarita Carlos a political science professor at the University of the Philippines.

‘They underestimated me’

Pacquaio is not worried. He is used to being the underdog.

“They might have underestimated me but they don’t know what’s on my mind. It’s even better that they underestimate me because in my life from the beginning in my experience I failed to make the Philippine [boxing] team because they belittled me back then” Pacquiao in a video message from Hollywood told the PDP-Laban ranks loyal to him.

He was reacting to Duterte calling him “ignorant” of the country’s issues. The irascible president had taken offence at the senator’s criticism of his policies on the South China Sea dispute with Beijing and allegations of corruption within his administration.

Having grown up poor Pacquiao dropped out of school and lacks the polished eloquence often expected of politicians of his stature. Some of his critics have used his lack of formal education to suggest he is unqualified for public office.

“But because of my determination hard work and discipline I was able to achieve my dreams and even more. My fight for PDP-Laban is for the little people” Pacquiao continued.

Pacquiao’s narrative resembles that of Duterte who identified with the poor and banked on their collective grievances against the elite-dominated establishment to propel him to victory.

Both men come from the Mindanao region the Philippines’ geographic political and economic south and speak with the region’s characteristic accent that right away differentiates them from the traditional elite.

But unlike Duterte a lawyer from a middle-class family who spent 20 years as Davao City mayor Pacquiao really did come from the street clawing his way out of poverty through boxing.

Duterte perpetuates the myth of his “simple life” by sharing photos of his average-looking house in Davao walking around in worn-out shoes and speaking gutter language. He refuses to disclose his bank accounts or even provide a list of his assets – mandatory for government officials – to dispel allegations of ill-gotten wealth.

Pacquiao and his family on the other hand are proud of the fortune he has made from boxing. His wife might once have drawn controversy for posting photos of her designer bags on social media but Pacquaio has earned a reputation for being generous with his wealth.

“From what I hear about the kinds of things and activities that [Pacquiao] does he really has a generous heart a compassionate heart to the extent that if he can he really helps people” Carlos the political analyst told Al Jazeera.

Pacquiao’s personal narrative needs no curation and it would have been a sure formula for winning the presidency in another time. But the Philippines’ current political scene is replete with personalities with strong narratives most of them more astute and seasoned politicians than Pacquiao.

“There will be many many other names” Carlos said. “It’s going to be a tough campaign for anyone.”

‘Already a legend’

But the sudden falling-out with Pacquaio could also further tarnish Durterte who is under pressure over his poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impending ICC investigation.

Pacquiao had been a staunch defender of Duterte’s controversial policies especially the anti-narcotics campaign that rights groups say has killed as many as 30000 people according to human rights groups. He also pushed for a bill to reinstate the death penalty at Duterte’s behest.

“The president is on survival mode” said Antonio Antogop Jr a former Duterte campaigner who now leads a movement pushing Pacquiao to run for president.

Antogop said he had campaigned among “ordinary folk in the boondocks” for Duterte whom he believed would help improve their lives.

“I thought Duterte could be our man because he’s just like us being from Davao and all” Antogop told Al Jazeera. “Unfortunately he failed us miserably.”

Many of Duterte’s disillusioned supporters are now turning to Pacquiao he said.

“I cannot mention their names but many who were with Duterte before are now with us. Some of his operators are now here with us too” said Antogop.

Even political heavyweights are considering alliances with Pacquiao.

New #ESPNDaily w/ @TimKeownESPN: Senator Manny Pacquiao isn’t just fighting maybe the last match of his singular career. He’s running for PRESIDENT. And turning on incumbent strongman Rodrigo Duterte — with his life and the Philippines on the line 🇵🇭🥊 https://t.co/j76Kn6XRrs pic.twitter.com/uoe0GgJMvl — Pablo S. Torre (@PabloTorre) August 20 2021

Last week Vice President Leni Robredo from the opposition Liberal Party said she was in “exploratory talks” with Pacquiao’s camp. The opposition needs a marketable champion and Pacquiao might just be it.

Meanwhile Duterte’s supporters within PDP-Laban have announced that they will field Senator Bong Go formerly Duterte’s aide and still his closest associate as their presidential candidate. Unlike Sara Duterte Go is a member of the party.

“I hope it’s true” said Puentevella Pacquiao’s spokesman. Opinion polls show Go significantly behind Sara Duterte in popularity. Melvin Matibag of the Duterte faction denied speculation that Go is a proxy for a last-minute switch with the president’s daughter.

That the entire scenario hinges on personalities such as Pacquiao and the Dutertes is lamentable said Carlos because it shows how the Philippines’ political parties are practically built around personalities rather than policies or principles.

“Sadly we’re just seeing faces but we’re not seeing programmes of government. As a voting public we would like to see the candidates talk about what to do with the next pandemic and what to do with the sorry state of our education system for instance” Carlos said.

Even now Pacquiao is making the same generic promises made by Duterte and all other presidents before him.

“God willing when the time comes mark my word – a new day will dawn in our country bringing hope and real prosperity and peace” he said in his video message.

Supporters of such charismatic figures rarely ask about the specifics. To them the medium is the message.

That is why Pacquiao’s match against Ugás could be so significant.

“Imagine the victory parade if he wins. Everyone will want a piece of him the idol of the masses. It will be a big boost to his candidacy to the point that some people in this country are now praying that he loses” said Puentevella.

“Their problem is win or lose he is already a legend” he added.

Exhale everyone: Crowd surfing has returned to Las Vegas.

At Mandalay Bay’s Michelob Light Arena on Friday evening a young lady rode a sea of extended arms towards a stage prowled by influential death-metallers Obituary whose frontman sang as if he was attempting to physically expel his lungs through his esophagus.

At the same time at Mandalay Bay Beach Paul Cauthen a honky tonk hell-raiser with both the dimensions and the demeanor of a whiskey-slicked wrecking ball led his band in ZZ Top covers and outlaw country revivalism as women in denim bell bottoms splashed in the pool next to mohawked dudes in matching denim jean jackets.

“Everything is sunshine” Cauthen sang like a drunk with the keys to a local distillery. “You caught me at good time.”

“You caught me at a good time!” a guy in the crowd bellowed in response.

And so the evening went as Psycho Las Vegas got off to a raucous can-you-believe-this-is-really-happening start. Beginning with a pool party on Thursday the first big music festival to return since the pandemic came roaring back to life this weekend on four stages at Mandalay Bay.

The vibe? That of a grounded teenager’s punishment coming to an end.

Yes of course there were random group chants of “Beer!” upon occasion — because well beer!

No you couldn’t see the grins behind all the mandatory face coverings but you knew they were there excited eyes betraying the smiles the masks hid.

“I’m so happy right now!” a dude in a Mastodon T-shirt exclaimed as said band took the stage at the Michelob Ultra Arena late Friday the prog-metallers in question conjuring a sound equally posited on heft and precision agility and aplomb like a ballet of elephants.

This was a weekend of sudden seismic mood swings.

On Saturday at Michelob Light Arena reggae- and hip-hop-informed electronic music troupe Thievery Corporation introduced the sitar to Psycho Las Vegas and got the fest’s first ever conga line snaking across the floor. The Flaming Lips followed with cosmic alt-rock mood enhancers featuring large inflatable robots and bubble machines; a few hours later death-metallers Cannibal Corpse kicked sand in the face of subtlety and restraint at Mandalay Bay Beach.

One of the motifs of Psycho Las Vegas is bands playing seminal albums in full.

On Friday Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA masterfully performed his masterful 1996 solo debut “Liquid Swords” flaunting his prodigious mic skills by expertly handling verses originally delivered by fellow Clan greats like Ghostface Killah RZA and Method Man leading a band that treated the songs like pinatas hitting them hard and playfully at once.

On Saturday Danzig dug into their darkly libidinous sophomore effort 1990’s “Danzig II: Lucifuge” airing rarely played album cuts like “Girl” from the highly Doors-influenced record; the following night on the same stage Southern-rock-informed metallers Down played their debut album “NOLA” in its entirety.

Despite the vast range of sonics on hand here there was one constant among almost every performer: Many of the bands were playing out for the first time in upwards of a year-and-a-half — from the aforementioned Cannibal Corpse to shoegaze-y black metal unit Deafheaven who mesmerized at Michelob Light Arena on Saturday.

Perhaps bossa nova/reggae throwback Claude Fontaine encapsulated it all best Friday while singing at the House of Blues.

“Your voice is a warm holiday….” she purred on “Strings of Your Guitar” her voice like papier-mache — beatific delicate. “Sing to bring me back my cheer.”

That she did on a weekend defined by that very act over and over and over again.

Ceja still disagrees with referee Russell Mora’s decision to stop his all-action brawl with Guillermo Rigondeaux. The Mexican contender also is certain he beat Brandon Figueroa in his fight following an eighth-round technical-knockout defeat to a surprisingly willing Rigondeaux in June 2019 at Mandalay Bay Events Center.

The Ceja-Figueroa fight – a 12-rounder for Figueroa’s secondary WBA 122-pound title – resulted in a split draw. Ceja who came in 4½ pounds overweight the day before he fought Figueroa hasn’t boxed since his draw with the undefeated Figueroa in November 2019 at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

“I’m mad about those fights” Ceja told BoxingScene.com through a translator after a press conference Thursday at MGM Grand Garden Arena. “That’s why I’m not gonna leave anything in the hands of the judges or the referee. I’m motivated to knock [Magsayo] out.”

The 12-round battle between Magsayo (22-0 15 KOs) and Ceja (32-4-1 28 KOs) is part of the Manny Pacquiao-Yordenis Ugas undercard at T-Mobile Arena. FOX Sports Pay-Per-View will air it during a four-fight telecast scheduled to start at 9 p.m. EDT ($74.95).

The Philippines’ Magsayo is an undefeated featherweight contender who is promoted by Manny Pacquiao’s company. Freddie Roach Pacquiao’s longtime trainer works with Magsayo as well.

Meeting Magsayo 26 on the Pacquiao-Ugas undercard has made Ceja more mindful than usual of not allowing this fight to go the distance.

“Obviously we feel like I did win the Figueroa fight” Ceja said. “So I’m motivated for this fight now. I don’t wanna leave nothing on the table nothing for the judges because the same thing happened when I fought Rigondeaux. I feel I beat Rigondeaux but the ref stopped me. The ref pretty much helped Rigondeaux. I don’t wanna leave nothing in the hands of the judges or the referee. I wanna leave it in my hands.”

Ceja has lost by technical knockout three times but based on his resume he appears to be the toughest opponent of Magsayo’s eight-year pro career. The 28-year-old Ceja briefly held the WBC interim 122-pound championship and gave Rigondeaux and Figueroa a lot of difficulty in those back-to-back bouts.

Barring a draw Magsayo or Ceja will move closer toward a shot at the WBC featherweight title because their fight is a 12-round elimination match. Magsayo is ranked fifth among the WBC’s challengers for Gary Russell Jr.’s 126-pound title seven spots atop the 12th-rated Ceja.

“It’s a great opportunity” Ceja said. “If I beat Magsayo I could become the next world champion. So I’m really excited. I’m happy. I’m motivated.”

Ceja feels fresher after his move up to the 126-pound limit as well.

“At 126 I feel much stronger” Ceja said. “At 122 I was dragging my feet toward the scale. But now at 126 I’m really really strong.”

The water-reliant microchip manufacturing process is largely responsible for drawing global attention to the drought in Taiwan where TSMC has four foundries. This process also makes the famously dry American Southwest a less-than-intuitive locale for multibillion-dollar investments to manufacture such chips. But there is already an established semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in Arizona; the state has emerged as a U.S. “manufacturing hotspot” in the push to “insulate semiconductor supply from China” Fortune reported in February.

During an interview with CNBC Forrester Research vice president Glenn O’Donnell compared semiconductor manufacturing to an indoor swimming pool: “You need a lot [of water] to fill it but you don’t have to add much to keep it going. Also being in an enclosed space a lot of the water that evaporates can be captured with a dehumidifier and returned to the pool.” This comment suggests that water availability may not be an ongoing burden to the manufacturing process once volume production commences.

Also crucial for making semiconductors is access to affordable stable energy. In Taiwan the cost of electricity is at risk of increasing by as much as 25% by 2025 according to Bloomberg which reports: “the government's rigid denuclearization policy and emission reduction targets imply that more-expensive renewable electricity will be the only choice for manufacturers' surging energy needs.” In Arizona semiconductor manufacturers will have access to the U.S. power grid as well as renewable energy sources including solar.

Sourcing talent

With record demand and billion-dollar facilities on the horizon companies will need to be strategic about recruiting a capable workforce. Talent in the field is tough to find but not as tough in the Southwest as it would probably be in many other parts of the United States. Arizona has an established yet largely dormant semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and also an active semiconductor design market both of which are anticipated to streamline the U.S.’s imminent march back into chip manufacturing.

Phoenix has long been the unofficial microelectronic manufacturing hub of the United States and Andy Blye of the Phoenix Business Journal reports: “Phoenix is home to many other semiconductor companies as well. NXP ON Semiconductor Microchip and Broadcom all have employees here.” Companies in the process of establishing (or reestablishing) fabs in the American Southwest will likely source expertise necessary to run the highly anticipated foundries by either relocating talent or by drawing from the established semiconductor design workforce that already exists in cities such as Phoenix. Middle market semiconductor companies or those adjacent to this space would likely see waves of hiring by TSMC Intel and Samsung which could lure talent away or push wages higher

Additionally the chip shortage has spurred political action as this June blog post on the Semiconductor Industry Association’s website explains: “Bipartisan legislation introduced this week in the House would eliminate the counterproductive per-country cap on employment-based visas in favor of a fair ‘first come first served’ system providing U.S. semiconductor companies with greater access to top talent from around the world needed to compete and innovate.”

Future possibilities

It's important to remember that the rush for capable employees is still a ways off; TSMC’s wafer fabrication plant in Phoenix “is expected to start volume production in 2024” according to Reuters and “Intel expects the Arizona fabs to be operational sometime in 2023” Morningbrew.com reported in May. TSMC has committed $12 billion for a foundry in Phoenix with “construction slated to start next year.” And in May Reuters reported that TSMC may build up to five fabs in Arizona.

Although volume production manufacturing appears to be a few years away manufacturing-adjacent industries can be expected to gear up creating new opportunities for the American middle market. Mainly semiconductor equipment companies and suppliers packaging companies and testing shops should prepare for a wave of change over the next few years. This is a great time for these companies to determine how they will adapt to the reintroduction of large-scale volume production; shore up relationships with their own workforces contractors and existing supply chains; and set aside capital to allow for strategic agility.

The strategy to build resilient semiconductor supply chains for the future “must include taking defensive actions to protect our technological advantages” according to the White House’s supply chain review. “But we must also proactively invest in domestic production and R&D.”

With approved capital expenditure plans experienced workforces to tap potential eases forthcoming for employment-based visas and an ever-growing demand for chips the future appears bright for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. However the trickle-down effects of reemerging domestic chip production are still in large part many years away from having significant impact on the global chip market and the middle market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In Hot Chips 33 presentation AMD outlines the future of 3D stacking technology also sharing first details on its 3D V-Cache stacking.

AMD presentation showcases existing and future 3D stacking technologies. As the TSV (Through Silicon Via) a vertical inter-wafer or inter-die connection sees an increase in bonds the technology will be focusing on more complex 3D stacking designs. At this point in time stacking allows full die-to-die stacking allowing DRAM on CPUs or CPUs on CPUs. The technology is progressing towards putting separate modules on themselves such as cores on cores only to allow macroblocks to be stacked.

Eventually the TSV pitch will be so dense that module splitting folding or even circuit splitting will be possible which will completely revamp the future of processors as we know them today. AMD listed all existing stacking technologies including Intel’s Foveros/EMIB techniques implying that AMD considered using this technology for their processors:

AMD had opted for a micro bump pitch of 9 microns which is a bit denser than future Intel Foveros Direct technology at 10 microns.

AMD expects its 3D Chiplet technology to offer 3x higher interconnect energy efficiency and 15x higher interconnect density.

The manufacturer had already announced its plans for 3D chipsets based on AMD Zen3 CPU featuring silicon to silicon TSV. The technology will increase the Level3 cache by 64MB. AMD already demonstrated the potential of its 3D V-Cache technology on AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU with 32+64MB L3 cache. Such a configuration increases the framerate by 15% AMD revealed.

Back at Computex 2021 where the technology was first shown AMD announced that Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache are to be mass-produced by the end of this year.

But at this year's Hot Chips symposium AMD is already laying out where it intends to go from here with ambitious ideas on how to apply the technology.

The 3D V-Cache shown off by AMD at Computex is the (relatively) simple addition of further L3 cache to a Ryzen 9 5900X bringing around a ~15% performance uplift in games. The 3D-stacking arrangement let AMD use a production process that allows for more densely packed SRAM for the upper die fitting 64 MB in the space directly above the 32 MB on the base die that had to be silicon suitable for both cache and compute.

This was all done using through-silicon vias (TSVs) connected with direct vertical copper-to-copper connections that pack far closer together than ""traditional"" microbump technology.

AMD claims a 9 micron bump pitch for their hybrid direct bonding technology; by comparison Intel Foveros was working on the order of 50 microns when implemented in Lakefield the main point of comparison used for AMD's claim of 3x efficiency gains and 15x higher density with its interconnects compared to the conspicuously unspecified ""other 3D architecture.""

Team Blue also have a pitch of 36 microns quoted for their upcoming Foveros Omni technology to be used in Meteor Lake CPUs and 10 microns in Foveros Direct a hybrid solution that more directly competes with what AMD's showing off here.

However both are only slated to arrive in 2023 while AMD have stated that their 3D-stacked Ryzen chips will be in mass-production by the end of this year.

The company is also working with TSMC on more complex 3D stacking designs with the ambition to stack CPU cores on one another splitting macroblocks of a CPU (such as lower levels of cache) between different layers or even going down to the level of circuit slicing.

Stacking compute silicon in particular brings unique difficulties in providing power to higher dies and removing heat from lower ones – one of the reasons why AMD's 3D V-Cache is only layered on top of the base die's cache leaving the CPU cores alone.

Of course all of this depends on how much improvement can be brought in power performance area and cost (PPAC) metrics – and of course if TSMC can continue to deliver their advanced packaging techniques in mass production.",,,,,,,,,

Microsoft plans to boost the price for its business software subscriptions including its core Office 365 suite starting on March 1 2022. The company calls it “the first substantive pricing update” since it launched Office 365 back in 2011 shifting from traditional licenses to subscription pricing.

The price increase “was a smart strategic poker move that could be another $5 billion+ incremental tailwind for Redmond in 2022 giving more confidence that numbers could continue to move up higher looking ahead” wrote Daniel Ives an analyst with Wedbush in a note to clients Friday morning.

For context Microsoft’s revenue was $168.1 billion in its recently completed 2021 fiscal year which ended June 30 up 18% year-over-year.

Ives wrote that Wedbush’s latest checks with Microsoft customers indicate that the “Azure cloud growth story is hitting its next gear of growth” contrary to Wall Street assumptions that the return to the office after the pandemic would put the brakes on cloud revenue growth.

Based on those two developments Wedbush raised its 12-month stock price target for Microsoft to $350 per share from $325 per share previously.

Microsoft’s price increase “reflects the increased value we have delivered to our customers over the past 10 years” wrote Jared Spataro corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 in a post this week.

Here’s how the price increases break down.

Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user)

Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22)

Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10)

Nadella discussed the responsibility tech companies need to take over the future of artificial intelligence.

Personal computers with Windows have made sounds to indicate errors since the 1980s. With Windows 11 Microsoft has revamped those sounds to make them less stressful.

Windows remains the world's most popular operating system accounting for about 14% of Microsoft's $168 billion in annual revenue. But it isn't always easy for Microsoft to keep its hundreds of millions of customers happy as they have widely varying opinions of what Windows should be — including what it should sound like.

The designers of Windows 11 took inspiration from an approach called calm technology which was described by two employees of the Xerox PARC research lab more than two decades ago. ""Calmness is much needed in today's world and it tends to hinge on our ability to feel in control at ease and trustful"" Microsoft's Christina Koehn and Diego Baca wrote in a blog post. ""Windows 11 facilitates this through foundational experiences that feel familiar soften formerly intimidating UI and increase emotional connection.""

Calm technology also informed the development of the sounds of Windows 11 said Matthew Bennett who crafted the sounds following contributions to Windows 8 and Windows 10.

Windows 11 stands out from its predecessors and its competitors by allowing people to use one group of sounds to match with light visual themes and a different group that goes along with dark themes. The sounds are similar which means people can recognize them as they switch between modes but slightly different. Applying a dark theme generally makes the sounds softer. They seem to echo as if in a large room.

""The new sounds have a much rounder wavelength making them softer so that they can still alert/notify you but without being overwhelming"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. Just like we rounded UI [user interface] visually we rounded our soundscape as well to soften the overall feel of the experience.""

People can change the default sounds by opening the Settings app and going to ""Sound > More sound settings."" But plenty of people will keep using the default sounds just as many people who open Microsoft Word will end up using the default font.

Bennett who left Microsoft in February after 12 years at the company spelled out several changes the company made to its system sounds with Windows 11 during the course of multiple interviews. (Each of the audio files below contains the new sound followed by its Windows 10 predecessor.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1wcm8tNy12cy1zdXJmYWNlLXByby140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro X: Which should you buy?,"Microsoft Surface Pro 7 $686.99 at Amazon $694.99 at Walmart $699.99 at Amazon Powerful Surface 2-in-1

The Surface Pro 7 is a continuation of the Pro design we've come to know and love albeit with a few minor changes. On the other hand the Surface Pro X is a significant departure as it's the first ARM-powered Pro we've seen. It's built for a different usage scenario despite following similar design cues and it was announced alongside a new Surface Slim Pen and Type Cover combination.

There's now the Surface Pro 7 Plus for Business which adds optional 4G LTE 11th Gen Intel Core CPU and Iris Xe integrated graphics and longer battery life. Although I'll still be focusing on the standard Pro 7 you can check out our Surface Pro 7 Plus vs. Surface Pro 7 comparison to see all the major differences.

And there's also the SQ2 version of the Surface Pro X released late 2020. Aside from the upgraded ARM CPU there's a new platinum color scheme more colors for the Type Cover and some general advancement in ARM and Windows. Both SQ1 and SQ2 models are still readily available to buy from Microsoft and other major retailers.

Let's take a look at the specs that make up these two devices.

Design and features

If you're familiar with the previous generations of the 2-in-1 Pro lineup not much has changed for the Pro 7. It still has the folding kickstand on the back a unibody aluminum design and it includes an IR camera for Windows Hello. It's so similar that you will be able to use older Type Covers and Surface Pens with the Pro 7 potentially saving you a good chunk of money if you're upgrading.

The Surface Pro X on the other hand has a thinner chassis that's lighter than Core i7 models of the Pro 7. It still has a kickstand on the back for propping up the tablet and it works in tandem with a new style keyboard that has a storage bay for the new Surface Slim Pen you can buy separately.

For ports the Pro 7 now includes USB-C instead of Mini DisplayPort allowing more versatility while still offering external display support. The Pro X has two USB-C ports but it doesn't have USB-A for your older devices. Both 2-in-1s have the proprietary Surface Connect port and both have a Surface Keyboard connector. One thing that's irksome is a lack of 3.5mm audio jack on the Pro X; Microsoft has already put out a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter so you'll have to jump on the dongle wagon if you'd like to use wired headphones.

There's no LTE connectivity for the Pro 7 (you'll have to go with the Pro 7 Plus for that) though it does offer Wi-Fi 6 connectivity for blazing wireless speeds. The Pro X is stuck on Wi-Fi 5 which is what we're used to but it does have support for both physical (Nano SIM) and eSIM to keep you connected when out of Wi-Fi range.

The front-facing cameras are similarly 5 megapixel (1080p) on both models though the rear-facing cameras differ. The Pro 7 has an 8-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video while the Pro X has a 10-megapixel camera capable of 4K video. If you're concerned with capture quality the Pro X will no doubt be the better choice.

Display and inking

Nothing has changed for the Surface Pro 7 in the touch display department compared to the Pro 6. It's sized at 12.3 inches with a 2736x1824 resolution and 267 PPI with a boxy 3:2 aspect ratio that's ideal for a tablet. It works with the Surface Pen for a quality inking experience with 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and tilt support for shading. To keep the Pen nearby it clips magnetically onto the side of the tablet.

The Pro X has shaken things up when it comes to the touch display. The chassis has almost the same footprint as the Pro 7's but the screen has had its bezel shrunk to accommodate more screen real estate. The result is a 13-inch display with 2880x1920 resolution and 267 PPI. It has the same 3:2 aspect ratio and ultimately will offer about the same experience as you'll get with the Pro 7.

However the Surface Slim Pen has a storage bay built into the attachable keyboard where it will charge while not in use. If you're sick of your Pen falling off your Pro while in your bag the Pro X's setup will be a welcome change. Note that the Slim Pen should work with other Surface devices.

Performance

The Surface Pro X is the first ARM-powered Pro device to hit the market. The original models have inside a custom 7nm Microsoft SQ1 7W CPU. It is essentially a suped-up Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx complete with eight cores 3GHz clock and custom Adreno 685 graphics (GPU) able to power dual 4K external displays. There's also now the SQ2 version that gives a slight boost to performance. When I say slight I mean slight. If you already have a Pro X with SQ1 CPU the upgrade is certainly not worth it.

The GPU delivers 2 teraflops of power — the original Xbox One had 1.3 teraflops — but it's not exactly meant for gaming. OpenGL games won't work on ARM and the device is ultimately suited best for web and scripted apps. UNITY and Unreal engines are getting ARM support though so we could begin to see some very good mobile games for the Pro X in the future. The Pro X isn't a gaming laptop but it can certainly keep up with Intel's integrated graphics.

Intel Iris Plus Graphics in Core i5 and Core i7 Surface Pro 7 models will be able to handle light to medium gaming but likewise don't expect it to perform as a gaming juggernaut. One thing to keep in mind is the arrival of Project xCloud Microsoft's upcoming game-streaming service. With a fast steady internet connection both the Pro 7 and Pro X could be used for a quality gaming experience.

.

On the CPU side you will see some limitations in the ARM-powered Pro X but in just about all cases you're going to be able to use your favorite software. And in terms of raw power the SQ1 and SQ2 CPUs easily beat an 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U. They just won't beat out the 10th Gen chips in the Pro 7. Battery life hits eight hours regularly in the Pro 7 while the Pro X hits about 10 hours using ARM64 and UWP apps. It falls to about seven or eight hours if emulating 32-bit x86 apps.

RAM in both devices runs up to 16GB of LPDDR4x. You can go as low as 4GB of RAM in the Pro 7 to save money while the Pro X drops down to 8GB. For storage the Pro 7 goes up to a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD) while the Pro X maxes out at 512GB. However storage on the Pro X can be removed without having to pull apart the entire chassis something that's not possible on the Pro 7.

Price

Looking at Microsoft prices for the Pro 7 start at $750. These baseline configurations include an Intel Core i3-1005G1 CPU 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD and do not include a Type Cover or Surface Pen. A decked-out model with Core i7-1065G7 CPU 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD runs at about $2100 making it considerably more expensive than the Pro X.

There are several variants of the Surface Pro X available to buy including an introductory $850 model with SQ1 CPU 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. Bumping storage up to a 256GB SSD raises the price to about $1000. Moving up to SQ2 models you're looking at about $1200 for a model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. A high-end model with SQ2 CPU 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD costs about $1500.

Keep in mind that other retailers will likely have different prices so you might be able to snag either device for even cheaper during a sale.

Go with the Surface Pro 7 for the best performance

The 10th Gen Intel Core ""Ice Lake"" CPUs available in the Pro 7 are going to be hard to beat in terms of raw performance and Intel Iris Plus Graphics are no joke either. Add up to 1TB of storage space and enjoy Wi-Fi 6 wireless speeds. You won't get LTE here and battery life won't be quite as good but the Pro 7 is a more traditional device that comes at a cheaper starting price. If neither of these devices are really to your liking head over to our roundup of the best Windows laptop options.

Stick with the Surface Pro X for ultimate portability

The ARM-powered Surface Pro X won't match up performance-wise with the higher-end Pro 7 models but LTE connectivity longer battery life and a slimmer body make it easy to take with you wherever you go. A smart new storage system for a slimmer pen is an attractive addition and two USB-C ports offer decent connectivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4Y2hhbmdlLXNlcnZlcnMtYmVpbmctaGFja2VkLWJ5LW5ldy1sb2NrZmlsZS1yYW5zb213YXJlL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4Y2hhbmdlLXNlcnZlcnMtYmVpbmctaGFja2VkLWJ5LW5ldy1sb2NrZmlsZS1yYW5zb213YXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Exchange servers being hacked by new LockFile ransomware,"A new ransomware gang known as LockFile encrypts Windows domains after hacking into Microsoft Exchange servers using the recently disclosed ProxyShell vulnerabilities.

ProxyShell is the name of an attack consisting of three chained Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

The three vulnerabilities were discovered by Devcore Principal Security Researcher Orange Tsai who chained them together to take over a Microsoft Exchange server in April's Pwn2Own 2021 hacking contest.

CVE-2021-34473 - Pre-auth Path Confusion leads to ACL Bypass (Patched in April by KB5001779)

CVE-2021-34523 - Elevation of Privilege on Exchange PowerShell Backend (Patched in April by KB5001779)

CVE-2021-31207 - Post-auth Arbitrary-File-Write leads to RCE (Patched in May by KB5003435)

While Microsoft fully patched these vulnerabilities in May 2021 more technical details were recently disclosed allowing security researchers and threat actors to reproduce the exploit.

As reported last week by BleepingComputer this has led to threat actors actively scanning for and hacking Microsoft Exchange servers using the ProxyShell vulnerabilities.

After exploiting an Exchange server the threat actors dropped web shells that could be used to upload other programs and execute them.

At the time NCC Group's vulnerability researcher Rich Warren told BleepingComputer that the web shells were being used to install a .NET backdoor that was downloading a harmless payload at the time.

Since then security researcher Kevin Beaumont reports that a new ransomware operation known as LockFile uses the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell and the Windows PetitPotam vulnerabilities to take over Windows domains and encrypt devices.

When breaching a network the threat actors will first access the on-premise Microsoft Exchange server using the ProxyShell vulnerabilities. Once they gain a foothold Symantec says the LockFile gang uses the PetitPotam vulnerability to take over a domain controller and thus the Windows domain.

From there it is trivial to deploy the ransomware through the entire network.

What we know about the LockFile ransomware

At this time there is not much known about the new LockFile ransomware operation.

When first seen in July the ransom note was named 'LOCKFILE-README.hta' but did not have any particular branding as shown below.

Old LockFile ransom notes

Starting last week BleepingComputer began receiving reports of a ransomware gang using branded ransom notes indicating that they were called 'LockFile' as shown below

These ransom notes use a naming format of '[victim_name]-LOCKFILE-README.hta' and prompted the victim to contact them via Tox or email to negotiate the ransom. The current email address used by the operation is contact@contipauper.com which appears to be a reference to the Conti ransomware operation.

While the color schemes of the ransom notes are similar the communication methods and wording make it unclear if they are the same operation.

Of particular interest is that the color scheme and layout of the ransom notes is very similar to the LockBit ransomware but there does not appear to be any relation.

When encrypting files the ransomware will append the .lockfile extension to the encrypted file's names.

Yesterday afternoon when BleepingComputer and ransomware expert Michael Gillespie analyzed the July version of LockFile we found it to be a noisy ransomware taking up many system resources and causing temporary freezes of the computer.

Patch now!

As the LockFile operation uses both the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities and the Windows PetitPotam NTLM Relay vulnerability it is imperative that Windows administrators install the latest updates.

For the ProxyShell vulnerabilities you can install the latest Microsoft Exchange cumulative updates to patch the vulnerabilities.

The Windows PetitPotam attack gets a bit complicated as Microsoft's security update is incomplete and does not patch all the vulnerability vectors.

To patch the PetitPotam attack you can use an unofficial patch from 0patch to block this NTLM relay attack vector or apply NETSH RPC filters that block access to vulnerable functions in the MS-EFSRPC API.

Beaumont says you can perform the following Azure Sentinel queries to check if your Microsoft Exchange server has been scanned for the ProxyShell vulnerability.

W3CIISLog | where csUriStem == ""/autodiscover/autodiscover.json"" | where csUriQuery has ""PowerShell"" | where csMethod == ""POST""

All organizations are strongly advised to apply the patches as soon as possible and create offline backups of their Exchange servers."

The story so far: Moderna the Massachusetts-based American biotechnology company has indicated that it may begin human trials for a vaccine for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in September  according to the ClinicalTrials.gov website employing the same m-RNA platform that it has used in its COVID-19 vaccine.

How is the candidate vaccine expected to work?

Formally known as mRNA-1644 it is made in a way to stimulate the B cells of the immune system. These are a class of white blood cells that produce antibodies which can bind to invading bacteria and viruses. The larger purpose of stimulating the B cells is to generate what are called broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) which are specialised blood proteins that attach to the surface proteins of HIV and disable them by accessing key but hard-to-reach regions on the virus. Over the last decade there have been advances in identifying new bnAbs from HIV-infected individuals that were seen to target very specific sites in the outer envelope of the HIV. Lab-based analysis and tests on animals have improved the understanding of how the knowledge of these sites can be used to make immunogens (or parts of a virus or bacteria that elicit an antibody response from the immune system. In the case of a coronavirus for instance the spike protein is an immunogen against which different vaccines elicit antibodies.)

One such immunogen that has been designed in the lab is eOD-GT8 60mer developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and its partners. In a Phase I trial scientists tested whether this approach would stimulate the human immune system to initiate the generation of bnAbs. This February IAVI announced that their trial produced promising results and their vaccine had succeeded in stimulating the production of the bnAbs needed to stimulate antibodies. The targeted response was detected in 97% of the participants. There were 48 healthy adults who had volunteered in the trial some of whom got the vaccine and some did not. The Moderna trial is designed to investigate a way to effectively deliver the eOD-GT8 60mer immunogen using the m-RNA technology that will direct cells to make the BnAbs which will elicit immune responses against HIV. For this trial Moderna will recruit 56 healthy adults without HIV to test the safety of the vaccine mRNA-1644 and basic immune response. The vaccine’s development involves funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Why is this approach promising?

The quest to develop an HIV vaccine is considered among the holy grails of scientific research. While treatment with Anti-Retroviral Therapy has significantly improved the longevity of those with AIDS this is a lifelong treatment. According to the World Health Organization there are around 37.7 million living with HIV as of 2020. Traditional vaccine approaches have not worked for HIV and in fact some of them have gone on to worsen infection. RNA-based immunogens are believed to be a promising alternative because they do not involve the use of a live virus can be made relatively easily can be quickly deployed and safely administered. A drawback of m-RNA vaccines used to be their instability. However the experience with the coronavirus vaccine has come as a shot in the arm. The success of m-RNA vaccines — Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna — in reducing hospitalisation and mortality has led to confidence in the underlying platform and therefore fresh investments to improve it.

What are the challenges ahead?

Of the people living with HIV over two-thirds are in Africa. Any success in containing the HIV pandemic would mean drastically cutting the rates of transmission there. However as the experience with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines shows getting essential jabs to the regions where they are most needed is the biggest stumbling block. Another challenge with m-RNA vaccines is that they are sensitive to temperature in storage and is a challenge for developing countries. HIV has mutated into several variants and is an insidious virus and it will be many years before definitive proof of the success of the m-RNA approach can be established.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL2NvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtbW9kZXJuYS1icnVuZWktbWZhLXNpbmdhcG9yZS0yMTI3Nzkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore sends 100000 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Brunei,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has contributed 100000 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as part of bilateral cooperation with Brunei to tackle the ongoing pandemic the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Saturday (Aug 20).

Coors seems to be determined to become the official supplier of all of our alcohol needs if their forays into sodas hard seltzers and ciders (via Molson Coors) are any indication.

Coors is an iconic company with a long history in the beverage business. It got its start in 1873 when German immigrant Adolph Coors and his business partner Jacob Schueler opened the Golden Brewery in Golden Colorado and produced the first bottles of its Golden Lager a year later (via Denver Business Journal). Joint ventures and mergers with SAB Miller and Molson Brewing of Canada have given the Molson Coors Beverage Company (now headquartered not in Colorado but in Chicago Illinois) a large chunk of the beverage market. Not content to rest on its laurels Molson Coors recently formed a division of the company called ""The Beverage Hub"" (via Drinks Retailing News) which is busy developing additional beverages to add to Molson Coors' portfolio of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage brands.

One of Molson Coors' newest products is Five Trail Whiskey. Five Trail is a blended American whiskey according to Thrillist. It will appear on store shelves beginning September 1. However Coors' venture into the whiskey world is starting with just four states: Colorado Nevada Georgia and New York. As of this writing we know of no timetable for debuting Five Trails in other markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sam Stites / OPB

Bakery workers at the Nabisco cookie plant in North Portland entered their 12th of a strike on Saturday after union members walked out on Aug. 10 following the breakdown of contract negotiations.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Representatives of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union Local 364 (BCTGM) said that workers decided to strike after three weeks of negotiations with Mondelez International the Chicago-based owner of Nabisco failed to yield an agreement.

According to Cameron Taylor a union business agent one of the major sticking points was a proposal to shift employees to a seven-day alternating shift workweek and remove overtime pay for weekends.

“These guys worked through the pandemic making all these snack products for this company working record time at record hours” Taylor said. “This company made record profits and they come to the table and they want takeaways from us. It’s disgusting.”

According to a statement from Mondelez the company is disappointed that union employees decided to walk out. The company said its goal has always been to bargain in good faith with its employees but it has now activated a plan to continue production while workers remain on strike.

“We have activated our robust business continuity plan and are committed to continuing to supply our delicious snacks to retailers and consumers” the statement reads.

The walkout by workers at the Portland plant was followed by walkouts at four other facilities in Colorado Virginia and Illinois representing a strike of more than 1000 employees nationwide.

Union employees have picketed in front of the Columbia Boulevard facility every day since the walkout with more than 200 people joining on Saturday for a rally at the front gates where labor advocates and other supporters chanted and waved signs.

Nabisco cookie factory workers listen to speakers and cheer at the picket line in front of the Columbia Boulevard facility Saturday Aug. 10. Sam Stites / OPB

Union organizers and politicians such as Oregon AFL-CIO President Graham Trainor state Rep. Rachel Prusak D-West Linn and Secretary of State Shemia Fagan were in attendance.

Vehicles passing by the picket line slowed down to read signs honk in appreciation and hold raised fists out their windows. Members of unions representing a wide variety of industries were also in attendance — as well as workers who don’t have union representation — in a show of solidarity.

BCTGM Union Local 364 President and Nabisco factory worker Jesus Martinez said the outpouring of support has meant a lot to those who have decided to walk out and fight for a better contract.

“They’ve said they want us to give up benefits they want us to work more and it has to stop” Martinez said. “We just want something fair. We want to keep what we’ve already paid for. They’ve given us nothing for free. Everything has been negotiated.”

Nearly a dozen or so speakers stood in front of the large crowd at the front gates of the facility on Saturday to air grievances with how the facility’s management has treated its workers. Some speakers from other unions offered words of encouragement and shared similar experiences in fighting for better contracts.

One of the main themes speakers returned to was corporate greed highlighting that Mondelez International recorded more than $3.5 billion in profits in 2020.

Union vice president Mike Burlingham said he and his coworkers appreciate the support and hope they can inspire others to stand up for themselves in their negotiations with employers for fair working conditions pay and benefits.

“This is a fight for the American middle class” Burlingham said. “We’re fighting to maintain what we already have. We’re not coming to the table asking for things we’re coming to the table saying just leave things alone.”

To support them in the fight for a better contract bakery union workers are asking the public not to buy certain products made at their facility. That includes Oreos and Chips Ahoy cookies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY2lvLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtbmV3cy90aHJlZS11cy1naWFudHMtdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLXVwLzg1NTA3MDE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three US giants to invest in UP,"Advt

As per a report by Zee News 40 foreign companies including American companies have proposed to invest about Rs 17000 crore in UP in the last four and a half years of the Yogi Adityanath government.

Among these companies are some of the largest names in the corporate world including Adobe Amazon American Tower Corporation Apple Caterpillar Delphi Cisco Deloitte Emerson Ernst & Young Google Johnson & Johnson JP Morgan & Company Lockheed Martin Marriott International MasterCard Mondelez International Carlyle Group Walmart Warburg Pincus IHS Markit and USIBC.

Many companies including Adobe Amazon Microsoft Delphi New Holland Global Logic Excel PepsiCo Synopsis and Cargill are already operating in India while Microsoft MACQ Software Noida and PepsiCo have stepped efforts to set up units in Uttar Pradesh.

The Akhilesh Yadav government projected itself as investment-friendly and tried to attract investment but the foremost thing the companies seek to start and project in a particular region is- rule of law. In the Akhilesh Yadav government Uttar Pradesh has registered a rise in crime against industrialists and wealthy people. The leaders of the Samajwadi Party used to extort money from industrialists in the name protection and party fund and many were killed in daylight because they refused to contribute. Therefore the tycoons were scared to invest in the state.

However after Yogi Government came to power the first thing to get fixed was the policing system. The government made active investments in policing and increased the budget by double digits. With the investment in policing and political backing many criminals were encountered and the corrupt leaders who extorted money from industrialists were put behind bars.

Now Uttar Pradesh is one of the most efficiently administered parts of the country and the ‘rule of law prevails in the state. Therefore the industrialists have no qualms about over-investing in the state which is not just being governed efficiently but the government is also providing various incentives for investment.

South Korean electronics manufacturers are ready to invest and move their factories to Uttar Pradesh from China. It seems that country after country is rushing to shift their factories to Uttar Pradesh given the availability of cheap labour a strong pro-active government and investment-friendly policies.

The Yogi government has organized various investor summits and expos in the last few years to attract private investment. These events have been quite successful with the promise of investment worth 4.68 lakh crore rupees in the UP Investor summit and more than 70000 crore rupees in the defence expo organized a few months ago.

The Yogi government has been proactive in dealing with Coronavirus and has already set up committees to assess the financial and social impact of lockdown on 11 sectors- industry construction revenue labour education agriculture social welfare rural development urban affairs water and handicapped welfare. The Yogi government must be applauded for transforming the state from a nightmare for industrialists to heaven for law-abiding companies.",,,

Investors are always looking for the next best opportunity that will deliver the most profitable ROI. Nowadays thanks to online brokers such as Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) eToro and many more engaging in such a process can be quite easy in comparison to a few years ago.

Anyone can become an investor especially in what the stock market has defined as a penny stock.

This has opened up the chance for students and underprivileged people to engage face-first with the ample monetary opportunities that the stock market can provide in 2021.

But are penny stocks under 10 cents worth investing? What are the risks under this very volatile Covid environment? Anyone even mildly interested in this alternative should continue reading.

The Penny Stocks Potential

A host of well-established companies once traded for less than $1 a share including Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST). Those who invested in these companies during their trading days could have accrued substantial profit.

Penny stocks are generally highly volatile and riskier but still represent the possibility of significant growth.

The appeal of a penny stock is easy to see as if you have $1000 to invest in the stock market you can get a considerably higher percentage of shares in a smaller company whose shares trade for a few cents rather than buying “blue chip” shares which can cost significantly more for an extremely small percentage of ownership.

Of course if a penny stock becomes a blue chip you could end up making big profits with the right trading strategy. Many pharmaceutical stocks that were considered small have reached blue-chip level.

Penny Stocks Under 10 To Watch

Stock Highlights

[wpdatatable id=1]

The first pool of penny stocks under 10 cents is Mobile TeleSystems –Mobil’nye Telesistemy PAO. The company is headquartered in Moscow Russia and primarily focuses on providing hardware and internet services for its expanding customer base.

A by-product of the privatization that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union the company announced significant growth before eventually hitting roughly 80 million subscribers.

This can be both an incentive and a deterrent for some but it should be noted that the company does come with a plethora of attractive features including a long-term analytic share price history which shows very little price volatility.

As for Banco Bradesco SA Preference Shares it is a banking and financial services company headquartered in the state of São Paulo Brazil with a cheap stock price of $5.52.

It is currently one of the hottest penny stocks under 10 cents and anyone overlooking this opportunity could miss a profitable trade.

Banco Bradesco is the third-largest banking company in the country as well as in Latin America and it is ranked as one of the top 50 most valuable banks in the entire world.

The opportunities to trade 10 cents penny stocks are arguably reflected on the prolific third-party investment it has received with over fifteen hedge funds investing in Banco Bradesco in its fourth quarter of 2020.

VEON Ltd is a Dutch telecom company with a current stock price of just over $ 1.7. Despite its very small market price it is actually one of the largest companies on the list with annual revenue of just under $8 billion in 2020.

With a current market capitalization of over $ 3 billion VEON Ltd. is certainly an option for those looking for strong penny stocks.

Secure Energy Services Inc is certainly another good option for penny stocks under 10 cents. This is a public energy services company specializing in solutions to upstream oil and natural gas corporations in the Canadian hemisphere and the U.S.

Its headquarters are based in Alberta Canada and its current stock price is just over $4. The company is categorized into several segments all encapsulating different services.

Annaly Capital Management Inc currently priced at $9.3 seems to come with a surprising number of advantages for penny stocks when considering its rather low market price.

The company is currently one of the largest mortgage investment trusts in the state of Maryland with its main headquarters stationed in New York City U.S. Annaly Capital Management penny stocks under 10 cents provide an astounding dividend of over 9%.

This is a massive incentive for individuals looking for a potentially sustainable source of income in the future as its shares have risen by over 50% in the last 12 months outperforming the S&P 500 Index by over 5%.

What To Look For When Selecting Stocks

Product Viability

One of the key factors to invest in penny stock is to evaluate a company’s prospects. Thinking “what could go wrong?” before investing will give you an idea of what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company’s ability to grow in the long term. Product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires? How could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product? The more viable a product is the better chances of good long-term growth and short-term stock performance.

Potential Company Growth

Although product viability will let you gauge a company’s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own. Within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm’s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the CEO. Any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand’s value.

Other aspects to consider are the firm’s ability to innovate research and operational excellence. The harder it is for competitors to breach the company’s moat the stronger the competitive advantage.

Assets vs. Liabilities

A firm’s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing. Assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled.

“The strength of a company’s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment-quality measurements: working capital or short-term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure” according to Investopedia.

In this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short-listed organizations.

Liquidity of the Market

Yes liquidity matters. According to FS Investments liquidity is “ the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security.” In this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be “liquid” while the opposite means they are illiquid.

In this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more-liquid investments “and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them.”

Tips in Trading Penny Stocks

Only Trade Money You Can Afford to Lose

This is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general. This rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means –apart from the literal– if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest.

Monitor the News Surrounding Your Stocks

Industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential. Still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context. When traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength.

Be careful of using news too simplistically. In many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context.

Don’t Rely on Promotional Pumps

At times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals. Euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset’s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher.

Steer Clear of Penny Stocks Listed in OTC

Several OTC-listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next big breakout. However these large businesses that offer a near-guarantee of achievement start with a high-priced IPO not on the penny stock market. Also OTC stocks do not need to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain on the exchange.

Only Trade With Volume

Penny stock requires you to trade with volume. According to Raging Bull they have a volume of around thousands of shares a day but penny stock firms with breaking news could have a high volume of millions of shares in a day.

“How do penny stocks make money for you? This is the time when you’re likely to cash in and in the penny stock world there’s some major event nearly every day.”

Never Over Trade – Buy Then Sell

The type of account you have may or may not allow for day trading. For instance if you are a starter your account may enclose restrictions intended to stop you from advanced trading strategies “or investing in securities that are illiquid or extremely volatile.”

“If this is the case and you’re upset by it then instead of viewing the restrictions as something negative it might help to think of them as benevolent brakes –in place to keep you from causing yourself financial damage by overtrading without understanding the risks involved.”

Ensure Wins One Trade at a Time

Staying liquid is also a way to stay invested. You only have to take positions when the market situation requires it. Minimizing the turnover of the assets that make up the portfolio substantially minimizes management costs.

Further controlling losses means that there is a limit in which they can be assumed to have a margin of recovery in the next trade. Compound interest added over time will allow you to achieve a higher return. An asset that is in a winning position can never lead to a losing position.

FAQs

Before launching into penny stock trading make sure you answer yourself some key questions yourself.

Can you get rich off penny stocks?

The answer is “yes.” But most of the time penny stocks can turn out to be quite risky. In fact such actions can lead to many different types of scams. However it is important to understand that penny stocks can earn you a lot of money and this is the reason why most investors are always willing to invest in these stocks.

They believe that the advantages of stocks outweigh the disadvantages. Among courageous investors these stocks have always been popular and in simple words they can offer impressive returns in a short amount of time.

Can I invest 500 dollars in stocks?

According to several expert stock traders this amount is perfectly valid to begin our adventures in the world of the stock market. However it is rather used to gain experience not to try to get the most out of them.

In other words you have a small amount to fine-tune your future investment moves which is something very important since you cannot always hit the value that offers the best returns.

What is the most successful penny stock ever?

Several penny stocks have achieved incredible feats but perhaps the most famous one is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the company remained away from the spotlight for many years it traded at $80 cents per share back in the early 2000s. As one of the largest tech companies worldwide the share has hit up to $360 with a return of 46750%. Still for every tech company whose penny stocks become a success hundreds fail.

What is the most shorted stock right now?

According to Seeking Alpha the most heavily shorted stock is currently Workhorse Group Inc (WKHS) with a 33% short interest. The firm is working on electric-powered trucks and utility vehicles “although still in the early stages of development ahead of a mass-market launch.”

“There is skepticism on whether the company will be able to meet production targets and if it has the necessary cash for the required investments.”

A Final Take

Penny stocks are well known for being extremely volatile and price fluctuations are very common reaching around 20%. Therefore it is essential to perform a fundamental analysis while following your risk management strategy before deciding whether to proceed with any trading decision.

Also it is good practice to operate in industries where there is great market growth compared to industries that are in decline.

Penny stocks tend not to have much daily trading volume on the stock markets therefore a large buy or sell order is often not needed to move the price. If many people are talking about a pea in internet forums for example that could also influence the price.

It’s important not to get caught up in an investment just because you’ve had a big one-day move and are afraid of losing it. What goes up quickly can go down even faster so make sure your reasons for investing in the stock market are correct.

One thing this pandemic has taught is that having the option to do physical activities in the digital sphere is both useful and desirable and thanks to virtual reality technology living life digitally has become even more immersive than ever. Nowadays you can even shop in virtual reality spaces!

Event planning company Hikky’s Virtual Market for example is a digital event space where users can don avatars to enter a marketplace buy real-life goods talk to people and explore the local area. But the most recent Virtual Market event Virtual Market 6 is special because its entranceway is a realistic recreation of Akihabara Station!

▼ Images are concept images and may not be exactly the same in the VR space.

Hikky has teamed up with JR East and JR East Planning to create a VR experience of the Akihabara Station area which will be the digital launching point of Virtual Market 6 from now until August 28. Visitors from anywhere in the world can walk around Akihabara Station enter through the station ticket gates and even ride the train to travel around the VR world of Virtual Market 6.

The station area looks exactly like the real Akihabara Station both inside and out all the way down to the ticket gates signboards and even the escalators. In the VR space you’ll also find characters from Evangelion and HoloLive as well as Chiitan! Look out for a special piece of mosaic art which will also decorate the real-life Akihabara Station for a limited time.

The collaboration intends to unveil more exciting ways to use the virtual Akihabara Station–besides just a launching point– such as inviting various companies to add their own flair to it. There are also more plans for the real station to mirror things that happen in the virtual station like with the mosaic art. We’ll have to wait and see what cool things unfold!

If you would like to check out the Akihabara Station entrance of Virtual Market 6 you can do so by going to its main page. Hikky’s Virtual Markets are open 24 hours a day while they’re ongoing so people from all over the world can join in at any time. You don’t need to have any VR consoles to participate either; you can easily access the venue from a PC.

This is one example of how the three companies are working together in their “Beyond Stations” initiative to combine the real and digital worlds and create a new kind of experience. Though this is the first of their collaborations JR East JR East Planning and Hikky have made a commitment to be pioneers in the territory of XR technology together–so we might see a lot more cool things come from them in the future!

A stunning mosaic depicting the Eternal Flame was displayed on the Kop in tribute to Andrew Devine the 97th victim of the Hillsborough tragedy.

Supporters held aloft cards that together created the image of the emblem along with the number 97.

A minute's silence was also held as Anfield paid tribute to the 55-year-old who died last month from injuries suffered in the disaster.

Liverpool FC captain Jordan Henderson laid a wreath dedicated to Mr Devine in front of the Kop before kick off.

The poignant acts of support came at the club's opening home game of the Premier League season against Burnley.

Volunteers had laid the mosaic tribute on the seats of the famous stand on Friday night after being invited by the club.

The mosaic and minute's silence followed the renaming of the walkway in front of the Main Stand to 97 Avenue earlier this week.

It had previously been called 96 Avenue.

Mr Devine defied medical expectations to live with his injuries for more than three decades.

Then 22 he was severely hurt in the terrace crush at the Leppings Lane end of the Sheffield stadium allocated to Liverpool supporters for the club's 1989 FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest.

Supported by his family he continued to go to matches when possible.

Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello ruled Mr Devine had been unlawfully killed.

His verdict was in line with the findings of a jury that in 2016 concluded the other 96 innocent men women and children who died as a result of injuries sustained in the tragedy were failed by authorities including South Yorkshire Police.

The jury also found Liverpool FC supporters held no blame for the disaster.

Mr Devine's name is to be added to the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield and from next season Liverpool FC shirts will feature the number 97 rather than 96 in the tribute emblem on the nape of the neck.

Following Mr Devine's death his family paid tribute in a touching statement that said: ""Our collective devastation is overwhelming but so too is the realisation that we were blessed to have had Andrew with us for 32 years since the Hillsborough tragedy.

""We welcome the conclusion of the coroner Mr Andre Rebello made today at Liverpool Coroner’s Court that Andrew was unlawfully killed making him the 97th fatality of the tragic events that occurred on April 15 1989.

""In the intervening years Andrew has been a much loved son brother and uncle. He has been supported by his family and a team of dedicated carers all of whom devoted themselves to him.

""As ever our thoughts are with all of those affected by Hillsborough.""

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 9 2021

Jason Moser: Boston Omaha. Boston Omaha obviously a business we talked about on the show before one that a lot of listeners are interested in. Matt I love looking down on this earnings report because you see billboard rentals broadband services insurance commissions. It's a fun answer when someone asks you what this company does. How did the quarter look to you?

Matt Frankel: Well in a lot of ways. There's a lot of the same issues we have in evaluating Berkshire Hathaway's earnings. Remember we did that last week. Because they're secretive about a lot of it just like Berkshire is. They release their earnings on random times you never know when their earnings are going to come out. We don't know what's in their stock portfolio which is a lot of their business. They are small enough unlike Berkshire that they don't have to tell us at all what's in it. Berkshire has to report every quarter what their holdings are which we'll actually get later today. But having said that what we do know looks pretty good. You mentioned billboard revenue was up. Billboard's by far the biggest operating business they have it's roughly 56% of the total revenue they make. It's important to pay attention to that number because that's the big chunk of it.

Moser: Sure.

Frankel: Broadband service more than tripled year over year. But take that with a grain of salt because it includes an acquisition they closed in December. One of their two major broadband operations wasn't in their company last year at this time. But that's a business they're planning on building out excellent margins 85% gross margin in the broadband services. Excellent business they'll be building out and I'm curious to see where that goes in the quarters ahead . Bottom line earnings have doubled year over year. But take that also with a grain of salt because it includes unrealized investment gains like Berkshire's the fluctuations in the stock portfolio. But book value which is a measurement that they actually pride themselves on. The CEO's bonus structure is actually based on their ability to grow book value. Book value grew by 28%. Not year over year but from December 31st. In the past six months the book value per share is up 28%.

Moser: Wow.

Frankel: Pretty impressive growth. This was before they announced Yellowstone's (NASDAQ: YSAC.U) SPAC deal that we talked about. Remember that was announced in early August. That has absolutely nothing to do with these numbers. Great numbers all around they have a lot of cash to put to work. We saw that they have about $57 million in cash another $132 million in Treasuries that they can use to invest buy other companies things like that. Stock portfolio has gone up tremendously. A lot of that is the Dream Finders Homes (NASDAQ: DFH) IPO that took place earlier this year. Cash flow their operating cash flow is up from $1.3 million a year ago to $5.3 million now. About quadrupled in their cash flow. Pretty impressive quarter all around. I guess there's a lot that we don't know about their business. To be fair I think the fact that they don't have to disclose their stock holdings at all gives them a nice competitive advantage.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: But they're a mysterious conglomerate in the same sense as the Berkshire Hathaway is that they really tell us only what they have to. Noearnings calllike we talked about with Berkshire. Noearnings call no shareholder letter none of that. Just here's your 10-Q and have a nice day.

Jason Moser has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important ...,"New York New York--(Newsfile Corp. - August 21 2021) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm a global investor rights law firm reminds purchasers of the securities of Ardelyx Inc.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Ardelyx class action go to http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2134.html or call Phillip Kim Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff you must move the Court no later than September 28 2021. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020 founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and misleading statements regarding Ardelyx's lead product candidate tenapanor a supposedly first-in-class medicine for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (""CKD"") on dialysis and the likelihood that it would be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). Specifically the lawsuit alleges that defendants possessed were in control over and as a result knew (or had reason to know) that the data submitted to support the New Drug Application was insufficient in that it showed a lack of clinical relevance of the drug's treatment effect making it foreseeably likely (if not certain) that the FDA would not approve the drug. When the true details entered the market the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

NFLX,Netflix,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMS8wOC9uZXRmbGl4LXRvcC0xMC1tb3ZpZXMtc2hvd3MtY2xpY2tiYWl0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Top 10: The streaming service's clickbait problem threatens to ruin it.,"I’m on my couch scrolling scrolling scrolling. As I scan my Netflix page which rectangular tiles leap to the forefront of my attention? Well there’s What Lies Below with its promotional photo of an impossibly hunky man emerging dripping from the surface of a lake. There’s Sexify with its promotional photo of a woman’s face seemingly captured at the peak of passion. Or maybe I should watch Lucifer its star staring shirtlessly into my soul his chest so uncannily hairless it looks like a video game character’s.

The answer to What Lies Below might be a jacked aquatic geneticist with a Superman jaw line but other mysteries are left teasingly unsolved by Netflix’s most popular titles. For a while this spring Why Did You Kill Me? jostled for space on the Top 10 list with Who Killed Sara? Why did you kill me? Who did kill Sara? Is it the girl in the yellow bikini? Or is she Sara? There’s only one way to find out: click.

In these late-pandemic days there’s a woozy familiarity to the screen where we make most of our entertainment decisions. To anyone who’s ever written headlines for online media Netflix looks familiar. As competitors begin to nip at the streaming giant’s heels Netflix seems to be flirting with the tantalizing tools that web editors discovered a decade ago or more: the curiosity gap the sexy thumbnail the misleading image. A homepage is a homepage after all and these days Netflix has discovered clickbait.

Advertisement

Netflix has always been devoted to getting users to click on a show—and fast. The network’s own research shows that users consider each title for a whopping 1.8 seconds and that if users don’t find anything in a minute and a half they’re gone. In the battle against “analysis paralysis” the network is constantly experimenting with new ways to make items on the homepage as appealing as possible.

And Netflix recognizes that artwork—the thumbnails they present—is crucial to that decision-making. Since 2017 Netflix has customized its tiles based on a user’s viewing history a change from its original quest to find the One Thumbnail to Lure Them All. This means (to take Netflix’s example) that if you watch a lot of romance the company might serve you a thumbnail for Good Will Hunting that features Matt Damon and Minnie Driver smooching. If you love comedy your Good Will Hunting thumbnail might feature Robin Williams. (More questionably as outlets such as Wired have reported if you’re Black you’re going to end up seeing Black performers in your thumbnails even if they’re relatively minor characters in the movie or show. I see Liam Neeson in my Love Actually thumbnail; others might see Chiwetel Ejiofor.)

The service’s homepage and the shows the network acquires has long been ruthlessly optimized to appeal to very specific audiences. When new content springs up on your Netflix homepage it is often brazenly similar-but-not-quite-related to content you’ve enjoyed before. Following the success of the comically generically titled Money Heist Netflix recently debuted the new even more generically titled hit Heist—one thumbnail featuring just to leave no stone unturned a woman wearing only her underwear and a cascade of $20 bills.

Sometimes the service stretches so far that it seems to verge on out-and-out misdirection: Take Ragnarok a Netflix title illustrated by an image of Thor’s mighty hammer. Click for this new Marvel Comics Universe series and you’ll wind up watching a perfectly pleasant Norwegian show about Norse mythology. And the company’s dependence on personalized artwork means it often seems to be playing 4-dimensional chess with recommendations. For some reason—maybe the action movies I recently streamed?—my homepage illustrates The Big Lebowski with a photo of an angry John Goodman pointing a gun as if the Coen brothers’ comedy is actually some kind of revenge thriller.

I mean whatever. As long as there have been movies there have been marketers scheming to get people to watch them. But this spring and summer things have looked a little different over at Netflix. The company seems more brazen in its strategies more willing to promise something and then absolutely fail to deliver often using headline tricks familiar from the social web. That’s what clickbait is: luring someone into clicking and then delivering something other than what the headline made them want. You ask a question but you don’t answer it. You promise satisfaction but you leave the user unsatisfied.

You might lazily click on a thumbnail for Sex/Life—featuring its beautiful central character gasping sweatily—not because you expect quality exactly but because you hope for a certain kind of breezy trash: Skinemax for the 21st century with just a little bit of character development to help it go down easy. It might not even matter if it isn’t good. It just needs to satisfy the urge you felt when you clicked on it.

Clickbait works—at least when users first encounter it.

But many of Netflix’s recent clickbait hits aren’t following through on their promises implicit or explicit. Sex/Life is “more soapy than sleazy” as Slate’s Karen Han put it larding its episodes with vanilla sex scenes but making that hot main character’s moral dilemmas so dull that the scenes are impossible to enjoy. What Lies Below offers neither great sea-monster sex nor actual thrills. Cripes you can keep clicking through an entire season of Who Killed Sara? 400 minutes of melodrama only to … never find out who killed Sara! Tune in for Season 2 I guess.

Living through the past decade in online news has made me a little suspicious of this particular kind of all-hat-and-no-cattle marketing. Take those titles-in-the-form-of-questions for example. In their bluntness they beg an answer and call to mind the “curiosity gap” headlines that took over media in the mid 2010s as every website tried to replicate the success of Upworthy: Someone Killed Sara. You’ll Never Believe Who It Was. Similarly the blandly sexy thumbnail images are reminiscent of the most basic of chumboxes those occasionally disturbing programmatic ads that take over the bottom of websites (including at times Slate) that need to scrape a little more revenue from their online real estate.

It seems unlikely that Netflix’s trend toward clickbait in 2021 reflects some executive decision; it’s probably a confluence of a few surprise hit titles and a machine-learning algorithm that’s just figuring out this particular flavor of human gullibility. Because clickbait works—at least when users first encounter it. It worked when Upworthy and other sites started playing with it in the early 2010s and the presence of these titles all over the network’s “hundred percent objective” popularity lists suggests they are working now. And once an algorithm sees something working it’s going hell-for-leather to replicate those results as much as possible.

The question is: What will Netflix do about its algorithms discovering humans’ basest instincts? There’s evidence that even now their internal metrics are shifting to emphasize not whether you click on a show but whether you stick with it. As of 2019 Netflix’s definition of whether a show had been “watched” was simply that a viewer had seen two minutes of it. That’s an obviously bad metric; two minutes isn’t even enough time to figure out that Chris Hemsworth isn’t in Ragnarok! But I spoke to several people familiar with the metrics Netflix uses internally and shares with creators and they suggested that stickiness—whether viewers make it 80 percent of the way through a series for example—is increasingly becoming more important than whether viewers click in the first place. “Things at Netflix change constantly” one show creator told me and “we don’t get a lot of information” but it was made clear to this creator that their show was renewed not because of huge numbers of people clicking but because a high percentage of people watched the whole season.

And that’s good! This is the kind of policy that will hopefully nip Netflix’s clickbait bloom in the bud. Take it from me on behalf of online media: It feels great at first to get people to click on girls in bikinis asking provocative questions but you’ll never guess what happens next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvbmV0ZmxpeC1tYWRlLTktYmlnLWNoYW5nZXMtbW9zdC1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1oYXZlLW5vLWlkZWEtYWJvdXQtdGhlbS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Made 9 Big Changes and Most Subscribers Now Have No Idea,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/netflix-made-9-big-changes-most-subscribers-have-no-idea-about-them.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvbmV0ZmxpeC1tYWRlLTktYmlnLWNoYW5nZXMtbW9zdC1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1oYXZlLW5vLWlkZWEtYWJvdXQtdGhlbS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMS8wOC90aGUtY2hhaXItbmV0ZmxpeC1yZXZpZXcvNjE5ODU1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Chair' Is Netflix's Best Drama in Years,"Perhaps like me you inwardly sigh with the breath of a thousand winds whenever you hear the words cancel culture as mangled and distorted as the expression has become. If so know that the people behind Netflix’s The Chair are likely sighing too. And yet here they are presenting a unicorn: a near-perfect television show that clocks in at just three hours and a comedy-drama that skewers the subject of free speech in academia without taking a side demonizing a particular group or descending into tweed-clutching.

The Chair created by the actor Amanda Peet and the academic and screenwriter Annie Wyman feels like it could have been a play (Peet has written two). The show’s structure—from introduction to rise to complication to catastrophe—is pure Freytag and its setting (the fictional Pembroke College a frigid northeastern school that’s supposedly a “lower-tier Ivy”) is insular and wood-paneled. In the first episode Ji-Yoon Kim (played by Sandra Oh) has finally reached a lofty career peak as the chair of the Pembroke English department. Apprehensive and endearingly awkward in a duffel coat she walks into her new office unwraps a gift (a nameplate for her desk that reads FUCKER IN CHARGE OF YOU FUCKING FUCKS) and sinks into her new desk chair which promptly breaks beneath her. The pratfall is also an omen: More than the furniture is rotten at Pembroke.

The college in fact is in crisis and the English department is hemorrhaging enrollments largely because the majority of its professors are tenured over 70 and totally unwilling to try to connect with their impassioned Gen Z students and their progressive priorities. On her first day Ji-Yoon is instructed by the dean to ax the most egregious dinosaurs including the Chaucer scholar Joan (Holland Taylor) and the American-lit professor Elliot (Bob Balaban). Elliot’s classes pale in popularity compared with those of his dynamic colleague Yaz (Nana Mensah) and yet he’s presiding over her application for tenure. More troublesome still is Bill (Jay Duplass) a rock-star professor of modernism in a state of catastrophe after his wife’s death. During one packed lecture Bill satirically performs a Hitler salute while considering absurdism’s power against fascism sparking a viral meme and a furious debate about free speech on campus.

Netflix

To The Chair’s credit it satirizes without picking a team and resists the urge to make anyone ridiculous. (It’s also the rare gift that allows people with an English degree to feel fleetingly relevant although it should come with a trigger warning for anyone who was ever lumbered with The Dream of the Rood.) Elegantly and briskly Peet and Wyman skewer all the reasons campuses might be igniting in discontent: professors held to different standards depending on their race and gender. Students made very aware by their mounting debt and limited opportunities that things are harder for their generation than they were for any other. Elder statesmen who suddenly realize how little they matter now. “I used to bestride the world like Colossus” Elliot mournfully tells his wife in one scene as she brandishes a box of adult diapers at him. “Well now you’re going to bestride it in Tranquility Briefs” she replies.

Read: American cynicism has reached a breaking point

Within its tight frame the series packs in more than shows three times its length. It’s particularly rewarding in its portrayal of Ji-Yoon’s personal life: In her 40s after breaking up with her longtime partner she tried for years to adopt eventually matching with Ju-Hee (Everly Carganilla) whom she named after her dead mother. The sore points and conflicts between Ji-Yoon her Latina daughter and her elderly Korean father Habi (Ji-Yong Lee) are thoughtfully and sweetly rendered. Oh has always excelled at playing women who reject the idea that things should be any way other than how they want them to be and Ji-Yoon—harried focused on work snappy paranoid that her daughter doesn’t really love her—embodies a kind of motherhood that’s rarely seen on-screen but is deeply gratifying nonetheless.

What truly sells The Chair though is how fast and funny it is while throwing around a legion of informed ideas about a well-trodden subject. “Stop saying ‘gag order’!” an exasperated Ji-Yoon yells at a younger teacher’s assistant after being excoriated on the front pages of the student newspaper. Then she pauses catches herself and diplomatically adds “Actually no say it as much as you want.” Classes on Moby-Dick turn not to themes of monomania and open-mindedness but to whether Herman Melville was a wife beater. The most talented people are given the hardest time because their talent allows them to see how urgently change is necessary. “Why should they trust us?” Ji-Yoon says of the students protesting outside her office. “The world is burning and we’re sitting here worried about our endowment.” The rifts between the generations seem impassable and yet the thing the series suggests might unite them is the one thing they can agree on: that whatever art language and literature might mean to different people they’re always worth fighting for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tb3N0LXdhdGNoZWQtbmV0ZmxpeC1vcmlnaW5hbC10di1zZXJpZXMtMTYyMTIxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 13 Most Watched Netflix Original Series,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/most-watched-netflix-original-tv-series-1621212 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tb3N0LXdhdGNoZWQtbmV0ZmxpeC1vcmlnaW5hbC10di1zZXJpZXMtMTYyMTIxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3Njb3R0bWVuZGVsc29uLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvamFzb24tbW9tb2EtaXNhYmVsYS1tZXJjZWQtc3dlZXQtZ2lybC1tb3N0LXdhdGNoZWQtbW92aWUtcGxvdC10d2lzdC1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's Most-Watched Movie 'Sweet Girl' Has A Huge Twist That Won't Please Anyone,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/08/21/jason-momoa-isabela-merced-sweet-girl-most-watched-movie-plot-twist-explained/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3Njb3R0bWVuZGVsc29uLzIwMjEvMDgvMjEvamFzb24tbW9tb2EtaXNhYmVsYS1tZXJjZWQtc3dlZXQtZ2lybC1tb3N0LXdhdGNoZWQtbW92aWUtcGxvdC10d2lzdC1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Shirley is also the host of the Women’s Agenda podcast series The Leadership Lessons.

Ranya Alkadamani is a leader in the media sector with commercial and political experience advising on strategic communications. She has worked in the impact-investing space.

“There couldn’t be a more important time for all Australians to be well and accurately informed about the critical issues facing this country and the world” Hambly said.

“AAP is here to deliver reliable fact-based news in real time. It is an honour and a privilege to have the opportunity to be part of delivering this mission and to help steer AAP into its sustainable future.”

In these Covid times you have to take your pleasure wherever you can get it and Josh and Luke apparently believe a YouTube styling video suggesting that should involve cheese in the tub.

But the cheese is the least of their bathroom sins. Their cavernous grey space is panned by the judges and sees them get this week’s wooden spoon.

Absolute bulls***: Fury over Block ruling

Block 2020 winners Jimmy and Tam spend prize money on first home

The $25356 main bathroom has a Venetian plaster wall and ceiling a mammoth 2.75m glass shower screen dark grey tiles and a lot of wasted space that Darren Palmer points out could easily have been used for cabinetry in the adjacent room.

Neale Whitaker calls it “just so incredibly dated” adding “you say masculine I say cold”.

Darren notes that the ultra expensive Venetian plaster ceiling would have eaten up a lot of their budget for no real return.

“It’s a really weird choice. It would have been a lot of money and I don’t think a ceiling is going to be something that appeals to a buyer” he says.

He also notes the under-vanity lighting serves only to spotlight a drain.

Shaynna ridicules the boys for their origami-ed hand towels and that block of cheese sitting on a bath caddie with some Ferrero Rochers.

“Take it on the chin your styling is atrocious” she says.

As all the brutal comments are read out Scott Cam goads the pair into retaliating knowing full well that for the first time the judges are actually at the judging announcement hidden inside a wooden hut.

“They’re wrong” Josh says citing the irrefutable evidence that their tradies like it. Well case closed.

Frugal hillbillies Kirsty and Jesse spent $19022 on their much smaller guest ensuite with its small vertically laid subway tiles in various shades of blue and pale blue circular basin.

The judges give it the thumbs up except for an unnecessary nib wall separating the toilet and shower and shell-shaped towel holders they describe as “kitsch” which a confused Jesse hears as “quiche” leaving him determined to avoid putting baked goods in any future bathrooms.

It’s a solid effort nonetheless considering earlier in the episode he had been as transfixed by the existence of a concealed cistern as Darryl Kerrigan was about rissoles.

“I’ve never been in a bathroom this flash let alone one we created” he says.

After a horror week Tanya and Vito somehow managed to finish their bathroom spending $33237 in the process.

They have four skylights floor to ceiling hand-pressed white and terracotta tiles a salmon coloured basin terrazzo flooring and a shower cavity big enough for a footy team.

The judges immediately noticed the lack of a toilet and plenty of places it could have gone apparently not being aware of Tanya’s personal adage that “you don’t shower where you sh*t”.

They’re unconvinced putting it next door at the end of a 5m corridor is the right choice but are prepared to wait and see.

They don’t like the black door trim black wall sconces or the choice of hooks over towel rails pointing out that towels don’t dry on hooks. They think the plant is too spindly and the pot should have been terracotta. And none of them are fans of the bathmat which Tanya reveals cost a whopping $200 proving once again money doesn’t equal good taste.

So the competition for top spot is really between Mark and Mitch and Ronnie and Georgia.

Ronnie and Georgia were confident of a win for their $24500 main bathroom featuring vertically laid white finger tiles a marble-look large format feature tile behind the bath a floating oak vanity skylight over the bath and brushed brass fittings.

And the judges love it but think the taps are too far away from the shower and note one wall is slightly out of whack possibly thanks to the handy list of defects Keith and Dan are handing over before each judging this season for the first time.

Mark and Mitch spent $20833 on their main bathroom with most of it going on a magnificent feature wall of rose pink Norwegian fan tiles the fan shape repeated on their wooden vanity. The toilet is cleverly tucked behind a door which allows room for a double vanity a choice the judges think Ronnie and Georgia should have made.

After last week’s criticism that their guest bedroom was safe and bland the judges are impressed.

“That’s what they were lacking in their bedroom last week. We had lots of measured choices but no punch. This is punchy as hell” Darren says.

It’s enough to earn the pair the win so when Scott Cam opens the hidden hut to reveal the crouching judges Mark and Mitch are happy to see them.

Not so Luke and Josh who turn bright red after the shellacking they had just endured.

“We don’t tell you stuff to be mean” Darren tells them.

“We want you to do well” Neale adds.

But Luke and Josh look unconvinced and angry and after that cheese-shaming who wouldn’t.

She finished seventh overall during a race defined by a power outage and a large wreck making history in the process. Deegan became the first woman in NASCAR to lock up a top-10 finish in the Truck Series outside of Daytona International Speedway.

Deegan started the race 19th overall based on NASCAR’s formula that takes into account factors from the previous race on the schedule as well as the team owner’s overall points. She proceeded to race in the top 20 throughout the evening before making a final push for her first career top-10 finish.

The Truck Series rookie appeared to be poised to finish 10th overall during the overtime race to the checkered flag at Gateway Motorsports Park. However she moved up three spots after the No. 17 of Taylor Gray collided with the No. 40 of Ryan Truex knocking them back in the pack.

Deegan Joined 3 Other Women to Finish Top 10 in Truck Series History

While Deegan is the only female driver to finish among the top 10 outside of Daytona International Speedway she is actually the fourth to finish near the front of the pack during her Truck Series career. According to “Jayski” Deegan also joins Jennifer Jo Cobb Natalie Decker and Angela Ruch.

Cobb was the first to set the mark doing so during the season-opening race at Daytona in 2011. The driver-owner started 31st overall in the No. 10 Ford and avoided wrecks that sent 10 of her peers to the garage early. She turned in the best performance of her career and finished sixth overall behind Kyle Busch while Michael Waltrip headed to Victory Lane.

Ruch only started 18 races during her Truck Series career but she joined Cobb in the history books during a wild race at Daytona. She kicked off the 2019 season with an eighth-place run in which she avoided the numerous wrecks that brought out a record 11 cautions. Ruch started 30th out of the 32-truck field and was only one of nine drivers that finished the race.

Decker was the latest female driver to claim a top-10 finish at Daytona doing so to start the 2020 season. She suited up for Niece Motorsports during the NextEra Energy 250 and began the race 30th overall in the No. 44 Chevrolet. Like Cobb and Ruch before her Decker avoided many incidents at the superspeedway and raced her way to a fifth-place finish — the highest-ever finish for a female driver in Truck Series history. Her outing still stands as the high-water mark but Deegan could soon fight to surpass it.

Deegan Still Has Plenty of Room To Grow as a Competitor

The rookie entered her first full-time Truck Series season with one start on her resume — Kansas Speedway on Oct. 17 2020. Deegan then proceeded to suit up for every race the majority of which did not include practice sessions or qualifying laps.

Deegan has managed to finish every single race during the 2021 season but she has also dealt with issues that kept her out of the top 10. She ended some races such as those at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway multiple laps behind the field but continued to fight until she finally cracked the top 10.

“We had a lot of meetings just going into this race going into the whole playoffs and everything” Deegan told Fox Sports after the race. “Obviously we’re not in it but just being around everything. We’re like ‘hey we’ve got to finish off the season strong.’

“We’ve had a rough year we’ve had our ups and downs. We’ve had our good moments we’ve had our not-so-good moments. And to be able to come out here and get a good solid finish and to have something to build off these next couple races to end the season it’s going to be huge for me.”

With the race at Gateway Motorsports Park complete Deegan has limited opportunities to finish out the season strong. She will suit up once again on Sunday Sept. 5 at Darlington Raceway. She will finish out the year with races at Bristol Motor Speedway (Sept. 16) Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Sept. 24) Talladega Superspeedway (Oct. 2) Martinsville Speedway (Oct. 30) and Phoenix Raceway (Nov. 5).

Embattled Nike caused widespread criticism on the Chinese internet as a sales worker in Kunming Southwest China's Yunnan Province allegedly discriminated against a migrant worker's family dealing a further blow to the brand's sales performance in one of its most important markets following the Xinjiang cotton incident.A 44-year-old migrant worker named Mao Zhigao and his wife took their three children to a Nike store in Kunming on August 13 afternoon. When they accompanied their daughter to pick clothes at the women zone their junior son aged 9 ran to them with tears in his eyes. The son said that he had picked two clothes but the saleswoman grabbed the clothes from him and put them back on the shelves ctdsb.net a news portal affiliated with Hubei Daily Media Group reported on Friday.Mao believed that the Nike saleswoman had discriminated against his family because of the torn clothes he wore on that day.""To safeguard the dignity of their son Mao's wife got into physical confrontation with the saleswoman"" the report said adding that there were several scratches on his wife's neck.With the help of the policemen they obtained a video clip of what happened to their child. When the family confirmed that the saleswoman grabbed clothes from their son Mao immediately called Nike's hotline to complain about their encounter at the store and hoped the worker could apologize the report said.But they received no immediate response. Only six days later they received a phone call from a Nike staffer responsible for the region. The staffer apologized to the family in the call and invited them to visit the store again but they refused.According to a report by xxcb.cn Nike said in a statement that the company made a sincere apology to the family and has fired the sales worker. In a video posted on Chinese Twitter-like microblog Sina Weibo on Friday Mao said he wants no compensation from Nike and will never shop at Nike stores in the future. ""The incident has cast a deep psychological shadow"" he said.The hashtag ""A Nike employee that discriminated against migrant workers has been fired"" trended on Sina Weibo. Netizens expressed criticism toward the Nike sales person and many called for a continuous boycott of the brand for its involvement in the Xinjiang cotton incident.Nike is among a number of Western retailers including Adidas and H&M that have been facing a backlash in the Chinese market over their previous support to the Western-led boycott on cotton sourced from Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over groundless claims of forced labor.The brand's fourth-quarter earnings in greater China of the fiscal year stood at $1.93 billion missing analysts' expectations of $2.25 billion.Global Times"

She works almost every day. She sees patients physically and virtually and checks in via email. Even with the long hours she loves what she does.

“Ever since I was little I've always loved animals. The typical 'oh it's always fed my soul'” said Wierczorek. “It's also the client's reaction of 'oh my goodness thank you thank you thank you.'”

What You Need To Know Veterinary medicine is consistently ranked as one of the worst careers for your mental health



Veterinarians can also carry a large student loan debt and may sometimes be forced to euthanize a patient with a treatable injury or illness because its caretaker can't afford the remedy



Veterinarians can suffer burnout or compassion fatigue

Unfortunately every client isn't always as grateful. That is one reason why veterinary medicine is consistently ranked as one of the worst careers for your mental health.

Veterinarians can also carry a large student loan debt and may sometimes be forced to euthanize a patient with a treatable injury or illness because its caretaker can't afford the remedy.

On top of that there is the technology aspect where people just flat out think they know more than the doctor.

“Over the course of time technology has played against us” said Wierczorek. “Like Facebook posts and other social media aspects. That has been the hardest part to combat because I can't combat the internet trolls.”

This can lead to burnout or compassion fatigue which Wieczorek said are two different things.

“Burnout I call it a work hangover” said Wierczorek. “It's like when you've worked four days in a row hard shifts hard cases. I'm just physically exhausted. I still care. I'm just like 'OK I'm here I just need some more coffee but I'm here. I can usually work my way out of that. Compassion fatigue is where you've given so much of yourself you can't replenish that. You don't know how to replenish that.”

The situations they see and experience daily take a toll.

“You know I could have two three euthanasias today. That's hard” said Wierczorek. “Then you have a new puppy and then an ear infection. Just the bouncing back and forth.”

Along with the mentally tough workload the volume of patients especially over the last year or so she said sometimes it's a bit overwhelming.

“I am seeing physically two patients every 30 minutes” said Wierczorek. “However I could see up to six depending on how I'm scheduled.”

She said by far the lack of trust in the profession is definitely the hardest fight.

“We're not here to take your money” said Wierczorek. “We're not here to jerk you around. Please just trust us. We go to school for this. We do this because we love it and do it for you guys especially.”

Her best advice is to remember you don't know what other people are going through and she asks to please just keep things kind.

“Just be nice” said Wierczorek.​",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvamVhbm5lLXJvYmVydHNvbi1ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1odW1vcmlzdC1kaWVzLWF0LTc3L2FydGljbGVfOWQwNzRkOTgtMDNhNy0xMWVjLTkwNDMtMjM4M2Q1NGJjMmNiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeanne Robertson North Carolina humorist dies at 77,"ELON — Jeanne Robertson who parlayed her appearance in the Miss America pageant into a career as a speaker and humorist died unexpectedly Saturday.

But what if it can't?,"PGA Tour hopes to finish Northern Trust at Liberty National on Monday. But what if it can’t?

JERSEY CITY N.J. – The PGA Tour isn’t far from the bright lights of Broadway this week and so as the saying goes the show must go on.

The final round of the Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club was postponed until Monday due to Henri which flipped back and forth from Tropical Storm to category 1 Hurricane status before making landfall on Sunday near Rhode Island and bringing heavy rain and 40-mile-an-hour winds as it weakened.

Central Park in Manhattan was doused with record rainfall and many New Jersey residents are without power but the Tour officials hope to complete play on Monday despite a forecast that calls for another “drenching rain.”

Tee times were released late Sunday afternoon with players being sent off both nines in threesomes. The first tee time of the day is set for 7:30 a.m. ET though veteran Tour pro Lee Westwood isn’t so sure that will be doable.

PGA Tour rules official John Mutch expressed a more sunny outlook despite the flash flood warnings in the area.

“Really good for 5 inches of rain” Mutch told ESPN of Liberty National which was built on a landfill and has a SubAir system beneath the greens. “They were working on the bunkers when I was there. There’s not a whole lot of standing water. I was pleased. I’ve seen a lot worse.”

When the third round ended Smith had caught Rahm at 16-under 197 with a course-record 60. South Africa’s van Rooyen shot 62 to trail by one stroke in third. He’s one of five players projected to move into the top 70 of the FedEx Cup point standings and advance to the BMW Championship which begins Thursday in Baltimore. Should he fail to be on the right side of the cutline he’s slated to head to Switzerland for the Omega European Masters.

The forecast is dicey with continued rain through Sunday night and into Monday. If less than half the field tees off for the final round the tournament could be shortened to 54 holes and a sudden-death playoff between Rahm and Smith who both missed birdie putts at 18 would determine a victor. That scenario has happened in the past such as when Tiger Woods won the 1997 Tournament of Champions and Phil Mickelson edged Gary Nicklaus at the 2005 BellSouth Classic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy93aGF0LWhhcHBlbnMtaWYtbm9ydGhlcm4tdHJ1c3QtY2FudC1maW5pc2gtbW9uZGF5L9IBSGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy93aGF0LWhhcHBlbnMtaWYtbm9ydGhlcm4tdHJ1c3QtY2FudC1maW5pc2gtbW9uZGF5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happens if The Northern Trust can't finish on Monday due to weather?,"What happens if The Northern Trust can’t finish on Monday due to weather?

UPDATE 2: This story has been updated after PGA Tour officials delayed starting the final round by several hours on Monday morning.

UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect an email sent to PGA Tour players about the finish of The Northern Trust.

PGA Tour pros got a rare day off on Sunday and they all had different ways they planned to spend it: family time chipping in the hallway Netflix etc. The day off of course was due to the threat of Hurricane Henri bringing heavy rain wind and damage to Liberty National in Jersey City N.J. So Sunday was called off with the plan to finish on Monday. But what if Monday isn’t in the cards either?

The PGA Tour will try to complete the entire final round on Monday with threesomes off both tees beginning at 11:30 a.m. ET after officials delayed the start by four hours. The Tour also plans to finish the tournament and crown a winner even if it lingers into Tuesday or longer.

Golf Channel’s Todd Lewis tweeted a photo of an email sent to players explaining the need for a 72-hole finish and clarifying that the three FedEx Cup Playoff events will be allowed to resume beyond Mondays regardless of how many holes are completed — a modification from the Tour’s Bad Weather Guidelines.

Based on the Tour’s handbook previously allowing a Tuesday finish or later would be extremely rare. Under the Tour’s Bad Weather Guidelines it states: Except for The Players Championship in the event of a suspension during a final round being played on Monday when at least half of the field has completed play the final round will be completed on Tuesday but no later. Further in no situation would we resume play in order to have 50% or more of the field complete their round. If play cannot be completed on Tuesday scores will revert back to the last completed round and the competition will be considered closed. … Except for The Players Championship play will not extend past Tuesday under any circumstances unless the event can be rescheduled and replayed in its entirety. This scenario would occur only if no more than 18 holes had been completed and an acceptable open date were available.

The Tour however has decided to make modifications for one of its marquee events.

On Sunday night the Tour also announced that the final round would be held without spectators. Liberty National received more than six inches of rain from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon and 1-2 more inches are expected overnight Sunday to Monday according to the Tour’s release.

“With more rain forecasted throughout the day on Monday including a possible afternoon thunderstorm officials determined that contesting the final round without spectators onsite would be the safest path moving forward” the release read.

The Tour made additional modifications to the schedule on Monday morning pushing back tee times by four hours in an attempt to give the course a little more time to dry out before sending players back out. The final grouping of Jon Rahm Cameron Smith and Erik van Rooyen is scheduled to tee off at 1:42 p.m. off the 1st tee.

The final round of @TheNTGolf has been delayed an additional hour and is now scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m. ET.

The Tour announced on Saturday afternoon that the final round of The Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City N.J. will be postponed from Sunday to Monday because of the approach of Henri forecast to slam into Long Island N.Y. Connecticut and other parts of New England early Sunday.

The National Weather Service has issued tropical storm warnings for Jersey City with the potential for 3-6 inches in rain and winds up to 73 mpg.

""Based on the projected path of [Hurricane] Henri and the Tropical Storm Warning that has been issued by the National Hurricane Center for the area where The Northern Trust is located there will be no play on Sunday"" the Tour said in a statement issues at 1:30 p.m. 20 minutes before the final twosome of Jon Rahm and Tony Finau teed off.

""Round 4 will be played on Monday"" the statement continued. ""Tee times and groupings for Round 4 will be published on Sunday afternoon with play on Monday slated to begin no earlier than 7:30 a.m.""

The top-125 players on the FedEx Cup points list gathered at Liberty National in the first of three playoff events. The top-70 on the points list will advance to the BMW Championship beginning on Thursday at Olympia Fields near Chicago.

The top-30 after that will advance to the Tour Championship Sept. 2-5 at East Lake in Atlanta."

Applying its engineering and manufacturing expertise Northrop Grumman improved upon the VLWT baseline design to replace high-cost components and drive overall affordability reproducibility and reliability.

VLWT can be used both as an anti-submarine weapon or an anti-torpedo systems. Its small size (121 mm in diameter) means it could be deployed from submarine’s 6 inch decoy launching systems. David Portner told Naval News that the VLWT uses a thermal battery system. Most of its performance figures are classified. 80 VLWT have been produced so far including 32 torpedoes with warheads.

Northrop Grumman was showcasing an actual VLWT torpedo prototype during Sea Air Space 2021.

“Penn State developed it you could essentially classify it as a prototype weapon right now with early operational use. It is now at the point where the Navy wants to transition it to industry and essentially modify the design so that it can be designed for manufacture in a high rate production environment. That is going to be a competition […] We expect the request for proposal to come out this fall in the next couple of months. The Navy would very quickly make a decision after that. We expect they will select the winner either later this year or early next year with a contract award in early 2022. That will allow us to much more quickly get into the evaluation and design changes necessary to be able to produce these in a normal manufacturing environment.”

According to Northrop Grumman if placed in the same water as the target the VLWT will search detect and engage with more maneuverability and anti-torpedo capability than its larger counterparts. Its small size effectively adds magazine depth to a submarine allowing it to defend itself efficiently from a single threat to an entire swarm. Additionally its size allows it to be deployed from airplanes or even from a helicopter – making it possible to deploy the VLWT directly above an enemy submarine. This is a tremendous advantage for the warfighter making it almost impossible for the submarine to evade a hit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvaG93LXNlY3JldGl2ZS1ibGFjay1wcm9ncmFtLWNyZWF0ZWQtYmVzdC1ib21iZXItaGlzdG9yeS0xOTIxNzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a Secretive Black Program Created the Best Bomber in History,"Here's What You Need To Remember: Conventional or nuclear the B-2 Spirit can handle almost any precision attack mission in any environment imaginable located at practically any point on Earth. The new B-21 Raider bomber set to enter service in the mid-2020s appears very similar to the B-2. Meanwhile the current B-2 fleet will likely fly for another twenty years or more.

The B-2 Spirit is one of three strategic heavy bombers in U.S. Air Force service. Originally conceived to infiltrate the Soviet air-defense network and attack targets with nuclear weapons over the decades its mission has grown to include conventional precision attack. The B-2 is the most advanced bomber in U.S. service and the only one of three types that still carry nuclear gravity bombs.

In the late 1970s the administration of President Jimmy Carter opposed the high-speed B-1A bomber as a waste of government money. Carter had been briefed on the new field of stealth technology and was responsible for the development of the F-117A stealth fighter. Instead of the B-1A Carter authorized the development of the Advanced Technology Bomber or Stealth Bomber. Little was known about the bomber at the time except that it would incorporate new radar-evading technologies and possibly a dramatically different shape than previous bombers.

The U.S. Air Force sent out a request for proposal in 1980 and in October 1981 Northrop won a $7.3 billion initial contract to produce 127 Advanced Technology Bombers. Northrop was a curious pick—after all it had not produced any bombers since World War II.

Northrop Grumman had been working on stealth since at least the mid-1960s. At a research facility in Rancho Palos Verdes California Northrop had been working on radar-evading aircraft shapes and radar-resistant materials. The company lost the competition to build the Experimental Survivable Test Bed (XST) which would later become the stealth fighter to Lockheed Martin but did win the opportunity to build another stealth testbed Tacit Blue. Tacit Blue featured 360-degree stealth a must-have for a penetrating strategic bomber.

Engineers had long known that flying wings had a minimal radar signature and flying wings were a Northrop specialty. The company had produced four flying wings: the Northrop Grumman N-9M the XB-35 and YB-49 and the YB-49A. None had been picked up by the Air Force but it gave Northrop Grumman a great deal of experience with the aircraft form. A flying wing properly shaped to further confound radar and use of advanced composite materials would create the ultimate penetration bomber undetectable by radar.

The B-2 was developed as a black program with all of the pluses and minuses that entails. On the plus side it was developed with a high level of secrecy and until rollout in 1988 few people were sure exactly what the B-2 looked like. On the other hand costs—and development problems that caused them to rise—were kept secret until 1988. The cost of the overall B-2 program rose from 35.7 to 42.8 billion dollars. Approximately one billion was spent strengthening the wing an Air Force requirement should the bomber ever be required to fly at low altitude. There were also allegations of fraud and overcharging at least one of which was settled out of court. The poisoned relationship between the Air Force and Northrop is regarded by some as one reason why the Advanced Technology Fighter competition which produced the F-22A Raptor fighter went to competitor Lockheed Martin and not Northro Grumman.

On November 22 1988 the first B-2 was rolled out at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale California and given the name “Spirit.” The bomber looked like a boomerang with a serrated rear section. Like previous Northrop designs it lacked a tail seamlessly blended wing and body and buried its four General Electric F118-GE-100 non-afterburning turbofans deep within the aircraft fuselage. Spectators were kept 200 feet from the aircraft to prevent close inspection of the plane’s features.

At the time of rollout the B-2’s unit cost was estimated at $515 million each making it the most expensive plane ever made. The value of stealth had not been proven in battle and Congress began to fret about the cost of the projected 132 aircraft. On top of cost and effectiveness issues Mikhail Gorbachev’s Perestroika reforms had considerably lowered tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union reducing the likelihood of nuclear conflict. The number of aircraft was eventually trimmed to just twenty-one.

The B-2 is sixty-nine feet long and seventeen feet high. It has a wingspan of 172 feet—exactly the same as that of the XB-35 and YB-49. It has a speed of 680 miles an hour and had a maximum altitude of 5000 feet. It has an unrefueled range of 6000 miles and has midair refueling capability.

The new bomber was one of the first military aircraft to make widespread use of new composite materials. Nearly 80 percent of the aircraft is made from woven composites that incorporated glass carbon and graphite fibers while the remainder is made of aluminum and titanium. The Spirit also has a radar absorbent coating whose sole purpose is to further reduce the radar signature. Former Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch has stated that the B-2 has a radar cross section in the “insect category.”

The B-2 has two weapons bays built into the belly section that together can hold up to 60000 pounds of ordnance. Each bay carries eight bomb racks and in the nuclear role the bomber can carry an assortment of up to sixteen B61-7 bombs (10–360 kilotons) B61-11 bombs (400 kilotons) or B-83-1 thermonuclear bombs (1.2 megatons). The Spirit will also carry the new B-61-12 bomb with a “dial-a-yield” configuration giving it a yield of .3 1.5 10 or 50 kilotons. The B-2 does not carry any nuclear-armed missiles at this time but will carry the Long Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile when it enters service.

The need to penetrate advanced air-defense networks in the post–Cold War era led to B-2s acquiring a conventional strike capability. The bomber can carry up to sixteen Joint Directed Attack Munition (JDAM) satellite-guided 2000-pound bombs. In the past it has also carried CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions and CBU-90 Gator mine dispensers but submunition-dispensing munitions are being phased out in U.S. inventories. The bomber also carries the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon a glide bomb with a range of up to fifty miles and a GPS-based guidance system. For standoff attacks the Spirit can carry the AGM-158 Joint Air Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the new longer-range JASSM-ER (extended range). Finally the B-2 can carry two 30000-pound twenty-foot-long Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs for attacking hardened targets one per weapons bay.

The B-2 has seen extensive use in the conventional role. The Spirit first dropped bombs in anger in the 1999 Kosovo War followed by the Iraq War in 2003. B-2s were among the first to drop bombs on the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan after 9/11 and bombed Libyan forces in 2011. The bombers are restricted to flying from a handful of locations due to their need for special climate-controlled accommodations to protect their radar-absorbent coatings. Flight time from the home of the Spirit fleet Whiteman Air Force Base Missouri to Iraq is thirty-eight hours and includes 4–5 aerial refuelings. Small numbers of B-2s can also operate from Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam in the Pacific and RAF Fairford in the UK.

B-2 bombers would almost certainly take part in any attack on North Korea’s nuclear program which would almost certainly be a part of or escalate to a larger war between Pyongyang its neighbors and the United States. While the B-1B bomber can launch cruise missile strikes against exposed targets the B-2 would be sent after the North Korean leadership itself. The Spirit would drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on hardened and underground North Korean command and control system ideally disrupting its ability to issue orders to launch missiles. Spirits would also drop MOPs on any hardened leadership facilities suspected of hiding North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and any concrete-protected nuclear storage and missile launch facilities.

Conventional or nuclear the B-2 Spirit can handle almost any precision attack mission in any environment imaginable located at practically any point on Earth. The new B-21 Raider bomber set to enter service in the mid-2020s appears very similar to the B-2. Meanwhile the current B-2 fleet will likely fly for another twenty years or more. All of this adds up to the Air Force flying bat-winged stealthy bombers for another forty or even fifty years a testament to the original flying wing stealth design that dates all the way back to World War II.

The Georgia Cyber Center.

“We talk about academics government and industry being the three legs of this the three important ingredients” said Michael Shaffer the center’s executive vice president of strategic partnerships and economic development.

With cybersecurity company SealingTech moving an office into the center’s Shaffer McCartney Building in July about 90% of the two-building center is occupied. Only one 33000-square-foot floor of the center is vacant as talks among Augusta University officials continue in earnest about erecting a third building.

""If you’d have told me five years ago that downtown Augusta would have some of the international companies that are downtown now I would've said no” Shaffer said. “My dream would’ve been ‘Yes eventually. How do we get there?’ ”

Now many are already there. Technology companies vying for government defense contracts are attracted by Augusta’s proximity to Fort Gordon home of the U.S. Army Cyber Command. Defense and aerospace giant Northrop Grumman intelligence and security contractor BAE Systems and cybertech firms Parsons Corp. and Peraton Corp. are among the center’s industrial tenants.

Other companies have expressed interest in the remaining space Shaffer said including tech consultant Accenture and CDW which provides cybersecurity hardware and software.

BAE already had office space in the center but announced a 17000-square-foot expansion last November. That build-out Shaffer said underscores an increase in corporate commitments for the Augusta area.

“From my years when I was in congressional and government work I used to complain that a lot of these companies were here but they service their contracts with a single person in their home with a computer” he said. “It’s not like some of these are now to Augusta in the sense that they haven’t done work here before. But what they’re now doing is putting a true footprint in Augusta.”

Moving to Augusta for cyber jobs becoming more frequent

Augusta also appears to be retaining more of the types of professionals that cyber companies look for when considering a move to the area Shaffer said. He said when SealingTech tried to recruit Georgia workers to its offices in Maryland nearly all the workers said they’d prefer to stay.

“Instead of operating where they were they just said ‘We’ll move there’ ” Shaffer said.

In turn more available cyber jobs mean that more ex-military choose to stay in the Augusta area after ending their Armed Forces careers at Fort Gordon he said.

They’re also trending younger Shaffer said. Five years ago “old colonels” were more likely to stay in Augusta for retirement.

“I don’t mean that in a bad way. I’m saying it just to point out that what we’re seeing now is a younger generation separating. They don’t necessarily stay here 25 years but they’re coming out and they start a new career in their 30s. They still have a lifetime in front of them for a career. The jobs weren’t necessarily here for them a few years ago. Now they’re here and we’re seeing it because we’re able to retain them and keep them here as we hire them.”

Rather than being mere office space the Cyber Center is “just crawling and about to grow” into its next phase of activity Shaffer said – cultivating ideas.

“We really want individuals and their companies that are there to be doing something innovative” he said. “So no longer is it really kind of ‘Come in the facility’ and you’re just doing cyber. What are you doing? What are you creating? What are your ideas? That’s just now starting to happen.”

The Cyber Fusion Innovation Center for example is a partner with Army Cyber Command. CFIC is one of several “innovation hubs” operated nationwide by Defensewerx a company that helps connect and simplify swift tech partnerships between the private sector and the military.

“In the cyber world unlike building a ship or a new gun or helmet or vest that can take years the solutions to their challenges have to come quick” Shaffer said. “They solve those challenges by using anybody that has the right solution. It can be an industry that exists. It can be an individual with a great idea. It can be an existing company. It can be a university. That universe is open across the country.”

No timetable for third building yet

There is no firm timetable for when ground might be broken on a third Cyber Center building Shaffer said but it definitely will be a building devoted to academics. It will be anchored by AU’s new School of Computer and Cyber Sciences which he says has “exploded.” Teams of recently hired researchers are running out of workspace and the downtown AU Riverfront Campus is expected to be their next destination.

“The beauty of it is if you think of all the industries that are there that is what they are looking for. They need research. They need researchers. They need those graduate students who can capstone projects.” Shaffer said. “Now you start seeing where we get to the next level of what truly the Georgia Cyber Center and that campus is about.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY29sbGVjdHNwYWNlLmNvbS91YmIvRm9ydW0xNC9IVE1MLzAwMTgwNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cheese on the International Space Station,"posted 08-21-2021 10:45 AM

The cheeses were sourced from Houston Dairymaids a shop local to the Johnson Space Center including an Old Farmdal by Columbia Cheese.

The NG-16 Cygnus delivered the latest cheese selection to the space station as noted by Expedition 65 flight engineer Thomas Pesquet on Twitter:

Like always there is emotional mud-slinging among the US allies while US President Joe Biden is being targeted for the ‘debacle’. The “forever war” – yes it’s the longest war US has ever fought – is finally over after 20 years. And the very regime that was thrown out of power when the US/NATO invaded Afghanistan in 2001 is now back.

As usual expert commentators are at pains to explain what went wrong with the glorious effort to build democracy and bring prosperity to this hapless country that has been in the throes of war for over four decades. The US and its allies spent a trillion dollars to win the ‘hearts and minds’ of the people even as they deployed the most sophisticated armed force in the world against the Taliban. Yet it came to nought in the end. Why? How?

The answers being peddled ad nauseam are more myths than reality. Like the Bourbons the imperial Americans neither forget nor learn. Here are some myths – and the hard realities they are meant to cover up.

Myth: ‘US spent a trillion dollars building a new Afghanistan …’

There are two myths in this popular epitaph for the Afghanistan Occupation. One is that the US and its allies spent about $1 trillion and the other is that it was spent for Afghani people.

Officially the US Department of Defence has put the cost at $837 billion between 2002 and 2021. In addition various aid and reconstruction agencies spent $133 billion on ‘Afghanistan reconstruction’ which includes setting up schools and building markets and roads etc.

However independent estimates put the real cost of war at $2.26 trillion more than double the official figures. According to a Brown University study costs must include the money spent on operations against Taliban in bordering districts of Pakistan on medical care of US injured soldiers and on the interest payments made by the US Treasury for commercial borrowing to fund the war.

Going by the official estimate only 16% of funds were spent on Afghan people under the so-called ‘Afghanistan Reconstruction’ sub-head. But if you take the unofficial estimate this comes to as little as 6% of the total cost of war. Even within that payments to various US civilian advisers contractors middlemen et al would bite off a fair chunk of the funds.

So the myth that US and its allies were spending an astronomical sum every year to educate Afghans help them become prosperous etc. is hot air.

Myth: ‘Corrupt Afghans are responsible for this debacle….’

This is the pre-eminent theme. It is strenuously argued that the US was working with good intentions sacrificing so many lives spending its money and trying to teach Afghans how to run a modern democracy but people like former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the bureaucracy embezzled the money refused to toe the line.

First as detailed above only a fraction of the money was spent on Afghanistan’s people. Most of the money was spent on US arms manufacturers such as Raytheon Lockheed Martin Boeing Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics who are the US Government’s biggest arms contractors (that is they are given contracts to make armaments of all kinds to be used in US wars).

According to one study the share prices of these five top US arms manufacturers increased 58% more in the past 20 years than the overall share market as reflected in the S&P 500. In fiscal 2020 the US government continues to hand out big ticket contracts to the top five according to one review of contract documents: Lockheed Martin ($74.2 billion) Raytheon Technologies ($27.4 billion) General Dynamics ($22.6 billion) Boeing ($21.5 billion) Northrop Grumman Corp. ($12.7 billion).

The war in Afghanistan was like always a boon to flagging economies of the West particularly the US. It was money being pumped into creating employment in US and Europe and yielding super profits to giant corporations and less for building democracy and bringing economic uplift in Afghanistan.

Second history is full of episodes of the ‘civilising missions’ launched by richer countries often with at the point of gun which ultimately destroy countries and leave them wracked by sectarian violence the economy in shambles and dominated by bloodshed. In the past few decades you can see the results of US interventions in Iraq Syria Libya Yemen all of them ‘bombed into Stone Age’ as a US President once famously put it. Afghanistan is yet another shining example of this civilising mission. A 2019 estimate by Brown University put the cost of war in Pakistan Afghanistan Iraq and Syria at a staggering $6.4 trillion.

Earlier in the 20th century the same mission was carried out against communists – Vietnam Laos and Cambodia -- and through proxies in Latin America repeatedly. Nowhere did it succeed and everywhere the people got rid of the US and its dictator proxies one way or another.

It is no surprise that at the end of it the predominant feeling among common Afghans is that the’ Occupiers’ have gone and the war has finally ended. True those sections that benefitted from the occupation including the puppet kleptocracy that ruled Afghanistan first under Hamid Karzai and then under Ashraf Ghani would be terrified. But that’s about all.

Myth: ‘Taliban are a liberating force….’

Among some sections yet another ignominious defeat of US empire building at the hands of the Taliban is being welcomed but without an evaluation of what the Taliban are. While there is no doubt that the defeat of the US-led Occupation is a step forward the Afghan people have to now deal with the Islamic fanatics. Like all religious fanatics who dream of building a theocratic state they have a medieval outlook and an extremely retrograde social policy.

It is possible that Taliban 2.0 may not be as brutal as earlier. But even if they have mellowed down they represent an interpretation of Islam that is inimical to the economic and social emancipation of the Afghan people. To build a modern industrial society a radical change is required that will involve the spread of education and technical training the liberation of productive capacities by introduction of modern farming techniques the removal of opium cultivation which had flourished under US Occupation the sustainable utilisation of Afghanistan’s vast mineral resources which include lithium cobalt copper and other Rare Earth elements and an engagement with the rest of the world.

This doesn’t have to mean a surrender to Western predatory corporations. But it does mean that merely claiming guidance from faith to run an increasingly complex society will have to be tempered. They will also have to give up on the hegemonic aspiration of imposing their own brand of Islam on all Afghans which include different ethnic groups (Uzbeks Tajiks etc) and even sects like Shias (Hazara Qizilbash).

It is too early to pass judgement but there is not much to indicate that the Taliban have reoriented themselves so much. Their past record is horrendous and chilling. A major turn away is required to discard the shadow of that past. Otherwise the Afghan people will have to struggle against them for their basic rights and for emancipation. At least now that fight can be joined with foreign occupiers out of the way."
NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL2NkYy13YXJucy1oaWdoLXJpc2stcGVvcGxlLXRvLWF2b2lkLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwcy12YWNjaW5hdGVkLW9yLW5vdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CDC warns high-risk people to avoid cruise ships vaccinated or not,"ORLANDO — The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated is guidance Friday to warn those at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 to avoid cruise ships whether they’ve had the vaccine or not.

It is a shift from the previous warning that only targeted unvaccinated travelers.

“Severe illness means that a person with COVID-19 may need: hospitalization intensive care a ventilator to help them breathe or they may even die” according to the CDC.

The updated guidance specifically warns those at high risk including older adults people with certain medical conditions and people who are pregnant or recently pregnant.

The CDC’s update comes during the recent wave of the delta variant of COVID-19 which can prove deadly to even vaccinated people with underlying conditions.

Cruise ships returned to sailing from the U.S. for the first time in June now with more than two dozen vessels departing from Florida Texas California Washington and soon New York.

Most sail with a vaccine requirement for any passenger 12 and older. Children 11 and under do not have a vaccine option. In Florida though a state law that went into effect July 1 threatens to fine businesses $5000 per instance if they require proof of vaccination so most cruise lines have shifted their stance in the state to allow unvaccinated passengers.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the parent company of NCL Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas filed a lawsuit over the law and federal judge this month granted an injunction against the state from enforcing it. That opened the door for NCL to begin sailing from Florida with its vaccine-only policy.

Even with Florida’s law shifting cruise lines’ stance on vaccination status some of the destinations cruise lines most often go to have begun to require vaccinations of cruise line passengers. The Bahamas updated an emergency order this week with just such a requirement forcing lines like Royal Caribbean Celebrity and MSC Cruises to limit sailings to only vaccinated passengers 12 and older from Florida when headed to the Bahamas. Carnival and Disney have announce any changes for their Bahamas cruises.

Most cruise lines have focused on the Bahamas as their main destination as they attempt to restart business after more than a year and half of shutdown. That includes stops at private islands such as Disney’s Castaway Cay and Royal Caribbean’s Coco Cay.

Cruise lines were at the epicenter of several outbreaks in early 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic expanded. The industry shut itself down in March 2020 and was then under a CDC no-sail order. Sailings only began after the CDC shifted to a conditional sail followed by months of shifting guidance before it allowed any cruise ship to sail from U.S. ports.

“The chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high since the virus appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships” the CDC states.

Several cruise lines have increased safety policies including more mask wearing and pre-cruise COVID-19 testing as the delta variant has taken hold.

Despite the COVID-19 health protocols in place on board ships now up and running with the CDC’s approval there have been several sailings in which passengers tested positive. Most cases were limited to just a few passengers and in several cases involved unvaccinated children who then also infected their vaccinated parents.

The lines though enacted their quarantine policies and have been able to continue sailing without any major outbreak.

Norwegian introduced the hull art trend in 2002 with the Norwegian Dawn. Through 2013 Norwegian cruise vessels received simpler design patterns related to their names the artwork evolved significantly in recent years.

Starting with the Norwegian Breakaway the company decided to commission famous artists for the jobs which now present several different styles inspirations and motifs.

Here are all the artists hired by Norwegian through the years and their artworks:

Norwegian Prima

Year: 2022

Artist: Manuel “Peeta” Di Rita

The recently floated out Norwegian Prima (pictured above) will feature the company’s largest hull art yet with elements going up to the ship’s superstructure.

Inspired by Italian graffiti art the piece is signed by the Venice-based spraycan artist Manuel Di Rita better known as “Peeta.”

Norwegian Encore

Year: 2019

Artist: Eduardo Arranz-Bravo

The hull art of the 2019-built Norwegian Encore was created by the Spanish artist Eduardo Arranz-Bravo.

According to Norwegian the work represents the artist’s modern and abstract style and feature a “labyrinth of color” inspired by Arranz-Bravo’s life by the sea in Barcelona. The piece of art is also meant to pay tribute to the vibrant guest experience for which the Norwegian brand is recognized the company said.

Norwegian Bliss

Year: 2018

Artist: Robert Wyland

Entitled “Cruising with the Whales” the Norwegian Bliss’ hull art was designed by marine life artist Robert Wyland and features an image of a mother humpback whale and her calf as a centerpiece.

With the ship custom-designed for Alaska cruising the artwork represents the beauty of the destination and the importance of marine conservation according to Norwegian.

Norwegian Joy

Year: 2017

Artist: Tan Ping

Originally designed for the Chinese market the 2017-built Norwegian Joy has one of the most distinctive liveries in the fleet.. Created by the Chinese artist Tan Ping the piece was inspired by the phoenix an iconic mythical bird believed to reign supreme over all birds of the world.

According to the artist the bird is a ubiquitous motif in Chinese culture and symbolizes beauty and good. On the Norwegian Joy it serves as a bridge across the West and the East and brings Chinese people’s best wishes to the world and everyone on the ship’s path said Ping.

Norwegian Escape

Year: 2015

Artist: Guy Harvey

The 2015-built Norwegian Escape has hull artw designed by Guy Harvey a marine wildlife artist who is also an activist for ocean conservation.

With backgrounds as a marine biologist diver photographer and angler Harvey created a design that spans through all the hull and features two undersea scenes that blend seamlessly.

“The large-scale mural demonstrates the concern and respect that Norwegian and I have for the marine environment through which this ship will travel” the artist said when the piece was first revealed.

Norwegian Getaway

Year: 2014

Artist: David “LEBO” Le Batard

The Norwegian Getaway’s hull artwork was commissioned to the Miami-based modern artist and muralist David “LEBO” Le Batard. Inspired by the Florida city the design features a whimsical tropical ocean theme complete with pelicans and palm trees.

The art is centered around a mythical mermaid which according to LEBO represents humanity’s connection to the sea. Surrounding the mythical creature is a fusion of sea and sky dancing across the 2014-built ship with three pelicans completing the artist’s version of a tropical paradise.

Norwegian Breakaway

But what this demand actually does is justify continued fossil fuel extraction and preserve the unsustainable status quo.

Last month a letter was presented to Congress signed by an odd coalition of big oil and gas companies airlines labor unions and big environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy and National Wildlife Federation. Their demand? Increased funding for the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. This technology say the signatories is necessary to combat the alarming levels of atmospheric CO 2 concentration the biggest contributor to global warming.

Even sections of the Left particularly writers connected to Jacobin magazine have echoed the fossil fuel and airline industries in calling for the expansion of carbon capture facilities. One Jacobin writer went so far as to say CCS should be scaled up “a thousand fold.”

Why have such disparate sectors lined up behind this climate solution?

What is Carbon Capture?

Despite increasingly devastating extreme weather events record high temperatures and steadily rising sea levels the world’s energy supply is still supplied overwhelmingly by fossil fuels. An estimated 85 percent of energy worldwide is produced through fossil fuel combustion. Meanwhile the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide now stands at around 410 parts per million higher than it has been in 800000 years.

Carbon capture is a process by which CO 2 gas is sucked from the air or from the emissions of fossil fuel plants and buried in the ground. The idea sounds intriguing and not dissimilar to the process of photosynthesis by which plants and algae extract CO 2 from the air and convert it using the sun’s energy into plant tissue. As one industry think tank says carbon capture “uses the same forces and processes that have trapped oil gas (including naturally occurring CO2) and other hydrocarbons in the Earth’s subsurface for millions of years.”

As each year sees new records set in atmospheric carbon concentration we should welcome the technology with open arms right?

Not quite.

A Catalyst for Even More CO 2 Pollution

To begin with the majority of carbon that’s captured each year by CCS facilities is actually reused by oil companies in a process called Enhanced Oil Recovery. By some estimates nearly 80 percent of all captured carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery which involves injecting the captured carbon into the ground to extract otherwise unreachable reserves of oil. In other words CCS facilities are taking CO 2 out of the atmosphere just to put much of it back in from new fossil fuel extraction and combustion. When enhanced oil recovery technology is employed in combination with CCS 73 percent of captured carbon eventually goes back into the atmosphere.

This partially explains why big oil gas and coal are so enthusiastic about carbon capture. Corporations are able to establish their “green” credibility while continuing to emit carbon and pollute the air and water. In fact with carbon capture facilities and carbon transport pipelines often subsidized by the federal government fossil fuel companies are incentivized to increase extractive activity. As Greenpeace notes the use of enhanced oil recovery means “the captured CO 2 … will become a catalyst for even more CO 2 pollution.”

Insufficient and Inefficient

The Global CCS Institute a pro-CCS advocacy group estimates that the total carbon sequestered by CCS around the world currently stands at 40 million tons per year. This sounds like an impressive figure until we consider that the amount of CO 2 released in the atmosphere is now around 33 billion tons annually. This means that only about 0.1 percent of all CO 2 emitted is currently captured by CCS facilities. Even under the most optimistic scenarios where facilities are rapidly built and brought online — and the captured carbon is not reused for further extractive activity — the technology would still capture only a small fraction of total emissions.

Then there is the exorbitant cost. In 2016 construction began on the Petra Nova carbon capture facility in southwest Houston financed in part by a $195 million Department of Energy grant. The facility was designed to capture emissions from a coal-fired power plant owned by NRG Energy and appeared to show early success. The company reported more than 90 percent of carbon emissions from the plant were being captured. Media outlets lauded the project; the New York Times called it “a bright spot for the technology’s supporters.” Last February the project was indefinitely shut down. That’s because Petra Nova sought to reuse the captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery but with the arrival of the global coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent plummet in oil prices NRG no longer determined carbon capture to be a worthwhile investment.

There are currently only around 20 large-scale carbon capture facilities in operation worldwide. The cost of building a single carbon capture facility can be upwards of $1 billion — the total estimated cost of the now-defunct Petra Nova plant. Scaling up carbon capture “a thousand fold” as Jacobin’s Holly Buck proposes would equal costs of at least $1 trillion not including ongoing maintenance and operation costs and still wouldn’t bring us one inch closer to reducing fossil fuel dependence and transitioning toward renewable energy. Who will pay the cost of building and maintaining these facilities? Without a financial incentive like revenue from enhanced oil recovery or government subsidies polluters are unlikely to take on the heavy investment costs associated with CCS themselves. A large portion of the burden will therefore fall on working-class and middle-class taxpayers. Once again the multinational energy companies will continue to reap massive profits from fossil fuel extraction while simultaneously taking advantage of public funding and hurting the working class.

These costs don’t even take into consideration the environmental impact of running hundreds of energy-intensive carbon capture and storage facilities around the world. What CCS proponents ignore is that the capture of greenhouse gasses necessitates that a significant amount of fuel be burned over and above that needed to generate electricity. Food and Water Watch notes that “retrofitting natural gas and coal plants with CCS while producing the same amount of electricity could raise natural gas and coal production by 13 percent and 35 percent respectively.” Even if facilities were able to capture and store 100% of a fossil-fuel-fired plant’s “normal” CO 2 output plus the additional output from running CCS it would still mean major environmental impact since “burning fuels to produce electricity emits dangerous air pollution depletes scarce water resources and generates large quantities of toxic waste.” Then there are the serious consequences of the continued drilling fracking and mining that will naturally follow the expansion of CCS everything from poisoned drinking water to earthquakes.

A Justification for More Fossil Fuel Extraction

Clearly CCS is wholly insufficient to deal with the immense climate crisis we’re now facing. But media outlets continue to tout the potential of the technology. Each day new extraordinary stories of “successful” carbon capture and storage projects appear in the media. Billionaire “philanthropists” like Bill Gates have pledged considerable sums toward CCS projects. The latest infrastructure bill approved by the Senate and supported by the Biden administration includes billions in funding toward carbon capture. Even the Paris Climate Agreements’ targets were predicated on developing CCS technology and facilities that don’t currently exist. How can we explain why so much of the establishment has lined up behind carbon capture?

Carbon capture is a highly marketable solution precisely because it greenwashes the continued extraction of fossil fuel companies offering the hope that we can simply turn hydrocarbons into a clean and viable source of energy. Almuth Ernsting founder of Biofuelwatch says “It gives people the sense that we can get away from burning ever more fossil fuels and this is a wonderful way of getting carbon back out of the atmosphere. Even if it isn’t done it provides some golden solution out there to justify not cutting emissions.” It’s no wonder that the oil industry has invested heavily in bringing attention to CCS. Just Google “carbon capture” and you’ll find several sponsored search results from ExxonMobil Aramco and Shell. Carbon capture is the ideal solution for the fossil fuel industry because it doesn’t threaten their bottom line — in fact as we’ve seen it can be used to boost the profits of fossil capital.

But why have organizations that claim to speak for workers and the environment pledged their support for new CCS funding from Congress? As Food and Water Watch notes several “well-funded national environmental organizations have uncritically swallowed the fallacious talking point that CCS is both necessary and capable of meeting climate demands.” Among the more than 160 signatories of the previously mentioned letter to Congress were environmental groups like the National Wildlife Federation The Nature Conservancy and union federations like the AFL-CIO and LIUNA. That’s because the objective of these organizations is not to clash with the fossil fuel giants but to partner with big oil and gas to protect modest amounts of land or to enact symbolic climate measures that generate headlines but don’t seriously cut into profits.

Fortunately the majority of environmental organizations worldwide oppose carbon capture as a solution. More than 500 U.S. and Canadian climate and environmental groups signed a statement urging lawmakers to reject CCS. This technology they rightly note is a “dangerous distraction” which is “unnecessary” “does not work” and “benefits polluters.”

CCS Mythology Captivates the Left

Sectors of the Left however and particularly environmental writers connected to Jacobin magazine have repeated the dubious claims put forward by the fossil fuel companies about carbon capture technology.

Leigh Phillips whose work appears regularly in Jacobin has repeatedly stressed the need for CCS both for the creation of jobs and the protection of the planet. He states that “a Green New Deal that puts nuclear power and synthetic hydrocarbons at the heart of an all-of-the-above approach including solar wind enhanced geothermal wave tidal hydrogen and CCS (carbon capture and storage) represents the sort of economic stimulus that deindustrialized communities can understand as delivering genuine transformation. It could secure a future for both the planet and the political left.”

Can Phillips truly be unaware that “all-of-the-above” was the exact catchphrase used by both the Bush II and Obama administrations to describe their own climate proposals — plans which included the continued use of coal oil natural gas and nuclear alongside renewables? Phillips’s rhetoric not only gives cover to the establishment politicians who did nothing to combat the climate emergency but also fosters the exceedingly dangerous illusion that there’s still time to be burning fossil fuels. In fact nothing could be further from the truth.

Holly Buck another Jacobin contributor goes even further stating that “combining direct air capture with enhanced oil recovery could produce carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative fuel if the production process pumps more CO2 into depleted reservoirs than it extracts in the form of carbon emissions.” Incredibly Buck would have us believe that oil extraction and combustion could actually become carbon negative. Better spin could not have come from the PR departments of the fossil fuel giants themselves.

What Is Necessary Instead?

Rather than dumping huge sums of public funds into unproven and costly technology at the expense of the working class we should demand that every measure be taken to keep fossil fuels in the ground. This means taking measures to challenge the interests of the biggest polluters including the fossil fuel corporations the petrochemical companies the airline monopolies the military and the auto manufacturers. We must demand the nationalization of the entire energy sector with the airline industry and the auto industry under worker and consumer control in order to transition in the fastest possible time to renewable energy. We must call for a massive scale down of energy usage which could be achieved by replacing auto production with the creation of fast and reliable public transportation and ending the production and use of luxury goods such as yachts mansions luxury cars and private jets. Renewable energy projects including solar farms wind farms and hydroelectric projects must be immediately developed through public works projects and paid for by heavy taxes on the fortunes of the super-rich.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What is Optimus? Why is it important? And is it worth prioritizing when looking for a new laptop?

What Is NVIDIA Optimus?

Optimus is a technology developed by NVIDIA that automatically adjusts graphics based on how you use a device. This optimization better conserves battery power on a laptop computer. It is sometimes referred to as a hybrid graphics system.

Optimus automatically transitions between integrated graphics and a discrete GPU based on the applications you use. This allows you to use high-performance graphics during gameplay or when watching an HD movie. When you're done or are surfing the web Optimus-enabled systems can switch to integrated graphics to prolong battery life.

What Are the Benefits of Using a Laptop With Optimus Technology?

The key benefit of using a notebook with Optimus technology is better battery life as the system doesn't run a power-demanding discrete graphics card all the time. By automatically switching between integrated graphics and a dedicated graphics card battery life improves in mixed usage situations. Since the function is performed automatically it also improves upon previous hybrid graphics systems that required you to manually switch between the two graphics systems.

How to Find a Laptop With Optimus Technology

Any Optimus system must have a compatible NVIDIA graphics card and clearly state that Optimus technology is supported. Not all modern laptops with the latest NVIDIA graphics cards have this feature. Two similar laptops in the same manufacturer series may not have it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdGNvaW5idXp6LmlvL3BhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy9haW96LW5ldHdvcmstam9pbnMtdGhlLW52aWRpYS1hY2NlbGVyYXRvci1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AIOZ Network Joins the NVIDIA Accelerator Program - Business Partnerships,"Digital media streaming to receive a boost as Layer 1 blockchain-based AIOZ Network joins the NVIDIA Inception accelerator program.

Or follow us on Google News

During AI Day this week Tesla shattered all rules and established industry standards when it comes to making a computer. The presentation just like on Autonomy Day was rather technical and the people making the presentation again may have failed to take into account that not everyone is fully literate in microprocessor design and engineering. Though AI Day was geared to excite the geeks and try to hire industry experts so this was likely an intentional choice.

In this deep dive we scrutinize and explain everything Tesla has said about computer hardware and compare it to the competition and the way things are normally done. Full warning: this presentation is still quite technical but we do try to explain it all in plain English. If you still have any questions please leave them down below in the comments and we will try to answer anything that we can.

To make this easier to digest we are also splitting it into a series of 4 or 5 articles.

The Tesla GPU Stack

In case it wasn’t clear Tesla has built — with NVIDIA GPUs — one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. That is what they call the GPU stack and what they hope their programmers will want to turn off and never use again as soon as Dojo is up and running. During the presentation they said that the number of GPUs is “more than top 5 supercomputer(s) in the world.” I had to dig it up but what Tesla most likely meant is that they have more GPUs than the 5th most powerful supercomputer in the world because that would be a supercomputer called Selene which has 4480 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. However if you add the top 5 together Tesla would not be beating the total GPU count — it’s not even close.

However Tesla’s GPU-based supercomputer or at least its biggest cluster is on its own quite possibly also the 5th most powerful supercomputer in the world. We can see that Tesla started receiving GPUs in mid 2019 for its first cluster. This date and the fact that they mentioned ray tracing during the presentation could mean that Tesla ordered NVIDIA Quadro RTX cards although they might have also been older NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Since NVIDIA released the A100 in November 2020 cluster number 2 is likely also made up of the older hardware. If they used V100 GPUS that would put the second cluster at around 22 PetaFLOPS it would be right at the very bottom edge of the top 10 list in 2020 and might not have even made the list and would certainly not make the top 10 list now.

Fortunately for us Andrej Karpathy revealed in a presentation he made in June that the largest cluster is made up of NVIDIA’s new A100 GPUs. He said that this is roughly the 5th most powerful supercomputer in the world. Considering the components the theoretical maximum would equal 112.32 PetaFLOPS putting it in 4th place however since when working together there is always some scaling inefficiency means 5th place is most likely an accurate estimate if we divide the FP16 TFLOP performance in half to estimate the FP32 performance you get around 90 PetaFLOP just a bit less than the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer in China.



The Dojo (that I would love to go to)

So at first glance it might appear that with 1.1 Exaflop this would become the most powerful supercomputer in the world. However Tesla sugarcoated the numbers a bit and Dojo will in fact become the 6th most powerful computer in the world. Right now the most powerful supercomputer is the “Fugaku” in Kobe Japan with a world record of 442 PetaFLOPS three times faster than the second most powerful supercomputer “Summit” in Tennessee USA which has 148.6 PetaFLOPS. Dojo with its 68.75 PetaFLOPS (approximately) would then be in 6th place. In fact because the next 3 supercomputers are quite close 61.4 to 64.59 PetaFLOPS it’s possible that Dojo is in seventh eighth or even ninth place. Later on in this series we will explain this in greater detail under the colorfully named section Tesla flops the FLOPS test.

Nonetheless this is absolutely nothing to laugh at. In fact when it comes to the specific tasks that Tesla is creating Dojo for it is very likely that Dojo will outperform all other supercomputers in the world combined and by a very large margin. The standard test for supercomputers is peeling apples but Tesla has a yard full of oranges and designed a tool for that so the mere fact that in addition to being the best in the world at peeling oranges it is still able to get 6th place for peeling apples just shows how incredible this system it.

Moving away from raw compute performance Dojo and its its jaw-dropping engineering puts all supercomputers to shame in almost every other way imaginable. To logically explain this we need to start at the beginning the small scale.

What is an SoC

The way every computer works right now is you have a processor (CPU) — in some cases a business server might have two and the/those processor(s) go onto a motherboard that houses the RAM (temporary fast memory of 8–16GB in good laptops/desktops) and the computer has a power supply that feeds electricity into the motherboard to power everything. Most consumer desktops have a separate graphics card (GPU) but most consumer processors also have a built-in graphics card.

Now if you haven’t read it yet you may want to read my previous article in which I analyze Tesla’s hardware 3 chip (Elon Musk on Twitter called it a good analysis so you can’t go wrong there) but to very quickly summarize: the Tesla HW3 chip and most consumer processors are actually an SoC a “system on a chip” because they include cache memory (sadly only a few megabytes) as well as a processor and a graphics card and in the case of the Tesla HW3 chip two NPUs or Neural Processing Units.



Wafer & Wafer Yield

Now before we move on I need to explain something about how processors graphics cards and SoCs are normally made. All of the components like transistors are not added to individual processors. They are all placed while the processor is part of a circular disc called a wafer which you can see in the image above. That wafer is then cut into pieces each of which becomes an individual processor GPU or SoC. The chip fabrication does not always go well and often some processors don’t work or are only partially operational. In the industry the common term to describe this issue is a low wafer yield.

Even most people who don’t know much about computer hardware know that Intel offers celeron/pentium i3 i5 i7 and i9 processors and that order is from weakest to strongest. What most people don’t know is that due to problems with wafer yield some of those processors are defective they work only partially so what they do is they disable the broken part of the chip and sell it as a cheaper version This is called binning. So a celeron/are ingena broken i3 and an i5 is a broken i7 and even within chips there are various versions of an i5 and i7 some that can’t reach the maximum clock speed are locked and sold as a cheaper variant of that chip. Whether Intel still does this today with their latest chips I am not sure but they still did this as recently as 2017. The point is that rather than throw away a defective wafer or defective chips in a wafer you can still salvage your yield.

High costs tough antitrust review cited as top challenging factors



By Kim Yoo-chul



Samsung leader Lee Jae-yong's release from prison is helping the company prepare for its next chapter. His release is putting pressure on corporate leadership to possibly use its huge cash reserves to make timely and splashy investments.



The justice ministry's approval of Lee's parole goes against President Moon Jae-in's commitment not to use his authority to pardon or parole top white-collar criminals ""for the sake of the economy."" Right after Lee's release from prison President Moon said he understood the criticism regarding the release of the Samsung vice chairman but at the decision was based partly on the country's expectations for Lee's increased contribution to tackling chip shortage and vaccine supply issues.



Because many governments view semiconductors and the current short supply as a matter of national security they are committing to increasing their spending and actively pursuing policies to boost semiconductor production. Korea plans to invest up to $450 billion until 2030 in a bid to make national chipmakers more competitive.



Given Samsung's world-leading strength in memory chip-making the company is being asked to clinch some creative and large-scale acquisitions as its leadership is increasingly being challenged in segments it has edges in.



As CEOs of the country's family-run conglomerates function more in a chief operating officer (COO) role no major investment or acquisition deals can proceed without a signoff from Lee the scion of the owner family.



From that standpoint investors continue to focus on Samsung over its intention to purchase Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors. But Samsung is coming close to shifting its stance towards the ""NXP scenario"" as its secondary option rather than a primary one.



On Sunday sources involved with the issue said the South Korean tech behemoth has started rethinking its possible acquisition of NXP.



""NXP Semiconductors was one company on Samsung's shopping but the company is second-guessing its acquisition of NXP because NXP is too big"" an industry executive said by telephone.



If Samsung acquires NXP then it can sell vehicle components to its existing clients such as BMW and Ford but a high price and expected tough antitrust review are cited as the two major points pushing Samsung to reconsider its assessment of taking over NXP the executive added.



Because Samsung has lagged behind in areas such as foundry chip-making driverless vehicles 5G and biotech its recent confirmation that it will try to close ""sizable deals"" in the next few years raised investors' expectations that Samsung may acquire NXP with JPMorgan recently justifying that scenario. Samsung Electronics' net-cash was some 125 trillion won as of last year comparable to Apple and Google in terms of cash holdings.

The water-reliant microchip manufacturing process is largely responsible for drawing global attention to the drought in Taiwan where TSMC has four foundries. This process also makes the famously dry American Southwest a less-than-intuitive locale for multibillion-dollar investments to manufacture such chips. But there is already an established semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in Arizona; the state has emerged as a U.S. “manufacturing hotspot” in the push to “insulate semiconductor supply from China” Fortune reported in February.

During an interview with CNBC Forrester Research vice president Glenn O’Donnell compared semiconductor manufacturing to an indoor swimming pool: “You need a lot [of water] to fill it but you don’t have to add much to keep it going. Also being in an enclosed space a lot of the water that evaporates can be captured with a dehumidifier and returned to the pool.” This comment suggests that water availability may not be an ongoing burden to the manufacturing process once volume production commences.

Also crucial for making semiconductors is access to affordable stable energy. In Taiwan the cost of electricity is at risk of increasing by as much as 25% by 2025 according to Bloomberg which reports: “the government's rigid denuclearization policy and emission reduction targets imply that more-expensive renewable electricity will be the only choice for manufacturers' surging energy needs.” In Arizona semiconductor manufacturers will have access to the U.S. power grid as well as renewable energy sources including solar.

Sourcing talent

With record demand and billion-dollar facilities on the horizon companies will need to be strategic about recruiting a capable workforce. Talent in the field is tough to find but not as tough in the Southwest as it would probably be in many other parts of the United States. Arizona has an established yet largely dormant semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and also an active semiconductor design market both of which are anticipated to streamline the U.S.’s imminent march back into chip manufacturing.

Phoenix has long been the unofficial microelectronic manufacturing hub of the United States and Andy Blye of the Phoenix Business Journal reports: “Phoenix is home to many other semiconductor companies as well. NXP ON Semiconductor Microchip and Broadcom all have employees here.” Companies in the process of establishing (or reestablishing) fabs in the American Southwest will likely source expertise necessary to run the highly anticipated foundries by either relocating talent or by drawing from the established semiconductor design workforce that already exists in cities such as Phoenix. Middle market semiconductor companies or those adjacent to this space would likely see waves of hiring by TSMC Intel and Samsung which could lure talent away or push wages higher

Additionally the chip shortage has spurred political action as this June blog post on the Semiconductor Industry Association’s website explains: “Bipartisan legislation introduced this week in the House would eliminate the counterproductive per-country cap on employment-based visas in favor of a fair ‘first come first served’ system providing U.S. semiconductor companies with greater access to top talent from around the world needed to compete and innovate.”

Future possibilities

It's important to remember that the rush for capable employees is still a ways off; TSMC’s wafer fabrication plant in Phoenix “is expected to start volume production in 2024” according to Reuters and “Intel expects the Arizona fabs to be operational sometime in 2023” Morningbrew.com reported in May. TSMC has committed $12 billion for a foundry in Phoenix with “construction slated to start next year.” And in May Reuters reported that TSMC may build up to five fabs in Arizona.

Although volume production manufacturing appears to be a few years away manufacturing-adjacent industries can be expected to gear up creating new opportunities for the American middle market. Mainly semiconductor equipment companies and suppliers packaging companies and testing shops should prepare for a wave of change over the next few years. This is a great time for these companies to determine how they will adapt to the reintroduction of large-scale volume production; shore up relationships with their own workforces contractors and existing supply chains; and set aside capital to allow for strategic agility.

The strategy to build resilient semiconductor supply chains for the future “must include taking defensive actions to protect our technological advantages” according to the White House’s supply chain review. “But we must also proactively invest in domestic production and R&D.”

With approved capital expenditure plans experienced workforces to tap potential eases forthcoming for employment-based visas and an ever-growing demand for chips the future appears bright for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. However the trickle-down effects of reemerging domestic chip production are still in large part many years away from having significant impact on the global chip market and the middle market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9zZWVlZC1yZXRlcm1pbmFsLXJldmlldy10aGUtcG93ZXItaXMtaW4teW91ci1oYW5kc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seeed reTerminal Review: The Power is in Your Hands,"Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

Seeed seems to be on a run right now. We recently reviewed Seeed’s dual gigabit ethernet carrier board and found it to be a handy piece of kit. But for Seeed’s next carrier board we see a different direction an all in one device that integrates the Compute Module 4 into a portable chassis designed for industrial and embedded applications.

Available at seeedstudio.com (Image credit: seeedstudio.com) Direct Pricing $195

Seeed’s reTerminal harnesses a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 with 4GB of RAM and a 32GB eMMC inside a plastic housing dominated by a 5 inch capacitive touchscreen. Despite the form factor we still have access to the GPIO and two camera connectors but there are some issues that we will address in the course of the review. At $195 reTerminal is an investment rather than an impulse purchase but what can we do with it and why would we spend that much on what is really a Raspberry Pi 4 ? Let's find out.

Using the Seeed reTerminal

Let's start with the elephant in the room. Seeed’s reTerminal feels like a slightly chunky tablet but it lacks a battery. Sure we can add a USB battery via the USB C port but there is no space inside reTerminal to add an internal battery.

The best way to use reTerminal is at your desk or embedded into a project with a reliable power source. With Raspberry Pi OS pre-installed onto the 32GB eMMC we are ready to build projects with little friction power up and go.

The look and feel of Raspberry Pi OS on the reTerminal is no different to the experience of a 4GB Raspberry Pi 4. The provided Compute Module 4 can be easily swapped out for another variant; all we need to do is remove the many screws holding the case together then remove the four screws which secure the Compute Module 4 to the carrier board.

The 5-inch 1280 x 720 screen is clear and bright even for old eyes such as ours. It supports multi-touch input and is surprisingly accurate enabling us to easily open and close windows and navigate menus in lieu of a mouse. That said a wireless mouse and keyboard are a great addition to this device. Underneath the screen are four buttons F1 F2 F3 and a green “input / enter” button. These buttons are mapped to asdf keys on the keyboard which means that can be easily used in your code based projects. If you were thinking of using reTerminal as a media player well you had better invest in a Bluetooth speaker as the only onboard speaker is a simple buzzer.

Getting inside reTerminal is easy but it can be a daunting experience. First we have to remove the four dust caps at the corners of the unit’s underside. Then gently pry the light grey plastic backing off take care near the center as it will flex and feel very fragile. Then remove the heatsink and finally remove the inside plastic case taking care not to wrench the Wi-Fi antenna off.

Once inside we can see the familiar connectors of the camera (CSI0) and a smaller Raspberry Pi Zero centric camera connector (CSI1). Connecting a camera is relatively easy but do take care of the black plastic locks and make sure that the gold pins of the camera’s flex cable are pointing upwards and not down to the board.

We inserted the camera cable incorrectly even after checking the connection and it caused a short that saw the unit draw 1.4A of power and quickly heat up. The camera’s flex cable will also need to be threaded through a slot in the outer case and this does leave the camera flapping around in the breeze. A camera mount / holder would’ve been a great addition.

The microSD card slot (see best microSD cards for Raspberry Pi ) is something of an issue in that we can only access it by removing the case. In an industrial setting we get it keeping ports tucked away reduces the risk of unsolicited code being run but the USB ports are an easy target for those kinds of attacks. It would’ve been great to have the microSD card accessible via the outside of the case but for now we can treat it as an additional storage option rather than a boot device.

On the sides of the reTerminal are four M4 screw points designed for use with modules that provide extra functionality for example LoRaWAN Industrial IO and PoE. We didn’t have any accessories to test so we cannot provide any further information but the idea of securely connecting an add-on is appealing.

The single camera mount on the bottom of reTerminal is a useful means to mount reTerminal to a tripod or bracket keeping the unit in easy reach but out of the way. On the underside we have a large industrial connector which breaks out a PCI-e 1 lane host USB 2.0 26 GPIOs and PoE. Sadly we have nothing to connect it to so we were unable to test.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Flashing an OS onto the eMMC of the Compute Module 4 is a little trickier than a microSD card. Seeed’s reTerminal comes with the latest Raspberry Pi OS installed to the 32GB eMMC but should we wish to use another OS or freshen up an old install we first need to flick a switch next to the Compute Module 4 enabling it for USB flashing. Connect the reTerminal to a Windows machine via the USB C port. We then need to follow the official documentation to enable our Windows machine to see the reTerminal and then we can flash an OS using the official Raspberry Pi Imager.

Using the GPIO requires an external breakout board such as Pimoroni’s HAT Hacker HAT. We connected a breakout and then used a Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro and a Sense HAT. Both worked with no issues. The GPIO is as accessible and easy to use as it is on a typical Raspberry Pi.

Use Cases for the Seeed reTerminal

The form factor and camera mount attachment mean that reTerminal is destined for use in interesting places. In an industrial setting reTerminal will be at its best. Able to work with off the shelf sensors and components used to monitor industrial processes plus we have the power of a Raspberry Pi 4 condensed into a small package.

For home users this is where the line blurs a little. At $195 including the Compute Module 4 Seeed’s reTerminal is for die hard Pi users and those looking to scratch an itch for their embedded projects. Sure reTerminal can be embedded into a robot and the five inch touchscreen provides an ideal interface to control and view the status of your creation.

Bottom Line

$195 is a lot of cash to spend on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 product. Seeed’s reTerminal is a well put together solid and responsive piece of kit. The form factor is excellent and the 5-inch touchscreen display is just enough for most projects. The letdowns for reTerminal are the limited access to the camera ports and the microSD card and the lack of a battery. But if you can work round these limitations then perhaps you have the ideal Pi for your next project.",,,,,,

As antique tractors fire trucks and cars lined up for the centennial parade the first the fair has held for at least a decade parade-goers gathered on a clear Sunday on the grounds in Wilmot.

Leading the procession was Marylln Zirbel the oldest living lifetime member of the County Fair riding on a in a tractor from the 1960s driven by her grandson.

Zirbel a 4-H leader for 40 years said she can’t even remember when she first became a member of the County Fair although it was some time in the 1950s. After the Fair was cancelled last year she said she was glad to be back and felt others shared the same sentiment.

“I just love the fair” Zirbel said “You can tell how much people miss seeing each other.”

Driving behind her was Randy Borri the fair’s veterinarian who was recognized on Saturday for 50 years of service. “It’s been a pleasure and an honor to serve as a veterinarian” Borri said “I met a lot of wonderful people here.”

Borri isn’t planning on going anywhere soon though. “Hopefully I’ll be around” Borri said laughing.

Returning Fairests

Past Fairest of the Fair winners going back as far as 1978 rode in the back of pickup trucks waving to the crowds. Jenny Happ the Fairest of the Fair program coordinator said that out of the 65 past winners 17 had returned to join the parade.

“It’s fun to see all of the memories brought back together after a hundred years” Happ said.

Claire Fox the 2021 Fairest of the Fair reflected on the centennial anniversary.

“I think my favorite part is we get to celebrate the history” Fox said “It’s nice to see all the fairests get together.”

Amanda Boss the 2018 winner mentioned a poster from the very first county parade she had seen. The events listed she said were largely unchanged in the 100 years since.

“It’s nice to see that’s never changed or dwindled” Boss said “The only difference is it was free in 1920.”

Fox said she was grateful that the fair was able to return after cancelling last year.

“Everyone should just realize how blessed we are to come together and celebrate like we are” Fox said “I just feel blessed.”

Donna Eliess-Jaworski the 1983 winner said she was feeling great.

“All this camaraderie it’s amazing” Eliess-Jaworksi said.

As the vehicles ranging from antique tractors to a new convertible corvette drove by the crowds riders tossed handfuls of candy to the kids.

“Kids love candy” said Norm Kazumura a Fair Board member for six years and the primary organizer for the parade. “They’ll say ‘Ma lets go to the parade and get candy!’”

Kazumura said they brought the parade back for the centennial anniversary as the first County Fair back in 1920 also had a parade. Depending on the response Kazumura said it could return as a regular fair event.

“It’s nice to see the community come together when you have something special like a centennial parade” Kazumura said.

Fairest crowning

Later in the afternoon they crowned the Fairest of the Fair. The three contestants Shannon Diedrich Paige Armbruster and Katelyn Hannah had to act out a radio ad announcing the fair answer two impromptu questions and go through a stage interview.

The 2021 Wisconsin Fairest of the Fairs Cayley Vande Berg of Fond Du Lac spoke to the crowd as the judges deliberated.

“I need to commend them for their courage to come up on this stage” Vande Berg said of the three contestants.

Hannah of Salem was crowned 2022 Fairest of the Fair. Diedrich of Twin Lakes was crowned Fair Royalty.

Their reign will begin Jan 1 2022 and go until Jan 1 2023.

Sunday was the final day of the Kenosha County Fair running until 7 p.m. More information about next year’s fair can be found at www.kenoshacofair.com.

Many think the same about Emmitt Smith for his career as an NFL running back. On Saturday the Pro Football Hall of Famer and former Dallas Cowboys great announced that the pair now have something else in common besides their athletic greatness. Smith announced he is becoming a co-owner of a NASCAR Xfinity Series team in 2022 with former Navy football player and military officer Jesse Iwuji who will also be behind the wheel.

Emmitt Smith announced as new owner of Xfinity Series team in 2022

'This is a gateway to transformative thinking and opportunity for people in the #NASCAR space. There are talented people that may have the passion but don’t know the pathway.'–@EmmittSmith22 on why he will partner with @Jesse_Iwuji on a new Xfinity team. https://t.co/3vvLg7HbYM — NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) August 21 2021

Before Saturday’s Xfinity Series race at Michigan the NBC pre-race show Countdown to Green interviewed military veteran and part-time Xfinity-Truck Series driver Jesse Iwuji who made a special announcement. He and Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith were joining forces to run an Xfinity Series team in 2022.

Smith came on and talked about the exciting new business venture.

“This came about a year and a half ago” Smith said. “We were in Texas at the Texas race and Jesse happened to be there. His partner Matt Casto reached out to me and my partners and we became a sponsor of that car during that particular race. That’s when I had the chance to meet Jesse understand what his mission was understand what his plans were and to try and be involved in every which way that I possibly could to help enhance it.”

While some might think Smith followed the lead of Jordan the eight-time Pro Bowler said it was Iwuji and helping him achieve his goals and make a difference in the community that motivated him to do it.

“Our mission is twofold” Smith said. “Obviously we want to win but we want to create an opportunity for others. All people are looking for is an opportunity to become successful.”

Who is Jesse Iwuji?

Jesse Iwuji will be the first one to admit he’s got a lot to learn about NASCAR. The 34-year-old lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve who played safety at the U.S Naval Academy before serving seven years of active duty is new to NASCAR. He made his Truck Series debut in 2018.

Since then he’s raced 13 times with the trucks and made five Xfinity Series starts. His highest finish was a 17th-place with the trucks on his home track of Texas back in 2019.

Despite Iwuji’s considerable inexperience Smith said his decision to come on board was an easy one.

“He’s a very talented individual not to mention he happened to be from the Dallas Texas-area and he grew up being a Dallas Cowboys fan” Smith said with a big smile. “With all of that said it made it a whole lot easier for me to get behind a young man like him that’s very passionate very driven obviously serving our country served our country for many years. And now he has a different type of passion in terms of getting into NASCAR and driving 200 miles an hour around a track trying to beat people. So I’m okay with that.”

Emmitt Smith has been a NASCAR fan since he was young

Emmitt Smith made his name as the all-time leading rusher in NFL history with the Dallas Cowboys. In addition to his obvious love of football growing up in Florida his dad also had a passion for NASCAR and introduced him to the sport.

“My father used to go to the races all the time” Smith said. “I never went to too many races but I went up to a race at Bristol Tennessee and I saw a bunch of wrecks and it was so loud. I enjoyed the moment and so much excitement around it. You talk about football is physical when you see cars wreck running into each other that’s extremely physical.”

Smith said even as one of the most successful players in NFL history he’s always been in awe of drivers and what they do.

“Seeing these big tracks and knowing these cars are flying around at 190 something almost 200 miles an hour these guys are so talented” Smith said. “I could not drive that fast. I know my talent. I know my lane. I’m going to stay in my lane and put Jesse in the car. Let Jesse drive and enjoy himself. It’s his job.”

Smith knows his lane. He used to run through it for touchdowns to the roar of cheering fans. Now he’s going to be able to experience a whole different roar at race tracks around the country.

Who'll pay to plug them?,"Sticking out like a sore thumb in the otherwise bucolic rolling pastures and fields of hay sit four rusting oil tanks “Out of Service” stenciled on their sides along with a scattering of other weathered and unusable equipment.

For the better part of three years Jon and Susanne Stephens have without success been trying to get Noble Energy to plug four wells the oil company has “temporarily” abandoned and remove the defunct equipment and underground flowlines from their land.

The wells haven’t produced any oil or gas since 2017 and Noble says it will at some point remove the equipment from the fields near Milliken in Weld County and plug the wells. “We will notify you when this activity is eventually scheduled” the company which is now part of Chevron Corp. told the Stephenses’ attorney in an email.

“When I was living in Iran this was around the time of the fall of the shah of Iran they had a saying he’d take the milk and leave the cow” Jon Stephens 83 said. “That’s how I feel about the oil companies. They take what they want and leave us to deal with the rest.”

Low-producing and inactive wells such as those in Stephenses’ fields stipple Colorado and are a major focus of rulemaking to ensure there are enough operator funds to plug and remediate all of the nearly 52000 oil and gas wells in the state.

In 2020 there were 17196 inactive wells – producing less than the equivalent of 1 barrel of oil a day including 9585 wells that produced no oil or gas at all. There were another 8538 low-producing wells with an output of between 1 and 5 barrels a day according to state data.

Together the two categories – which were defined in a draft state rule – account for almost half of all the wells in Colorado.

“This rulemaking is unmasking a problem that has been silently growing for decades” said Kate Merlin an attorney with the environmental group WildEarth Guardians. “Operators have neglected their old wells and left them open and idle rather than pay to clean them up and plug them.”

More wells are being plugged than are being drilled

A prime goal of the rules being developed by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission is to make sure there are adequate bonds posted so that if an operator goes bankrupt or disappears the state has the funds to plug and remediate these “orphan” wells.

Industry representatives caution however that this is a misreading of the situation and that many shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells are closed when oil prices are low for maintenance or for safety when new wells are being drilled in the area.

Companies are now plugging more wells than they are drilling. Between 2015 and 2020 8104 wells were drilled in Colorado and 9902 were plugged according to industry statistics.

“The current situation in Colorado is improving within the existing system” API-Colorado an industry trade group said in comments to the COGCC. “Colorado is well positioned to deal with the orphan wells.”

Even the low-producing wells have economic value yielding a small but steady stream of oil and income year after year according to Sam Bradley a spokesman for the Small Operator Society an industry trade group. “They just keep truckin’ along.”

Still the COGCC was mandated by Senate Bill 181 – the 2019 law that transformed the commission’s mission from promoting oil and gas development to protecting public health safety and welfare – to beef-up the financial assurance rules.

The commission initially drafted a rule that would have required a $78000 plugging and clean-up bond for each well compared to the current $10000 to $20000 per well. The agency has since recalculated the average plugging and clean-up cost at nearly $93000.

Every company would also pay $200 a well into an orphan well fund raising about $10 million a year.

Under lobbying from the industry the draft rules were scrapped and turned into a “strawman” for discussion by oil companies local governments and environmental and community groups.

“The proposal would have created the most expensive financial assurance rules in the country for a state that has among the fewest orphan wells in the country” said Dan Haley president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association an industry trade group.

New draft rules are set to be issued at the end of August with hearings early next year and final adoption in April 2022.

The goal COGCC chairman Jeff Robbins said is “better financial assurance without creating unintended consequences and adding orphan wells … Getting the balance right is really really important.”

The commission has however already identified what may be lurking problems that need to be addressed by increased financial assurance.

A 2018 commission task force said some operators have maintained “active” status for wells through the ploy of “selling past production from leasehold tank inventory or by ‘swabbing’ the well to extract and sell a small amount of fluid product each year.”

The commission also has found transfers of wells to new owners involving a large number of low-producing wells “are likely to result in higher risks to the public of the new operator orphaning the wells.”

Slow clean up keeps owners of Weld County land from selling for development

Traveling the Front Range and Eastern Plains the nature of Colorado oil and gas wells unfolds as a complex pattern that contains derelict drillers bankruptcy and orphan wells the clash of suburban home building and drilling but also robust plugging programs by some companies and profits and royalties being squeezed from even the most modest of wells.

The tale is different in the farm fields out near the Nebraska border than in the quickly rising subdivisions in communities like Broomfield but the new financial assurance rules must encompass them all.

One provision in the draft rules tried to address the Stephenses’ problem by requiring a company to get its shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells back in production within six months or increase the bonds on them or put them on a list to be plugged within three years.

API-Colorado supports the idea of a plugging list. Texas has one said Carrie Hackenberger the group’s associate director although a three-year time frame may be an issue.

Jon Stephens remains vexed by the proposal. “The farmer is left waiting three years maybe more after already waiting years” he said. “We just want the return of our farmland.”

In 1921 Susanne’s grandfather Frank Spomer – one of a wave of German Russian immigrant farmers who spread out across the Midwest and West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – bought the cropland outside Milliken.

The mineral rights on the land however were owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad had sold off the surface but held on to the minerals as is allowed by Colorado’s split-estate system.

It was another 85 years before somebody showed up to tap those minerals. By that time Susanne 84 who had grown up on the farm owned the land but Noble Energy one of the biggest operators in Colorado held the oil and gas rights.

In 2006 Noble started drilling on the property. The Stephenses had no choice. Under Colorado law a landowner cannot deny a mineral owner access.

Noble paid $27500 for surface damage on the 160 acres of irrigated fields as it drilled five wells and laid underground flowlines to carry oil to a four-tank battery that also included a heat separator and two concrete water storage tanks and took up about two acres of the land.

“The wells were drilled over a period of a year” Jon Stephens said. “The fields were torn up for months. We were dealing with erosion problems.”

Then in 2017 Noble pulled some but not all its equipment and listed the wells as temporarily abandoned.

A temporarily abandoned well is one where equipment has been removed and a temporary plug put in place. A shut-in well is one where the valves have merely been shut off. There are about 8100 shut-in wells and 2700 temporarily abandoned wells in the state.

In 2019 Noble plugged one of the Stephenses’ wells but did not clean up the site Jon Stephens said.

This has left the Stephenses in limbo. The land is currently leased to a neighboring farmer but the option of selling it especially for development is limited because of the unplugged wells and flowlines running through the property.

This is a problem that plagues landowners and developers across Front Range oil country. “They keep (them wells) in place to avoid plugging” said Lance Astrella an attorney who represents property owners in oil and gas cases. “It is an abuse of property rights. It is probably a trespass case but most land owners can’t afford to file a lawsuit.”

Low-producing wells even if uneconomical are also used to hold on to leases which require an operating well Astrella said.

Noble when asked by The Sun about the Stephenses’ wells said they are scheduled to be plugged late this year or early next. “That’s not my information” said Matt Sura the attorney representing the Stephenses.

All this leaves Jon Stephens frustrated. “We aren’t anti-oil” he said. “We’re pro-oil we just think there should be a fair game.”

The economics are fragile but every little pump jack helps

Richard Jefferson 63 is one farmer who is happy to have oil wells – 13 bobbing horse-head pump jacks – on his Eastern Plains’ fields of proso millet and wheat Washington County land his family has tended for 70 years.

They are all stripper wells each one yielding no more than 15 barrels of oil or 90000 cubic feet of natural gas a day. Still there is a steady stream of royalties. “I get $600 to $800 a month depending on oil prices” said Jefferson who unlike the Stephenses owned his mineral rights. “It is not a huge amount of money but it is cash in the pocket. It helps.”

One of the wells on Jefferson’s land is operated by Impetro Resources a company with 100 stripper wells run by Sam Bradley 37.

“I have to hand it to these young guys” Jefferson said. “You have to have balls to buy these stripper wells.”

Bradley followed his father who is a geologist into the “small” oil business. The elder Bradley “has a passion for vertical wells” Bradley said. “He chased these assets for years.”

After getting a degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines Bradley held a string of jobs in the industry including as an operations engineer for the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Co. before starting Impetro – Latin for “to succeed.”

While the focus in Colorado has been on the big new horizontal shale wells – drilled to a depth of 10000 feet running as much as 3 miles underground and producing the equivalent of 5000 barrels of oil a day or more – the majority of wells in the state are stripper wells.

The 29000 stripper wells make up 56% of all the wells in Colorado though they accounted for less than 5% of the oil and about 15% of the natural gas produced in 2018 according to the Colorado Office of State Auditor.

These vertical wells about 4000 feet deep are often decades old. Some of Bradley’s wells have been producing oil for nearly 50 years.

“The wells decline at about 2% a year” Bradley said. “They are bunt singles. You’re not going to get rich but they are cash positive.”

Six days a week a contractor called a “pumper” checks each of Impetro’s wells dropping a tape measure into the collection tanks. (There are two oil tanks an oil-water separator a water settling tank and a produced water pit supporting Impetro’s pump jack).

When the oil in the tank reaches 10 feet the pumper dispatches a tanker truck to collect the contents – about 180 barrels to 230 barrels a load.

Bradley pays the pumper $400 a well each month. A pumper can cover 20 to 30 wells and Bradley said make a decent living. “It’s one of the better employment opportunities out here” he said. Impetro also paid $173000 in county property taxes last year.

Fate of companies running little stripper wells depends on big markets

Yet the economics of strippers remain fragile and their fate is perhaps bound even more tightly to the price of oil on markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange than those of the big oil companies.

Bradley said that out of every barrel of oil sold about $25 goes to basic operating and compliance costs $2 go to local taxes (strippers are exempt from state severance taxes) and another $5 goes to the cost of hiring a workover rig for repairs to the well bore.

Royalty payments to folks like Jefferson take another $5 a barrel while $2.50 goes to debt service and $1.50 to general and administrative costs. The cost of paying trucks and pipelines to deliver the oil is a final $5 a barrel.

“If the NYMEX is below $45 I am bouncing below bottom” Bradley said “and when it is above $50 I can start to make a little money and pay off my debt.”

In the depths of the pandemic the spot price of benchmark U.S. oil dropped as low as $16.94 a barrel. It averaged $39.17 for 2020 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

To make ends meet during the pandemic Bradley laid-off employees lived in a camper and pumped the tanks himself. Still he says he almost lost his business.

Oil prices have rebounded and Aug. 20 spot price on the NYMEX closed at $63.40 a barrel.

“The reason guys like me invest in this business is that you can make money in these upswings” Bradley said. But after last year’s near-death experience Bradley hedged his output selling a large chunk of his 2021 production in fixed contracts at $45 a barrel. “I am far from flush with cash but I am financially secure” he said.

While margins are slim Bradley said an evaluation of his portfolio done for a bank by a third-party auditor found that the low-yielding but long-lived assets will make enough cash flow over the next 13 years to plug his wells.

The draft financial assurance rules would completely upend the economic balance of stripper wells Bradley said.

The draft rules would call for each well to be bonded for the cost of plugging and abandoning at $78000 but they would allow blanket bonds for operators with large numbers of wells.

Bradley and most stripper well operators however would fall into a category called “Tier 3” which was aimed at low-producing wells.

An operator with more than 60% of its wells producing less than five barrels a day would have to start paying into a fund for the next 10 years to cover each well at full-cost bonding.

“Tier 3 operators may have the highest risk of orphaning their wells because they have a higher percentage of low producing wells that generate relatively little revenue and they are plugging a relatively low percentage of their wells” the commission said.

“The rules are a complete disaster” Bradley said. “These draft rules require me to tie up all my working capital in bonding. The rules would drive operators out of business and create a whole lot of orphan wells.”

The commission’s financial assurance task force raised the same prospect saying “Additional regulatory burdens placed on a large number of ‘low flow wells’ could result in a significant short-term increase in the number of orphaned wells.”

The Small Operator Society representing 65 small oil and gas companies lobbied the COGCC to set up a statewide fund into which all the oil and gas companies would pay based on their production and from which all operators big and small could draw to plug wells. The commission did not adopt the idea.

“It was pretty much an admission by the small operators that they don’t have the resources to plug their own wells” Sura the oil and gas attorney said.

It is not that simple said COGA’s Haley. “This is an industry full of small businesses hundreds of mom-and-pop businesses across the state” he said. “There are problems for small businesses when government increases the cost of doing business in Colorado. It may be expensive for large businesses but they can shoulder it more easily.”

Bradley said the commission doesn’t understand the stripper well business and that as long as a well is producing more than two barrels of oil a day there will always be a buyer and operator for it. Below two barrels a day the wells are uneconomical and there will be few takers. There are thousands of wells recording less than two barrels a day.

“Even in the worst year we’ve seen 2020 there was only one operator who went bankrupt and created orphan wells Petroshare” Bradley said. “That should tell you something.”

One bankruptcy had many ripple effects

Englewood-based PetroShare Corp. initially filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 in the hopes of reorganizing but by June 2020 facing the pandemic collapse in oil prices and the economy the company was liquidated.

PetroShare owned as many as 141 oil and gas wells according to COGCC data some dating back to the 1980s and some brand new horizontal wells. At the time of its liquidation the company had 89 wells.

The wells were sold in the bankruptcy proceeding to two companies to whom PetroShare owed money. Those companies however did not take all the wells leaving some orphaned.

At the time of the liquidation three wells had been inactive for more than five years 17 had been inactive for more than two years and 47 likely qualified as stripper wells according to analysis by Carbon Tracker a climate policy think tank.

The state seized $325000 in PetroShare bonds for 53 orphaned wells and 58 orphan well sites. That came to a little more than $6100 for each well leaving the COGCC to make up the difference.

“They become our responsibility for the rest of their lives?” Pam Eaton then an oil and gas commissioner asked at a June 2020 hearing on PetroShare’s bankruptcy. “That’s correct” replied Steven Kirschner a COGCC staffer.

While PetroShare may have been the most recent high-profile bankruptcy liquidation – there have been several other operators who have slipped into and out of bankruptcy reorganization – it is far from the most notorious. That distinction goes to Texas Tea LLC.

Texas Tea whose mailing address was a UPS Store between a nail spa and a juice bar in a Lakewood strip mall on West Colfax Avenue ran up so many violations at least 55 and was so delinquent in paying fines that it was banned from doing business in Colorado.

The City of Brighton took the responsibility for plugging one Texas Tea well within its city limits at a cost of $26000 and in 2016 the COGCC took over about 30 of the company’s wells. Texas Tea had $72000 in bonds — $2400 a well.

There are still eight Texas Tea wells and 11 well sites on the state’s orphan well list to be cleaned up.

A review of COGCC data shows that there are other wells that may be heading toward the orphan well list like the 22 temporarily abandoned wells of Colorado Springs-based FRAM Operating LLC.

FRAM ran as many as 83 wells in Delta and Mesa counties and was last recorded having 25 wells. It posted $345000 in total clean-up bonds including $250000 for plugging.

The company’s last recorded oil production was in 2018 65 barrels of oil and 22 thousand cubic feet of gas for the year. In April 2019 FRAM filed for bankruptcy according to a COGCC inspection report for one of the wells in Mesa County along Kannah Creek.

“Location should be a high priority when assigned to the OWP (Orphan Well Program) due to the proximity to residence and an active stream” the March 2021 report said.

FRAM emerged from bankruptcy in March but has been issued COGCC notices of violation this year for failing to report on well operations and for not performing mechanical integrity tests. The tests are required on wells once every five years. Some of the wells according to a complaint filed with the commission by WildEarth Guardians haven’t had a test since 2012.

The company did not reply to voicemail messages seeking comment. Its email address was no longer functioning.

An analysis done by the COGA of all 579 wells orphaned in Colorado found that almost a third belonged to six former operators who had had formal enforcement actions against them including PetroShare.

“When we looked at those operator traits they had a track record of being unresponsive to compliance issues” said Dave Kulmann a consultant who did the COGA analysis. “If you see this behavior and those 2 BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) wells there is a risk.”

Of the 186 orphaned wells the six companies owned 65% had no production in the previous three years being listed as shut-in or temporarily abandoned and all were classified as stripper wells.

“The true risk of becoming an orphan well is not just the well but more critically if the operator has compliance issues or is unwilling to address well issues” the COGA analysis said.

As it is the bulk of inactive wells are not in the hands of small fly-by-night drillers but some of the largest operators in the state.

Chevron’s Noble Energy in 2020 had according to the COGCC’s data1600 shut-in wells 20% of all the wells in the state in this category and 117 temporarily abandoned wells including the four on the Stephenses’ land 44% of the state total.

Noble’s most recent count puts the total for shut-in and abandoned wells closer to 1900 while it has 2400 producing wells. Noble also has about 700 wells producing 2 BOE a day or less.

The largest operator in the state Occidental Petroleum Corp. had 2112 shut-in wells and 253 temporarily abandoned wells.

Kulmann said that is actually a good thing these wells are in the hands of big operators like Chevron one of the world’s 10 largest oil producers.

“They are a big company that gives me comfort that they are not going to abandon wells to the state of Colorado” he said.

“The state needs to plan for the oil and gas industry not as we have known it in the past”

A 30-year-old Noble well now in the hands of Extraction Oil & Gas Co. part of a $125 million acquisition in 2014 sits in a broad sunflower-filled open space in Lafayette hemmed in here by suburban housing and there by light industry.

And on an early August day the well was in the process of being plugged its life officially ended. A workover rig with its 104-foot tower was already in position. On an open space trail a dog-walker ambled by and a jogger passed at a good clip.

Luke Hinrichs 38 Extraction’s workover supervisor who has overseen pretty much every one of the 435 wells the company has plugged since 2016 surveyed the scene.

“When you first turn up people are worried you are there to drill or frack” Hinrichs said. “You try to explain ‘No we’re plugging a well and we’ll be gone.”

While the drilling of new wells and fracking – which sends fluids down the bore under pressure to fracture rock and release oil and gas – can take several months plugging and remediating an old well site including hauling off old tanks and equipment cleaning soil and grading takes about three weeks Hinrichs said.

The workover rig is mobile and comes collapsed on the back of a truck trailer and pops up with its tower extending like a telescope. The actual plugging of the 7000-foot-deep old Noble well was set to use about 840 gallons of cement and take just about 20 minutes Hinrichs said.

Before that the workover rig has to pull up any piping and debris in the well and slide in tubing so the well can be flushed and pressurized with fresh water.

A large stack of pipe already pulled from the well was now sitting next to the rig and a big white tanker truck filled with water lumbered on to the site.

A gyro survey an instrument used to get an accurate downhole location of the wellbore is lowered into the well. Sometimes heat sensors are dropped in to develop heat logs or a downhole camera is used all aimed at getting a better understanding of the state of the well.

The plugging and abandonment plan has to be filed with and approved by the COGCC and is a public record.

One of his most challenging plugging jobs Hinrichs said was on a Weld County dairy farm where the well had been covered by “cow-pucky pond.” A dike had to be built around the well in the waste lagoon to get to it. “That was some fun” he said

When the crew – Extraction was using oil field service company Ranger Energy Services on this job – is ready to seal the Lafayette well an iron plug capped with cement will be placed at the bottom and cement will be pumped in.

The most expensive part of the process is removing the old tanks and equipment and cleaning up the site. “Taking out the tanks you can find old spills” Hinrichs said. “It’s the legacy stuff you have to contend with.”

Extraction said the cost of plugging and remediating a well like the one in Lafayette ranges between $80000 and $180000.

Similar plugging jobs are taking place across the Front Range. Between 2017 and 2020 Occidental Petroleum spent more than $100 million to plug and abandon 2224 wells while drilling 937 according to a filing with the COGCC.

Noble the second largest producer has plugged and remediated 1700 wells and associated facilities between 2018 and 2020 and has plans to seal 445 more wells in 2021.

Since 2017 the company said in comments to the COGCC that it has plugged six wells for every one it has drilled and spent $200 million on the program.

Most operators including Extraction depend on contracting with oil field service companies for plugging which could create a traffic jam if every company faces the same plugging deadline. Noble has 14 of its own workover crews the company said.

As for its large number of shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells Noble said in an email “We don’t believe low producing or inactive wells are a predictor of orphan-well risk.”

“Many of the company’s shut-in or temporarily abandoned wells are legacy vertical wells on lease positions acquired from other companies” Noble said. “Many of those will be plugged and removed as part of our horizontal development plans. “

That may address some but not all of the problems critics say. “The operators who are plugging the wells aren’t the ones we are most concerned about” Merlin the WildEarth Guardians attorney said. “The problem is the stripper wells.”

“The large companies aren’t plugging out of the goodness of their hearts” Merlin said. “By and large they are required to plug wells that could interfere with the drilling of new wells.”

In many ways the debate over the financial assurance rules is a debate over the financial health and fate of the industry.

“A healthy and growing oil and gas industry in Colorado will voluntarily plug far more older wells than any government program with ZERO cost to taxpayers” a coalition of industry groups said in comments to the COGCC.

But Sura the oil and gas attorney who represents municipalities environmental groups and property owners like the Stephenses said “this is an industry in decline we are never going to see the amount of production we saw in 2019.”

“Since they are an industry in decline they should start considering their asset retirements and the state needs to plan for the oil and gas industry not as we have known it in the past” he said.

In 2019 Colorado posted record production of 19.2 million barrels of oil and 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Production dropped nearly 11% in pandemic-ridden 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 production was down 25% year-over-year though industry representatives say they expect it to increase with the country’s economic rebound.

While not an international oil company like Chevron or Occidental the pending merger of Extraction with Bonanza Creek Energy and Crestone Peak Resources into Civitas Resources will create one of the largest Colorado operators with almost 2400 producing wells and 1000 shut-in and temporarily abandoned wells.

The three companies are also responsible for having plugged more than 1000 wells according to COGCC data. Extraction has plans to plug another 20 to 25 old wells before the end of the year for a total of 50 to 60 in 2021.

From the Extraction plugging job suburban development can be seen creeping over the horizon in neighboring Broomfield. In Lafayette the well plugging was ahead of growing suburbia but sometimes as in the case of Broomfield’s Anthem Highlands suburbia gets there first.

1 leaking well in a subdivision takes $500000 to resolve

A drive along Graham Peak Way in Broomfield’s Anthem Highlands development is a trip down one of the countless new suburban streets spreading across the old farm fields and prairies of the Front Range.

The byway is lined with large buff-colored homes with a basketball hoop in one driveway an American flag flying next door scooters strewn across a front path and one of those little green plastic men parents place on curbs in the hopes that motorists will take heed of their children at play. Maple oak and elm saplings still tethered to posts line the street.

At least that is the scene until the home of Wayne Bott 41 and his wife Bennett. Just beyond their house the land on either side of Graham Peak Way is vacant – a few rubble piles weeds wildflowers and hard packed dirt.

There are placards stuck along the street showing where the developer Richmond American Homes was ready to build one sign announcing: “Richmond America Lot 138 16321 Graham Way.”

New construction paused on these lots in the Anthem Highlands development of Broomfield because of methane leaking from a well capped decades ago. (Andy Colwell Special to The Colorado Sun)

It even had the type of home to be built – Plan D601 – a five- to seven-bedroom house with a three-car garage a formal dining room and a great room. “An entertainer’s dream” a brochure proclaims.

The home building was cut short when it was discovered that an old plugged oil and gas well now covered by Graham Peak Way was leaking methane and that the gas had saturated the soil in the area.

“The fact there was an old well may have been buried in all the real estate papers” Bott said. “But we didn’t know about it.”

The city found out about the problem well when it decided to have all the existing wells mainly old and many plugged tested after Extraction announced plans in 2017 to drill 139 new wells in Broomfield.

That is how in May 2019 ERO Resources the city’s consultant found the soil around the Davis 43-6 well now buried under the street was as much as 95% saturated with methane. It looked like the concrete plugs in the well drilled in 1994 and plugged in 2003 had not held.

“When the methane migrates up through the soil it replaces everything” said Mike Hickey head of the COGCC’s orphan well program. “It had years to accumulate.”

Broomfield officials put a freeze on building permits and turned to the state’s orphan well program for help. The concern was that the explosive gas could collect in basements.

In 2017 gas from a severed oil field line seeped into the basement of a home in Firestone leading to an explosion that destroyed the house and killed two people. Ten Anthem Highlands homes were tested for methane – all were negative.

There are 239 wells that need plugging on the state’s orphan well list and 535 orphan-well sites that need remediation.

The state has seized a little more than $2.7 million in bonds from defunct operators of these sites and a 2018 executive order by Gov. Jared Polis allocated $5 million to the orphan well program over two years. The money comes from industry fees and fines.

The COGCC’s strawman proposals would raise the orphan well fund to $10 million a year though a $200-a-well fee an operator would pay.

A commission analysis of orphan well plugging and remediation costs in the state program found the average price per well was $92710 with a range of $25500 to $291000.

Most of those wells however are in rural areas. “Remediating a well in the middle of a suburb is another story” Hickey said.

On Nov. 14 2019 not long after the Botts had moved in to their surprise a towering workover rig appeared in the middle of the roadway a few hundred feet down the street. There were fire trucks and police cars.

COGCC and Broomfield oil and gas inspectors were on site with infrared cameras to check for fugitive emissions. Air monitors were set up. “It was really some scene” said Hickey who oversaw the operation.

The Davis 43-6 well was buried under the asphalt and what the subdivision plans showed 8 feet of earthen fill had covered the well.

The crew had to dig through the tight compacted material and at 11 feet down they encountered a 2-inch pipe suspected of being attached to the well; a hydroexcavator a giant vacuum truck was used to expand the dig.

Finally 16 feet down they reached the well Hickey described as “a dark stinky hole.” The cement in the well had severely deteriorated.

“There were some plugs we were expecting to find that weren’t there that had fallen away degraded” Hickey said.

The workover rig which straddled the sidewalk set to its task first drilling down to clear old concrete and sliding extra metal casing into the well then a new concrete seal was pumped in. Repairs were made to a depth of 2500 feet. The job which was supposed to take two weeks was completed Dec. 8.

Then they waited for the methane to dissipate. The readings tended downward eventually got to single digits but the methane lingered.

This past June to speed the process Richmond American Homes paid to have trenches with vents built parallel to the sidewalks along the vacant stretch of Graham Peak Way. One of the test sites that had measured 3.4% methane on June 21 was down to 0.6% by June 26.

The city is still waiting to give Richmond American Homes which did not respond to email requests for comment the go-ahead for new homes.

Now all is quiet on Graham Peak Way. “I am glad all the construction is over” Bott said. “But you know they are going to start building homes whatever it takes.”

At a City Council briefing last spring Jack Denman Broomfield’s environmental consultant was asked if other municipalities were dealing with these issues or are doing methane soiling testing.

“Not only is this a new issue for the city and county I would pose it is a new issue for the oil and gas commission as well as many of the residential developments up and down or at least in the northern Front Range as residential development moves into legacy oil and gas wells” Denman said. “This is something new for the Front Range.”

And the final price tag of plugging and remediating Davis 43-6? Richmond American Homes spent $200000 on the trenches and vents according to the city and the COGCC spent nearly $300000 plugging. So dealing with this one well on a Front Range suburban street had cost about half a million dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Aug. 22 2021) – The U.S. Men’s National Team will play for fifth place at the NORCECA Continental Championship after beating Guatemala on Sunday in a classification match 3-1 (23-25 25-22 25-19 33-31).

The young U.S. team (3-2) of mostly college players will take on Dominican Republic (2-3) for the second time in the tournament in the fifth-place match on Monday at 1 p.m. PT. The U.S. Men beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 (25-18 23-25 25-18 26-24) in their pool play match on Aug. 19.

U.S. Head Coach Andy Read started an entirely new lineup against Guatemala. Sam Kobrine started at setter Camden Gianni and Will Rottman at the outsides Austin Wilmot and Merrick McHenry at middle Jalen Penrose at opposite and Mason Briggs at libero.

OFFICIAL STATISTICS * TEAM STATISTICS

“We used a whole different team” U.S. Head Coach Andy Read said. “We came with 14 players and one of our goals was to give everybody an extended play. There are so many young guys and they needed experience; they played great. I am so happy for our setter Sam Kobrine Camden Gianni everybody was out there. They trained hard and I liked how they played.

The U.S. led Guatemala in kills (67-35) blocks (10-7) and aces (5-1) but gave up 54 points on unforced errors while Guatemala committed 24. The U.S. hitting efficiency behind Kobrine was .437. Guatemala hit .280.

Camden Gianni led all scorers against Guatemala with 27 points on a match-high 25 kills (.545 hitting efficiency) one block and one ace.

“We were super confident of what we were putting out there on the court and I think some of the guys trusted their serve a little bit too much tonight and that’s why missed son many including me” Gianni said. “We did a good job in serve-receive and putting pressure on them in defense and coming out with the win.”

Among other U.S. scorers Penrose scored 14 points on 11 kills two aces and one block. McHenry scored 13 points on nine kills (.692) and a match-high four blocks. Rottman and Wilmot each scored 10 points on nine kills and one block.

Kobrine scored four points on two blocks and two aces and Keenan Sanders scored four points on kills as a substitute.

The water-reliant microchip manufacturing process is largely responsible for drawing global attention to the drought in Taiwan where TSMC has four foundries. This process also makes the famously dry American Southwest a less-than-intuitive locale for multibillion-dollar investments to manufacture such chips. But there is already an established semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in Arizona; the state has emerged as a U.S. “manufacturing hotspot” in the push to “insulate semiconductor supply from China” Fortune reported in February.

During an interview with CNBC Forrester Research vice president Glenn O’Donnell compared semiconductor manufacturing to an indoor swimming pool: “You need a lot [of water] to fill it but you don’t have to add much to keep it going. Also being in an enclosed space a lot of the water that evaporates can be captured with a dehumidifier and returned to the pool.” This comment suggests that water availability may not be an ongoing burden to the manufacturing process once volume production commences.

Also crucial for making semiconductors is access to affordable stable energy. In Taiwan the cost of electricity is at risk of increasing by as much as 25% by 2025 according to Bloomberg which reports: “the government's rigid denuclearization policy and emission reduction targets imply that more-expensive renewable electricity will be the only choice for manufacturers' surging energy needs.” In Arizona semiconductor manufacturers will have access to the U.S. power grid as well as renewable energy sources including solar.

Sourcing talent

With record demand and billion-dollar facilities on the horizon companies will need to be strategic about recruiting a capable workforce. Talent in the field is tough to find but not as tough in the Southwest as it would probably be in many other parts of the United States. Arizona has an established yet largely dormant semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and also an active semiconductor design market both of which are anticipated to streamline the U.S.’s imminent march back into chip manufacturing.

Phoenix has long been the unofficial microelectronic manufacturing hub of the United States and Andy Blye of the Phoenix Business Journal reports: “Phoenix is home to many other semiconductor companies as well. NXP ON Semiconductor Microchip and Broadcom all have employees here.” Companies in the process of establishing (or reestablishing) fabs in the American Southwest will likely source expertise necessary to run the highly anticipated foundries by either relocating talent or by drawing from the established semiconductor design workforce that already exists in cities such as Phoenix. Middle market semiconductor companies or those adjacent to this space would likely see waves of hiring by TSMC Intel and Samsung which could lure talent away or push wages higher

Additionally the chip shortage has spurred political action as this June blog post on the Semiconductor Industry Association’s website explains: “Bipartisan legislation introduced this week in the House would eliminate the counterproductive per-country cap on employment-based visas in favor of a fair ‘first come first served’ system providing U.S. semiconductor companies with greater access to top talent from around the world needed to compete and innovate.”

Future possibilities

It's important to remember that the rush for capable employees is still a ways off; TSMC’s wafer fabrication plant in Phoenix “is expected to start volume production in 2024” according to Reuters and “Intel expects the Arizona fabs to be operational sometime in 2023” Morningbrew.com reported in May. TSMC has committed $12 billion for a foundry in Phoenix with “construction slated to start next year.” And in May Reuters reported that TSMC may build up to five fabs in Arizona.

Although volume production manufacturing appears to be a few years away manufacturing-adjacent industries can be expected to gear up creating new opportunities for the American middle market. Mainly semiconductor equipment companies and suppliers packaging companies and testing shops should prepare for a wave of change over the next few years. This is a great time for these companies to determine how they will adapt to the reintroduction of large-scale volume production; shore up relationships with their own workforces contractors and existing supply chains; and set aside capital to allow for strategic agility.

The strategy to build resilient semiconductor supply chains for the future “must include taking defensive actions to protect our technological advantages” according to the White House’s supply chain review. “But we must also proactively invest in domestic production and R&D.”

With approved capital expenditure plans experienced workforces to tap potential eases forthcoming for employment-based visas and an ever-growing demand for chips the future appears bright for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. However the trickle-down effects of reemerging domestic chip production are still in large part many years away from having significant impact on the global chip market and the middle market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzYWhpLmNvbS9hancvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTQ0MTYyNDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Niche chip maker SkyWater plays key role in U.S. supply strategy | The Asahi Shimbun: Breaking News Japan News ...,"President Joe Biden holds up a silicon wafer as he participates virtually in the CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on April 12 2021 in Washington. (AP Photo)

BLOOMINGTON Minnesota--While U.S. presidents often seek to boost the nation's infrastructure such as highways roads and bridges President Joe Biden held a cutting-edge example in his hand.

In an online meeting from the White House in April with CEOs of semiconductor companies Biden held up an iridescent disk and said “Chips like the one I have here this is infrastructure.”

The CEOs participating in the meeting represented such major companies as Google Intel Hewlett-Packard and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s largest semiconductor foundry.

But the wafer that Biden held up was manufactured by SkyWater Technology Inc. based in Bloomington Minnesota.

Thomas Sonderman 58 SkyWater’s president and CEO said of that moment “It was a great honor and a sense of pride for all SkyWater employees.”

Sonderman participated in the online summit from his office here and reflected on that meeting in an interview in late May with The Asahi Shimbun.

SkyWater was a unique presence at the summit because it only has about 600 employees and its sales are less than 1 percent of Intel’s.

SkyWater was invited partially because of the increasingly fierce competition between the United States and China for supremacy in economic and military matters that will turn on advanced technology such as artificial intelligence and other areas that are heavily dependent on semiconductors.

Due to the key role semiconductors play national governments have taken the lead in trying to win the competition.

While the United States has placed emphasis on semiconductor research and development much of the actual production is consigned to companies in Taiwan and elsewhere.

But with the intensifying competition with China as well as the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic there has been increasing concern about the risk in being dependent on other nations for semiconductor manufacturing.

“Globalization is here” Sonderman said. “We are a global society and we need to recognize that but there's certain critical infrastructure that nations need to pay attention to.""

SkyWater is a major wafer fabrication facility known commonly as a wafer fab that supplies the U.S. military among others. More importantly it is the only U.S. investor-owned and U.S.-based fab.

That has now become a major strength for SkyWater as concerns are being raised about the safety of the semiconductor supply chain and due to the extreme importance placed on confidentiality by the U.S. military.

In a sense SkyWater represents the move to reclaim a dominant position in the semiconductor sector through the fusing of government military and private companies.

The Asahi Shimbun

STAKING OUT NICHE THROUGH 3-D CHIPS

To get a feel for what SkyWater was trying to achieve a reporter visited its Skytech Center in Bloomington.

Because electronic circuits now exist in a world measured in nanometers or one-millionth of a millimeter a powerful microscope was needed to view the maze-like structure of a chip.

John Spicer 63 executive vice president in charge of operations at SkyWater said “The whole landscape of going from the invention of this little microchip to where we're at today where there's millions of chips that do different things it's amazing to me.""

Employees are dressed in what appear to be space suits to ensure cleanliness of the plant facility. And the Skytech Center has been designed to keep dust particles to an extreme minimum.

The center was constructed as an advanced research and development facility with funds from the Pentagon and its affiliated agency the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

The research at the center is not only moving away from embedding microscopic electronic circuits on a flat surface but also from the silicon used to make the chips. Instead carbon nanotubes are being used to in effect stack the chips into a 3-D form.

SkyWater CEO Sonderman called what was being done at the Skytech Center “a resetting of Moore's Law.""

Gordon Moore a co-founder of Intel famously predicted in the mid-1960s that the number of transistors on a chip would double about every 18 to 24 months. That has since been known as Moore’s Law.

The competition in the miniaturization of chips has led to the dominance in the semiconductor manufacturing sector by TSMC.

No longer able to compete many U.S. companies have instead focused on research and development as well as chip design rather than manufacturing.

The smaller the width of circuits the more transistors can be jammed into a chip improving its performance. Because TSMC has succeeded in producing the most advanced semiconductors with circuit widths of less than 10 nanometers Taiwan now accounts for about 92 percent of all the chips of that size produced in the world.

And while TSMC is now seeking to create chips with circuit widths of 3 nanometers the main chips produced by SkyWater have widths of 90 nanometers.

Given that difference SkyWater had to find a new area in which it could compete and came up with the revolutionary 3-D stacking technology.

The Asahi Shimbun

Clearly in SkyWater’s corner was the U.S. military which had long held concerns about the globalization of the semiconductor industry. It is now said that to complete a typical chip parts and other materials have to cross national borders about 70 times before the final product is manufactured.

That “just-in-time” supply chain has in turn been a key source of global economic growth.

But major confusion can erupt if that supply chain is disrupted due to natural disasters or other factors.

And there are especially strong concerns within the U.S. government and Congress about the excessive dependence on TSMC for advanced semiconductor production.

A major reason is that Taiwan is at the core of the confrontation between the United States and China. If the supply of semiconductors should be disrupted by a military skirmish the effects on the U.S. economy and military strategy would be unimaginable.

Ever since its birth the semiconductor industry has been closely linked with military technology as well as space and aeronautical development.

DARPA has played a vital role in developing major postwar technology such as the internet. It also provided funds to Moderna Inc. after it was established in 2010. The pharmaceutical company has now developed one of the COVID-19 vaccines in wide use around the world.

SkyWater has been working closely with the U.S. military since 2017 when it received certification to work with it. The following year DARPA approved a joint project between SkyWater and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research into 3-D chips.

Since 2019 the company has been receiving as much as $170 million (about 19 billion yen) from the U.S. Department of Defense for the production of semiconductors capable of withstanding high levels of radiation in space.

Sonderman has no doubt that the support provided by the U.S. government and military had been vital in producing positive results.

“While we're a small company we know how to make public-private partnerships work"" he said.

NATIONS WORKING TO PROP UP CHIP INDUSTRIES

Semiconductors are considered the foundation that will determine which nation comes out on top in economic and military competition centered on such key technologies as artificial intelligence and high-speed communications.

In a sense semiconductors will be for the 21st century what petroleum was to the previous century.

While the novel coronavirus pandemic led to sudden economic slowdowns in 2020 semiconductor demand was up particularly for computers that were in sudden need with the increase of teleworking. And while semiconductor demand for use in automobiles was initially expected to be down there was actually a much stronger recovery.

The semiconductor supply was hurt this year due to a fire at a plant of the major Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Renesas Electronics Corp.

According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics global sales of semiconductors for 2021 is being estimated at $527.2 billion (about 58 trillion yen) an expected increase of 20 percent over last year.

However various nations have begun implementing industrial policies to rebuild the global supply chain in a manner advantageous to them.

Under President Donald Trump the United States strengthened export restrictions on semiconductors to China. The Biden administration maintained that policy but there has been growing concerns in Washington due to the chaos in supply brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to reinforcing cooperative efforts with allies the U.S. Senate in July passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act which would set aside $52 billion to strengthen domestic semiconductor production and the supply chain.

Similar large support measures for the semiconductor industry are being pushed in Europe South Korea Taiwan and China. In June Japan also came out with a strategy to reinforce the domestic production base for semiconductors under a state project.

But some experts have expressed skepticism at whether such measures will have the desired effect.

For example China is said to have provided about $200 billion over a decade in subsidies that were not always well-defined in terms of actual purpose. Even after such expenditures China’s competitiveness in the semiconductor industry lags behind the United States and Taiwan.

T.J. Rodgers 73 the founder of Cypress Semiconductor pointed to the inefficiencies and slow decision making on the part of governments and said “I've always looked at government as an interference not a help not a partnership.”

CRAFTSMEN'S SKILLS DETERMINE QUALITY

The competitiveness of each nation’s semiconductor sector can be said to have developed by companies employing a diverse workforce as well as taking advantage of the globalization symbolized by a huge overseas market.

But while SkyWater is a 100-percent American company just a few minutes’ drive away is the plant of Polar Semiconductor Inc. affiliated with Sanken Electric Co. a major Japanese semiconductor company.

Surya Iyer 52 the vice president of operations and quality at Polar Semiconductor believes other factors also play a role in a successful semiconductor industry. Originally from India Iyer pointed to craftsmen’s skills on the plant floor as well as a culture that encourages free thinking along with cooperation with other individuals and nations based on trust.

A visitor to the Polar Semiconductor plant gets the impression of being on a spaceship because not only is the plant interior painted white but the employees also wear white uniforms. Efficient plant operations are due in part to the cooperation from industrial robots that transport wafers within the well-organized plant.

There are said to be between 400 and 1400 steps in the production of wafers including applying oxide film to the surface and covering it with a photosensitizing agent. Applying photography principles circuit patterns laid out on a glass plate are etched onto wafers by applying ultraviolet light to the pattern. Repeating such steps with precision produces the extremely fine electronic circuits.

The various steps reminded the reporter of the process used in Wajima lacquerware a subject covered in my early days as a journalist.

“A company could say ‘I'm going to stop supplying you with this’"" Iyer said. ""I expect those kind of problems to be zero to very small where businesses are free to do what they want. A supply chain is more resilient if there are options in democratic countries.”

The team at IIT-Bombay partnered with IIT-Delhi SETS Chennai and Defence Research and Development Organisation for hardware encryption. (HT FILE)

Memory is a critical aspect of the internet-of-things (IoT) a network of objects embedded with sensors or chips for exchange of data over a wireless network without the intervention of humans. Memories are used to customise chips by giving them user-specific storage of digital data. IoT connects tiny chips which are all identical but distinguished by an identity (a barcode) stored in the memory. This data is stored within metal-insulator-metal (MIM) memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit memory chip.

At a time when IoT is disrupting the semiconductor industry worldwide the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem led by Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) Mohali department of space Government of India had to import the main technology from abroad.

However a team of researchers at IIT-B led by Udayan Ganguly professor in the department of electrical engineering along with SCL have successfully demonstrated a CMOS-180nm-based 8-bit memory technology. This technology is adopted for production.

Ideally silicon chips (like thermometers) should be identical but manufacturing variations produce tiny offsets (such as errors in temperatures) which are revealed upon testing. This renders a large fraction of chips useless. The technology designed by the IIT-B team enables storing this tiny offset correction in memory once and applying it to the output afterward to make each imperfect chip perfect.

Using this method generic chips can now be designed and make application-specific offsets added to make expensive custom chip design redundant saving time and money for the user.

“One out of 100 ideas makes the journey from lab to fab. The exacting process of exceeding 95% yield requires an unrelenting multi-disciplinary team supported by a world-class R&D infrastructure to form an enduring collaboration. Once such successful technology opens possibilities of touching countless lives in this case through chips with a tiny memory” said Ganguly.

This one-time programmable (OTP) memory is based on ultra-thin deposited silicon dioxide instead of the existing gate oxide-based OTP technology. In contrast to the high voltage required by gate oxide breakdown (a popular OTP memory) IIT-B’s memory chip requires less power and chip-area as the need for boosted voltage supply is avoided.

“Memory technology is critical to data security. It is essential for present and future Indian Fabs. To infuse innovation translating memory technology from research to manufacturing is the key to compete globally and serve locally to establish a vibrant semiconductor ecosystem. The OTP Memory Technology Adoption for Trimming Application by the joint IIT-B-SCL Chandigarh team is a pioneering step in this direction. It will be a game changer by enabling secure memory and encryption hardware for the country” said VK Saraswat member of NITI Aayog.

The project was initiated by the department of science and technology’s (DST) Intensification of Research in High Priority Area (IRHPA). Aspects of the work were funded by DST’s Nanoelectronics Network for Research and Applications (NNetRA) DST-Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and office of PSA for hardware security. The team at IIT-B partnered with IIT-Delhi SETS Chennai and Defence Research and Development Organisation for hardware encryption.

“The success of the Digital India initiative by the Government of India has underpinnings in our country’s ability to manufacture electronics hardware. The focus on electronics hardware including integrated circuits or chips is key to strengthen R&D primarily in space and defence sectors. Development of standard product design or IP development and semiconductor manufacturing are increasingly important. Improving India’s participation in this area is a major priority for R&D in India. The partnership between IIT-B and SCL to establish this memory technology for the first time demonstrates the augmented potential for semiconductor research in the country” said K Vijay Raghavan principal scientific adviser (PSA) to the Government of India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9hcmUtcmFkaW9hY3RpdmUtZGlhbW9uZC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtdGhlLXNvbHV0aW9uLXRvLW51Y2xlYXItd2FzdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Radioactive Diamond Batteries the Solution to Nuclear Waste?,"Beta particles contain nuclear energy that can be converted into electric energy through a semiconductor.

A typical betavoltaic cell consists of thin layers of radioactive material placed between semiconductors. As the nuclear material decays it emits beta particles that knock electrons loose in the semiconductor creating an electric current.

However the power density of the radioactive source is lower the further it is from the semiconductor. On top of this because beta particles are randomly emitted in all directions only a small number of them will hit the semiconductor and only a small number of those will be converted into electricity. This means that nuclear batteries are much less efficient than other types of batteries. This is where the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) comes in.

The radioactive diamond batteries are made using a process called chemical vapor deposition which is widely used for artificial diamond manufacture. It uses a mixture of hydrogen and methane plasma to grow diamond films at very high temperatures. Researchers have modified the CVD process to grow radioactive diamonds by using a radioactive methane containing the radioactive isotope Carbon-14 which is found on irradiated reactor graphite blocks."

Quoting unnamed sources the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported Friday that the Netanyahus continued on to Hawaii after flying to San Francisco for a two-week vacation in the United States.

Ellison the cofounder and chairman of Oracle Corporation purchased 98 percent of Lanai in 2012 for a reported $300 million.

A response sent to the newspaper on Netanyahu’s behalf insisted his family was covering the cost of the trip.

“There is no prohibition on former prime minister Netanyahu meeting with a witness. The list of witnesses includes hundreds of people including his lawyers and members of his party with who he is in constant contact” the statement said.

Netanyahu is on trial for charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases as well as bribery in one of them. He denies wrongdoing.

Ellison is one of several hundred prosecution witnesses in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. His name reportedly came up in two of the cases and a report last year said he lobbied and convinced Israeli mogul Arnon Milchan to drop his lawyer so Netanyahu could hire him.

Netanyahu and his family flew abroad to vacation last week despite the Health Ministry and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urging Israelis to avoid non-essential overseas travel amid surging COVID-19 cases in Israel and elsewhere. Officials have also warned of new coronavirus variants entering the country.

Under current Health Ministry guidelines the Netanyahus will be required to quarantine for a week upon returning.

Also Friday Channel 12 news revealed that Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli — whose ministry has a leading role in the coronavirus policies at Ben Gurion Airport — also traveled to America.

The unsourced report said Michaeli’s staff and Labor party members tried unsuccessfully to convince her to reconsider saying the trip will likely get negative coverage and be seen as belittling the public.

“The minister will comply with all necessary coronavirus guidelines” her office said in response.

After facing public criticism Michael revealed her trip was not a vacation but was undertaken for the purpose of meeting her first child newly born through surrogacy.

Michaeli will also have to self-isolate when she gets back to the country as nearly all travelers do as part of stricter quarantine rules that took effect this week.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The overseas drop was a very strong 26% with some markets seeing increases and amid No. 1 openings in Brazil and Spain. The worldwide gross including domestic‘s great hold has topped the century mark with $112M through Sunday.

As we noted last weekend reviews and word of mouth are propelling Free Guy —

as well as a turn in the weather in some parts of Northern Europe — and overseas legs can be expected with an ultimate multiple well above 4. What’s more Free Guy on Friday scored a China release date (August 27) meaning it will be only the second Hollywood title to enter the market after this weekend’s Luca (more on that below). Disney has also kept spending on Free Guy and targeted a campaign to disrupt against Warner Bros’ The Suicide Squad. As a piece of new IP and with some markets still in flux and some folks still wary of heading to the cinemas Free Guy was not anticipated to be a rush-out. We should look forward to strong holds.

The Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($9.8M) Russia ($6.1M) France ($2.7M) Japan ($2.7M) and Saudi Arabia ($2.3M). The IMAX total is $5.7M global.

Normally we’d expect one of the bigger markets on Free Guy to be Korea but there’s a phenomenon there that’s impacting Hollywood titles. This session two studio entries trailed three local pictures (one new and two holdovers). In fact no new Hollywood movie has taken a No. 1 spot across any weekend in August which is unusual — even with the undeniable strength of Korea’s homegrown industry. This appears to be a result of a move by the Korea Theater Association which includes top exhibition chains CGV Lotte and Megabox to incentivize distributors to release big-budget local titles as the market hit a lull earlier this summer.

Instead of the normal 50/50 split between theaters and distributors cinemas are not taking any proceeds until the box office reaches 50% of a film’s production budget. The Korea Herald reported this was the case with recent hits Sinkhole and Escape From Mogadishu (No. 2 and 3 this weekend respectively) while it is not clear if it applies to this frame’s top draw action thriller Hostage: Missing Celebrity which opened at No. 1 with $3.8M. The screen counts are also heavily weighted to the local titles ranging from 960-1200+. Conversely new studio pics Old and Paw Patrol: The Movie were at 453 and 240 locations respectively. Korea is a very significant market but is particular in that distributors also own theater chains. For example Mogadishu is released by Lotte and Sinkhole by Megabox’s Showbox.

Turning back to overall action Paramount/Nickelodeon/Spin Master’s Paw Patrol: The Movie had a fierce early showing in six markets last session and kept up the overseas momentum this weekend dropping by just 18%. This session added 33 new markets and wagged up a further $12.8M for a $21.5M offshore cume to date. The like-for-like result is 23% above My Little Pony and 102% over Playmobil: The Movie. Globally the pups have grossed $34.5M.

In other highlights having scored the first release slot for a Hollywood movie since June Disney/Pixar’s Luca settled for a second place $5M start in China behind local holdover Raging Fire. The market is experiencing some closures and capacity restrictions and Pixar pics can be hit and miss there although last Christmas’ Soul started out soft and held very well to final at RMB 376M ($58M). Luca’s opening is 9% below Soul and 83% ahead of Onward.

Meanwhile Universal’s F9 is closing in on the $700M mark at the global box office with $696.4M through Sunday and Paramount’s A Quiet Place Part II is currently at $296.3M with another eight markets opening next weekend so eyeing the $300M milestone.

In new play Warner Bros future romance noir Reminiscence (which also went out on HBO Max domestically) debuted in 48 offshore markets which rep 30% of the landscape. The start was $3M with the best results coming from the Middle East. Along with the soft domestic start on this adult-skewing Hugh Jackman-starrer the global cume is $5M. There are 18 more markets to come next session including France Germany Italy Russia Spain and Korea.

Here’s a closer look at holdover play through this weekend:

FREE GUY

‘Free Guy’ Disney As noted above the Ryan Reynolds-starrer from Shawn Levy added $17.1M from 46 markets for a $53.1M cume to date. The overseas drop was a very strong 26% and with domestic’s strong hold the worldwide gross has topped the century mark landing at $112M through Sunday.

Regionally Free Guy dropped 22% in Europe and 26% in Latin America. The Netherlands was up 14% Singapore (the only South East Asian market currently open) increased 5%; France dropped just 2% and Germany was off by a slight 10%. Germany has rebounded well of late although on Monday it adds the health pass requirement which we’ve seen negatively impact box office in France and Italy in the past few weeks.

Free Guy is still No. 1 in the UK and Australia (the latter with about 65% of the country’s box office shut down) and in Brazil bowed 26% ahead of Jungle Cruise and 79% above Cruella.

The Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($9.8M) Russia ($6.1M) France ($2.7M) Japan ($2.7M) and Saudi Arabia ($2.3M). The IMAX total is $5.7M global.

PAW PATROL: THE MOVIE

‘Paw Patrol: The Movie’ Paramount Paramount/Nickelodeon/Spin Master’s feature transfer also showed great staying power with an 18% drop in markets that opened last frame and adding $12.8M from a total 39 for a $21.5M offshore cume to date. In highlights Germany opened at No. 1 with a fantastic $2.6M (including previews) at 578 locations. Netherlands gave the pups a No. 2 start with $1.1M at 133. Mexico was a No. 1 bow-wow with $864K at 785. Following its No. 1 launch in France last weekend Paw Patrol (or La Pat’ Patrouille as it’s known locally) dropped by just 21% for a $4.9M cume to date. The UK also dipped by just 21% for a $6.1M cume. Majors to come next week are Russia and Spain followed by Brazil and Australia in September.

THE SUICIDE SQUAD

Warner Bros/DC’s The Suicide Squad added $8.7M in 73 markets for a $91.5M overseas cume and $140.8M global. The UK by far leads all play at $17M followed by Russia ($8.4M) France ($5.2M) Germany ($4.9M) and Mexico ($4.3M). There are five markets to go.

THE BOSS BABY: FAMILY BUSINESS

Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby: Family Business added $8.4M across 27 markets this weekend notably bowing in Russia and France. In the former the No. 1 $5.3M start including strong previews is the best animated opening of the pandemic. France which has shown that it’s keen on family films right now (Paw Patrol had a great No. 1 start there last session) welcomed Boss Baby 2 at No. 2 with $2M behind local opener Bac Nord. The offshore cume is now $35.6M for $92.1M worldwide. Australia Italy Germany the UK and Japan are still to come.

F9

Universal F9 is now thisclose to topping $700M at the global box office with $696.4M through Sunday. The latest in the Universal saga finally motored its way to Italy with a No. 1 $3.1M bow above Hobbs & Shaw (including previews). However the introduction of the health pass in the market is still impacting ticket sales overall and particularly in the demo. Japan was the top holdover showing great tenacity after three weekends with a $25M cume. Germany had a terrific 26% drop and has grossed $20.7M to date surpassing Hobbs & Shaw. The overseas weekend was $7.3M for an international cume of $524M.

LUCA

‘Luca’ Disney/Pixar Luca kicked off in China at No. 2 with $5M in the first Hollywood showing since June. Social and critical scores are a 9.1 on Maoyan (versus Soul’s 9.2) and a 7.3 on Douban (Soul was an 8.8). As noted above Pixar can be hit and miss in China. Luca is currently No. 2 in presales for Monday and Tuesday and school vacations continue until September 1 while Covid cases are dropping (about 30% of sites are currently closed). Maoyan upped its final projection on Luca throughout the weekend but is still calling it low at RMB 86.5M ($13.3M).

JUNGLE CRUISE

Disney’s Jungle Cruise again posted good mid-weeks and saw a 41% drop from its third session to $4.1M from 49 markets. A shift in the weather helped Netherlands (+10%) and Belgium (+6%) increase. The Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt-starrer has an international cume of $81.2M and a global total of $173.7M to date. The Top 5 are the UK ($13.9M) Russia ($8M) Japan ($6.8M) France ($6M) and Saudi Arabia ($3.6M).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I4NWE4M2Q3LWZjMDEtNDBkOS1hYjFiLWY2ZGVjNWMxYjVhZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goal.com owner nets Italy's top football site,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Buzz suggests that the duo will share screen again and this time it will be for the remake of a popular Southern film. The 2020 film 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo' was a huge hit on the box office and like every other popular Southern film this one is also being planned for a Hindi remake.

The project was supposed to go on floors by June but since that could not happen makers are hoping to start the film by November. The role offered to Kriti was originally played by Pooja Hegde while Kartik Aaryan's character was originally played by Allu Arjun. The film will be directed by Rohit Dhawan and it'll be bankrolled by Allu Arvind Aman Gill and S Radha Krishna.

“What is your government’s position on company compulsory vaccination? This is against the right to freedom” the Opposition Leader said.

“Our human right is fundamental but you must also know that this right is also a qualified right. You must exercise your right within the context of the right of another person next to you” said PM Marape.

“The other person who is operating in the same space as you who sits on the same plane with you who works in the workspace with you who shares the same public space with you; that person also has the same right to be protected from COVID-19.

“Workplace safety is important not only for COVID-19 but in all areas. If you go into a mining company for example you must follow the safety requirement of that workplace. Responsibility for what is good for them we have passed this back to them. This is not something we are making up or are being secretive about.

“I understand fully and I am among those who subscribe to fundamental rights but that right is a qualified right within the context of our responsibility.”

Prime Minister Marape continued to reiterate Government stand something he has been doing over the past weeks on vaccination in PNG.

“Our policy on vaccination is clear: Vaccination is not compulsory. But the responsibility is on the Government to make vaccination available throughout the country knowing that COVID-19 is a real threat.

“For us in Parliament one Member of Parliament has already died. So is a staff member of Parliament. When we look at the number of deaths in the country and across the world COVID-19 is a real threat.

“We will not be a responsible government if we do not act. Vaccination is available; four of them approved by the World Health Organisation.

“Fiji for instance has compulsory vaccinations but not us. But the companies have their right; they operate on the companies Act; they also operate under the Health & Safety Act. They have the right to decide what is safe for their companies” the Prime Minister said.

Environment and Conversation Minister Wera Mori interjecting with a Point of Order added to the clarification for the Opposition Leader:

“With due respect to the Leader of the Opposition: if he had listened carefully he would have heard that the Prime Minister had adequately answered the question. In any mining setting of which I have been a part of for over two-and-a-half decades mine safety takes precedence over any other issues. No one including the Queen of England will compromise mine safety.

The Member for Ijivitari Richard Masere added: “Companies have company policies. I do not know when companies impose company policies on things such as the chewing of betelnut and smoking. We do not raise it on this floor of Parliament. This is important to protect their employees and customers from lawsuits.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZ2xpdHouY29tL2FtaWQtb3R0LXBsYW5zLXJ1bW91ci1mbG9hdHMtYWJvdXQtbG92ZS1zdG9yeS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtdGFtaWwtbmV3cy0yOTM0NzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amid OTT plans rumour floats about 'Love Story' release date - Tamil News,"'Love Story' starring Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi is set to hit the screens on September 10 (for Vinayaka Chavithi). This date was announced earlier this week.

As per the latest buzz in the industry the dance-based romantic drama might either come early or be postponed. Reason? September 10 is going to see the OTT release of Nani's 'Tuck Jagadish' (on Amazon Prime) and Nithiin's 'Maestro' (on Hotstar).

The belief is that the makers of 'Love Story' don't want to lose out on box office collections to the two OTT releases especially with Nani's movie. Already the Telangana Theatres Association has raised its voice against the clash between 'Love Story' and 'Tuck Jagadish'. They have already demanded that producers should ask OTT platforms not to release movies on OTT for festivals and weekends so that the theatrical business is not affected negatively.

Clarity over the release date of 'Love Story' will emerge soon. One thing is for sure. September will be a good month for the audience who have a number of interesting options on the platter."

Subsequent efforts secured instead the nickname “Sir Sell-out” and over the past week the moniker has had quite an airing. Rudd’s deal to sell the FTSE 250 defence and aerospace contractor Meggitt to its US rival Parker Hannifin for £6.3bn marks his seventh mega-deal and the second in a year. It has also landed him in the middle of a row about defence and the national interest.

To complicate matters Rudd now has “a dogfight” on his hands says The Sunday Times. The mooted deal has triggered a higher £7bn offer from a private-equity-style outfit named TransDigmalso American. Rudd has always nailed his colours to achieving the best price for shareholders. Now he maintains that were a suitor to try and win Meggitt on price alone ministers must step in. Parker’s bid as he points out includes legally binding commitments to invest in Meggitt’s Coventry HQ and maintain or grow spending on research and development.

The Thatcherite go-go years

A “bluff and forthright” captain of industry of the old school Derby-born Rudd 74 has always divided opinion. Many view him as an “exceptional dealmaker” says the Daily Mail; others as “the man who sold Britain”. He has certainly always been a man in a hurry. The son of a weights-and-measures inspector he was academically promising but left grammar school before his 16th birthday to join a firm of Midlands accountants. Rudd gained his commercial education from the firm’s industrial clients. “I observed who was successful and who wasn’t – and why.” He moved on to become a troubleshooter for the holding company London & Northern but didn’t stay long. “I was always a flitterer” he later told Management Today. “I was never interested in the boring bit of running a company. I was always interested in the angles.” Newly married he headed to the industrial heartlands of south Wales made a fortune in property development and then bought a local company with a clapped-out foundry Williams Engineering. Rudd and his business partner Brian McGowan “transformed Williams into a Thatcher-era go-go stock” says The Sunday Times taking advantage of the 1980s industrial recession to snap up companies on the cheap. At its peak assets included Yale and Chubb Polycell Rawlplugs Cuprinol and Crown Paints. But he saw the writing on the wall for conglomerates early and in 2000 broke Williams up.

Spending more time with wine

The move left Rudd free to do what he likes most: chairing companies and wringing the best value out of them. By the mid-2000s his reputation for disposals preceded him says Management Today. It became a “joke” that shares in Rudd’s companies were always “a buy” because he’d soon be selling up. He pushed through deals despite strong opposition and negative feedback from analysts. There were a few close shaves notably in 2007 when as deputy chairman of Barclays he championed a giant deal to buy the Dutch bank ABN Amro. Fortunately for him RBS got there first.

Boots Invensys BAA Signature… Many of Rudds’ deals and break-ups are still raked over by those accusing him of “leaving UK plc a poorer place”. Rudd isn’t fussed says The Sunday Times. But Meggitt looks like his swansong. Rudd wants to spend more time at his South African vineyard perfecting his chenin blanc.

He's the former Chancellor who gave up editorship of the Evening Standard and a string of high-profile jobs to make his fortune in the City. But George Osborne's new career as an investment banker appears to have got off to an extremely slow start. Robey Warshaw the high-profile firm he joined in April has so far missed out entirely on the summer takeover boom in the City according to analysis by The Mail on Sunday and data firm Refinitiv.

Research shows the prestigious boutique adviser hasn't worked on a single publicly announced deal since Osborne officially started work there. Robey Warshaw's last publicly announced deals were in March when it advised National Grid on its £14.2billion purchase of electricity giant Western Power Distribution and £3.9billion sale of Rhode Island-based The Narragansett Electric Company.

Since then private equity companies have swooped on dozens of companies – most recently supermarket chain Morrisons and British defence group Ultra Electronics.

That has left Robey Warshaw tenth in the Refinitiv merger and acquisition league table for topearning corporate finance advisory firms in deals involving British companies this year. In previous years it has appeared higher alongside US giants Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. This year has been one of the busiest for UK takeovers since the credit boom of 2007. Morrisons is in a £7billion tussle between a private equity consortium led by ex-Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy and a group of investors backed by SoftBank an investment group led by maverick Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son.

Meanwhile FTSE 250-listed defence group Meggitt is the focus of a £7billion dogfight between two US engineering giants: Parker Hannifin Corporation and TransDigm.

And FTSE 100-listed cybersecurity firm Avast recently agreed to be bought by US business NortonLifeLock for £6.2billion.

Goldman Sachs is top of the table. The US bank – whose London-based dealmaking department is led by financier Anthony Gutman and Mark Sorrell son of WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell – has advised on 65 deals worth £89billion.

JPMorgan is second and Bank of America third in the Refinitiv rankings. The top British advisory firms are NM Rothschild in fourth and Barclays in sixth.

A source close to Robey Warshaw pointed out that most of this summer's deals have been for 'mid-sized companies' and are being led by private equity investors adding: 'That's not what Robey Warshaw really does – it mainly works for extremely large publicly-listed corporations. It's still very early days [for George Osborne]. Big deals can take years to put together.' Osborne is understood to be on leave after the birth of his month-old son Beau.

Professor Scott Moeller a former Deutsche Bank investment banker and now head of the M&A Research Centre at The Business School at London University added: 'There has been a tendency this year for buyers to tighten their relationships with the banks financing the deals. This is not something that boutiques [such as Robey Warshaw] can provide as they don't have the balance sheets to [finance] deals.'

Osborne joined Robey Warshaw to great fanfare after editing the Evening Standard and working one day a week at fund management firm BlackRock for £650000 a year.

At one stage in 2018 he reportedly had nine jobs including chairing the Northern Powerhouse Partnership think tank and advising Exor the owner of Juventus the Italian football club.

Osborne was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016.

Robey Warshaw was set up in 2013 by Sir Simon Robey a former Morgan Stanley banker and former chairman of the Royal Opera House and Simon Warshaw a former UBS banker.

The firm has worked on some of the largest takeover deals of the past decade. It advised SAB Miller on its £75billion takeover by brewing titan Anheuser-Busch InBev and resources firm BG Group on its £47billion sale to Shell.

Robey Warshaw also advised Comcast on its £30billion takeover of Sky three years ago and the London Stock Exchange's £20billion takeover of data group Refinitiv.

Last year the three main partners – Robey Warshaw and Philip Apostolides – shared a reported £17million in remuneration. Since 2013 the trio have shared more than £200million in remuneration.

Senior City bankers said Osborne was brought in to use his network of contacts to lure foreign firms interested in buying British businesses. He could yet be in line for similar rewards if he's successful. Robey Warshaw declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,

PayPal has launched its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. PayPal

LONDON — PayPal is launching its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. The U.S. online payments giant said Monday it would let British customers buy hold and sell digital currencies starting this week. It marks the the first international expansion of PayPal's crypto product which first launched in the U.S. in October last year. ""It has been doing really well in the U.S."" Jose Fernandez da Ponte PayPal's general manager for blockchain crypto and digital currencies told CNBC. ""We expect it's going to do well in the U.K."" PayPal's crypto feature lets customers buy or sell bitcoin  bitcoin cash  ethereum or litecoin with as little as £1. Users can also track crypto prices in real-time and find educational content on the market. Like the U.S. version of the product PayPal is relying on Paxos a New York-regulated digital currency company to enable crypto buying and selling in the U.K. PayPal said it has engaged with relevant U.K. regulators to launch the service.

A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority Britain's financial services watchdog was not immediately available for comment on the announcement.

Growing adoption

PayPal's crypto service is similar to one from U.K. fintech firm Revolut. As is the case with Revolut PayPal users can't move their crypto holdings outside the app. Although Revolut recently started testing a feature that lets users withdraw bitcoin to their own personal wallets. PayPal says its foray into crypto is about making it easier for people to participate in the market. ""The tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that"" da Ponte said. ""Having that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point."" The payments processor is one of many large companies taking a leap into the mostly unregulated world of cryptocurrencies. Despite ongoing concerns about price volatility consumer protection and potential money laundering in the industry major firms including Mastercard  Tesla and Facebook have been warming to crypto lately.

Bitcoin the world's biggest digital currency hit a record high of nearly $65000 in April before tumbling below $30000 in July as Chinese regulators extended a crackdown on the market. It has since recovered to a price of over $50000. While PayPal started with crypto trading the company is betting digital currencies will take a greater role in e-commerce in the long run. Earlier this year PayPal started letting U.S. consumers use crypto to pay at millions of its online merchants globally. The firm also expanded crypto buying and selling to Venmo its popular mobile wallet. ""We definitely have ambitions to continue to expand the product range in the U.S. the U.K. and other markets"" da Ponte said. ""We are very deliberate about starting with initial functionality and then we'll see where the market is going to take us. Different markets have different appetite for products.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM5OGM1ZmEyLThlZTUtNGVhYS05ZmU3LTA0YmI0ZWY5OTZlNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal's Dan Schulman on seizing the opportunities in digital payments,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The website which allowed sex workers to enter the so-called creator economy with its popular direct-to-consumer subscription platform did $2 billion in sales in 2020 and took a 20% cut of the action according to Bloomberg which first reported the news of the pivot away from porn.

Now OnlyFans plans to ban all videos featuring “sexually explicit conduct” starting Oct. 1. While the definition of sexually explicit content is still undefined (the company says some nude photos and videos will be allowed) hardcore porn on the platform seems unlikely to survive the new policy. It’s unclear if the new policy will make illegal content such as child pornography any easier to eliminate.

But the decision to remove OnlyFan’s most popular product was not a result of legal pressure according to the company. The decision was made in order “to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers” an OnlyFans spokesperson wrote by email.

The change marks a growing trend where financial services firms such as credit card and payment processors effectively decide what content is allowed or prohibited on internet platforms. For creators who depend on internet platforms for their income especially adult performers the sudden change represents a cautionary tale as the gatekeepers of the creator economy take shape.

Backpage and Pornhub fell first

Last year Visa and Mastercard cut ties with PornHub the online porn giant over allegations detailed by The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof that it didn’t aptly stop the spread of videos showing child abuse and non-consensual sex. PayPal had cut the site off the year before. After credit card companies cut ties the service turned to cryptocurrencies for transactions. Today PornHub users can only pay for exclusive content (similar to OnlyFans) with a direct bank account transaction or via cryptocurrency handled by the company Cosmo Payment. Something similar happened to Backpage an online classified ad business popular with sex workers which was cut off by credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in 2015 before being shut down by US authorities in 2018.

Adult performers claimed decisions like these don’t help abuse victims and further ostracize sex workers looking for legitimate platforms to make money. Alana Evans president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild (APAG) wrote on Aug. 20 that one of the “real reasons” that OnlyFans changed its tune was pressure from credit card company Mastercard. In the past Digital rights activists like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have claimed that payment companies are trying to police speech online while the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized PayPal and Venmo’s ban on sex work for endangering already vulnerable populations.

OnlyFans now faces similar allegations to those leveled against PornHub: A recent BBC investigation showed that OnlyFans gave repeated warnings to creators who posted illegal content but did not ban them on the first offense. So far Visa Mastercard and other credit card companies as well as the online payment processor Stripe which powers other creator platforms like Substack have maintained ties with OnlyFans.

But it was clear change was coming.

Mastercard announced a new policy directed at adult content due to take effect on October 15. Under the new rules adult sites taking Mastercard payments will need to prove the age and identity of anyone uploading or depicted in adult content conduct a pre-publication content review process and offer a robust complaint resolution and appeals process. “The ability to upload content to the internet has become easier than ever” the company stated in its announcement this April. “Now our requirements address the risks associated with this activity. And that starts with strong content control measures and clear unambiguous and documented consent.”

A Mastercard spokesperson said the company did not directly pressure OnlyFans to change policy and only found out about the decision through media coverage. “It’s a decision they came to themselves” said Seth Eisen a communications executive for Mastercard. Visa and Discover which are also payment partners of OnlyFans did not respond to a request for comment. Stripe which OnlyFans uses for payments to creators for non-adult content as Stripe explicitly bans pornography or other “obscene” content declined to comment.

OnlyFans later clarified that it would have been in compliance with the new Mastercard policies and instead blamed the banks for putting up unnecessary obstacles. OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely told the Financial Times that he would “absolutely” welcome porn back if banking policies changed. On OnlyFans creators upload videos of themselves or others and users can subscribe to creators’ pages with access to exclusive content for a fee (though some accounts are free).

Now the porn industry’s role in the creator economy which promised individual internet users can make a living by selling content directly to their fans is in jeopardy. OnlyFans briefly removed adult performers’ reliance on the industry’s gatekeepers but instead exposed their reliance on internet platforms and financial services companies.

This story was updated on Tuesday to clarify that Mastercard’s new policies were not the reason for OnlyFans’ decision according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vcGF5bWVudC1hcHBzLTEwMS1pcy1jYXNoLWFwcC1zYWZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Payment Apps 101: Is Cash App Safe?,"DISCLAIMER.

In a Nutshell

Cash App is an extremely popular—and safe—peer-to-peer payment app. Similar to Venmo Zelle and PayPal Cash App allows users to safely send funds directly to their friends and family or pay small businesses for goods and services.

Cash App does exactly what its name implies—it provides an easy way to transfer cash from one person to another. You can also use Cash App to pay bills contractors charities and other small businesses. In short it’s a versatile and convenient money-moving option. But is Cash App safe?

In This Piece

What Is Cash App?

How Does Cash App Work?

Is Cash App Safe?

Cash App Alternatives

We’ll unpack the perks of Cash App in this article and then we’ll compare it to other payment options. Let’s begin with a thorough explanation of what Cash App is and how it works.

What Is Cash App?

Cash App is Square’s answer to PayPal’s Venmo. It’s Square’s peer-to-peer payment app—and it’s doing very well in the marketplace.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an online boom and self-service vendors were able to help meet that demand. Like many other user-friendly payment options Square’s profits grew 32% year over year in the first quarter of 2021. Cash App did even better growing 171% year over year—tallying a gross profit of $495 million.

So why is Cash App so popular? In part because it’s a convenient alternative to a bank account. When you sign up you’ll get an account number and a routing number which you can use to receive funds. You can send up to $1000 in any 30-day period—and you can increase that limit by verifying your ID (as long as you’re over 18).

Cash App also offers a free debit card called the Cash Card which you can use to pay for items in stores or withdraw cash at an ATM. Each cash withdrawal carries a $2 fee—but if your Cash App account receives more than $300 in paycheck deposits per month Cash App will reimburse your ATM fees.

How Does Cash App Work?

You can use Cash App to pay friends freelancers utility bills charities—almost anything really. If you want to split the bill at lunch simply:

Open the app on your phone

Choose the amount

Enter an email address a phone number or a $Cashtag

Indicate what the payment is for

Hit “pay”

Cash App payments are instant so recipients receive funds in seconds. If you receive a Cash App payment by accident and need to issue a refund the refunded money will reappear in the accidental sender’s account straight away.

International payments like domestic payments are free. So if you regularly send money to the UK or Europe you can do so without incurring a fee—and that’s something you won’t get from PayPal.

Is Cash App Safe?

Generally speaking Cash App is very safe. Cash App’s parent company Square uses the latest encryption and fraud detection tech to keep its customers’ money safe—the same technology it uses to keep Square Point of Sale transactions secure. In addition Cash App is PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Level 1 compliant.

In other words Cash App is hard to hack—and if anyone does hack into your account Square’s fraud detection algorithms should notice. Every time you sign into Cash App you’ll get a single-use log-in code—and if you enable the Security Lock option payments won’t go through without your passcode.

You do still need to beware of phishing and smishing attempts though. Cash App and Square in general will never ask you to provide personal information—your Social Security number your sign-in code or your PIN for instance.

Requests for “test” transactions are also not legitimate. If you receive an email with a link attached don’t click on the link—and don’t log in and give away any of your information no matter how convincing the landing page.

Cash App Alternatives

Cash App isn’t the only money-moving option out there. Alternatives include Venmo and Zelle which we’ll compare in the table below.

Tip: Check out our reviews of Venmo and PayPal

App name Cash App Zelle Venmo Parent company Square Early Warning Services PayPal Bank account needed? No Yes but the app is still available if your bank doesn’t have built-in Zelle No Who can you pay? Anyone—including friends family charities contractors and utility companies People you trust including friends and family members People you trust including friends and family members and businesses Debit card Yes No Yes Can you hold a balance? Yes No—Zelle connects straight to your bank account. Yes Fees If you use your CashApp balance a debit card or your back account the service is free. There’s a 3% credit card fee and instant bank transfers cost 1.5%. Standard bank transfers are free. None—although some banks charge fees to use Zelle If you use your Venmo balance a debit card or your back account the service is free. There’s a 3% credit card fee and instant bank transfers cost 1%. Standard bank transfers are free. Limits Send up to $250 per week and receive up to $1000 every 30 days. Verify your identity to lift those limits. Speak to your financial institution to find out if there are limits associated with Zelle. You get a $299.99 weekly limit when you sign up. To lift that limit to $4999.99 verify your identity.

Cash App Versus Credit Cards

If you don’t want to pay via app but also don’t like to carry cash around credit cards are another convenient payment option.

If you decide to get a credit card look for a low APR and if possible go for a card with cash back rewards points or other perks. If you’re looking to transfer your balance choose a 0% interest offer to cut the amount you pay over time. If you’re new to credit on the other hand go for a credit builder card to boost your score.

You can compare credit cards and find the right one for you at Credit.com. It’s easy—and it takes just a few minutes to apply.

Can Cash App Be Trusted?

Is Cash App safe then? On the whole yes Cash App is safe—particularly if you switch on the Security Lock option. Cash App’s parent company Square uses encryption technology and fraud detection algorithms to keep consumers like you safe. Remember—never respond to phishing or smishing scams and never share personal data like your Social Security number or your PIN.

We rely on each other to maintain a thriving adaptable and progressive city; however sometimes the stability of our community can be jeopardized by large corporations that have the funds and influence to manipulate the environment we live in.

Global corporations mainly PepsiCo and Coca-Cola infiltrate food and beverage environments with sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) that undermine public health in the Santa Barbara region. SSBs are beverages that contain added sugars like sucrose and high fructose corn syrup and include soda sweetened fruit juices energy drinks teas and coffees. Added sugar in SSBs are associated with weight gain and increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease liver disease dental disease and obesity. SSB consumption is also associated with poorer diet quality e.g. energy drinks with unhealthy diets in college students inflate the possibility of disease. These destructive products are heavily marketed towards the youth in our community the demographic most susceptible to these diseases and future health complications. Not only are industry titans like Pepsi targeting the malleable lives of our youth but their products pollute our natural environment e.g. PepsiCo and CocaCola were the two top global sources of plastic pollution in 2020.

The community of Santa Barbara has been a leader of the environmental movement since the 1969 oil spill that led to the creation of Earth Day in 1970. Local organizations such as the Environmental Defense Center and the SurfRider Foundation work to increase environmental protection by defending native habitats preserving waterways and much more. While Santa Barbara as a whole seems to be riding the growing wave of global environmental awareness the prevalence of single-use plastics such as the ubiquitous PepsiCo plastic beverage bottles at UCSB hinders the city’s sustainability progress. In late 2020 Break Free From Plastic a global movement pushing for solutions to the plastic pollution crisis named PepsiCo as one of the world’s top three plastic polluters. Sales of single use plastic beverage containers have increased from <150 billion (B) in 1999 to 550B in 2019. These plastics degrade slowly persisting in the environment for up to a thousand years damaging ecosystems harming terrestrial and marine life and polluting water air and soil. Additionally microplastic particles are known to accumulate within human tissue leading to potential health issues we are only just beginning to understand such as respiratory diseases and cancer. The heavy promotion of and reliance on single-use plastic beverage containers at UCSB impedes Santa Barbara’s vision of a sustainable future and makes the community complicit in PepsiCo’s damaging environmental practices.

At the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are strategically subtle in convenience stores vending machines and sports events through extensive advertising and display. UCSB’s pouring rights contract (PRC) with PepsiCo gives the beverage company exclusive rights to promote and sell their products at university events and venues. While there are countless beverage options available to the campus community up to 75% of the shelf space in certain campus convenience stores are dominated by PepsiCo products. The agreement makes healthy beverages less convenient restricts the sales of non-PepsiCo bottled beverages and allots UCSB approximately $6000000 over the course of 10 years to actively facilitate the promotion and sales of PepsiCo beverages. UCSB prides itself on being a leader in environmental sustainability health promotion and equal opportunity so why are these values left unacknowledged within the UCSB-PepsiCo PRC?

The UC Healthy Beverage Initiative (HBI) part of the UC Healthy Campus Network aims to increase tap water accessibility and decrease SSB consumption at all 10 UC campuses. At UCSB the HBI research group (HBIRG) aims to spark discussions about the environmental health and social equity implications of the PRC as well. The UCSB HBIRG consists of student researchers that investigate how the campus beverage environment can be more inclusive and consistent with our UC and UCSB health equity and environmental goals.

As graduating UCSB students and part of the UCSB HBIRG we hope that Santa Barbara gets more involved in spreading awareness of the negative public and environmental health impacts of SSBs and the large influence beverage companies have on our community. Let’s work together to keep Santa Barbara healthy and thriving for many future generations to come!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVncm9jZXIuY28udWsvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktYW5kLWVudmlyb25tZW50L3JlZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZS1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS13aHktcGVwc2ljby1tY2RvbmFsZHMtYW5kLXdhaXRyb3NlLWFyZS1qdW1waW5nLW9uLXJlZ2VuLWFnLzY1OTExOS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regenerative agriculture: why PepsiCo McDonald's and Waitrose are jumping on regen ag,"Amid concerns over the UK’s food security nature-based farming is on the rise. Who’s driving ‘regen ag’ and will it become the norm?

Food and farming is alive with buzzwords: ‘zero waste’ ‘plant-based’ ‘superfoods’. ‘Regenerative agriculture’ has become the latest.

Regenerative agriculture or ‘regen ag’ as it’s known has no hard or fast definition. At its heart it’s about growing food in a way that simultaneously boosts the environment. It typically involves minimal soil disturbance reduced or zero fertiliser use and a diverse range of crops and livestock.

Such nature-based farming practices have boomed in recent years following a growing recognition of food production’s devastating effect on Britain’s biodiversity. Farmland birds have more than halved since 1970 while 15% of British wildlife species are now facing extinction the 2019 State of Nature report concluded.

“Changing agricultural management” such as intensification and chemical use was listed as “the biggest single impact” behind the decline.

Regenerative agriculture is for many the standout solution. And it’s gaining traction. Food giants from McDonald’s to PepsiCo are now turning to regenerative agriculture to try and stem the tide while Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Strategy recommended the government put aside up to £700m to pay farmers to create nature-rich landscapes.

“The manufacture production and distribution of food has become an ecological disaster” said Dimbleby in his latest report calling for new and diverse methods of agriculture including regenerative farming practices “that work with nature instead of against it”.

Nestlé plans to halve the carbon footprint of its fresh milk supply in the UK by 2025 in large part by helping its dairy farmers to change to regenerative practices.

Ethical wildlife-friendly organisations are surging in popularity – groups such as the Nature-Friendly Farming Network Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF) and the Farming & Wildlife Advisory Group.

“The manufacture production and distribution of food has become an ecological disaster”

Yet the practice remains relatively niche. Groups such as the Landworkers’ Alliance represent about 1500 farmers promoting more regenerative approaches while the Nature Friendly Farming Network and Pasture-fed Livestock Association have a similar number between them.

So what is needed to roll out this type of agriculture on a wider scale? And can it ever become the norm?

The UK is at a once-in-a-lifetime juncture in its agricultural history. Brexit has provided an opportunity to replace the EU’s much-maligned subsidy system covid has put food security back on the public agenda while the climate crisis is forcing a comprehensive reimagining of food supply from farm to fork.

“We will have to produce more food from the remaining land without resorting to the kind of intensive farming practices that have already done so much damage” said Dimbleby’s National Food Strategy. “This feat of acrobatics is achievable – but only with a concerted effort of will.”

What big suppliers and retailers are doing Waitrose Waitrose’s strategy aims to improve soil and the natural world through restorative land management. It focuses on topsoil regeneration the water cycle and increasing carbon capture biodiversity and resilience to climate change. In October 2020 it committed to make GHG emissions from its UK farms net zero by 2035. M&S M&S has initiated a five year ‘Farming with Nature’ collaborative programme to support its Select Farmers to become more resilient to the biggest environmental challenges they face – spanning climate change biodiversity soil health and water usage. As part of this M&S is introducing 30 million bees to 28 UK Select Farm sites across the country. Morrisons Morrisons has begun working with a group of farmers to develop net-zero models. This includes switching to renewable energy reducing water and fertiliser use and regen ag practices. Morrisons aims to be the first UK supermarket to use only net-zero certified farms when sourcing from British suppliers. PepsiCo In April PepsiCo launched its Positive Agriculture initiative aimed at spreading regenerative farming practices across seven million acres — roughly equal to its entire agricultural footprint. The food giant estimates that this will eliminate at least three million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade. Nestlé Nestlé is working with over 500000 farmers and 150000 suppliers to help them implement regenerative agriculture practices. These typically involve improving soil health and maintaining and restoring diverse ecosystems. In return Nestlé rewards farmers by purchasing their goods at a premium buying bigger quantities and co-investing.

Not since Clement Attlee’s post-war British government has such reform felt afoot. The precariousness of Britain’s food supplies had been exposed during WWII and led to a newfound obsession with self-sufficiency. But incentives for increased food production created ruinous environmental consequences such as the removal of hedges and a surge in pesticides and artificial fertilisers.

This time around many of the same factors are in play yet regenerative agriculture poses a very different type of solution. The theory is that reduced soil tilling and reduced chemicals can create stronger soils. Stronger soil leads to stronger plants which in turn leads to stronger profits. All while boosting biodiversity and helping to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

But there are many barriers to most farmers making such a transition. “You can’t just flick a switch and expect all farmers to switch to a different way of farming” says Michael Lee an expert in sustainable livestock systems at Harper Adams University.

“There are many beef and sheep farmers for example for whom farming is not their main income after they’ve diversified. And so for them the investment to make that switch doesn’t stack up.”

Many farmers are wary sceptical of the strong claims made in regen ag’s name. A 2018 study for example found ‘regenerative’ fields in the US had 29% lower grain production over traditional corn production systems yet still delivered 78% higher profits.

The reality is that every farm and every farmer will opt for a different path depending on investment potential and local environmental available land. One of the most telling factors could be who their customers are particularly if it’s a major supermarket.

Vicki Hird head of sustainable farming at Sustain says there are two issues at the heart of why British farming is unable to produce the food we need while protecting the environment: money and power.

“Farmers are often at the sharp end of supermarket practices because of the competitiveness of the sector”

The dominance of the major supermarkets in today’s food market leaves farmers with little negotiating power she argues forcing farmers to not only pursue practices such a heavy pesticide use and high food waste in order to meet the specific requirements supermarkets demand but leaves them with an ever-diminishing share of the financial pie. Farmers now receive just 9% of the total £120bn spent on food in the UK each year and as NFU president Minette Batters put it in 2018: “You cannot go green if you’re farming in the red.”

To redress the balance of power Hird is calling for a rapid growth in shorter less centralised supply chains to sell directly to local and regional markets. This would require investment in local infrastructure – abattoirs and logistics hubs for example – Hird calls for an increase from around 2%-3% today to 25% by 2030.

This would not only provide farmers with more control of what and how they produce claims Hird but by eliminating the many intermediaries involved in supermarket supply chains – transport packaging marketing advertising – farmers could boost their incomes without burdening shoppers with a jump in food prices.

Such a leap would undoubtedly be transformative but even under this ambition supermarkets would still supply the majority of food consumed within the UK. For this reason many farmers are pushing for greater government intervention to tackle the perceived inequity in food supply. The UK’s new Agriculture Bill includes a section titled “transparency and fairness in the agri-food supply chain” which enables ministers to introduce new laws on regulating the food chain. The NFU hopes it will lead to a new enforcement body for regulating relationships between farmers and their buyers much like the Groceries Code Adjudicator introduced following an investigation into the way supermarkets were sometimes treating their suppliers.

“Farmers are often at the sharp end of supermarket practices because of the competitiveness of the sector” says Christine McDowell food chain advisor at the NFU pointing to issues such as delays in payments retrospective deductions specification or order changes at short notice or “simply unfair and undeliverable contract clauses”. Some supermarket dairy contracts for example include clauses which explicitly forbid farmers from seeking any legal or professional advice says McDowell.

The NFU is developing a set of principles to present to government that would seek to return power to farmers boost incomes and thereby enable more farmers to transition to new farming methods. “If farmers are losing money because of really bad behaviour in the supply chain then they don’t have the cash to invest in sustainable farming practices.”

Supermarkets and nature

Some supermarkets are already taking steps to boost their regenerative agriculture credentials. In Waitrose’s ‘Agricultural Strategy’ the retailer has set out a series of pledges to farm with nature enhance biodiversity and regenerate the environment committing suppliers to requirements such as growing all non-organic fresh fruit & vegetables to be grown with minimal pesticide and herbicide use.

M&S meanwhile has started a five-year ‘Farming with Nature’ collaborative programme to support its Select Farmers to become more resilient to the biggest environmental challenges they face.

The challenge all retailers face however is balancing any agricultural transition with customer demands – shoppers who have come to expect cheap meat symmetrical fruit & veg and all foods year-round.

For regenerative agriculture to become widespread a fundamental rebalancing of the make-up of Britain’s food production and consumption is required. An overconsumption of protein for example has led to livestock being fed from arable land that should be producing fruit & vegetables for human consumption says Harper Adams’ Lee – a pattern that can only truly be reversed by changing consumer demand.

It is a message reminiscent of Wendell Berry farmer and writer who argued that environmentally we require not “the piecemeal technological solutions that our society now offers but … a change of cultural values that will encourage in the whole population the necessary respect restraint and care”.

Regen ag will be just one part of the picture in redressing food’s impact on the environment. Food waste plastics and global commodities will each need solutions of their own. Yet arguably none of these can be solved in isolation.

As agricultural environmentalist William Russell puts it: “Regenerative agriculture is not just about soil. It’s about regeneration of society food culture and farming.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9hcHBsZWJlZS1zZWxsaW5nLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1tb3VudGFpbi1kZXctMTQ0MTAwODU5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applebee's Is Selling An Exclusive Mountain Dew Soda With Blue Raspberry And Blackberry Flavors,"Some of PepsiCo’s Mountain Dew’s best flavors aren’t available in bottles or cans. Instead you can only find them as a fountain drink. And sometimes you can only find them as a fountain drink as a restaurant-exclusive. That was the case with Mountain Dew Vibe and Sweet Lightning and that’s also the case with this new release the Dark Berry Bash.

Thanks to the part-time detectives on Reddit we know that the new soda is rolling out exclusively at Applebee’s restaurants. The sip which is listed on PepsiCo’s website is a dark blue color. The flavors match the hue since you’ll get notes of blue raspberry and blackberry. The soda has a space theme as detailed on an Applebee’s sign and we believe it’ll take our taste buds out of this world.

“In the depths and darkness of space a dark energy has been released! With a blinding flash blue raspberry and blackberry flavors collide into an explosion of sweetness and refreshment! Get ready to surf galactic waves of this stellar new flavor with Mtn Dew Dark Berry Bash” the Applebee’s sign says as photographed by Reddit/u/jakedaily.

Now we know the who (us) what (new Mountain Dew) where (Applebee’s) and why (because we deserve it) but the when is still up in the air. It looks like some locations are getting the soda now but it’s not clear how long it’ll be around.

The persistent impulse among domestic and international bottlers and distributors has been to stimulate the consumption of the sugary beverages to increase market share. We call this the “sweet drink wars”: the battles for the palate in hot and humid Guyana.

As we saw in a previous installment the Berbice bottlers resorted to destroying the competition’s bottles in their fight for market share. The sweet drink wars in British Guiana intensified between the 1940s and the 1970s: from the end of World War II to the mid-1970s when a severe foreign exchange crisis crippled the Guyanese economy. The battle involved three urban companies: D’Aguiar Brothers Ltd. Wieting and Richter’s (W&R’s) Cold Storage and Ice Depot and the Rahaman Soda Factory. They developed new technologies established national distribution systems and launched innovative marketing and promotion campaigns that invoked hygiene- and ideology-related narratives. The sweet drink wars in Guyana have always featured geopolitical class ethnic and community dimensions.

I pick up the story during World War II. On September 2 1940 the United States and Great Britain signed the Destroyer-for-Bases Agreement. A 99-year lease facilitated the United States’ establishment of an airbase at Hyde Park on the east bank of the Demerara River (now Timehri) and a seaplane or naval base on the west bank of the Essequibo River. American military personnel remained in the colony until 1966 when British Guiana gained its independence.

At the start of World War II both Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola were expanding their domestic and international operations. Both companies supported the American war effort. Robert W. Woodruff President of the Coca-Cola Company declared that it was his company’s intention to “see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents wherever he is and no matter what the cost.” He was gambling on the proposition that when the troops returned from overseas campaigns they would remain Coca-Cola consumers. In 1941 Pepsi Cola adopted the red white and blue logo to express its support for the American war effort.

Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola were available in British Guiana during World War II. Wieting and Richter had the Coca-Cola franchise. The Banks DIH website indicates that the company acquired the first Pepsi-Cola franchise in South America in 1942. This was indicative of the significant changes in the company. In 1939 Peter Stanislaus D’Aguiar the U.K.-educated grandson of José Gomes d’Aguiar became the managing director. According to the company’s narrative Peter D’Aguiar “relinquished” the cocoa chocolate and schooner shipping businesses to concentrate on bottling. The company’s museum located in the rotunda at Thirst Park has an illustration of the first bottling equipment Peter D’Aguiar bought. It was in bottling technologies from Flugel Co. Ltd.

By about 1952 DIH had launched the I-Cee brand of nonalcoholic carbonated beverages. Among the initial I-Cee flavors were cream soda orange and tonic. I-Cee lemon was launched in 1961. The I-Cees were the large (10 oz) drinks. DIH also bottled small (6 oz) drinks such as Lime Rickey ginger ale and soda water under the Club brand. These were “mixers” which were targeted to hotels clubs and bars. Another small drink bottled by DIH during the 1950s and early 1960s was Vimto. Vimto whose trademark was registered in British Guiana in 1919 has enjoyed prestige in the society’s sweet drink culture.

Coterminous with this expansion was a series of assertive marketing and public relations efforts aimed at increasing D’Aguiar Bros’ market share and dominating the market. Wieting and Richter’s Cold Storage and Ice Depot (CSID) with the Coca-Cola Juicee and Star brands sought to defend its market share maintain brand loyalty and increase consumption of its fizzy products. One of CSID’s strategies was providing free “Cokes” for school children attending the annual Empire Day rallies in Georgetown.

During the early post-World War II years the fight for British Guiana’s sweet drink market was primarily between D’Aguiar Bros. Ltd and Wieting & Richter. However by 1950 there was another player the Rahaman Soda Factory located in Houston on the East Bank Demerara. The company started with the Wonder brand of lemonade after the end of World War II. By the early 1950s it was bottling the Red Spot brand under a franchise relationship with S. M. Jaleel of Trinidad and Tobago. At its launch the Red Spot brand had more flavors than any bottler in colony. There was banana ginger beer grape grapefruit Kola Champagne Lime Rickey pineapple and R S Cola along with the traditional orange cream soda and ginger ale. Among its marketing slogans was “Always Refreshing.” The company located in Rahaman’s Park Houston East Bank Demerara was solely owned by Hajji Meer Amjad Ally Rahaman the son of Meer Abdul Rahaman the founder of the Peter’s Hall mosque.

In 1958 the Rahaman Soda Factory acquired the Coca-Cola franchises for Demerara and on Monday June 9 1958 it launched the 12 oz king-sized Coke from a new and technologically advanced factory. A regular 6.5 oz bottle of Coca-Cola cost 7₵ (US 3.5₵) and a king-size bottle was 8₵ (US 4₵). The opening of the Coca-Cola factory was covered extensively in the press. The Daily Argosy of Saturday June 7 1958 carried an extended story that included a photograph from the press conference held at the Palm Court in Georgetown the previous day. In the photograph were Cyril White managing director of The Argosy Company; Ulric Gouveia with Radio Demerara; M. A. Rahaman; and Juan Basseda regional manager of The Coca-Cola Company. The report stated that Basseda had “flown in from Havana Cuba to be present at the press conference.”

The opening of the Coca-Cola factory occurred at an important moment in British Guiana’s Cold War experience. Beginning in 1953 the United States and its allies had concerns about British Guiana becoming a base for Soviet expansionism in the Americas. For the United States this was unacceptable. In 1953 the colony’s first government elected under universal adult suffrage was declared to have been pro-Communist. It was ousted from office after 90 days. According to Dr. Cheddi Jagan:

“Soon after the suspension of the constitution in 1953 the British government moved quickly and launched what Emrys Hughes British M.P. called ‘rule by the iron hand and wooden head.’ The kid glove gave way to the mailed fist.”

Between 1953 and 1957 British Guiana was administered by an interim government whose explicit goal was to promote capitalism as the engine of social and economic development. When the Rahaman Soda Factory launched its Coca-Cola line in June 1958 the People’s Progressive Party under the leadership of Dr. Cheddi Jagan had returned to power. His electoral base the Indo-Guianese population remained loyal during the August 12 1957 general elections. In June 1958 Coca-Cola’s regional manager’s office was in Havana Cuba while Fulgencio Batista was in power.

The opening of a new Coca-Cola bottling plant in British Guiana represented a development model promoted by U.S. foreign policy. It has been referred to as franchise capitalism. Simply stated in this model the developing world would leap into the world of industrialization through franchise relationships with American private sector corporations. Not only would this accelerate “modernization” but it would also quickly provide employment increase consumption and in the process stop the spread of communism. In British Guiana in 1958 Coca-Cola represented private investment a sacrosanct value system to be promoted and defended as was democracy within the American sphere of influence.

Prior to the Rahaman company’s becoming the “newly authorized Coca-Cola bottler for Demerara” the brand’s bottler in British Guiana was W&R’s CSID. However by the late 1950s its bottling plant had grown old and consequently was unable to meet Coca-Cola’s quality specifications. According to members of the Rahaman family “Coke approached [their] grandfather to take over their franchise from W&R. W&R had failed to meet Coke’s standards.”

Senior Coca-Cola executives made many visits to the Rahaman Soda Factory during the early years of the franchise. One such was the 1961. The Evening Post of May 12 1961 reported a routine visit by Mr. Montague Thomas vice president of the Coca-Cola Inter-American Corporation and the Coca-Cola Export Corporation. Thomas is reported to have reiterated that the Rahaman Soda Factory plant was “one of the finest in the region which includes the Caribbean islands and the three Guianas.”

Also accompanying the Coca-Cola vice president was Mrs. M. Thomas. Another article in the May 12 Evening Post indicated that “late last year [1960] the Cuban government confiscated the Coca-Cola Company and the belongings of Mr. and Mrs. M. Thomas both Americans.” Coca Cola’s regional head office was now in Nassau Bahamas. These were intense ideological times in the hemisphere!

In late 1972 W&R relocated its bottling plant from Water Street to the Ruimveldt Industrial Estate. It eventually reacquired the Coca-Cola franchise which it maintained until December 1975 when its operations were acquired by Banks DIH which was also located in the Ruimveldt Industrial Estate. In 1970 Hajji Meer Amjad Ally Rahaman died and the company was acquired by his sons Meer Hamaz Meer Imran and Meer Ansari. The company name was changed to the Republic Soda Factory. By the early 1970s all three of Guyana’s dominant bottlers were located relatively close to one another on East Bank Demerara.

The companies’ advertising and marketing campaigns have played pivotal roles in creating awareness and stimulating the consumption of nonalcoholic carbonated beverages in post-World War II British Guiana. The outcomes of those campaigns still resonate in Guyana. In the sweet drink war there were many casualties especially among the Lemonade People and other small community-based bottlers. Many had been in business since the early 20th century. These bottles of fizz especially the franchised brands were ascribed a higher social status. They not only challenged the small lemonade but they also marginalized homemade drinks as thirst quenchers and refreshers. The franchised sweet drinks were positioned as healthy symbols of modernity and sophistication. The Lemonade People and the community-based bottlers were framed as unsanitary. The next installment will examine some of the tactics deployed in the sweet drink wars.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  there are at least 13 different COVID-19 vaccines currently in use around the world including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine — many countries across the world have authorized or approved one or both of these vaccines for use. Read on to learn how these two vaccines work how effective they are and other critical information you need to know if you’re deciding which one to get or simply want to learn more. Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech AstraZeneca Other names BNT162b2 Comirnaty Oxford ChAdOx1 AZD1222 Vaxzevria Type mRNA vaccine adenovirus vector vaccine Doses 2 (21 days apart) 2 (28-84 days apart) Efficacy Up to 95 percent Approx. 70.4 percent US Authorization December 11 2020 (16 and older)

How do these vaccines work? The Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines each work in different ways. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine uses mRNA technology while the AstraZeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus vector. Below we’ll discuss the mechanisms used in each vaccine meant to help protect you from becoming ill with COVID-19. Pfizer-BioNTech The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is often referred to by other names in scientific literature including: BNT162b2

Comirnaty This vaccine is given in two doses. The second dose is given 21 days (3 weeks) after the first dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine uses mRNA technology that scientists have been working on for many years. Some of the earliest successful mRNA vaccine clinical trial results were published in 2008. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine works through the following steps: After you receive the vaccine the mRNA that it contains is taken up by nearby cells. Once mRNA is inside of a cell the mRNA remains outside of the nucleus and doesn’t directly impact your DNA. The mRNA in the vaccine provides instructions to the cell on how to produce the spike protein that’s found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. The virus uses this protein to bind to and enter cells before it begins reproducing and spreading the virus throughout your cells. Using the information provided by the vaccine mRNA the cell makes spike protein. When this process has been completed the mRNA is then destroyed. The spike proteins that the cell has produced are then displayed on the cell surface. Immune cells in your body can now recognize the spike protein as a foreign substance and work to build an immune response against it. Your immune system can now produce antibodies and other immune cells that specifically recognize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These tools can help to protect you from becoming sick if you’re exposed to the novel coronavirus. The mRNA used in the vaccine makes the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine less stable in storage than other types of vaccines. Because of this it needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures between -112°F (-80°C) to -76°F (-60°C) once it’s been prepared for injection. Once it’s been diluted and prepared for use the vaccine remains stable at room temperature for up to 6 hours . After this period ends it must be discarded and can no longer be injected. AstraZeneca The AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine is also known by several other names in scientific papers including: ChAdOx1

AZD1222

Vaxzevria Similar to many other COVID-19 vaccines the AstraZeneca vaccine is given in two doses. The second dose is given between 28 to 84 days (4 to 12 weeks) after the first dose. The AstraZeneca vaccine is delivered using an adenovirus vector. This is the same type of technology that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine uses. This type of vaccine uses a deactivated adenovirus that’s been modified to deliver the vaccine contents into a host cell. Once the contents enter the cell the adenovirus breaks down. This means that it can’t cause disease in humans or interact with our DNA. Here’s how the AstraZeneca vaccine works: After the vaccine is injected the modified adenovirus can enter nearby cells and release its genetic material. This genetic material has instructions on how to make the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. Your cells use the information provided by the adenovirus’s genetic material to make the spike protein. When the spike protein is made it can travel to the cell surface and be displayed there. Immune system cells notice the spike protein and recognize it as a foreign substance. This triggers the production of an immune response. Your immune system generates antibodies and immune cells that specifically recognize this new spike protein. If you’re exposed to the novel coronavirus the antibodies and cells can help prevent you from becoming ill. The AstraZeneca vaccine is stable at higher temperatures than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine able to be refrigerated between 35°F (2°C) and 46°F (8°C) rather than stored in an ultra-cold freezer. Once a vial is opened it can be kept at room temperature for up to 6 hours. It can no longer be injected after this period and must be discarded. Will boosters be needed? In August 2021 the FDA approved the use of Pfizer or Moderna booster vaccination doses to be given to people with weakened immune systems — specifically those who’ve undergone solid organ transplants. Research on how long the immunity generated from any COVID-19 vaccine will last is active and ongoing. An April 2021 press release from Pfizer notes that protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine lasts at least 6 months. Similar information regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine has yet to be released. It’s likely that a vaccine booster will be needed at some point in the future. A COVID-19 vaccine booster could be beneficial in helping reinforce your immunity and to protect against coronavirus variants. Was this helpful?

How effective are these vaccines against COVID-19? After vaccination it takes your body time to build up immunity. This means that you’re considered to be fully vaccinated when it’s been at least 2 weeks since your second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine. You’re not considered immune right after your second dose. How is vaccine efficacy calculated? Just how effective these vaccines are is determined by a calculation called vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy measures the percent reduction of a disease in people who’ve been vaccinated compared to those who haven’t. For example if a study reports a vaccine efficacy of 80 percent for a vaccine against a certain virus this means that the risk of vaccinated individuals becoming ill with that virus is decreased by 80 percent. Efficacy numbers can vary among studies of the same vaccine due to factors like study size how long the study lasts and even the health of the participants involved in the study. Was this helpful? Vaccine efficacy is carefully reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when making the decision to grant emergency use authorization (EUA). Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have been given EUA in the United States and numerous other countries. Let’s examine vaccine efficacy data from large-scale clinical trials for these two vaccines. Pfizer-BioNTech The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial with 43448 participants. Each participant was given two injections of either the vaccine or a placebo spaced 21 days (3 weeks) apart. Researchers calculated vaccine efficacy 7 days after trial participants had received their second injections. At this point the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be 95 percent. Some other data that was reported from this clinical trial includes: COVID-19 after second dose At least 7 days after their second dose 8 people in the vaccine group contracted COVID-19. In the 7 days after getting their second injection 162 people in the placebo group got COVID-19.

COVID-19 between doses Only 39 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the vaccine group between the first and second doses. This means that vaccine efficacy during this period is about 52 percent. 82 cases of COVID-19 were reported between the first and second injections in the placebo group.

Severe COVID-19 After participants received their first injection only 1 case of severe COVID-19 was reported in the vaccine group. 9 cases were reported in the placebo group.

COVID-19 deaths No deaths from COVID-19 were reported in either the vaccine or the placebo group.

AstraZeneca The efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine was assessed in four clinical trials carried out in the UK Brazil and South Africa. All four trials combined included 23848 participants. Participants were given two injections of either the AZ vaccine or a control injection containing no protection against COVID-19. Depending on the participant’s location injections were spaced between 4 and 12 weeks apart. Researchers evaluated vaccine efficacy 14 days (2 weeks) after the second dose and found that: Vaccine efficacy in participants who received two standard doses of the AZ vaccine was 62.1 percent.

Vaccine efficacy in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose was 90 percent.

Vaccine efficacy across both groups was calculated to be 70.4 percent. Some other findings in the study included: COVID-19 hospitalization: 10 people in the control group (who didn’t get the AstraZeneca vaccine) were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the 21 days after the first injection.

10 people in the control group (who didn’t get the AstraZeneca vaccine) were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the 21 days after the first injection. Severe COVID-19 or COVID-19 death: Of the 10 people from the control group who were hospitalized 2 people had COVID-19 categorized as severe. Of these 2 people 1 died from COVID-19. Clinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine are also underway in the United States Peru and Chile. In late March 2021 AstraZeneca announced that an interim analysis of 32449 trial participants found that the vaccine had an efficacy of 79 percent. Shortly after this interim analysis was released the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease raised concerns about the data used for this calculation. AstraZeneca reviewed the data and corrected the vaccine efficacy to 76 percent. Should I get vaccinated if I’ve already had COVID-19? Get a COVID-19 vaccine even if you’ve already had COVID-19 and recovered. It’s unknown how long an individual’s natural immunity to COVID-19 lasts after an infection. It’s possible to contract the virus and become ill more than once. Some people who’ve recovered from COVID-19 should wait before getting vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends waiting 90 days after a COVID-19 infection if your treatment involves monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. Was this helpful?

Are the COVID-19 vaccines safe? To be approved for large-scale use (even emergency use) a vaccine must be assessed by the FDA as both safe and effective. All vaccines come with some risks or potential side effects. But the benefits of a vaccine must always outweigh its potential risks. Pfizer-BioNTech The CDC states that those who have an underlying health condition can get a COVID-19 vaccine as long as they haven’t had a previous serious allergic reaction to the vaccine or any of its ingredients. This includes people who have a weakened immune system or are pregnant or breastfeeding . Specific safety data for these populations is limited but increasing evidence indicates that vaccination poses minimal risk. All of the ingredients used in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are also listed in an FDA fact sheet meant to be used by both people giving and receiving the vaccine. AstraZeneca The European Medicines Agency (EMA) notes the following related to the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine: People with allergic reactions to previous vaccines may still receive the AstraZeneca vaccine unless they’ve had a previous allergic reaction to the AstraZeneca vaccine itself or one of its ingredients.

People with weakened immune systems may be vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. No safety concerns have been reported. But their immune response to COVID-19 following vaccination may be weaker than that of someone with a stronger immune system.

People who are pregnant or breastfeeding can get the AstraZeneca vaccine. Data on the use of the vaccine in this group is limited. Talk with a doctor before vaccination if you have any concerns.

People who’ve had a blood clot along with a low platelet count due to a previous dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should NOT receive this vaccine. Refer to the vaccine’s official summary of product characteristics to see the different ingredients used in the AZ vaccine and decide if you may have an allergy to one of its ingredients.

Do these vaccines work against COVID-19 variants? Viruses mutate constantly. In many cases mutations are harmful to the virus and prevent it from finishing its life cycle. But in other cases a new mutation can provide the virus with an advantage. A large number of variants of the new coronavirus have been detected so far. Some are considered “variants of concern” — this means that they may: be spread more easily

cause more severe illness

evade diagnostic tests (resulting in false negative results)

be unaffected by the immune system even after vaccines or monoclonal antibody treatments A few examples of novel coronavirus variants include: B.1.1.7: First identified in the United Kingdom. It’s more transmissible than the original strain of the novel coronavirus and may potentially cause more severe illness.

First identified in the United Kingdom. It’s more transmissible than the original strain of the novel coronavirus and may potentially cause more severe illness. B.1.351: First detected in South Africa. Like B.1.1.7 it’s also more transmissible. It also appears largely unaffected by the immune system even in those who’ve been vaccinated.

First detected in South Africa. Like B.1.1.7 it’s also more transmissible. It also appears largely unaffected by the immune system even in those who’ve been vaccinated. P.1: First detected in Brazil and Japan. Similar to B.1.351 it also seems to be able to evade the immune system.

First detected in Brazil and Japan. Similar to B.1.351 it also seems to be able to evade the immune system. B.1.617.2: First detected during an outbreak in India early in 2021. It’s also known as the Delta variant and may be more easily spread than other variants. Research into how effective the different COVID-19 vaccines are against these variants is ongoing. Read on to learn what we know so far. Pfizer-BioNTech An April 2021 study tested serum the part of the blood containing antibodies from people who’d been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against test viruses with spike proteins from different COVID-19 variants. Researchers found that the serum neutralized both the B.1.1.7 and the P.1 test viruses at a similar rate to the original strain of the novel coronavirus. They also noted that neutralization of B.1.351 test viruses was lower but still robust. A July 2021 study from Qatar looked at vaccine efficacy in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with confirmed cases of COVID-19. At the time of the study most COVID-19 in Qatar was due to either the B.1.1.7 or the B.1.351 variant. Researchers found that the vaccine efficacy against these variants was quite high for people who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: B.1.1.7 variant: 89.5 percent

89.5 percent B.1.351 variant: 75 percent

75 percent Severe critical or fatal illness due to either variant: 100 percent Research from the United Kingdom has also found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is effective against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 “Delta” variants finding the following efficacy: B.1.1.7 variant: 93 percent

93 percent B.1.617.2 variant: 88 percent AstraZeneca A March 2021 study assessed protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in 8534 individuals following a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine or a control injection. Researchers found that: 520 participants developed COVID-19 after their second injection. Only 173 (33.3 percent) were in the group that received the vaccine.

After sequencing 147 samples from symptomatic infections 35 percent of infections were found to be caused by B.1.1.7.

Vaccine efficacy was calculated to be: 70.4 percent for symptomatic COVID-19 caused by the B.1.1.7 variant 81.5 percent for COVID-19 not caused by B.1.1.7

The same research from the United Kingdom mentioned earlier also found that individuals that were fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine showed a vaccine efficacy of: B.1.1.7 variant: 66 percent

66 percent B.1.617.2 variant: 60 percent A different March 2021 study looked into the efficacy of the AZ vaccine versus placebo against the B.1.351 variant in South Africa. Vaccine efficacy 14 days after the second injection was found to be low at about 21.9 percent overall for the B.1.351 variant in both people receiving the vaccine and those receiving the placebo.

How much do the COVID-19 vaccines cost? During the pandemic the federal government of the United States is providing authorized COVID-19 vaccines free of charge . This is regardless of a person’s immigration status or health insurance coverage. If you go to get a COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic you can’t be charged for: the vaccine

any copays coinsurance or administration fees

fees for an office visit if the only service rendered was COVID-19 vaccination Because the AstraZeneca vaccine isn’t yet authorized in the United States it’s not included in this program. But the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is due to its emergency use authorization. Other countries like the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union also provide the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines free of charge. Countries who participate in the COVAX program may also be able to provide you with one of these vaccines for free. COVID-19 vaccination will likely continue after the pandemic as either first-time vaccinations or booster shots. This means that the vaccines may come at a higher cost since both are made by for-profit pharmaceutical companies. The exact details of when the pandemic may end or what the costs of the vaccines may be have yet to be confirmed.

Are these vaccines authorized for use? COVID-19 vaccines used in the United States including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are currently authorized under an emergency use authorization (EUA). EUAs are issued by the FDA but aren’t the same thing as full FDA approval. An EUA is used by the FDA to allow the use of unapproved medical products during a public health emergency like a pandemic. The FDA must carefully review a product before granting an EUA: Product submission: A company seeking an EUA for a product needs to submit results from a phase 3 clinical trial to the FDA with both safety and efficacy data. This trial can still be in progress but must meet specific milestones set by the FDA. Internal review: Once the submission is received FDA scientists carefully go over clinical trial data. External advisory panel review: During the internal review an external advisory panel also reviews and discusses the data provided in the submission. This panel includes scientists and public health experts. The decision: The FDA considers the feedback from the internal review and the external advisory panel review. When deciding to grant an EUA the FDA must conclude that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. The AstraZeneca vaccine isn’t authorized for emergency use in the United States and has yet to submit for an EUA. Now let’s look at some specific authorization details for these two vaccines. Additional authorizations or approvals may be added on an ongoing basis. Pfizer-BioNTech The FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in individuals aged 16 and older on December 11 2020. It was also authorized on May 10 2021 for use in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also listed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use. Many other countries worldwide have also either authorized or approved the vaccine: AstraZeneca The AstraZeneca vaccine has yet to be authorized for emergency use in the United States by the FDA. On February 15 2021 the WHO listed the two versions of the AZ vaccine for emergency use in adults aged 18 and over. Similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine many countries around the world have either authorized or approved the AZ vaccine.

What should I know about the manufacturers of these vaccines? Let’s take a closer look at the namesake companies who’ve produced the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. Pfizer-BioNTech Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical company headquartered in New York City. They develop new drugs and vaccines for a variety of different health conditions. A few examples of Pfizer’s more well-known drugs or vaccines include: Enbrel (etanercept) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis

Lipitor (atorvastatin) used to lower cholesterol levels

Lyrica (pregabalin) used to treat nerve pain

Prevnar 13 a type of pneumococcal vaccine

Viagra (sildenafil) used to treat erectile dysfunction The COVID-19 vaccine was developed in collaboration with the German biotechnology company BioNTech. This collaboration came out of a previous agreement between the two companies to develop a flu vaccine using mRNA technology. AstraZeneca AstraZeneca is a British and Swedish pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge United Kingdom. Their main therapy areas include oncology and conditions that impact the respiratory system cardiovascular system and kidneys. Some examples of AstraZeneca products include: Crestor (rosuvastatin) used to lower cholesterol levels

FluMist a live intranasal flu vaccine

Nexium (esomeprazole) used to treated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Tagrisso (osimertinib) used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer AstraZeneca developed their COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with scientists at the University of Oxford. That’s why you’ll sometimes see this vaccine referred to as the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Which vaccine is better? To best protect yourself from COVID-19 and stop the spread of the novel coronavirus it’s important to get vaccinated. The best vaccine to get is typically the one that’s the soonest available to you. If you live in a country where both the Pfizer-BioNTech and AZ vaccines are authorized or approved you may need to decide which one to get if both options are offered to you. As you decide you may want to consider the potential risks or side effects associated with each one. For example you may have concerns about TTS and choose to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Talk with a doctor if you’re unsure which one’s better or safer for you. They’re an important resource for information and can cover various topics with you like: potential benefits of vaccination

safety and efficacy evidence currently available

potential risks of becoming ill with COVID-19 particularly if you have an underlying condition or are pregnant

side effects associated with vaccination and what to do if you experience them

how to find a vaccination site close to you No two vaccines are alike Keep in mind that it isn’t possible to directly compare these two vaccines because their clinical trials: used different study protocols methods and endpoints

were performed in different geographic locations across the globe

had different groups of study participants

occurred at different times in the pandemic This is important to consider when weighing the benefits risks and efficacy of each vaccine. Talk with a doctor or a specialist with experience in vaccines like an immunologist or epidemiologist if you have any questions about how these vaccines were tested and authorized.

Investors might think of several attributes when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) and Pfizer (PFE 1.19%) are mentioned. The longevity and stability of the two companies could come to mind. So could dividends. Both J&J and Pfizer have been longtime favorites for income-seeking investors.

But which of these two healthcare giants is the better dividend stock? Here's how Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer stack up against each other.

The case for Johnson & Johnson

Few stocks boast a dividend track record that surpasses that of Johnson & Johnson. The company is a Dividend King -- an S&P 500 member with at least 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. J&J's streak stands at 59 years. Only nine other companies have increased their dividends for a longer period.

Johnson & Johnson's dividend yield of 2.4% isn't bad either. While it might not be as juicy as what some dividend stocks offer investors can sleep soundly at night with confidence that the dividends will keep coming quarter after quarter.

The best dividend stocks don't just provide dividends. Even income investors would like to have solid share appreciation too. J&J appears to be in a good position to deliver on this front as well.

Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the healthcare giant's prospects. The consensus among analysts projects average annual earnings growth of nearly 9% over the next five years. That's a little better than the company's average annual adjusted earnings growth of 8% over the last two decades.

Johnson & Johnson isn't overly dependent on one product to generate this growth. It has 28 platforms or products that generate sales of at least $1 billion annually. And roughly one-fourth of the company's sales come from products launched within the last five years. Look for solid growth and solid dividends from this big company for a long time to come.

The case for Pfizer

Pfizer isn't a member of dividend royalty like Johnson & Johnson is. However the company has steadily increased its dividend payout over the last 11 years. Pfizer initially thought that it would reduce its dividend a little with the merger of its Upjohn unit with Mylan. But the drugmaker generated enough money to avoid a dividend cut.

Throughout most of the last 12 months Pfizer's dividend yield topped 4%. It now stands at 3.1%. This lower yield is due to the pharma stock soaring 35% during the period.

The company's COVID-19 vaccine developed with BioNTech has been the primary growth driver. Pfizer expects the vaccine will rake in $33.5 billion in sales this year making it the world's top-selling healthcare product.

The big drugmaker could have another COVID-19 blockbuster on the way with PF-07321332. Pfizer hopes to file for Emergency Use Authorization of the antiviral drug later this year as post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals exposed to the coronavirus.

Pfizer isn't solely dependent on its COVID-19 programs for growth though. Its lineup includes several other products with strong sales growth. The company even projects average annual adjusted earnings growth through 2025 in the low double-digit percentages without any of its COVID-19 sales included.

Better dividend stock?

I like both of these stocks. Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer have survived and thrived since the 19th century. Both companies have strong financial positions. Both have solid growth prospects.

Based on their dividend programs though I think that J&J is the better pick. I can't think of many better overall dividend stocks in the healthcare sector. The company has an impeccable track record of dividend hikes along with a solid dividend yield. J&J also has more diversified revenue sources than Pfizer does which makes it less risky.

Pfizer will probably deliver stronger growth over the next few years. However if your main focus is dividends you won't go wrong choosing Johnson & Johnson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vVG9wX05ld3MvVVMvMjAyMS8wOC8yMi9WaXZlay1NdXJ0aHktRkRBLVBmaXplci1hcHByb3ZhbC1tYXktdGlwLXRvd2FyZC12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi8zOTQxNjI5NjYxMDk4L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vYW1wL1RvcF9OZXdzL1VTLzIwMjEvMDgvMjIvVml2ZWstTXVydGh5LUZEQS1QZml6ZXItYXBwcm92YWwtbWF5LXRpcC10b3dhcmQtdmFjY2luYXRpb24vMzk0MTYyOTY2MTA5OC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Vivek Murthy: FDA approval of Pfizer vaccine 'may tip' more toward vaccination,"1 of 5 | U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Sunday he believes full federal approval of Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine ""may tip"" some who have not yet been inoculated to get the vaccine.

Aug. 22 (UPI) -- U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Sunday he believes full federal approval of Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine will lead to increased vaccination numbers and vaccine mandates from businesses universities and other entities. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union Murthy responded to reports by The New York Times CNBC and other outlets that the Food and Drug Administration is aiming to grant full approval to the Pfizer vaccine as soon as Monday.

""I anticipate that if and when that comes that will have two impacts. I think for people who have been waiting for this ... and that's a small number of people but I think still significant -- I think this may tip them over toward getting vaccinated"" Murthy said.

""But also I think that for businesses and universities that have been thinking about putting vaccine requirements in place in order to create safer places for people to work and learn I think that this move from the FDA when it comes will actually help them to move forward with those kinds of plans.""

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 170821621 people representing 51.5% of the U.S. population are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 while at least 60.7% have received at least one dose. Among adults 62.4% have completed their vaccination regimen and 73% have received at least begun.

Murthy on Sunday noted that this sample size has shown the vaccines are effective and that people should get vaccinated as soon as possible regardless of the status of federal approval.

""I think what is important for us to realize is that we have had strong evidence from real world data that this vaccine has been doing remarkably well and has maintained a strong safety profile"" he said. ""We have given it to hundreds of millions of people and we have seen that it's doing its job.""

Amid the presence of the highly infectious Delta variant cases have surged throughout the United States with the CDC reporting a seven-day moving case average of 134859 as of Friday.

Among the most affected areas are Mississippi which is reporting 120 new cases a day per 100000 people over the past seven days followed by 109 in Florida and 108 in Louisiana according to The New York Times.

There have also been high-profile instances of so-called ""breakthrough"" infections among fully vaccinated people with Sens. Angus King I-Maine; Roger Wicker R-Miss.; and John Hickenlooper D-Colo. announced separately Thursday that they each tested positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who announced he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday announced Saturday he had produced a negative test after just four days.

""I'm told my infection was brief and mild because of the vaccination I received"" Abbott said in a video posted to Twitter. ""So I encourage others who have not received the vaccination to consider getting one.""

As of Aug. 9 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 8054 so-called ""breakthrough"" COVID-19 infections among vaccinated individuals that have resulted in hospitalization or death.

Rev. Jesse Jackson 79 who was vaccinated against the virus and his wife Jacqueline Jackson 77 were taken to Northwestern Hospital in Chicago after testing positive for COVID-19 on Saturday.

Citing the threat of the Delta variant the CDC and other health organizations plan to make booster shots available for vaccinated people eight months after their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine beginning in September.

Murthy said that boosters will allow people to ""stay ahead of this virus"" and the rollout will prioritize those at the highest risk such as healthcare workers and the elderly.

""[T]he vaccines are continuing to work remarkably well for preventing people from ending up in the hospital and they are saving lives. So that's the reason we are not recommending boosters today"" Murthy told ABC News' This Week. ""But what we are seeing is a decline in the protection against mild to moderate disease and so we are anticipating there may be an erosion in that important protection that we're seeing today down the line.""

Earlier this month World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged a booster moratorium of about two months calling on wealthier nations to instead send vaccine doses to poorer nations.

On Sunday Murthy said the United States must both ""protect American lives"" and ""help vaccinate the world"" noting that overall vaccine supply has been growing.

""And that's why in addition to donating more than 120 million doses of vaccine and moving out on the commitment of 500 million doses starting this month that the president announced earlier in the summer we're also working with companies and with other countries to stand up manufacturing capacity so we can really scale up production of the vaccine"" he said. ""We have to work on both fronts. That is the only way the pandemic will end.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMzQ0MDE4L21vcm9jY28tcmVjZWl2ZXMtbmV3LXNoaXBtZW50LW9mLXBmaXplci1zaW5vcGhhcm0tdmFjY2luZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morocco Receives New Shipment of Pfizer Sinopharm Vaccines,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BmaXplci1mZGEtYXBwcm92ZWQtMDc0NTQ2MDAxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer to be FDA approved,"Yahoo Sports

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion saying he didn't commit a crime.

If the convictions are allowed to stand attorney Yaakov Roth told a three-judge panel during oral arguments it could expose every elected official in the country to prosecution for accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld a former Cincinnati city councilman was found guilty of the charges in 2022 and sentenced last year to 16 months in prison. He's five months into that sentence now. But he is appealing his convictions and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Thursday.

The roughly 40-minute hearing took place in a courtroom packed with Sittenfeld supporters as well as attorneys interested in the outcome of the appeal which partly centers on what is corrupt when it comes to a politician accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld himself was not in the courtroom.

Roth began his argument by pointing to amicus briefs filed by 16 former federal public corruption prosecutors as well as a bipartisan group of former attorneys general and federal judges.

All of them Roth said are trying ""to tell this court that something has gone wrong.""

Judges question both sides

The judges − John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy − continuously asked questions of both sides throughout.

Many questions focused on whether Sittenfeld's actions were sufficient to be considered crimes. The judges also asked about topics that were raised repeatedly throughout the trial and in post-trial court filings.

Some questions centered on whether there was clear and unambiguous evidence of an exchange of money for official action − a quid pro quo.

At one point Nalbandian pointed out that Sittenfeld had promised to ""deliver the votes"" and get a ""veto-proof majority"" of City Council to support a development project in exchange for a $20000 donation to his political action committee.

Why couldn't the jury conclude that was evidence of corruption? he asked Roth.

Roth responded that prosecutors had strung together Sittenfeld's statements ""to make it into something it's not.""

Judges focus on conversation with developer

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer spent much of his 15 minutes of argument time responding to questions from the judges.

Two judges asked specifically about a recorded conversation between Sittenfeld and a local developer during which they talked about supporting Sittenfeld's then-planned mayoral campaign.

As Sittenfeld and the developer Chinedum Ndukwe talked about campaign donations Sittenfeld said: ""You don't want me … to be like 'Hey Chin like love you but can't.'""

Prosecutors at trial said Sittenfeld was threatening to withhold support for the project unless Ndukwe contributed. But Roth argued that the statement wasn't sufficient evidence of a crime and said it seemed as if prosecutors had stopped focusing on it.

During arguments Thursday Nalbandian asked Singer if prosecutors were ""running away"" from the ""love you but can't"" comment.

Singer said the statement was one part of a ""corrupt solicitation"" that involved multiple statements. It was ""evidence the jury could consider"" he said.

What's next

A decision is not expected to come for some time possibly not until after Sittenfeld completes his prison term.

Roth on Thursday asked the court to consider releasing him from prison while it considers the appeal. The judges did not indicate whether they will consider that. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco have banned tobacco industry employees from attending its annual conference following complaints about the “problematic behaviour” of tabacco staff.

The decision to ban tobacco company employees from the conference came after a two-year long review by the international body according to a report in The Times.

It followed a rise in the number of complaints from members about “perceived unprofessional or problematic behaviour” by employees in the tobacco sector who reportedly disrespected presenters during Q&A sessions and attended members-only meetings. Tobacco industry staff were also accused of using the international non-profit organisation’s name in press releases to imply its endorsement of various company findings.

The involvement of the tobacco industry in the professional association’s research has been a controversial issue for some time but the reported ban has added fuel to the flame.

The news comes as a planned takeover of a British respiratory drugmaker Vectura by the maker of Marlboro Philip Morris International has come under fire.

In a joint letter more than 20 health bodies urged the board to reject Philip Morris’ bid saying it put the future of the pharmaceutical firm under threat.

The groups warned a takeover by PMI raised ethical issues that could damage Vectura’s “future commercial viability as a company dedicated to improving respiratory health”.

Bryan police say they were called to a home Saturday night in the 900 block of Muckleroy Street for a disturbance involving a weapon.

The complainant in this case said he was threatened by Nathaniel Phillips 66 during a verbal altercation the two were having. The man claimed Phillips attempted to cut him with a knife then left and said he was going to return with a gun.

As police were at the home speaking with the victim Phillips reportedly drove by the house and then sped away when police saw him. Police went after Phillips and found him after he crashed into a tree near Neal Elementary school.

Inside the car police said they found a knife and handgun. Phillips admitted to having a couple of beers prior to the crash.

Phillips was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon driving while intoxicated-3rd or more evading arrest/detention with a vehicle resisting search terroristic threat unlawful carrying of a weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.

In a memo to the judge police requested that a higher bail be set for Phillips.

Police said Phillips has previously been convicted of driving while intoxicated four times and has been arrested for DWI five times. He also has 27 previous arrests in Brazos County for offenses including attempted homicide multiple aggravated assault with a deadly weapon possession of a dangerous drug obstruction/retaliation and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.

The memo by police goes on to say ”Phillips’ continued reckless behavior shows that the leniency he has been shown has not changed his behavior nor has it aided in the safety of those around him. His pattern of behavior indicates that he will continue to violate the law in a manner that threatens the safety of others.”

On Sunday afternoon Phillips remained in jail on bonds totaling more than $110000.

Times of trouble are often times of truth. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity for people to signal their true commitment to friends. To get a sense of how close countries are in geopolitical terms and how warm their relationships are one can simply count the number of high-level visits or the amount of COVID-19 vaccines donated between them.

If these indicators have something to say then Vietnam is the closest to the United States – and the farthest from China – among all Southeast Asian countries. The United States and Vietnam have conducted three high-level visits since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 – and the count will soon be four. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Vietnam in October 2020 followed by then-National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien in November. Last month U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin went to Vietnam during a tour of three Southeast Asian countries that also included Singapore and the Philippines. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will arrive in Vietnam on Tuesday as part of her first trip to Asia.

There have been two high-levels visits between China and Vietnam in the same span. Chinese Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi traveled to Vietnam in February 2021 followed by Defense Minister Wei Fenghe in April. Most tellingly since the pandemic began Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and State Councilor Yang Jiechi have visited all member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) except Vietnam.

The donation of COVID-19 vaccines can also measure the warmth between nations. So far China has donated to Vietnam a country of nearly 100 million people a total of 700000 doses including 500000 doses prioritized for Chinese citizens residents of the provinces bordering China and Vietnamese travelers to China and 200000 doses for the Vietnam People’s Army. By comparison China gave Laos a country of 7 million people nearly 3 million doses. For Vietnam the United States is by far the biggest donor with 5 million doses given as gift.

But these indications are at odds with the official designations of their relationships. Vietnam calls 14 countries its “strategic partners” and three additional countries – China Russia and India – are “comprehensive strategic partners.” As a mere “comprehensive partner” the United States stands in a lower-level category together with Argentina Denmark and Hungary. Why the discrepancy?

The relationship between Washington and Hanoi is one of the most delicate and most subtle in the world. Historical memories ideological differences and domestic concerns often make things unspeakable in this growing relationship. But the largest factor of all that renders the U.S.-Vietnam relationship so delicate and so subtle is China. It is also the critical factor that makes and unmakes the strategic aspect of U.S.-Vietnam ties.

It was to placate China that the Carter administration shelved normalization with Vietnam in 1978 helping to delay the normalization until well after the Cold War. Fast forward to the early 2000s when the George W. Bush administration considered Vietnam as a potential strategic partner because it regarded China as a potential strategic competitor. In 2008 Vietnam joined the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership a grouping thought to be a key counterweight to China’s economic juggernaut at Washington’s invitation.

The United States officially offered a strategic partnership with Vietnam in July 2010 when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi. She came to attend an ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting at which she declared U.S. national interests in freedom of navigation open access to Asia’s maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea. Traveling to Hanoi again in July 2012 she gave Vietnam one of the strongest public supports in its feud with China over the South China Sea. She also invited Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) chief Nguyen Phu Trong who had no counterpart in the United States to Washington the next year.

This sparked a major debate within the Vietnamese leadership. While integrationists were eager to broaden cooperation with the Western superpower anti-Westerners worried that this would erode Communist Party rule. Commemorating the 1972 U.S. Christmas bombing of Hanoi in December 2012 Vietnam’s Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh warned that Washington could invade the country again “when the opportunity arises.” The next year it was President Truong Tan Sang not party chief Trong who went to the United States and at his visit the two countries raised their ties to a “comprehensive partnership” a level below the “strategic” one.

It took a Chinese crossing of Hanoi’s red line to push Vietnam across a self-imposed red line in its U.S. relations. When China parked its giant oil rig HYSY-981 within Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for 75 days in the summer of 2014 relations between the two Communist countries plunged to the lowest point since their open hostility in the 1980s. Again the United States came out with the strongest public support for Vietnam. It also matched word with deed by lifting a ban on maritime weapons sales to Hanoi. The oil rig crisis proved to be a litmus test and a game changer. It was the first time in history that Communist Vietnam trusted Washington more than it trusted Communist China. Since then Vietnam’s military leaders have stopped raising the prospects of a U.S. war against Vietnam.

When CPV chief Trong visited the White House in July 2015 Vietnam wanted to add the attribute “extensive” to their “comprehensive partnership” a patent imitation of the “extensive strategic partnership” that Japan and Vietnam announced in March 2014. The plan was not adopted perhaps because Washington did not want a half-step. But trust between the two former enemies was bolstered enormously. The next year bilateral trust received another boost when then-President Barack Obama visited Vietnam and on the eve of his trip completely ended the U.S. arms embargo imposed against Vietnam since 1975.

Meanwhile China stepped up its encroachments into Vietnamese waters. After building large artificial islands in the Spratlys Beijing ratcheted up its harassment of Vietnam’s offshore hydrocarbon exploration forcing Hanoi to scrap new projects and pay dearly for contract breakage. By 2018 the Vietnamese Politburo greenlighted preparations for elevating ties with the United States to a formal strategic partnership. As the plans went President Nguyen Phu Trong would visit President Donald Trump in late 2019 and the two would announce the new designation. But Trong’s health issues intervened and his trip was postponed indefinitely.

When the White House changed tenants in January 2021 a new uncertainty shrouded the old plans. Being at the receiving end of China’s increasing aggression in the South China Sea Vietnam kept its hopes for an upgrade in U.S.-Vietnam ties. On more than one occasion senior Vietnamese diplomats publicly noted that the bilateral partnership was already “strategic in essence” despite being “comprehensive” in name.

The Biden administration also signaled its desire for a strategic partnership with Vietnam. Its Interim National Security Strategic Guidance issued in March 2021 named Vietnam as one of a few countries that Washington would focus on to “deepen our partnership … to advance shared objectives.” Testifying before the Senate on July 13 President Joe Biden’s nominee to be the next ambassador to Vietnam Marc Knapper said “Right now we have what we call a comprehensive partnership; we hope to raise it to a strategic partnership and I will take steps to do that by strengthening even further our security relationships with Vietnam.” Two weeks later Vietnamese leaders could hear this U.S. intention directly from visiting Secretary of Defense Austin. The momentum is now set for the two countries to announce their long overdue strategic partnership the next time their top leaders meet in person.

In the large scheme of things the strategic rivalries between the United States and China and between Vietnam and China continue to converge. Both the United States and Vietnam are among the countries most committed to preventing Chinese domination of Southeast Asia. Both are eager to maintain a rules-based international order in the South China Sea. And both are interested in restructuring the international supply chains to reduce excessive dependence on the Chinese market.

A strategic alliance between the United States and Vietnam is the logical result of this convergence. Its formal designation matters because it codifies commitment and helps domestic and bilateral coordination but it will lag behind the informal realities because of the need to minimize Chinese apprehension. The extent of the lag depends primarily on the intensity of the rivalries. Looking into the future as these rivalries are certain to grow U.S.-Vietnam relations may be elevated to a “comprehensive strategic partnership” within a decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PNC,PNC Financial Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2NvdmlkLXBwcC1sb2FuLWZvcmdpdmVuZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks Are Opting Out of the Government's PPP Loan Forgiveness Process,"At least three major banks have decided to opt out of a new process for getting Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven directly by the Small Business Administration The Intercept has learned leaving their small business customers with no other recourse if the banks refuse to forgive loans or drag out the process.

Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and PNC have all decided to opt out according to emails shared with The Intercept.

They are major players in the program which Congress created to offer businesses loans to spend on payroll and other qualified expenses to help weather the shutdowns. As of the end of May JPMorgan Chase was the top PPP lender followed by Bank of America in the No. 2 spot; PNC is No. 11. All told lenders representing just half of all outstanding PPP loan forgiveness applications have opted in according to the SBA.

PNC recently sent an email to Jesse Grund owner of personal training studio Unconventional Strength in Orlando Florida saying “Considering we have already built a streamlined end-to-end digital portal and associated review process for your PPP forgiveness application; we will be opting out of using the SBA’s forgiveness portal.”

Grund still hasn’t had his $5000 PPP loan forgiven and was instead told by PNC that his “Correct Maximum Loan Amount” was just $917 leaving him on the hook for the rest. “It’s PNC’s fault I got this money” he said. “Now you guys want to come back at me for it.”

Early in the pandemic small business owners were urged to flock to the Paycheck Protection Program. The loans were made with the promise that they would be forgiven and essentially turned into grants if used properly.

But many small business owners have struggled to get their loans forgiven by the banks that issued them. Banks were incentivized to issue PPP loans through the fees they generated but they don’t receive any fees to push forgiveness through and they’ve dragged their feet. Of the total PPP loans that have been issued less than half have been forgiven thus far.

In response the Small Business Administration the government agency tasked with running the program announced in late July that it would offer small business owners who took out PPP loans of $150000 or less a way to bypass intransigent banks and seek forgiveness directly from the agency. Congress had at one point late last year considered automatically forgiving all loans under $150000 but it never followed through.

But there was fine print in the SBA’s recent announcement that many may have missed: Banks actually have to opt into the direct process for small business owners to access it. And at least three major ones have refused.

“Forcing lenders to opt-in to the process could have been disruptive” said SBA spokesperson Terrence D. Clark in an email. He noted that lenders continue to opt in and that the agency is conducting outreach to encourage them to participate. “[W]e speak to lenders daily” he said. In a statement SBA Associate Administrator for the Office of Capital Access Patrick Kelley said “We encourage all lenders to opt-in to this tested portal.”

When asked for an explanation as to why the bank decided to bar its customers from the SBA’s direct forgiveness option a PNC spokesperson pointed to a statement that said “[L]enders that participate in the SBA’s forgiveness portal are still responsible for reviewing and issuing forgiveness decisions to the SBA. We would therefore still need to ensure borrowers meet loan eligibility and loan forgiveness requirements regardless of whether we chose to use the SBA forgiveness portal or not.”

Chase offered no explanation in its correspondence to its customers. In an email sent to a small business owner it said simply “[W]e’re continuing with our simple process and not participating in the new SBA direct program.” In response to a request for comment a Chase spokesperson said over email “Chase customers should submit their forgiveness applications through our platform” adding “We have a simple process that takes under 10 minutes to complete.”

For some business owners being cut off from the SBA’s direct program could mean they can’t get some or all of their loans forgiven at all. Some banks have been contacting small business owners in recent months and telling them that they shouldn’t have received the original amount they received — which the banks themselves approved — and requiring the owners to pay back the difference. But many told The Intercept that they used the money correctly and had fully expected to have their entire loans forgiven.

That’s what happened to Warren Davis owner of fundraising consultancy Warren Davis Consulting LLC who received his loan from Chase and was recently told the bank won’t let him seek forgiveness directly from the SBA. After the bank originally issued him a $6812 PPP loan he was later told he was only eligible for $1795.53 in forgiveness. Now he must pay Chase $460.01 on the first of every month with two years to pay the remainder of the loan off. “That loan payment is the second highest payment I now have besides my rent which is also due on the 1st” he said in an email. “I have tried trying to get answers numerous times from Chase with no luck over the months.”

In response to situations like Davis’s the Chase spokesperson said “Small businesses must meet the standards to qualify for forgiveness whether they go through their lender or directly through the SBA.”

When asked why Bank of America has opted out spokesperson Bill Halldin said “Because our portal is simplified and has been out there for six months” adding that if the bank opted in “we would have to develop a new interface.” The bank is reviewing whether to join the SBA’s process but “at this point our simplified portal is delivering what people want” he said.

But that portal is not delivering what Amy Yassinger needs. Yassinger owner of a music company that offers party bands for weddings in Illinois was encouraged by Bank of America to apply for a PPP loan early in the pandemic. The bank helped her with the process assuring her its underwriting team “would make sure everything was solid” she said in an email. She used the $38730 to pay employees as if they were working their regular slate of events despite widespread cancellations as well as to cover some nonpayroll expenses.

Yet 11 months after she got her loan the bank told her it would only submit $2436 to the SBA for forgiveness. “It was one thing to have my life completely gutted for over a year as my company was forced to cancel or postpone over 60 events in 2020” she said. “It is another to have Bank of America want $36000 out of $38730 back in the next 5 years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndic3Blbmd1aW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2luYXVndXJhbC1wZW5ndWlucy01ay1wcmVzZW50ZWQtYnktcG5jLWEtc3VjY2Vzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inaugural Penguins 5K Presented by PNC a Success,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.wbspenguins.com/2021/08/22/inaugural-penguins-5k-presented-by-pnc-a-success/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndic3Blbmd1aW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL2luYXVndXJhbC1wZW5ndWlucy01ay1wcmVzZW50ZWQtYnktcG5jLWEtc3VjY2Vzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

That old adage when it comes to old hot rods is especially true. While hot rod aesthetics and fashion have fluctuated over nearly 100 years the genre never gets old even as the rodding scene morphs and evolves.

We’ve come a long way baby. After WWII kids bought junkyard Fords and hopped ’em up with boneyard motors crudely built homemade parts and some Sombreros snagged from the Midnight Auto Supply store. With no aftermarket industry the guys had to be creative and most importantly put it together on the cheap. The result was rickety rides that no one but an 18-year-old would dream of strapping on and going 100mph. Yet these trailblazers are now legendary inspiring everything from music movies to greaser chic fashion.

Fast forward fifty years and a guy can aggregate an almost infinite assortment of the highest quality parts in the world to build a rod all you need is money. The possibilities are endless with a myriad of suppliers building bodies frames suspensions engines and gauges. The trick is combining these elements in a new and interesting way.

Add a famous hot rod shop to the equation and all of a sudden million-dollar hot rods are fairly common at car shows and auctions. A far cry from how it all began. The rat rod movement was a reaction to rich guys billet parts and unlimited budgets and brought the hobby full circle back to its roots.

Scott Sharrock’s 1932 Ford Roadster straddles both worlds. It isn’t a rat but it’s not a high-end trailer queen either. In fact not only is the car a multiple award winner but it’s been driven from Florida to California and regularly cruised and enjoyed. One look at the film of oil and dust on the engine and a paint chip here or there are tell-tale signs that this isn’t an AMBR contender. Christened “Mr.Reliable” it isn’t a “perfect” build. Think of a well-oiled broken-in baseball mitt and you get the idea.

Although Sharrock hailing from Lexington Ohio didn’t build the car (he bought it at a Mecum auction) he is a car guy through and through. His roots run deep and he won his first NHRA trophy when he was just sixteen years old. He’s been a drag racer for 60 years amassing dozens of victories running a 1972 Dodge Dart as well as racing dealer-backed Yamaha motorcycles in the Seventies.

He acquired the ’32 after an arrangement made by the former owner Edward Getzen and his best friend. They made a pact that if either died they would assist in selling each other’s cars and getting fair value for their wives. It’s a conversation all car guys need to have at some point as no one gets out of here alive. Getzen passed and is now burning rubber in hot rod heaven. Shortly thereafter that’s when our man Sharrock bought the car at auction.

The car was built by Takash Race Craft out of Florida over an 18-month period. A good foundation is critical and this ’32 has stout components. A rigid 1.5″ metal tube frame by Easyrider sports a stretched 106″ wheelbase and anchors the build.

Up front the car rides on a 6″ dropped Super Bell axle split wishbones chrome Panhard bar and Bilstein shocks. A Vega rack and pinion unit with an Ididit column update the steering.

Bringing up the rear is a Strange axle with a 9″ Ford rear with 3:70 gears. A four-link coil-over suspension with Aldan America shocks keeps everything tamped down. America Racing Torque-Thrust wheels 15×5″ up front and 11×17″ in the rear are wrapped in Nankang 135R15s and Falken 275/60/17s respectively. Four-piston brakes all the way around complete the rolling stock.

The car is powered by a 1995 355ci small-block Chevy built by Richard Childress Racing out of Lexington North Carolina. While not a fire-breather it pumps out a healthy 425hp and 390 lb-ft of twist. The roadster breathes deep via an Inglese intake with a custom-built eight stack fuel injection unit and exhales through Blockhugger headers and Flowmaster exhaust. The GM 400R4 automatic transmission was built by Takash Race Craft. This combo provides more than enough scoot for this little roadster.

From there a fiberglass Harwood ’32 roadster body stretched two inches was dropped onto the chassis. The tinted split windshield was laid back 30 degrees and framed with a custom surround built by Florida Roadster Shop. A metal hood with 90 louvers on each side and is secured with Bearclaw latches. The crowning touch is a fabric-covered Carson top with a 4″ haircut.

The plastic body was smoothed and massaged to glassy perfection by Hot Rod Parts Inc. and then sprayed out in PPG Ebony black by Pro Street Customs. Hi-Boy peepers light the way and ’49 Merc rear taillights add a nice bit of bling to the build.

Inside the cabin contrasting black and tan Ultra leather swath the seats door panels and one-off console. A custom metal dash a banjo steering wheel and seats are out of a Jaguar all play well together. The 2″ of interior space gained from the stretched body may seem incremental but as most roadster owners know more is more when it comes to hot rods and legroom.

Meanwhile Sharrock is having fun with the car. He constructed a building just to house it and tucks the roadster away during the winters. He loves cruising the car with his lovely wife Karen and while the car has garnered many ribbons and awards the couple is especially fond of the “Pick of the Litter” award they received at a car show that was sponsored by the Human Society.

For now the couple is enjoying and driving the car. With 18500 miles on the clock Sharrock looks forward to many more smiles and miles and that’s where Mr. Reliable easily lives up to his name.

As a 15-year-old growing up in Far Hills New Jersey in 1998 Jared Isaacman was ready for something different. He had enough of high school and saw his three older siblings — all at least 10 years older — leading more fun and interesting lives than him.

Boy was that about to change.

As it was Isaacman was more focused on making money with a computer repair and web design company that he and a friend started. Looking to drum up business he got a job at CompUSA thinking a giant computer retailer wasn’t a bad place to find customers. Not too long after one of those clients a credit card processing services firm called Merchant Services Inc. extended the teenager a full-time information technology job.

So at 16 Isaacman left high school got his GED and went to work for MSI. He wasn’t there long but the job gave him exposure to the payments industry showing him how clunky and neglected certain parts of it were especially for businesses simply looking to accept credit card payments. As Isaacman often does he saw opportunity.

That same year in 1999 he left MSI and started United Bank Card in his parents’ basement beginning his journey to transform the payments industry as a teenager who couldn’t yet qualify for his own credit card.

Today United Bank Card through rapid growth many acquisitions and some name changes too is Shift4 Payments a company with 1500 employees including about 500 at its headquarters in a nondescript brick office building at Lehigh Valley Industrial Park III in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

The 38-year-old Isaacman who lives in Palmer Township remains at the helm as CEO leading a company that with 7000 sales partners annually processes more than $200 billion in payments for 200000 businesses.

Jared Isaacman founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments.

And while Shift4 has plenty of Main Street customers the company lives more on the complex end of the spectrum targeting businesses such as large hotel chains ski resorts sports stadiums and casinos. All told more than 21000 hotels and 125000 restaurants in the United States use at least one of Shift4’s products.

“If you can run your entire business on an iPad like a food truck then that’s Square country” Isaacman said. “Our customers need like 20 different types of software to function.”

Payment volume suffered early in the pandemic but Shift4 started to see some recovery in the restaurant space as early as April 2020 which allowed it to proceed with an initial public offering two months later. When the company went public Isaacman became a billionaire via his 38% stake in the company. Today Forbes puts his net worth at about $2.4 billion.

Beyond the world of payments Isaacman is an accomplished pilot rated to fly several types of commercial and military aircraft. That passion led him to build Draken International a defense firm that trains Air Force pilots that Isaacman sold two years ago to Blackstone for nine figures.

And as he runs Shift4 which now has a market capitalization of $6.5 billion Isaacman also is preparing to launch into space next month as the commander of Inspiration4 the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth.

Even for Isaacman accustomed to working day and night since he was 16 he’s having to use all hours of the night and weekends to balance the responsibilities. He told The Morning Call during an interview last month that his Shift4 executive team is getting emails from him at 2 or 3 in the morning as he rotates between the payments business and his space-training schedule. He’s also squeezing in time with his wife Monica and his two daughters ages 5 and 7.

As for what comes next?

“Right now I’m really just focused on this mission because it’s so damn important” Isaacman said. “And really there’s some pretty unbelievable things we’ve been working on at Shift4 too that I think can be pretty transformational over the next year. So those are all top of mind but I’m sure there will always be something that comes next. But we’ve got enough on the plate right now.”

Despite the national attention Isaacman has received over the last year — he was featured in Forbes last fall after taking Shift4 public and the Inspiration4 crew made the cover of TIME magazine — many Lehigh Valley residents may not even know his name or realize he calls this area home. Residents may have however heard the company’s Harbortouch product mentioned on “Bar Rescue” after host Jon Taffer in 2017 endorsed the company’s touchscreen point-of-sale systems.

In the Lehigh Valley Shift4 is a large employer but certainly not as immediately recognizable as PPL Corp. Air Products or Mack Trucks. And while Isaacman spends a good portion of his time here and is building a home in Lower Nazareth Township many Lehigh Valley business nonprofit and economic development leaders have had a hard time getting his ear.

“We’re very glad that he’s chosen the Lehigh Valley for both his business and his home” said Don Cunningham president and CEO of Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. “He’s an exciting guy with a great company. We’re hopeful that someday he’ll become involved in the Lehigh Valley community.”

How Shift4 came here

It wasn’t until 2011 when the fast-growing United Bank Card made the move to the Lehigh Valley from Hunterdon County New Jersey.

In the years prior the company grew rapidly gaining trade publication attention as early as 2003 and launching a pioneering free terminal program a year later.

By 2005 United Bank Card made its debut on the Inc. 5000 — the magazine’s annual list of the country’s fastest-growing private firms — at No. 19 with revenue growth of 2319% between 2001 and ’04.

The company made it to No. 6 in 2006 the year Isaacman was featured on “American Story with Bob Dotson” on NBC. The host told the story per a transcript of the segment of a 23-year-old entrepreneur who employed 125 people bought his dad a Ferrari for Father’s Day and donated $24000 to a homeless shelter.

Things were rolling by the time the company in 2008 launched its Harbortouch point-of-sale system which handled magnetic card swipes and also included software for inventory management and merchandise pricing.

Amid the growth Isaacman said it was an easy natural choice to come to the Lehigh Valley.

For one the company needed to access a talent pool which meant either going east or west. As it was many of the company’s employees already were making the trip from Pennsylvania which also offered lower costs for United Bank Card.

The Lehigh Valley also had another advantage: Lehigh Valley International Airport the place where aviation enthusiast and pilot Isaacman learned to fly.

So the firm set up its headquarters at 2202 N. Irving St. in Hanover Township adjacent to the airport. The state chipped in a $778750 funding package.

In 2012 following the success of the company’s Harbortouch point-of-sale system United Bank Card rebranded as Harbortouch.

“United Bank Card I picked that name in 1999 because it sounded like an established financial institution and I was 16 years old in my parents’ basement so I needed a name like that” Isaacman said. “The moment we started building our own hardware and software and had our point-of-sale capabilities by 2008 that was the last message we wanted to send.

“We didn’t want to sound like an old and crusty financial institution. We wanted to sound like we were fast moving and that we had this killer technology that was also safe” he said.

In fall 2017 the company by then known as Lighthouse Network searched for a new headquarters location in the Lehigh Valley to house its growing workforce. The company looked at locations in Allentown including The Waterfront but early in 2018 decided to expand in place in Hanover Township.

“The reason we’re in our present facilities now and making do is because we didn’t leave ourselves enough time to transition to another facility” Isaacman said.

Shift4 Payments has its headquarters in Hanover Township Lehigh County.

Even before that decision the company continued getting larger.

Harbortouch acquired MSI — Isaacman’s old employer — in 2014 and two years later gained an investment from private-equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners to accelerate its growth plans.

Several acquisitions followed none more transformative than the January 2018 purchase of Shift4 Corp. a Las Vegas payment processing company that served tens of thousands of clients across North America including Choice Hotels Caesars Entertainment and the PGA Tour.

“We went from being able to process payments from four different types of software to 350 types of software in an industry that was moving rapidly toward integrated payments and software” Isaacman said. “It was a very important deal for us.”

With that deal complete Lighthouse Network rebranded as Shift4 Payments — a name Isaacman hopes sticks.

“But yeah 21 years of history we’ve had a couple name changes but it’s all based on just the evolution of the business” he said. “We just didn’t stay still and do the same thing that made us special 20 years ago and hope that would still carry the day five years later. We just evolved.”

Pandemic hits

It was Thursday March 19 2020 when Shift4 sent its office employees home the day Gov. Tom Wolf ordered the closure of non-life-sustaining businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Isaacman remembers walking down the rows of empty cubicles at the Lehigh Valley office wondering “Am I ever going to see anybody back here again?”

For Shift4 it was a shock. The company had spent the last decade predominately focused on serving restaurants and hotels — some of the hardest-hit industries. As the situation worsened Shift4 delayed its long-planned initial public offering.

“You go from a business that you built in your parents’ basement to something that people are saying ‘Wow this thing could be worth billions and billions of dollars in the public markets’ to ‘Everybody go home payment volume is virtually nonexistent the world is shut down’ ” Isaacman said.

“And you’re like ‘What just happened?’ We went from something to nothing pretty damn fast.”

Business took a major hit by late March 2020 when Shift4’s end-to-end payment volume — the dollar amount of card payments it authorizes and settles on behalf of merchants — tanked 70% according to the company’s annual report.

To bolster its finances Shift4 furloughed about 25% of its employees instituted a hiring freeze and reduced salaries for management.

At the same time the company raced to roll out new solutions for its customers especially restaurants as the world pivoted from dine-in to takeout and delivery.

For three months it waived online ordering mobile payment and gift card fees for restaurants. By the end of April it launched a free solution that enabled restaurants to publish an online ordering website in less than an hour. And by late June it introduced technology that allowed consumers to pay their bill at restaurants retailers and hotels by scanning a QR code on the receipt or terminal and completing the transaction on their phone.

Slowly but surely payment volume started recovering.

“What we saw even starting in the first week of April 2020 is people got to eat” Isaacman said noting the company logged year-over-year volume growth in June 2020 as it won market share from competitors.

And during the third quarter last year Shift4 reinstated “substantially all” of its workforce. It lifted the hiring freeze in August 2020 and fully reinstated management salaries in October.

Those optimistic signs early in the pandemic allowed Shift4 to move forward with its IPO in early June 2020 only a couple of months later than planned.

The company’s IPO was priced at $23 a share. Shift4’s shares opened the next day at $33.10 a 44% jump.

Where is it headed?

Shift4’s stock price has increased since eclipsing $100 in April and now trading around $80.

The company has continued to grow acquiring VenueNext in March for $72 million in cash and stock and bolstering Shift4’s presence in sports stadiums entertainment venues and theme parks. Shift4 also has inked deals this year with the San Diego Padres and the United Center home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks.

Shift4 Payments rings the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on June 3 in celebration of the one-year anniversary of its initial public offering.

And on June 22 Shift4 said it processed $1 billion in weekly end-to-end payment volume for the first time. For reference Isaacman said the company’s first billion-dollar year was 2004 and to hit $1 billion in just one week in 2021 means Shift4 has reached a compound annual growth rate of more than 26% for the last 17 years.

Shift4 also is coming off a second quarter in which it beat Wall Street’s expectations: The company logged gross revenue of $351 million net revenue of about $136 million and reported its first quarter of positive net income at $4.5 million.

Isaacman however is quick to point out the company on an earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or EBITDA basis has been profitable since 2004.

Shift4 also reported record quarterly end-to-end payment volume of $11.8 billion nearly three times the comparable period last year and more than double the same period in 2019.

That growth outpaced the roughly 30% jump in spending during the quarter — as compared to 2019 — from Visa and Mastercard users in the United States pointed out Darrin Peller managing director at Wolfe Research.

It’s even more noteworthy he noted when considering hotels a big business for Shift4 haven’t fully recovered yet.

For 2021 Shift4 is now forecasting end-to-end payment volume of $46 billion-$48 billion.

“In our view they’re doing very well and gaining quite a bit of market share” said Peller who analyzes the payments processing and IT services industries and covers Shift4.

And that growth should continue to funnel into the Lehigh Valley.

Isaacman pointed out he’s in the midst of a home construction process in Lower Nazareth that has been ongoing since before his 7-year-old daughter was born.

“So I’m very committed to my home being in the Lehigh Valley area and that Shift4’s headquarters will be in the Lehigh Valley area” he said.

But Isaacman hinted that it may not always be in its spot at 2202 N. Irving St. The company’s annual report shows that its lease at its 45840-square-foot headquarters expires Aug. 31 2025.

He admits the company’s Lehigh Valley office is “suboptimal” forcing Shift4 to pick up space in the general vicinity as needed. Shift4 he said also is thinking about what the post-pandemic workspace will look like.

“One of our hubs will always be here and I just can’t see us continuing for the long run to do this makeshift setup we have today” Isaacman said. “It’s going to be either some sort of a new build or a consolidation into a more modern fun facility for our employees.”

Thinking about where the company is many expansions later is still difficult for Isaacman to fathom. He reflects constantly going back and reading emails he wrote 15 or 20 years ago to replay a certain decision and think about what he could have done differently.

But there’s still no way the 16-year-old ambitious entrepreneur in his parents’ basement all those years ago could have guessed his future self would be a billionaire or a pilot readying to venture into space.

“I couldn’t have imagined that I would be sitting here in this situation I’m in today a year and a half ago let alone five 10 15 years ago” he said. “But I also would say I wasn’t either driven or motivated in any of those periods of times to be a billionaire or go to space. It was just ‘What is the challenge that we’re undertaking right now and how do we succeed at it?’

“It’s just that as you grow as an organization the challenges become bigger and the results if you do succeed become grander.”

Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year.

ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

4G LTE WiFi Modem unboxing

It’s a 3-in-1 device that works as a 4G USB dongle connected to a PC or laptop a 4G USB WiFi cellular router/hotspot and a USB flash drive when adding a MicroSD card.

4G performance is limited to 150Mbps DL 50Mbps UL while WiFi only supports up to 72 Mbps using 802.11n 2.4GHz WiFi. That’s perfectly fine for my use case as the plan is to use it as a standalone WiFi hotspot with an unlimited 10 Mbps SIM card and in locations with low population densities so 5GHz WiFi is not a must.

The USB dongle ships with a user manual in English mainly explaining how to install the driver when connecting it to a Windows 10 computer. Something we’ll not need here.

The bottom cover has credential information for the WiFi access point (SSID: 4G-UFI-XX password: 1234567890) and the web interface used for configuration( username: admin password: admin).

The MAC address prefix (381C23) reveals the manufacturer should be Hilan Technology CO.LTD a company based in Shenzhen China.

4G LTE WIFI modem teardown

Let’s open the device to check out the design and main components. We just need to remove three screws before popping up the two plastic shells.

There’s a sticky metal sheet on top that should act as a shield. We can remove it to reveal all components besides the Qualcomm RTR8605 RF Transceiver.

It’s a Qualcomm design but the markings for the main chip are all but gone. The memory chip should be SK Hynix H8ACS0PE0MBR-46M.

The other side of the board comes will plenty of passive components the SIM card and MicroSD card sockets and Qualcomm PM8028 for the power section of the circuit.

I also inserted the USB dongle into my PC:

We can see the Vendor ID is 05C6 the product ID is F000. There are some references on the OpenWrt website about people getting a 4G USB dongle working with an OpenWrt router not running OpenWrt directly on it. Nevertheless at least one of those posts mentions it’s based on a Qualcomm MDM9200 platform.

Using the 4G LTE WIFI Modem as a standalone mobile hotspot

Let’s try it out. I’ve inserted a nanoSIM card through a SIM card adapter…

and connected the device directly to a 5V USB power adapter.

I could not get an Internet connection the first time only WiFi as the SIM card was not detected. Removing it and re-inserting it did the trick and after connecting to the 4G UFI_XXX SSID I immediately got Internet access no configuration required at all.

That’s awesome. But let’s check out the web interface going to HTTP://192.168.100.1…





Not quite a modem responsive design web interface and it’s a pain to use on mobile so let’s switch to a desktop web browser instead.

Copyright “2014 Qualcomm”. This thing may run an old firmware from a Qualcomm SDK and they did not modify anything. Don’t expect much security from the dongle and it may be easy to hack. Let’s login.

There are five main items with Home 4G Settings Wi-Fi Settings Station and Help Information. The Home section shows the list of clients and data statistics.

Better change the admin password before checking out the 4G settings… Now that’s really odd because I’m based in Thailand and connect with a DTAC SIM card while here it shows the network as being “China Unicom (3gnet)”. The dongle will probably automatically acquire the right network name and APN but not update it in the settings.

As one should expect the interface will allow us to change the Network Name (SSID) as well as the password. After changing both clicking Apply and Reset it would still reconnect to the old SSID but removing and reinserting the dongle work and I could use the new credentials.

The reasons I decided to get this 4G USB dongle and WiFI hotspot are that it’s small and cheap (around $14 shipped) and I was not satisfied with the performance stability of using my Android phone as a WiFi hotspot and installing my SIM card into a PinePhone to use it as a mobile hotspot proved to provide good performance when it works but 4G would disconnect regularly requiring a reboot or several to get a connection.

As already mentioned I have a 10 Mbps data plan so I would have assumed the 4G USB WiFi dongle to reach 9 to 10 Mbps but it’s a disappointment.

Moving the USB dongle in the same room seems to improve things a bit but again short of expectations.

I’m now at home where I mostly use Fiber-to-the-Home (300/100Mpbs) but I’d usually get around 9-10 Mbps with Speedtest using my Android phone in another house where I don’t have broadband Internet. So for comparison let’s install the SIM card into the phone set it up as a hotspot and run Speedtest from my computer again.

The results are better although the upload speed is under 4 Mbps. Note that results vary quite a lot between runs.

[Update: August 26 2021. I’ve now moved to another location with a better cellular signal. 96% instead of 57% as shown on Pinephone and ran Speedtest again with the “4G LTE WiFi modem” router with the same SIM card and results are pretty good.

It’s maxing out the speed of the SIM card. So it looks like it’s just the dongle does not handle a relatively weak cellular signal well at least compared to a phone but when the signal is strong it performs as expected.]

Conclusion

The good things about the “4G LTE WiFi Modem” USB adapter are that it’s basically plug-and-play and when the cellular signal is good it works as expected and is just as good as a phone. Its low price is also a plus but note that it runs an outdated OS and performance is underwhelming when the cellular signal is not that strong compared to running the hotspot in a phone at the same location. The same device is sold on Aliexpress for $7.79 with a fair amount of reviews most of which are positive. But it looks like people are using it as a USB modem rather than a WiFi hotspot.

The first question you may have about Baseus’ 100W charger is why support Qualcomm Quick Charge 5 and not some other standard?

Quick Charge 5 is one of the industry’s most powerful energy-efficient and safest fast-charging standards on the market today. Qualcomm states that its latest technology is 10°C cooler as much as 70% more efficient and up to 4x faster than its previous solutions. As we know keeping temperatures low is very important to battery longevity during fast charging. In addition Quick Charge 5 supports a wide range of voltage current thermal and other protection layers ensuring that devices charge safely even at 100W.

Perhaps most importantly Quick Charge 5 is compatible with the tech industry’s most popular charging standards. It’s not some proprietary technology that only works with a limited number of phones and gadgets.

The protocol is backwards compatible with Qualcomm’s previous versions of Quick Charge ranging from Quick Charge 4+ to the classic and persistently popular Quick Charge 2 variant. Quick Charge 5 is also based on the USB Power Delivery PPS protocol. It can fast-charge gadgets that support this latest universal standard and the original USB Power Delivery standard.

In total Quick Charge 5 supports more than 250 mobile devices and over 1000 accessories. Compatible devices include the latest Samsung Galaxy S21 series Apple’s iPhone 12 range the Nintendo Switch MacBook Pro and many other gadgets with a USB-C port. It should be able to fast charge nearly any gadget you throw at it.

Everything you need to know about the charger

The Baseus 100W GaN II Fast Charger sports a single USB-C port that provides up to 100W of power using the Quick Charge 5 and the aforementioned compatible standards. That’s enough power for your smartphone or high-performance laptop. Baseus notes that its plug can fully charge a 96W MacBook Pro 16-inch in just two hours or charge a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra to 70% in just 30 minutes.

In addition the GaN II Fast Charger is built using Gallium Nitrate (GaN) components. GaN components are more efficient and allow for greater heat dissipation which combined with Quick Charge 5 support ensures the charger remains cool when delivering 100W of juice. GaN also allows the charger to be more compact and lighter than traditional models while also running cooler. Baseus’ GaN model is 40% smaller than its previous 96W charger.

For those after a one-stop charging solution for your smartphone laptop and more the Baseus 100W GaN II Fast Charger with Quick Charge 5 onboard has you covered. Alternatively the Baseus 100W 4-Port GaN II Charger which can charge four devices simultaneously is a great pick if you’re looking for a USB Power Delivery PPS charger that can power multiple devices at once.

Cherlynn Low spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 to determine who it’s really for. Terrence O’Brien compared and contrasted the Pixel 5a against previous versions to find out where the value lies in the upgraded model. Cherlynn also put the ASUS-Qualcomm Snapdragon smartphone through its paces to see how it stacks up against mainstream devices.

The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is now in the same price range as regular flagships

Engadget

Cherlynn Low was upfront about the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in her review. Not only is it the best foldable phone yet with a fast large screen neat software tricks and water resistance but it’s also now available at a (relatively) reasonable $1000. She says it’s basically a regular smartphone that folds in half with a satisfying snap. The stronger aluminum refined hinge and tough screen made it the first foldable she was willing to throw into a purse without worrying about scratching. She liked the widgets available for the Cover Display window the new color options and the Flex mode which assisted with one-handed use.

Despite that she still feels the Z Flip 3 is a hard sell. The battery life was woefully short and rarely lasted an entire day and the software was a bit buggy. While most apps fit nicely on the screen there was an occasional mismatch of aspect ratios that caused difficulties. For example the pop-up dialogs in Settlers of Catan disappeared into the edges of the display. Plus it was hard to find the benefit for more mainstream audiences who could purchase an iPhone or Samsung handset for the same price. For those who are nostalgic or curious enough to buy the Z Flip 3 they ‘ll find themselves with a capable device that has the best any foldable can offer.

Google’s Pixel 5a is an incremental (and somewhat boring) update

Engadget

Terrence O’Brien is quick to point out that the $449 Pixel 5a is a bit of a stop-gap: The Pixel 4a 5G was a solid offering and the Pixel 6 should be right around the corner. That being said there’s still a few things about the 5a that make it worth considering. While the 5a keeps the same processor RAM and camera experience as the previous version it adds IP67 water and dust resistance and an incredible battery. Terrence said the 4680mAh battery survived through nearly 23 hours of video play before powering down and was still at 40 percent after 24 hours of general heavy usage.

The rest of the features on the 5a include a metal unibody with a matte texture an upgrade to Gorilla Glass 6 and a 6.34-inch OLED panel with HDR support and 2400 x 1080 resolution. Terrence admits that the Snapdragon 765G processor is a bit outdated but also says that the 5a still felt responsive and quick while reading email or playing The Elder Scrolls: Blades. However it stuttered a few times while navigating YouTube and editing photos. The camera experience is also excellent though the same as the features on the 4a 5G: an 8-megapixel front-facing camera a 12.2-megapixel main lens and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle. Overall Terrence’s biggest objection to the 5a was that it was a bit boring in that it’s very close to a reproduction of the 4a 5G.

The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders truly isn’t for everyone

Engadget

Qualcomm and ASUS teamed up to create a smartphone for fans of the Snapdragon chipset but Cherlynn Low says it's a bit too niche to broadly recommend. With a 6.8-inch screen and weighing in at 210 grams this is one of the heavier phones that she’s tested recently — and its looks differentiate it from the competition. Cherlynn says its rounded-rectangle body matte blue finish and shiny red accents make it stand out but she was less fond of the illuminated icon on the rear which can glow on and off.

The rest of the $1499 device includes a 144Hz refresh rate display comprehensive 5G support and rapid charging. The AMOLED panel runs at a resolution of 2448 x 1080 and delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks. However the 20.4:9 aspect ratio cut off some content like the ends of longer messages in Telegram. The phone includes a pair of wireless Master and Dynamic earbuds to pair with Qualcomm’s High Dynamic Range Audio Record to support high-res 24-bit 96kHz audio. However there were several features that had yet to be released and the phone did tend to run hot. Cherlynn says unless you’re a big Qualcomm fan or really need the refresh rate you’ve got better options elsewhere.

Loupedeck Live is a control surface ideal for desktop apps

Engadget

First James Trew wants you to understand what the Loupedeck Live is: a Mac or PC control surface with multiple configurable dials and buttons. He also wants you to understand what it’s best for which is audio- or image-editing and a workflow of dynamic profiles. When using these profiles the Loupedeck will automatically switch to the assigned buttons and rotaries you’ve selected for that program. This means the Live is adaptive and will follow you with a variety of actions and choices as you navigate.

That puts it in contrast to the competition the Elgato Stream Deck which works as more of a program launcher. The Loupedeck Live offers three models of control surface with each being physically distinct and intended for different uses; James says the Live version looked good on his desk. He particularly liked the mini LCD displays on the buttons which show what each does and the rotary dials which he found useful for volume control or scrolling through a list. James felt the particular strength of the Loupedeck was the large amount of native-app support it offers — not only can it be helpful for streaming but it will also lend a hand when editing or designing a logo.

He told reporters Sunday that he woke up with a sore throat following the Titans’ 34-3 preseason win over the Bucs at Raymond James Stadium on Saturday night.

The worry for Tampa Bay is that Vrabel spent a lot of time last week with Bucs quarterback Tom Brady and his son Jack after joint workouts Wednesday and Thursday.

Vrabel also huddled with Brady and Bucs coach Bruce Arians prior to Saturday’s game. The meetings were outdoors but none of them were wearing masks. Vrabel and Brady were teammates with the New England Patriots.

Since Vrabel is vaccinated he will need two negative tests in 48 hours or he will have to quarantine for 10 days.

“We’ll be fine. We’ll figure this thing out” Vrabel said. “I don’t think anyone who has tested this morning has tested positive.”

Last October the Titans were fined $350000 for COVID-19 protocol violations. Between Sept. 24 and Oct. 11 the Titans had 24 members of their organization test positive for COVID-19. As a result of their positive tests the team’s Week 4 game vs. the Steelers was postponed until Week 7 and the team’s Week 5 game against the Bills was moved from Sunday Oct. 11 to Tuesday Oct. 13.

So far the Bucs say they have had no recent positive tests for COVID-19. Florida reported a little more than 150000 new cases of COVID over the past week.

“Big big biggest game of the year — tonight” Gronkowski says with a smile as he walks into Raymond James Stadium.

Gronkowski and fellow starters won’t play against the Tennessee Titans after two physical and heated joint practices on Wednesday and Thursday. Hence it really isn’t the biggest game of the year for the starters. Gronkowski and Tom Brady notably weren’t in uniform for the game. Punter Bradley Pinion served as the captain for the game per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times.

For many other Bucs players the game might as well be the Super Bowl as they compete for roster spots. Joey Knight of the Tampa Bay Times coined the name “Bubble Bowl” for the Bucs-Titans clash as players look to survive the upcoming cuts from 85 to 53 players over the next two weeks.

Knight noted that “competition remains furious at a number of positions where several are competing for only one or two available depth-chart spots.”

He notably highlighted the injury-riddled offensive line as one spot where new additions Brandon Walton Jack Benzinger and Earl Watford hope to make a splash quickly. Nick Leverett has also shown promise in camp per Knight.

Other key positions battles Knight highlighted included cornerback inside linebacker and defensive line. He added that quarterback running back and wide receivers are basically set in stone.

Five Fights Break Out at Bucs Joint Practice

If resting starters wasn’t already on Bucs head coach Bruce Arians’ radar the fights that broke out in Thursday’s practice with the Titans arguably confirmed the decision.

“Really pleased with the work we’ve gotten the last two days — extremely good competition” Arians said about the joint practices on Thursday. “Obviously it always happens when the flyers and the gunners get together something starts. But it was spirited it was great practice and I really appreciate the Titans for coming down here and helping us get better and hopefully we made them better.”

Arians denied the fights including the one involving Antonio Brown which led to the star wide receiver’s brief exit.

“Fighting? I didn’t see any fighting” Arians said. “A lot of pushing and shoving but I didn’t see any fists thrown.”

Even a direct question by the media didn’t get Arians to acknowledge Brown’s actions.

“Nah waving flies” he told the media.

Notably the players involved in the fights can’t get penalized by the league according to Greg Auman of The Athletic.

Gronkowski: ‘It Was a Great Decision’

Going into his second season with the Bucs Gronkowski called it “a great decision” to return to the NFL in 2020 after a year away from the game in retirement. He joined the Bucs via a trade with the New England Patriots the month following the signing of Brady in free agency.

“It was a great decision and I’m definitely glad I’m still playing. It’s a grind at times but overall it always pays off” Gronkowski said per Pro Football Talk.

Gronkowski dealt with a myriad of injuries during his time with the Patriots but he saw a resurgence in health with the Bucs.

“I’ve been here all offseason and now for camp and I feel like I’m doing a lot better this year for sure” Gronkowski added per Pro Football Talk. “Conditioning wise coming off a year and not playing and then heading into a camp like this it’s hard work. … It’s night and day from where I was last year in training camp to where I am now.”"

Graphics cards are still quite difficult to purchase at reasonable prices in most regions but the month of August in particular has seen a number of developments that are worth talking about.

Updated: See our latest GPU Pricing Update here.

The market is still facing complications that are affecting GPU prices. If you're new to this series in previous articles we've described this as a multi-factor situation. Many people are quick to place all the blame on one area or another but the reality is there are many contributing factors. As we sit here in August high demand for gaming GPUs cryptocurrency mining supply shortages for key graphics card components limited wafer allocations at fabs logistics issues due to the global pandemic tariffs and several other reasons are all contributing to the current state of the market. It's a complicated situation.

A couple of weeks back we ran a survey asking HUB's YouTube community what factor you blame the most for current GPU prices. 41% of people responded that global supply constraints for components was the main driver while a further 32% placed the most blame on cryptocurrency mining. Indeed these two factors appear to be the most significant at play at the moment. Interestingly though only 5% of users thought high demand from PC gamers was to blame.

Let's talk about what's happened this month. The launch of the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT took place which I think is fair to say received only lukewarm reception. A high MSRP positioning it as a ""1080p GPU"" and issues with a limited x8 PCIe bus. There was some hope that a new mid-range GPU would help shift graphics card prices lower but are we seeing that in the market today?

From certain angles the answer is yes. As we talked about in our recent investigation of whether AMD lied about 6600 XT's ample stock and availability the 6600 XT actually launched in reasonable quantities far higher than any other recent GPU launch. This means that if you do want to spend around the $400 to $500 mark depending on where you live it's now easier to buy a GPU. In Australia it's been 10 days since launch and you can still find 6600 XTs for as little as $680 AUD which is $100 above the local MSRP but significantly cheaper than Nvidia's RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti.

It's unlikely we'll see these GPUs hit the MSRP again soon with retailers describing this $680 price as more the ""true"" MSRP based on the shipments they are seeing. And as we discussed at length in the 6600 XT availability investigation despite these seemingly attractive prices 6600 XTs aren't exactly flying off shelves since it doesn't offer killer value or performance compared to what you've been able to buy for the past few years.

We're also starting to see some movement on pricing for graphics cards around the 6600 XT. In particular we're seeing increased shipments of GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPUs with LHR (Lite Hash Rate). We've seen many more limited runs of cheaper 3060 Tis in the past few weeks than in prior months which seems to be Nvidia's response to the 6600 XT. It's been pretty crazy to see some RTX 3060 Ti models available for less than the current going price for the RTX 3060 and retailers are telling us that as soon as they get stock they can price below $720 they just fly off shelves.

The RTX 3070 and 6700 XT remain quite expensive and higher end models are either completely unavailable or still sitting on shelves at ridiculously inflated prices. That's something to keep an eye on in upcoming months.

We also surveyed users about the position you are currently in with your GPU. A higher proportion than ever have said they have managed to buy a current-gen GPU. Of the respondents that do want to upgrade and aren't fine with their current GPU just under half have been able to buy a new GPU while around 40% are still waiting for price reductions. A further 11% of this group said there are no GPUs in their price range indicating they are waiting for more entry-level cards to hit the market like a GeForce RTX 3050-type product.

Ethereum on the Rise

Other major updates this month concern the cryptocurrency market and crypto mining. We don't want to spend ages talking about mining since a lot has been going on but we'll quickly summarize the key points on how this is affecting GPU pricing.

The price of popular coins such as Ethereum has risen substantially in the past month. Before we were looking at a price a little below $2000 now it's above $3000. Crypto is as always volatile but the rough gains we are seeing month on month are 60% for this currency and similar for others. These gains have flattened out a bit over the last week.

Ethereum pricing chart

With gains in value come gains in difficulty. Ethereum difficulty has spiked recently to a near record level reducing block rewards for miners. Miners are getting less Ethereum from mining though the value of those coins has increased as well as the interest in mining.

Affecting Ethereum mining this month was the rollout of the new EIP1559 protocol upgrade. If you wonder how this affects mining revenue the answer is simple: due to the way it burns transaction fees the upgrade reduces the payout to miners for processing transactions. Like with difficulty spikes while the reward in Ethereum is now lower the value of Ethereum has increased so it's a tug-of-war situation.

Software developers have also found a way to partially bypass the limit on Nvidia's Lite Hash Rate GPUs increasing the cap on Ethereum mining performance from 50% to 70%. LHR cards still are less desirable for mining compared to the non-LHR variants but are more desirable than before.

The final point to talk about with mining is that with all these recent updates – higher Ethereum prices but lower payouts and all of that – actually mining Ethereum isn't always what miners are doing on their GPUs. On some cards coins such as Raven or Ergo have been more profitable though as more people jump on these coins difficulty spikes on those coins too and so on.

Bottom line about GPU mining right now the value of crypto has gone up significantly around 60% but the profitability of mining has risen to a more modest degree around 20 to 30% month on month. Combined with the release of the 6600 XT and increased GPU supply how has that affected the GPU market?

The Scalper Market

Much to our surprise the scalper market on eBay has remained relatively flat comparing completed sales from the past week to the same time last month. With a big spike in coin value I was expecting the market to react in a more dramatic way similar to what we saw back in May when GPU prices were at their worst. But that hasn't been the case with most GPUs only fluctuating in price by a few percent.

Of course there are outliers. The GeForce RTX 3070 was the most in-demand card in August with prices rising the most of any current generation Nvidia GPU. Meanwhile the RTX 3060 Ti went in the opposite direction with a 6% price cut on average due to what appears to be the influx of LHR-limited models.

The AMD RX 6900 XT increased the most in price possibly due to a greater than expected drop in price last month. The card with the most volume and in close competition to the RTX 3070 the Radeon RX 6700 XT increased in price by 8 percent. Meanwhile the scalper volume of AMD's higher end GPUs is very low suggesting that AMD is mostly making their mid-range offerings at the moment.

While these numbers are an aggregate of all new GPUs sold through eBay in the last month there's a difference in price between LHR and non-LHR cards so if you are a gamer that doesn't care about mining there is a chance that GPUs have gotten cheaper for you.

MSRP eBay Average Price June eBay Average Price July eBay Average Price August Current Price Inflation Price Increase July to August Radeon 6900 XT $1000 $1932 $1460 $1622 62% 11% Radeon 6800 XT $650 $1450 $1282 $1268 95% -1% Radeon 6800 $580 $1210 $1087 $1127 94% 4% Radeon 6700 XT $480 $907 $733 $793 65% 8% Radeon RX 6600 XT $380 $633 67% Average 92% 5%

The most stark difference is seen with the RTX 3060 Ti. The average sale price on eBay for this GPU was $950 while most LHR cards were selling for around $850. However if you want a non-LHR model like the Founders Edition card and others you're looking at having to spend at least $1250. That's a 47% price hike for 43% higher mining performance after factoring in the latest LHR bypasses.

It's similar for models like the RTX 3080. The average sale price is currently $1643 however LHR cards are going for $1400 to $1500 while non-LHR variants are in the $1800+ range. For gamers there is no reason to spend that extra money on the non-LHR variant because the LHR cards are identical for gaming.

The Impact of Lite Hash Rate (LHR)

We recently received an Asus TUF Gaming RTX 3080 LHR variant to test and Steve found it was the same as the non-LHR card in gaming performance with the same cooler design and thermals. This works across most LHR GPUs and with the majority of new GeForce GPUs hitting the market now being LHR variants there's nothing to worry about for gamers.

The discrepancy between LHR and non-LHR pricing is also why we see odd pricing trends for example it explains why the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 are relatively poor value while the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3080 are looking better. The tide seems to have shifted for the 3060 Ti and 3080 to being mostly LHR releases while there are still lots of non-LHR 3060 and 3070s being sold. Nvidia says the vast majority of GPUs moving forward will be LHR variants which will hopefully see prices continue to decline over time.

What happens in the new GPU market is usually reflected in the used market and that's also true this month.

Used GPU Pricing

Pricing for Nvidia's RTX 20 series were relatively flat month on month after two consecutive months of double-digit price drops. For some reason the RTX 2080 Ti increased in price by 10 percent however most other GPUs in the line-up saw no price difference. A similar observation can be made for the GeForce 16 series where most cards saw virtually no price changes. This is where having a lot of RX 6600 XTs at MSRP would be nice as those with GTX 1660s could upgrade at virtually no cost after selling their old GPU.

MSRP eBay Average Price June eBay Average Price July eBay Average Price August Current Price Inflation Price Increase July to August GeForce RTX 2080 Ti $1000 $1219 $952 $1043 4% 10% GeForce RTX 2080 Super $700 $887 $788 $802 15% 2% GeForce RTX 2080 $700 $834 $686 $703 0% 2% GeForce RTX 2070 Super $500 $784 $638 $667 33% 5% GeForce RTX 2070 $500 $678 $603 $614 23% 2% GeForce RTX 2060 Super $400 $707 $613 $615 54% 0% GeForce RTX 2060 $350 $549 $476 $482 38% 1% Average 24% 3%

In the older GeForce 10 series prices have risen slightly across the board particularly for the higher end models like the GTX 1080 Ti. However the mid-priced options like the GTX 1070 Ti remain largely unchanged. It also appears that the volume of these older GPUs being sold is slowly reducing as first-time owners upgrade to newer GPUs.

Then we get to AMD's Radeon RX 5000 series and like in prior months it makes absolutely no sense for a gamer to consider these GPUs as a used upgrade option. The prices of cards like the 5700 XT remain high as the RDNA architecture is good for mining punching well above its weight. If owners of the 5700 XT haven't already upgraded to something like the RX 6700 XT basically for free then they should be seriously considering it if gaming is their primary use for these cards.

The volume of AMD's older high-end cards like Vega 56 and 64 has fallen away in the last few months. This month prices have risen substantially as they are capable mining GPUs. Meanwhile in the lower part of the market prices have risen somewhat for cards like the RX 580 8GB though not to a more significant degree than other GPUs. It's still the case today that if you have $300-400 to spend and desperately want a GPU you're much better off buying a GTX 1060 6GB than you are getting an RX 580 8GB with the RX 580 a more powerful and more sought-after card for mining.

The State of the GPU

For the most part GPU prices are still terrible and very poor value and unfortunately throughout the last month we didn't see any further reductions to GPU prices on the used or scalper markets. This is disappointing for all those gamers that are still waiting for better GPU prices before they jump in and make a purchase.

And while GPU prices haven't fallen they haven't increased substantially either which I take as a positive considering cryptocurrencies have seen a surge. With Ethereum prices skyrocketing this month and profitability up not just for Ether but other coins as well seeing this reflect only stagnation on GPU prices rather than a massive spike is good news.

There are a few other glimmers of positivity here. Nvidia is clearly transitioning significant portions of their GPU offerings to LHR GPUs which are now forming the majority of sales for some graphics cards such as the RTX 3060 Ti. Even with the latest developments raising the LHR limit cap these cards are more accessible and affordable for gamers. The LHR program has received its share of criticism but it will be interesting to hear from actual users what you think of it now that it seems to be helping lower GPU prices.

Based on what we've seen so far in 2021 GPU prices may continue to slowly fall over the next few months but there's still the question if pricing will ever return to MSRP levels and if that's even achievable until component shortages and ridiculous logistics costs settle down.

However today there's a clearer path to better GPU prices and room for prices to finally go down. Nvidia needs to keep shipping only LHR GPUs to manufacturers. Miners may hate it but cards with reduced mining performance are better for gamers and there's always the uncapped RTX 3090 if you need something without restrictions.

AMD also has a role to play here. The Radeon RX 6700 XT and 6600 XT are currently the two best value GPUs for cost per frame which I believe has led to the gears finally ticking over on RTX 3060 Ti production – the great pressure of competition. While these GPUs have far from a perfect price tag especially the 6600 XT if AMD can pump these out and keep prices closer to the MSRP this will have beneficial effects across the market.

Intel's Flagship ARC Graphics Cards With Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU To Be Highly Competitive Against NVIDIA GA104 & AMD Navi 22

The first Intel ARC graphics cards will be powered by the Alchemist GPUs based on the Xe-HPG architecture. Intel has so far confirmed that the first discrete graphics cards will hit retail by Q1 2022 and will be based on the TSMC 6nm process node. Intel also detailed the specifications of Alchemist GPUs and the core building blocks which include the Xe-Core.

Intel ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU - The Building Blocks

So rounding up what we learned the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU features a Xe-Core which is the fundamental DNA of the 1st Gen ARC lineup. The Xe-Core is a compute block that is composed of 16 Vector Engines (256-bit per engine) and 16 Matrix Engines (1024-bit per engine). Each Vector Engine is composed of 8 ALUs so in total we are looking at 128 ALUs per Xe-Core. Each Matrix Engine block is also referred to as an XMX block which will handle tensor operations in both FP16 and INT8 modes. The Xe-Core further features its own dedicated L1 cache.

Intel fuses four Xe-Cores together to form a Render Slice which is composed of 4 Ray Tracing Units four Sampler Units Geometry/Rasterize/HiZ engines and two Pixel Backend blocks with 8 units on each. These Render Slices are put together to form the main GPUs. The flagship is composed of an 8 Render Slice configuration which features 32 Xe-Cores 512 Vector Engines and 4096 ALUs. There will be different configurations with 2 4 6 Render Slices but we are focusing on the flagship part in this report.

Intel ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU - Comparing It To NVIDIA's GA104 & AMD's Navi 22

A rundown of the specifications and comparison has been made by 3DCenter which gives us an idea of the theoretical performance that Intel's new GPU will have to offer. So right off the bat Intel's ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist flagship will offer more TMUs and ROPs than the NVIDIA and AMD competition. The core count at 4096 is higher than AMD's Navi 22 Navi 21 (RX 6800) but lower compared to NVIDIA's GA104. NVIDIA is using a dual FP32 numbering methodology and should theoretically be 3072.

Intel's ARC Alchemist GPUs have lower ray tracing units than the competition but we don't know exactly how their Ray tracing implementation works. For example while Navi 22 offers more RT cores than the GA106 Ampere GPUs the hardware-level integration within NVIDIA's RT cores is superior in all regards to AMD's implementation. So the final performance would depend upon Intel's hardware-level integration and software-level optimization for ray tracing applications.

A major lead that Intel could have over the competition especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology and based on the expected numbers Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.

Lastly the theoretical FP32 compute performance is computed with an expected peak clock rate of 2 GHz. That's the most likely scenario for TSMC's 6nm process node given how well clocks scale on TSMC's 7nm process node. Based on that the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU could offer around 16-17 TFLOPs of Compute power. This is slightly lower FLOPs than what NVIDIA's GA104 produces but it should be noted that not all FLOPs should be measured equally as gaming architecture runs very different compared to datacenter chips.

Based on these early specifications we are looking at an Intel graphics card that could end up being faster than AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT and NVIDIA's RTX 3070 with ease. To push its 1st Gen graphics cards further into the consumer segment Intel may likely offer very competitive prices against established giants like AMD and NVIDIA. And along with a strong suite of software-level optimizations they might have a win-win in their hands which will only be pushed forward with future generations of ARC GPUs.

Ron DeSantis Is Regeneron Investor,"MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) -- As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criss-crosses the state opening monoclonal antibody treatment centers using Regeneron as a post-exposure prevention for COVID-19 he is also being criticized because one of his top donors is a Regeneron investor.

According to the Associated Press filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show Citadel a Chicago-based hedge fund has $15.9 million in shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as well as options to buy its stock.

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has donated $10.75 million to a political committee that supports DeSantis. He also donated $5.75 million in 2018 and $5 million last April.

Citadel's investment in Regeneron is a tiny fraction of its overall $39 billion in investments but if the stock price were to go up Citadel would benefit. DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw points out that Citadel has far greater investments in Moderna and Pfizer which manufacture COVID-19 vaccines.

But the relationship has generated a buzz on social media as Democrats question the relationship.

""Claiming that there is somehow 'corruption' by promoting the baseless political narrative that Governor DeSantis supports Regeneron over COVID vaccines (completely false but that is another topic) is not even logically consistent when you examine the SEC filing"" Pushaw said in an email. ""Citadel holds far more shares of Pfizer and Moderna than Regeneron.""

DeSantis announced on Wednesday the opening of another monoclonal antibody treatment center at C.B. Smith Park in Pembroke Pines. Another site is opening on August 21 at Tropical Park in Southwest Miami-Dade. The state plans to have 21 open by next week.

Experts say the drug is an effective treatment for COVID-19 if people receive treatment soon after testing positive.

It helps keep people out of overcrowded hospitals but experts say vaccines not treaments for people after they get sick are the best way to do that.

The Regeneron drugs when given within 10 days of initial symptoms have been shown to cut rates of hospitalization and death by roughly 70%. The vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. have been proven in large real-world studies to be 95% effective against hospitalization.

""It is safe effective and free of charge to all patients in Florida. This should not be a political issue -– it's about saving lives"" Pushaw said.

The federal government is paying for the monoclonal antibody treatments and patients aren't being charged for the antibody cocktail.

The Citadel CEO a billionaire has donated tens of millions of dollars to other conservative candidates and political committees across the country. He was raised in Florida and is building an oceanfront mansion near Trump's Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago resort.

Citadel declined to comment.

Greg Abbott announces negative COVID results on Twitter,"Gov. Greg Abbott took to Twitter late Saturday afternoon to announce that he is now testing negative for COVID-19.

""I am told that my infection was brief and mild because of the vaccination I received"" Abbott said in a video announcement posted to the social media service.

He encouraged ""others who have not yet received the vaccine to consider getting one.""

The Republican leader said that his wife first lady Cecilia Abbott continues to test negative for the virus.

Abbott who was fully vaccinated tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday according to his office. His spokesperson Mark Miner said Abbott was asymptomatic but received Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment while isolating at the Governor's Mansion.

Abbott said he will continue to quarantine per doctor's orders while he keeps working on issues affecting Texans ""including opening infusion centers for antibody therapy treatment across the entire state of Texas.""

Regeneron's monoclonal antibodies are a treatment that helps keep those at risk for severe illness out of the hospital.

Medical experts have told the American-Statesman that the treatment must be given before symptoms worsen to the point of a patient being hospitalized. Like the vaccine the government is offering the treatment for free though it's available only to those with a doctor's referral.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxlZGdlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL2Rlc2FudGlzLWFubm91bmNlcy1tb25vY2xvbmFsLWFudGlib2R5LWNsaW5pYy1sYWtlbGFuZC84MjI4Mjg2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakeland's monoclonal antibody clinic opens; treatment against COVID,"LAKELAND — Gov. Ron DeSantis came to Lakeland on Saturday morning to announce the opening of a monoclonal antibody clinic in Polk County.

The clinic is set up at Lakes Church 1010 E. Memorial Blvd. and will be open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. DeSantis said the clinic has the capacity to treat more than 300 patients per day using Regeneron.

Treatment will be available free of charge to all individuals who are at risk of hospitalization from the COVID-19 virus regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status DeSantis said. Those seeking treatment at the state clinics should have a positive COVID test or have a high risk and confirmed exposure to the virus.

""It has been used by health systems in most parts of the state pretty consistently however it's something a lot of people didn't know about"" the governor said. ""We are helping raise the visibility of it.""

The state has opened at least a dozen monoclonal antibody clinics so far including Lakeland as of Saturday. Other nearby locations are: Camping World Stadium in Orlando and Kings Forest Park in Tampa. Later Saturday DeSantis was Manatee Memorial Hospital in Bradenton to open another site. DeSantis has promised to offer 15 to 20 sites across the state by early next week so the vast majority of residents have easy access to a clinic.

""The vast majority of Floridians age 50 and above qualify for this treatment one way or another"" he said.

The governor had Florida's Surgeon General Scott Rivkees issue an order that allows people to receive monoclonal antibody treatment at state clinics without first obtaining a doctor's prescription — often required at many hospitals and private clinics.

Regeneron approved in 2020 for emergency use

Regeneron was approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 last year — like each of the available vaccines. The medication can be given to patients via IV infusion or a series of four shots two to the stomach area and one in each arm prior to the development of serious symptoms. State clinics will administer the drug via shots in order to treat more patients efficiently DeSantis said.

""The key here is early treatment"" he said. ""If you wait till you are really really sick and need hospitalization or intensive care these antibodies have missed opportunity to do what they need to do.""

Monoclonal antibody treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by approximately 70% according to the governor and has been effective against the highly contagious Delta variant.

""At least 90% of patients admitted for COVID did not receive early monoclonal antibody treatment. Had a lot of patients gotten this many would not be admitted in the first place"" DeSantis said.

AdventHealth and Lakeland Regional Health have been reporting record-high levels of COVID hospitalizations. Their numbers are more than double what was seen during the last surge in mid-January.

Gov. DeSantis: Northeast Fla. has seen decline in admitted patients

DeSantis said the northeast area of the state where the first monoclonal antibody clinics were opened have seen a decline in their numbers of admitted patients. The governor said he has ""great reports"" out of Jacksonville the second site to open.

Those interested in getting monoclonal antibody treatment can go to patientportalFl.com to register online find nearly sites and make an appointment. The online portal requires people to enter their name address contact information and answer demographic questions. It requests individuals provide their health care insurance information so the state may qualify to have treatment costs reimbursed by FEMA but people can decline to answer.

The Florida Department of Health's website at floridahealthcovid19.gov also provides a link for people to find either state-run or local health care providers offering the monoclonal antibody treatment.

Lakeland Regional Health has been offering the monoclonal antibody treatment since at least November. Danielle Drummond LRH's president and CEO recently said it is treating approximately 60 patients per day.

Florida Sen. Kelli Stargel R-Lakeland was on hand Saturday morning to thank DeSantis for opening a clinic in Lakeland given the stress local hospitals are under.

""Thank you for having a multifaceted approach to how we approach this"" she said.

Stargel encouraged individuals who feel comfortable getting the vaccine to go out and get vaccinated. She also asked people to do their part be compassionate to others and wear a mask if they go someplace where they could get infected or infect others with the virus.

NEW YORK — Editor's note: The video above is from a previous story.

Twitter suspended the account of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary for violating rules on “abusive behavior” after The Associated Press said her conduct led to a reporter receiving threats and other online abuse.

The DeSantis aide Christina Pushaw saw her account locked for 12 hours a Twitter spokeswoman said.

Earlier Friday incoming AP CEO Daisy Veerasingham wrote to DeSantis asking him to end Pushaw’s “harassing behavior.”

“This is unacceptable behavior from a government employee especially one whose job it is to work with the media and communicate with the public” Veerasingham said in the letter The Washington Times reports.

According to AP they are seeking to fight online bullying against journalists a growing trend that is often triggered by public figures.

Pushaw denied trying to direct the governor’s followers to target AP’s reporter despite retweeting his article and writing “drag them” in a now-deleted post.

Pushaw had objected to Tuesday’s story by AP’s Tallahassee Florida-based reporter Brendan Farrington which pointed out that one of DeSantis’ multimillion-dollar donors invests in a company making the COVID-19 treatment drug Regeneron reports AP.

She says she deleted the tweet because she did not mean “drag them” as a threat.

The Urban Dictionary defines “drag them” as to roast make fun of or mock someone very hard. Its use seems to imply or encourage people to go on the attack in a way that’s just shy of being direct PEN America's Program Director for Digital Safety and Free Expression Viktorya Vilk said to AP."

ResMed’s total revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $3.2 billion — an 8% increase from the previous year.

The San Diego life science company’s quarterly dividend increased by 8% to $0.42 per share. According to the fourth quarter earnings for the period ending June 30 income from operations increased 8%.

A recent recall for a competitor’s ventilators as well as ResMed’s launch of a new sleep apnea machine have created an opportunity for the company to capitalize on growth beyond the fourth quarter.

Industry Outlook

In June Phillips (NYSE: PHG) recalled millions of sleep apnea and ventilator devices for safety concerns. Following this announcement ResMed’s CEO Mick Farrell made a statement reiterating the safety of their products and assured customers that they were preparing for an increased demand for ResMed devices.

“I want to reassure our patients providers physicians and communities that ResMed devices are safe to use and are not subject to Philips’ recall” Farrell wrote in a July 14 statement. “At this time of considerable increase in demand for ResMed products we are doing everything we can to increase our manufacturing of sleep and respiratory care devices so we can get them to the patients who need them most.”

In response to analysts’ questions about the Phillips recall and supply chain constraints brought on by the coronavirus pandemic Farrell said he expects the company to continue growing and accelerate its product flow in the first half of 2022.

“We’re doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the past the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale” Farrell said. “We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022…We do see room for expansion of supply ahead.”

He added that based on ResMed’s latest supply chain information and analysis they could add up to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 which exceeds their initial growth projections.

“Looking ahead we are confident in our ability to grow steadily through our fiscal year 2022 and to deliver for all our stakeholders” Farrell said. “We’re driving accelerated adoption of digital health solutions in sleep apnea COPD and out-of-hospital care accelerating our ResMed 2025 strategy.”

New Product Rollout

ResMed launched a new positive airway pressure (PAP) device called the AirSense 11 for the U.S. market on Aug. 17. Digital health and customized care are the way of the future and play into the design of the AirSense 11 which features a touch screen and connects to a patient’s smartphone to help the hundreds of millions of people who struggle with sleep apnea seamlessly manage their therapy.

Jim Hollingshead president of ResMed’s Sleep and Respiratory Care business said that this product was rolled out in a new way to accommodate recent demand for its products following the Phillips’ product recall and added supply chain challenges.

This situation has created an increased demand for ResMed’s products and while they have the manufacturing capability to meet this moment Hollingshead said the supply chain constraints brought on by the pandemic have made it difficult for companies across many industries to secure electronic components.

With this in mind ResMed adjusted its strategy and initiated a “controlled extended product launch” for the AirSense 11. Typically the company would ramp up production of the new product and allow inventory of the previous model to “fade out” but given the constraints in supply Hollingshead said they pulled the launch of AirSense 11 up a bit to have a steady controlled release.

Hollingshead said that he expects sales to go up for their new product similar to the AirSense 10 which “changed the paradigm in the industry.”

“We saw a big benefit when we launched AirSense 10 and we do anticipate a real benefit with AirSense 11” Hollingshead said. “We hope to take market share with the launch of this product and to have revenue growth…we had pretty significant growth when we launched AirSense 10.”

A comeback loss infamous enough to claim the ""28-3"" scoreline as an Easter egg the game was especially bitter for Alford remembering a karmic Falcons celebration at halftime.

As the 2016-2017 Falcons cleared the field for a halftime performance from Lady Gaga alleged baroness they began claiming victory in the locker room — mistaking two quarters of football and a 25-point advantage as a sufficient stronghold versus Brady-Belichick’s Patriots.

Per the Arizona Sports story Alford’s current Cardinals teammate Malcolm Butler spoke on the DB’s story. Butler was also part of the winning Patriots squad at Super Bow LI:

""I talked to him about (that Super Bowl) I asked him if he wanted his ring back. He told me a story he said he was in the locker room at halftime he told me he was about to pop a bottle and things like that it was so funny. And we [Patriots] came back and beat them.

""I’m just imagining him at halftime. Robert he’s a funny guy he’s got a lot of energy tells a lot of jokes and he told me at halftime they were in there dancing and hooraying then we came back and beat them so I think that was pretty funny.""

Alford’s next headline-worthy moment came in the fourth quarter covering Julian Edelman as the Patriots trailed 28-20 with two minutes left. Spotted as the first Falcons defender to tip the ball at Edelman for the infamous juggling catch Alford watched as one miraculous play made way for the next.

Seth Rollins vs. Edge

We go back to the ring and out first comes Seth Rollins. We wait a few seconds before The Brood music hits and out comes WWE Hall of Famer Edge. Flames rise up as Edge comes from underneath like The Brood once did. Edge marches down the ramp as the red lights flash. He stops and kneels as the lights go dark. Edge's normal theme starts up now as he finishes marching to the ring to a big pop.

The bell rings and they stare each other down. They go at it and Edge dodges a shot then drops Rollins with a right hand. Rollins seethes as Edge smiles at him. They lock up and Edge applies a headlock. Rollins fights out but Edge clotheslines him over the top rope to the floor. Rollins comes in swinging but Edge blocks and works him over. They end up on the floor and Edge keeps control against the barrier. They bring it back in and Edge knocks Rollins back to the floor.

Seth Rollins received a ""Brood Bath"" during Friday's WWE SummerSlam edition of SmackDown on FOX.

SmackDown opened with WWE Hall of Famer Edge coming to the ring for an intense promo where he talked about how Rollin has put him in a dark place these days a place he doesn't like to go because it's so hard to come back from. Edge then admitted that he likes that place but Rollins has helped him find a place in his heart where the blood runs black. Edge ended that promo by declaring that on this day he sees clearly and at SummerSlam he doesn't have to just beat Rollins he has to break and humble him and he's going to burn Rollins down.

Rollins wearing an all-white suit later came to the ring to respond to The Rated R Superstar. Rollins laughed at and mocked Edge saying they both knew that part of Edge is now dead and gone. Rollins was suddenly interrupted by the familiar tune of The Brood's old WWE theme music as the red lights started flashing around the arena and flames appeared.

Edge then appeared on the big screen and told Rollins to beware because the freaks come out at night and Rollins will never see them coming. Edge then laughed at Rollins as a huge amount of dark blood fell from the rafters covering Rollins and his all-white suit knocking him to the mat. McAfee called it a ""Brood Bath"" as a shocked Rollins got back to his feet. Edge had disappeared from the big screen by that point but the area was covered by the dark colored blood.

The Brood was a WWE Attitude Era stable that included Edge current Impact World Champion Christian Cage and leader Gangrel. Based off a group of vampires the group was active from October 1998 until the summer of 1999. The Hardys later aligned with Gangrel and were briefly known as The New Brood. The original Brood would often give their opponents a ""blood bath"" but it appears ""Brood Bath"" is the proper verbiage for modern day WWE.

The Brood trended on Twitter after SmackDown with many fans commenting on what a potential return for the stable would look like these days.

Edge vs. Rollins will take place later tonight at WWE SummerSlam.

When Ross Haley entered the cannabis industry 20 years ago it was to sell the proverbial “picks and shovels” with Ag Natural an ancillary company he founded to focus on gardening supplies for Northern California marijuana farmers.

Only four years after launching Ag Natural Haley learned that a competitor wanted to acquire the business which he wound up selling in 2005.

After the sale Haley immediately began another ancillary marijuana business Vermicrop Organics which offered a line of fertilizers and soils designed specifically for cannabis growers.

ADVERTISEMENT

He later merged Vermicrop with a sister company General Hydroponics and ran both until they were acquired by agricultural giant Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2015.

Haley also found time in 2010 to start The GrowBiz another retail hydroponics company which expanded to 12 retail locations before being purchased in 2020 by GrowGeneration Corp.

In 2016 Haley also founded Truth Enterprises which became the parent company of his current business Lbs Distribution a state-licensed marijuana cultivator manufacturer and distributor based in West Sacramento.

MJBizMagazine sat down with Haley to get his advice for other cannabis entrepreneurs about how best to plan and execute an exit from a startup business.

What was the key to your success with startups and exits?

The theme of the California Gold Rush was picks and axes. It’s pretty commonly known that there were a lot of successful companies that came out of that industry that weren’t actually mining for gold. They were servicing supplies.

From a business aspect that model works in a lot of different industries and it worked really well for me in this industry.

Part of it was that cannabis growing and selling weren’t completely legal.

So the tools that were needed to care for the plants increase yields and mitigate pests I found ways to supply those products to growers.

Those businesses—the hydroponic (cultivation) stores specifically—became training grounds for knowledge.

People could come in and buy supplies and talk about genetics methodology things that were successful or weren’t successful.

That really became a breeding ground for my knowledge. The common thread was knowledge and technical expertise in an industry that really couldn’t share it publicly.

What were some of the obstacles when building and exiting each of those companies?

Creating processes and finding passionate people that care about the business and the product are big obstacles for us.

Just learning how to do business in the trenches not being formally trained. I think those are probably three of the largest obstacles: people process and learning through trial and error.

Persistence was a huge (asset). I think the biggest reason businesses fail is because people quit.

You see a lot of businesses where they start out as a cardboard manufacturer and end up being a print company.

If failure’s not an option sometimes you have to make a left turn sometimes you have to make a right turn but you just keep moving until you figure stuff out.

What was the trickiest part about exiting for you?

The legal side is probably one of the most difficult things—and it’s mostly underestimated by people who haven’t experienced exiting.

The cost and the resources you need to do that successfully is definitely one of the largest hurdles in exiting.

I underestimated the amount of contractual diligence that would be required to sell.

It’s also really easy to not have the right contract and end up costing yourself a tremendous amount of money even after close because there are invocations and all these things that can be pulled back if the diligence isn’t done correctly.

How long does exiting take?

My first major deal (with Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2015) was a year and a half from the start of “the dance” to closing that deal. That was my first major exit.

Fast forward to the GrowBiz deal I had offers from GrowGeneration over four years and always turned them down. It wasn’t until this last interaction (in 2020) that myself and my partners were ready. They made the right offer (and) that was probably about six to seven months to close.

Ag Natural was a much simpler deal. That was just a couple months from the time I decided to sell it.

But it was somebody I knew a private party who already had a hydro store and understood the business very clearly. It was a friendlier and more knowledgeable strategic deal.

At the time it was incredibly large for me. I made seven figures. But in complexity and size it was a speck compared to the deal (with Scotts).

What advice do you have for others when exiting a startup?

Run your business first. Take care of your customers your employees and your vendors. That’s first and foremost. Without that there’ll never be a good exit.

I think a lot of operators get distracted with trying to sell their business rather than trying to run their business because they’re trying to sell it instead of trying to optimize.

Get operating. Everything takes time so the sooner you start the sooner you’ll start creating value.

Don’t underestimate the value in people and team members.

And really be prudent in bringing people in that fit the culture that have desires that are similar to the mission of the business. Build a dynamic team that will fight for the wins and never give up. That’s super important.

Clean accurate data that’s an area I learned quickly early on. Keep good records: contractual financial legal.

Take the time to do it up front so you’re not taking time looking back to clean it up when you’re in the middle of a deal because it’ll cost you time energy and money.

The cleaner your financials sales history and contracts the easier it will be to point out your strengths while negotiating and back them up. That’s really important in a deal.

The most important is to actually have fun and enjoy the chase. Looking back my favorite memories are from the journey not the exit.

Though the wins feel really good it’s important to enjoy the adventure. Some of the hardest times can be some of the most fun times.

reportedly installed a soft-serve-ice-cream machine at his Beverly Hills home. Ice-cream company CVT Soft Serve posted on Instagram that Bezos is its first residential client.

Bezos appears to be a fan of soft-serve ice cream : He stopped by Milk Bar in New York in 2019.

How much do you enjoy eating soft-serve ice cream? If your name is Jeff Bezos the answer is apparently a lot.

The Amazon and Blue Origin founder has installed an artisan soft-serve machine inside his Los Angeles home according to an Instagram post this week from Los Angeles soft-serve-ice-cream company CVT Soft Serve.

""I just did an ice cream delivery to a guy that now has CVT on tap in his house 24/7"" the post reads accompanied by a photo of founder Joe Nicchi. ""Thank you Jeff Bezos for being our first residential #CVTeeny client.⁣""

He added: ""What. The Actual. Fuck?!?"" Vice was the first to spot the post.

The CVTeeny is a soft-serve-ice-cream machine designed to look like a food truck complete with a customizable ""license plate"" on the front. (We'll just have to guess at what Bezos chose for his plate.)

The machine dispenses vanilla chocolate and twist soft-serve according to the company's site.

While we don't know for sure which of Bezos' houses the machine was installed in from CVT's photo it appears to be his Beverly Hills estate. He purchased the home previously known as the Warner Estate in February 2020 for $165 million breaking the record for the most expensive home sale in California state history. He added an adjacent $10 million property creating a $175 million compound.

A spokesperson for Bezos did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the soft-serve machine.

Bezos has shown in the past that like many of us he's unable to resist the simple allure of soft-serve.

In April 2019 he was spotted with two of his children at New York City's Milk Bar a dessert spot and bakery founded by chef Christina Tosi. Page Six reported at the time that he ordered the company's famous Cereal Milk ice cream which is intended to taste like ""the bottom of your cereal bowl.""

Now thanks to his new unlimited ice-cream machine Bezos will no longer have to make a special trip to get his soft-serve fix.",,,,,,,,,

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGJlcnRzb25mdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZXRlci1sYXR1cm51c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter S. Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Visitation will be at the Gilbertson Funeral Home Devils Lake on Monday May 13th from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. with a Rosary and Prayer Service at 6:00 p.m.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family.

Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

At least that is what one can only imagine the execs at Adidas are thinking after they announced on August 12 that they would be selling off the formerly iconic athletic brand Reebok to Authentic Brands Group.

The deal was for a reported $2.46 billion — a steep discount to the original purchase price of $3.8 billion back in 2006.

The transaction represents a proverbial waving of the white flag for Adidas. Yet there is still hope for Reebok.

ABG has the business model to turn Reebok around. Having recently placed bets on Lucky Brand and Brooks Brothers during the pandemic CEO Jamie Salter says that he’s looking for strong brands with real estate exposure and international footprints. Reebok fits the mold.

With ABG also announcing plans to go public at a $10 billion valuation the acquisition of a brand with as much baggage as Reebok could be cumbersome. Slater however is confident that the acquisition will be accretive to the company which employs an asset light model of owning the equity in consumer brands and working with partners to execute on supply chain management.

A redistribution of ABG resources along with a heightened focus on the nostalgic nature of the brand could be the ingredients to a winning strategy for Reebok.

What The Heck Happened?

In what can only be described as a “swing and a miss” from an M&A perspective Adidas fought valiantly to bring the former footwear giant to consistent profitability. Post-acquisition in 2006 Reebok’s revenue curve looked more like a roller coaster than the desired “up and to the right” graph Adidas would have hoped for.

However Reebok was finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. It returned to profitability in 2018 and even saw sales growth in 2019. Then the pandemic — a black swan event that spelled doom for many of the world’s retailers and sent Reeboks revenues spiraling to the tune of a 22% decline.

Adidas announced in early 2021 that it was looking to fully divest from the once lauded brand and thus the fire sale began. Sycamore Partners Wolverine Worldwide (parent company of Sperry’s Saucony and Merrell) Cerberus Capital Management CVC Capital and Advent International were all — at one point — at the table.

Adidas Steps In

In 2006 the thesis for an Adidas-Reebok merger made perfect sense. While Adidas was competing favorably with Nike on its home turf in Europe the company was losing market share in the U.S.

At the time of acquisition Adidas had only 9% of the total $9 billion U.S. shoe market — Reebok owned 12% and Nike held a whopping 35%. While the merger effectively doubled Adidas’ market share in the States a key factor in the deal was that the two brands would be maintained separately in order to retain brand integrity.

Big mistake.

Out of the gate Reebok’s performance was uh lackluster at best. From 2006 through 2010 the company’s revenues linearly declined from 4.7% of total Adidas’ revenues to 2.6%. There was a brief glimmer of hope from 2010 to 2011 when Reebok was able to grow sales from $1.5 billion to just over $2 billion regaining the confidence of Adidas head brass. That is until the Federal Trade Commission got involved.

At the end of 2011 the FTC forced Adidas to pay customers back $25 million for what it dubbed deceptive marketing tactics. The misleading marketing tactics were related to the company’s shoes that supposedly “helped tone” an individual’s buttocks. You can’t make this stuff up.

Then everything dovetailed with the end of the licensing agreement between Reebok and the NFL — one of the brand’s few bright spots.

A foray into the fitness space with a Crossfit licensing deal and a push to divest its existing U.S. infrastructure in large outlet stores proved to be too little too late.

The aforementioned push to profitability in 2018 was driven mostly by large-scale consolidation and not any form of product innovation. The company moved to a single centralized hub in Boston and shuttered 35 of its brick-and-mortar locations.

The experiment failed.

Why It Failed

Having lost much of the momentum from the ‘80s and early ‘90s Reebok struggled in three main areas: low profit margins too many products and too many distractions from its core product suite.

While from the outside with the likes of Allen Iverson and Shaquille O’Neal touting the brand the situation may have seemed well and good — internally Reebok was hemorrhaging money. The company saw its highest sales and best margins on athletic apparel but the expansion into too many channels drove margins down to 7% compared to Nike’s 15% in 1997.

Reebok didn’t need runway to grow it needed to have its hand held. In 2015 we saw the potential for what could have been as Kasper Rorsted took the reins from former CEO Herbert Hainer. An aggressive strategy to downsize plus an emphasis on the core the product almost righted the ship in 2019.

Now Reebok will be relegated to the land of misfit toys that is the ABG’s collection of brands.

How ABG Could Make It Work

ABG plans to apply a model known as Sparc that it developed with Simon Property Group the country’s largest mall operator.

The model is a joint venture where Sparc is able to purchase large quantities of retail and spread those fixed costs across the collection of brands owned by ABG. This allows the companies to each leverage their respective core competencies — real estate and brand building.

A similar model will be applied to the Reebok purchase. Reebok will still be responsible for all of the design and shipping to their existing manufacturers. However with the assistance of ABG Reebok will be able to bypass the third-party licensee which would traditionally receive a percentage of the sales. This will all be accomplished through a new entity known as Reebok Design Group.

On the flip side ABG will not hold or ship any inventory but instead control distribution and eliminate the middleman. ABG will be responsible for selecting specialty retail where Reebok will go “narrow and deep.”

The ultimate goal with the new structure is to increase margins — substantially. The licensing model which ABG has employed with its other salvaged brands is tried and true across industries not just for ABG.

While predicting an outcome could be a fun exercise it’s unnecessary thanks to the company’s recent IPO announcement. Markets will determine whether or not they believe in the new business combination. Personally I think they just might be onto something.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jamie looked happy and relaxed in a stylish fedora hat and yellow t-shirt while sporting a very bronzed glow.

River - who recently celebrated his fifth birthday - sported a striped rainbow vest as he snuggled up for a smooch with his dad.

The mum-of-five captioned the sweet snap with a bright yellow love heart.

It comes shortly after Jools 46 revealed she's considering IVF after suffering five heartbreaking miscarriages including recently during lockdown.

Speaking on podcast Made By Mammas host Zoe Hardman said that Jools was ""pining for a sixth child"" before she turns 47 next year.

Jools replied: ""I really do I really do but I've just had three miscarriages since then [River's birth] and I'm thinking - and a recent one three weeks ago - and I'm thinking: 'No.'

""I dunno. I do want to but I've got to mentally check that it's a good idea to do. And also physically because I am 45 as I always say nearly 46. So it's a little bit dodgy.""

Discussing the miscarriages Jools said: ‘I went to see the doctor the other day and he said: 'How are you mentally?'

""I thought about it and I went: 'Well this is the fifth one now.' I had two before River and they’ve been early ones the last two have been at six-and-a-half weeks.

""So I just feel… I’m really good at going: 'Right I’m pregnant but it won’t work so I’m just going to carry on' whilst everyone gets really into it and I have really learnt to not because I’m kind of not very positive about it.""

Jamie and Jools wed in 2000 and had their eldest child Poppy Honey when they were 27.

There is a 14 year age gap between River and his eldest sister who was born in 2002.

Along with Poppy and River they have 18-year-old Daisy Boo Petal Blossom 12 and 10-year-old Buddy Bear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3Mvc3RyaWN0bHktc3Rhci1qb2Utc3VnZy11bnZlaWxzLTI0ODEzNTYx0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrLzNhbS9jZWxlYnJpdHktbmV3cy9zdHJpY3RseS1zdGFyLWpvZS1zdWdnLXVudmVpbHMtMjQ4MTM1NjEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strictly star Joe Sugg unveils sweet snap of sister Zoella's blossoming baby bump,"Strictly Come Dancing star Joe Sugg is preparing for uncle duties as his sister Zoe Sugg is expecting her first child with boyfriend Alfie Deyes

Joe Sugg has already proved he's going to the best uncle to sister Zoe Sugg's baby.

The YouTube star is expecting her first child with boyfriend Alfie Deyes and Strictly Come Dancing star Joe has delighted fans as he shared a new snap of him and sister Zoe as he catches up with his family.

Posting the photo on his Instagram stories he wrote: ""Not long now! #UncleJoe.""

Zoe also uploaded the snap to her own Instagram account and joked about the siblings' similar outfits.

""Love these photos with @joe_sugg can’t wait to see what kind of uncle he’ll be"" she wrote alongside the photo.

She added: ""The matching flannel was unintentional haha.""

Zoe and Alfie confirmed earlier this year that they are expecting a baby girl together due in September.

""We’re super excited to share with you that our baby girl will be joining us in September"" they wrote in identical posts at the time.

However they have yet to decide on a name for the little one.

Alfie told Metro.co.uk : ""I wish we had [decided on a name]. I just really want to see her little face!

""I know so many people that have named their babies – the baby's been born and then they've changed the name. I didn't realise how hard it was to make a decision on the name.""

When it comes to his own relationship Joe is dating Strictly professional dancer Dianne Buswell who he met whilst appearing on the BBC One show in 2019.

And Dianne recently admitted the pair haven't discussed plans for marriage or children in the future as they just like to ""play it by ear"".

""I'm quite an unorganised person actually. Joe and I don't really talk about that kind of thing"" she told Hello! magazine recently.

""We're both so relaxed so we just play it by ear.

""We really enjoy each other's company so much and whatever happens happens.""

The red-haired beauty explained how her and Joe clicked instantly when they were partnered together on the show.

""Joe was a lot of fun. We clicked straight away with our humour"" she shared.

""We loved being there because it was just really fun. We would crack jokes but then there was also the very serious side to it.

""He was the perfect student and was willing to work hard but he needed to because he wasn't a natural dancer and to get him to the level that we got him to"" she added."

Summer is always prime for dresses but feminine frocks are definitely enjoying a moment in the sun. From the tailored lines of vintage-inspired pieces to gauzy dresses perfect for a garden party to classic motifs like ginghams and florals warm-weather fashion seems to be harkening back to a time when getting dressed meant getting dressed. Dare we ask — could this be a sign that our long months spent in yoga pants are coming to an end?

We spoke to three Southern dressmakers who are participating in this movement towards feminine timeless pieces. Each has made a conscious decision to build their business in the South rather than migrating to cities typically associated with the fashion industry. And all three of them are invested in more than simply creating a clothing line. They’re forging relationships with the people who buy from them. They know these customers could just as easily buy a $30 dress online but instead they’re choosing to spend their money on well-made beautifully designed pieces with a story.

Rebekah Murray | Virginia Dare Dress Co.

Rebekah Murray is a graphic designer by education photographer by trade and dress designer by chance. Her work as a wedding photographer and her travels abroad pushed her to create something that felt historically inspired absent of current trends and with a classic pastoral elegance that felt memorable. Her grandfather was a fashion designer in New York and Rebekah had the drive to learn the art of dressmaking from the ground up. With the support of her family and friends Virginia Dare Dress Co. was born. If you’re not already sold by her timeless styles and ageless silhouettes just remember the tagline on Virginia Dare Dress Co.’s Instagram: “Made with love and pockets.” Does it get any better?

Did you always want to design clothing?

I’ve worked as a wedding and fashion photographer for almost 15 years and the quest for cute dresses to shoot weddings in is a frequent topic in forums. I got to travel a lot for destination weddings and over the years felt like it was really difficult to find pieces I could comfortably travel in wear for touring and also be functional to work in. I really admire Kate Middleton’s style and found there weren’t enough dresses that had a thoughtful simplicity but still a feminine classic cut and designed to be versatile for seasons and day or night.

I also found it really difficult to find dresses that were a little more modest in coverage without feeling too old-fashioned. It felt like the most basic necessity but not easily found! Some years ago I felt like I wanted to pursue something besides photography so the two needs met (for simple classic dresses and also a new career path) and my parents and I had the idea for me to start a clothing company.

How have you worked to differentiate your brand and your style?

I want the brand to feel like a warm welcoming place for our “kindreds” as we call our community. Some ways we’ve done that are through a really beautiful packaging experience that hopefully feels like a gift sent from a friend or in-person events inspired by our brand’s lifestyle aesthetic like picnic day at a historic park or a meet-up at a flower farm to pick bouquets. We also try to give the best service and experience possible. A lot of our design decisions are inspired by feedback and conversations with customers. When you’re a small brand each individual is so valuable and I hope they always feel that.

What do you wish consumers knew about buying from smaller independent brands rather than fast fashion?

That while we can’t compete on price we can care about giving a much better experience to them. And that their purchases are impacting our lives!

We don’t get the financial breaks that larger companies do when purchasing materials or larger batches of production so our costs are always higher but we can try to make it up to them by providing value in other ways.

What do you see as the advantages to starting and growing your business in the South rather than a typical fashion hub?

I’m so grateful for it! I think it could be easy to get swept up in the expectations of the fashion industry in a hub like New York but here in Virginia I feel so connected to the actual customers and I get to keep them front and center when I go to work each day. I want to be completely here to help serve them and learn about what their needs or wants are and then get to know them over time and celebrate their wins with them. A good dress is more than just clothing; it’s a uniform for a beautiful life. It’s a privilege to play a small part with these in our community.

A Dress We Love: The Chambray Alice Wrap Dress is a perfect pick for summer into fall. Wear it now with sandals then layer it with boots and a chunky cardigan when a chill turns up in the air. You can buy Virginia Dare Dress Co. dresses on their website.

Courtney Pugh | Piccadilly

Have you ever known a mother daughter and daughter-in-law to get along so famously that they decide to go into business together? That’s exactly what the three women behind Piccadilly did in 2020. These three talented creatives are designing darling dresses for girls that feel both classically Southern and worldly at the same time. And lucky for us they just launched their first women’s dresses this past spring with a floaty feminine dress called the Camden. Creating beautifully handmade clothing that’s 100% cotton and machine washable Piccadilly set out to create heirloom-quality pieces that aren’t too precious to wear for everyday life. These are dresses that are made to be worn and lived in yet they don’t sacrifice girlish charm. Now we’re just hoping they keep expanding that women’s collection …

What inspired you to start your own dress label?

Our very first dress was originally created for our own little one with no intention of replicating the design let alone starting an entire collection. However when that dress became the “go-to” for everything from jumping in mud puddles to sitting in church pews we knew we had something special. Piccadilly was created to fill a market space in children’s clothing we couldn’t find ourselves — something posh and playful classic and different Southern and European. We built our brand in a way that focused on these elements for children exclusively at first but could pivot to eventually include women’s pieces.

What has the process been like scaling your business and working with manufacturers? Have you tried to keep your work local?

When we first launched in October 2020 we had plans to outsource to larger manufacturers to keep up with demand. However we weren’t willing to compromise on quality to make that happen. There are two things that are essential to our brand: the way the clothes feel and how they’re made. We’ve all added things to our wardrobe we adore only to see them fall apart after one wash. Keeping our work local and in-house at this stage ensures that will never happen to a Piccadilly product. Our goal is to eventually find partners to help with scale but we’re careful not to rush into something — all good things take time!

How have you worked to differentiate your brand and your style?

Our mission as a brand is to create clothes that wear beautifully wash easily and are worn often. We highly endorse outfit repeating over here! When it came to trying to find our spot in the marketplace we knew our style would be unique. Our goal with every design is to balance formal with casual incorporate a Southern flare and introduce European elements. We’re unique because our style isn’t the traditional Southern smock or the ultra-trend. We’re somewhere in the middle and we see a growing market for that.

What do you wish consumers knew about buying from smaller independent brands rather than fast fashion?

What we would give to have every customer as a fly on the wall from the second the “ding” of a new order notification rings to the moment their order ships from our doors. It truly is a labor of love and no thread is stitched item packaged or bow tied without our hand in the process making sure every detail is as it should be. The number of hats a smaller business owner wears is truly baffling. On any one day we are designers seamstresses web coders marketing officers inventory supervisors accountants postal carriers and social media managers. It’s A LOT but at the end of the day we know every order going out the door is one that will surpass customers’ expectations when they receive it – and that matters! Today’s world is all about instant gratification at the lowest price but we believe that comes at a cost you inevitably pay for. It’s been eye-opening learning from our own journey what it means to support small businesses and we will forever be grateful for the lesson.

Have you collaborated with other creatives either in the fashion world or elsewhere?

Wow so glad you asked this question. We’re thrilled to announce we’re in the process of collaborating with one of our favorite creative designers for the fall collection. We’ve been huge fans of Meredith Owens from Design A La Mere based in Wilmington NC for years and it’s a dream to be working with her gifted mind on the patterns for this next release. We’ve also been fortunate to work with incredible retail partners in this first year like Out of Hand in Mt. Pleasant SC and BumbleBaby’s new flagship store in Chicago IL.

A dress we love: The Camden Dress is the gorgeous lightweight dress you’ll wear all spring and summer long. Imagine frolicking through a garden straw hat in hand or strolling along the beach. This is the dress you’ll be wearing. You can shop Piccadilly on their website.

Catalina Gonzalez Jorba | Dondolo

Dondolo started with a mission to support and empower mothers. Founder Catalina Gonzalez Jorba is a mother herself but after her first child was born she was yearning for a creative outlet and a way to share herself with her community. Originally from Colombia she had the idea to create stunning heirloom-quality designs for families and manufacture them in her home country. Now Dondolo both supports the women in Colombia who are employed by the company and she gives back to non-profits in Dallas to support her local community. Each purchase leads to a donation to an organization that betters the lives of women and children.

As Catalina says on her website “The word “Dondolo” means ‘to swing’ and I truly believe that the love you give is returned to you.”

​​What inspired you to start your own label?

The brand idea came after I had my first child Santiago. I was enjoying every moment of my new role as a mother but I felt something was missing. In becoming a mom my heart grew in a way that I never thought possible and I wanted to share that love with not only my family but with other women and children that may be in need.

My dream for the brand from the beginning was always to “give back” both by supporting my native country and the local community in Dallas where I live with my family. Today Dondolo is a luxury lifestyle brand that provides children and women with beautiful heirloom-quality clothing made by women in Colombia.

How have you worked to differentiate your brand and your style?

We’ve really focused on bringing heirloom quality clothing to life through creating vintage designs with a modern twist. Our differentiator lies in the details of the designs – each piece is hand-embroidered hand-smocked and created with so much love. Dondolo is love in details and love in giving back.

What do you wish consumers knew about buying from smaller independent brands rather than fast fashion?

Shopping small provides an amazing opportunity to create a sense of community and purpose. When a customer shops with Dondolo they are not only buying a beautiful piece of clothing to incorporate into their precious family memories they’re also making a difference in the lives of women and children in Colombia. Our statement pieces tell a beautiful story and spark conversation around giving back. It’s a topic we hope the women in our community can connect on and feel proud of!

Have you collaborated with other creatives either in the fashion world or elsewhere?

This year we’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with some amazing female-led brands and businesses including LoveShackFancy Gen Sohr of Pencil & Paper and Born on Fifth’s Emily Hertz. I can truly say that when we work together as women we are more successful!

What has your experience been as a designer in the South?

It has been incredible. Being in the South is one of the main reasons that Dondolo grew so quickly in the beginning. We had a loyal passionate community of Southern boutiques and customers who craved vintage-inspired heirloom clothing. There’s also a real sense of collaboration and support here. I’m so thankful to be surrounded by amazing women and entrepreneurs who helped guide and empower me at the start of my journey – and still today!

A dress we love: The Strawberries Long Dress feels like summer. You’re instantly transported to running barefoot through the grass picnic in hand. And those charming scallop details along the chest and back are just the icing on the cake. You can buy Donodolo dresses and lifestyle products on their website.

Morey Company,"From left: Kevin Fukuyama Joshua Morey Doug Aihara and Todd Uyemura at the office of J. Morey Company. (MARIO GERSHOM REYES/Rafu Shimpo)

Having achieved the milestone of its 75th anniversary since its founding in Little Tokyo right after World War II the Aihara Insurance Agency announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its business to another long-time Japanese American insurance firm with community history: the J. Morey Company.

The Aihara Insurance Agency was founded by Luis Aihara on May 1 1946 in Little Tokyo. Like many Japanese Americans he had returned to Southern California with his family after being displaced by the U.S. government during World War II and unfairly incarcerated in a concentration camp. The family had a farm in Garden Grove and were among the fortunate ones to have neighbors who maintained their property during the war.

Upon returning however Luis sought another career away from the farm and relocated to Little Tokyo. He began selling life insurance for Occidental Life one of the first companies that sold policies at standard rates to those of Japanese ancestry and other people of color beginning in the 1930s.

In June 1951 Luis incorporated his business as the Aihara Insurance Agency and began selling auto and home insurance to his clients. As with life insurance Japanese American agents had been limited or even restricted from selling auto and home policies by the insurance companies until the postwar era.

“The renewals for auto and home insurance provided my dad with a steady income” explained Doug Aihara who took over the family business from his father in November of 1993. But it was hardly lucrative. “Back in those days annual auto premiums were less than $100 per year.”

In October 1968 the Aihara Insurance Agency moved into the newly constructed Kajima Building at the corner of First and San Pedro streets as one of the original tenants. The move coincided with the steady growth for the agency as the Japanese American community’s economic strength improved.

Luis Aihara founded Aihara Insurance Agency in May 1946 as Japanese Americans resettled and rebuilt their lives in Southern California.

The Aihara Insurance Agency was also one of the first to benefit from the emerging presence of Japanese corporations doing business in America. Because of language and cultural obstacles Japanese companies sought out Japanese American insurance agencies who had the ability to speak Japanese and understood the culture. Luis and his agency acquired Japanese corporate clients including Yamaha Suzuki Motors Epson Kajima and Panasonic.

As business prospered the Aihara Insurance Agency took a leadership role as one of the founding members of the Japanese Casualty Insurance Association which used the collective strength of almost a dozen Japanese American agencies to attract the attention of insurance carriers who had ignored or shut out their Nikkei clients.

“With the buying and selling power of so many agencies” Doug noted “the association members were able to secure contracts to sell a carrier’s product that may not have been available otherwise. Back in those days finding carriers that would sell to Japanese was hard enough so having the purchasing power of the association opened doors for many of its members.”

The Japanese Casualty Insurance Association also set ethical guidelines for its members to respect each other’s business and not try to lure clients away from fellow members. “The idea was there was enough business to go around the Japanese American community” Doug explained.

Luis passed away in 2007 and over the years there has been some thought of continuing the family business into the third generation. But circumstances did not work out and Doug began seeking the right fit for the sale of the company. Ultimately he chose the J. Morey Company.

‘I was looking for a company that I was confident would serve the needs of our clients moving forward” he stated. “The J. Morey Company was the best choice. They agreed to let the Aihara Insurance Agency continue working under our name during the transition in our offices. I feel strongly that this was the ideal outcome for all parties. Having reached our 75th anniversary I thought this was the right time to sell the business. I think my dad would have agreed.”

The J. Morey Company was founded in Cerritos in 1980 by brothers John Jack and Jim Morey but the family’s roots began in Little Tokyo. Their grandfather Bungaro opened a dry goods general store in Little Tokyo in 1907 and their father George worked there until the war. Because of their forced removal the Morey family lost that business.

Over the years the J. Morey Company expanded acquiring the Hirohata Insurance Agency the oldest existing Japanese American business and Mineta Insurance in San Jose. In 2012 Joshua Morey John’s son opened the company’s office in Little Tokyo walking distance from his great-grandfather’s general store. He is now the president of the company

“I emphatically believe in the perpetuation of minority communities” Josh Morey said. “My father John and uncles Jack and Jim have instilled values of community that are bigger than anything we can do on our own. It’s an honor to assist in the perpetuation of the Aihara family’s 75 years of cultural footprints in our Japanese American community. Our firm’s duty (giri) is to preserve and grow the legacies of those who’ve gone before us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWVmdGFpbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzIyL3B1ZWJsby1jb3VudHktaGFsbC1mYW1lLWluZHVjdC00LWFsdW0tMjAyMS81NDE0NjIwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pueblo County Hall of Fame to induct 4 alum in 2021,"The Pueblo County High School Alumni Foundation will induct four new members in to the school's Hall of Fame on Sept. 30.

Elizabeth Villegas class of 1966

Villegas graduated from the then-University of Southern Colorado in 1970 and coached track and field at Penrose High School for four years before returning to Pueblo County. She distinguished herself as an exceptional teacher and multisport coach for the Hornets over the course of 24 years.

""She was very pro-female athletics... We were of that generation that had just started Title IX"" said Cherie Toussaint a fellow coach and educator at Pueblo County. ""In our schooling there wasn't much opportunity for women and she was one of the handful in District 70 that fought like the dickens to make sure girls were recognized.""

Villegas coached track and field gymnastics basketball and volleyball for the Hornets. Among her many achievements she was a recipient of the Pueblo Latino Chamber of Commerce Teacher of the Year Award won multiple volleyball coach of the year awards and was inducted into the Greater Pueblo Sports Association Hall of Fame.

Contreras was born and raised in Avondale. He created the Avondale clean-up and was an organizer for multiple community events including the community's Easter egg hunt and Veterans Day parade.

He remembers his time spent growing up as a child in Avondale fondly.

""It was a great time to grow up in that town"" Contreras said. ""A lot of people were related in that town but if you weren't related you still knew everybody. At that time you could get a pop bottle and you could give a nickel for it ... We had a few little stores over there that we traded with.

""Overall it was just fantastic to live in.""

I have been the sole owner since that time. We provide services in Pueblo Denver Fort Collins and Colorado Springs.""

Hernandez also devotes his life to philanthropy in Pueblo.

As we watched the launch the crew capsule and booster rocket landing safely it felt like everyone was yelling for three minutes straight.”



Since his role at the company involved internal communications Solano was directly responsible for setting up watch parties at the company’s facilities across the country.



“Before this I didn’t know that communication people ordered the food” he said. “I was coordinating with vendors executing on event activations managing budgets and also putting together ‘crescendo events’ that built up to the summer’s launch. It’s was a really amazing experience.”



Solano’s Blue Origin internship has been the pinnacle of his academic journey so far — one in which he didn’t let an initial setback get in the way of his ambition.



“Advertising was always fascinating to me” he said. “Even when I was watching cartoons I remember enjoying the ads. I saw them as just other pieces of content part of the stories brands tell about themselves.”



He excelled at Granada Hills Charter High School as part of the marketing and business program and even interned with entertainment and social content company Fullscreen Media as a teen. While his grades extracurricular activities and teacher recommendations were outstanding Solano admits that his standardized test scores weren’t as high as he would have liked. He ended up only getting in to one university: California State University Northridge.



“When I told one of my teachers that I didn’t get into USC he laughed — he thought I was joking” Solano recalled. “At first I was devastated but eventually I became just as determined to go to CSUN and give it my all.”



Solano threw himself into earning internships and learning more about marketing and communications. He became an intern with a student-staffed creative agency serving in numerous roles from photographer to copywriter eventually working his way up to lead strategist and account manager. Solano remembers that he once completely reworked an integrated marketing slide deck the day before a presentation (applying the lessons he had learned from his internships and academic marketing journals) — and that his clients were impressed with “how organized and professional it was.”



“After that moment even if I didn’t say anything in a meeting my boss would always comment ‘Ian I know you have something to say what are your thoughts on this?’” he said.



Because of his success at CSUN Solano was at first hesitant to transfer to USC. “I had a strong community at CSUN and I was thriving” he said. “What convinced me was that all of my mentors told me ‘You should go to USC it’ll open a lot more doors for you.’”



Solano was initially accepted as a transfer student to USC Marshall.



“But when I took my first accounting class I was like ‘This ain’t it!’” he said with a chuckle. “I like to write and tell stories and PR and marketing allows me to do that.”



He transferred to USC Annenberg’s public relations program for his junior year continuing to broaden his skillset through both his coursework and work experience. He particularly credits “Effective Writing for Strategic Public Relations” with Adjunct Instructor Jacqueline Liu and “Strategic Public Relations Research Analysis and Insights” with Assistant Professor Eunjin “Anna” Kim.



“In the first class I learned how to hone my craft in writing mastering the materials you’re expected to know on your first day in public relations: press releases FAQ’s newsletters etc.” he said. “In the second you learn how to layer that writing with sound research and analytics. I really liked the emphasis on being a really good writer — that’s something that I can apply to literally anywhere that I go in my career” he said.



He also continued to secure meaningful internships notably at the Annenberg Agency which pairs students with nonprofits that need PR and marketing support. His work with the nonprofit Duet helped grow their donations and social media footprint.



For Summer 2021 he weighed internship options that included Amazon and Facebook but his mentors convinced him that the uniqueness of the Blue Origin position was too good to pass up.



“I’ve always been interested in space. I’m a huge Star Trek fan” Solano said. “And I was like OK space travel is such an interesting industry I get to live in Seattle for the summer let’s do it.”



Now moving into his last semester at USC Annenberg Solano is focusing on a project he calls Cue Protagonist! a content channel on Twitter that aims to teach and empower individuals “to be the main character of their own life.” After that he said he’ll likely apply for communications positions at agencies like Golin and WE Communications and companies like Apple Facebook – and Blue Origin where he knows he left a good impression.



“With my internship at Blue Origin winding down I asked my boss if there was anything during my interview process that I should leverage for future interviews.” Solano said. “She told me my interview was like one of those interviews where you just knew that the person you were going to hire was right in front of you; that showed me how well Annenberg has prepared me for stepping out into the professional communications world.”"

DALLAS — Updated at 8:52 p.m. with a statement from Southwest Airlines.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines is among the six commercial carriers being enlisted to help with the evacuation of Afghanistan refugees.

In a statement on Sunday American said it would be ready within 24 hours to send three widebody aircraft to military bases and ""other secure transit points"" on the Arabian Peninsula and in Europe.

""The images from Afghanistan are heartbreaking"" American said in a statement. ""The airline is proud and grateful of our pilots and flight attendants who will be operating these trips to be a part of this life-saving effort.""

American said it will work to ""minimize the impact to customers"" that the program will have on its normal operations.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin on Sunday morning activated Stage I of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) calling for 18 commercial aircraft to help transport the refugees after they leave Afghanistan.

Among the 18 planes three will be from American Airlines. Atlas Air Delta Air Lines and Omni Air will also send three planes. United Airlines will send four and Hawaiian Airlines will send two.

Dallas-based Southwest Airlines is not part of the long-range international program because its aircraft Boeing 737s don't have the range needed for these evacuation efforts.

However Southwest released a statement late Sunday night saying the airline will charter four domestic flights on Monday separate from the international CRAF that will help transport people arriving into the U.S.from Afghanistan. A Southwest spokesperson said the airline anticipates operating the same amount of flights on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week as well.

""We are proud to support our military's critical humanitarian airlift mission and we are grateful to our Employees for demonstrating an eagerness to support these military efforts once again displaying their true Southwest Heart"" the Southwest statement said. ""Of course the Southwest Team stands ready to provide additional support to the Department of Defense if needed. Since these are Department of Defense charter flights we are unable to discuss the specific origin or destination cities.

The charter flights should not impact other commercial flights for Southwest customers the airline said.

None of the U.S. commercial carriers will fly directly into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Afghanistan. The U.S. military will continue ferrying out individuals from there to a neutral location in another country. If activated American and the other commercial carriers will pick up refugees that the military has flown out of Afghanistan.

The commercial airliners will then fly the evacuees to pre-determined locations such as the U.S. or other countries that will accept them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS90aGUtY2x1Yi1hdC1tc3ktbmV3LW9ybGVhbnMtYWlycG9ydC1wcmlvcml0eS1wYXNzLWxvdW5nZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Club At MSY New Orleans Airport Priority Pass Lounge Review,"The Club at MSY airport lounge in the New Orleans airport is the Priority Pass option there. Many haven’t seen it since the airport opened a brand new terminal abandoning the existing one shortly before the pandemic.

The lounge is located past security. It’s in the area that connects the A and B concourses. So flying Southwest which departs from B I passed the entry to those gates and continued walking as though headed towards the A gates. The directions tell you to “pass Cafe Du Mondé” in that area which is accurate. There’s an elevator to the third floor where the lounge is located on the right hand side once you pass concessions.



Terminal-level signage

Overall the physical space of the lounge is fantastic. It’s small but efficiently laid out and mostly devoid of passengers at least during my visit.



Seating



Bar

The food there was sad with nothing hot at all served in the mornings. That might not be a permanent situation as pre-pandemic they reportedly offered gumbo pasta and a crab and corn bisque (which alternated with a broccoli cheese soup). The Club lounges are usually pretty bare bones so lack of a substantive spread wasn’t surprising. But I was pleasantly surprised by the physical space.

Maybe the best thing about the lounge was the bathroom situation – each bathroom is a private room rather than shared stalls.

I wouldn’t arrive at the airport early to visit The Club at MSY but it’s a perfectly fine place to wait for your flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vb3poYXdrLmNvbS9zYW50YV9iYXJiYXJhX2FpcnBvcnRfbmVpZ2hib3JzX3NvdW5kX29mZl9vdmVyX2pldF9ub2lzZV8yMDIxMDgwOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frustrated Santa Barbara Airport Neighbors Sounding Off Over Jetliner Noise | Local News,"At roughly 5:30 a.m. each day United Airlines Flight 5211 takes off from the Santa Barbara Airport’s main runway en route to Denver.

Depending on the prevailing winds at the time the twin-engine Embraer-175 jetliner takes off either to the west — over the Target store Camino Real Marketplace and the Ellwood residential area — or to the east in the direction of More Mesa Hope Ranch and the eastern Goleta Valley.

In either case soon after becoming airborne the aircraft with engines roaring makes a hard turn out toward the Pacific Ocean while gaining altitude and heads toward the Rocky Mountains.

These flight patterns are designated under the airport’s voluntary noise-abatement procedures but they are not always followed precisely by the pilots in command of the aircraft.

On a typical morning over the next 90 minutes or so after that first Denver flight at least five more commercial jets take to the skies from Santa Barbara in a similar manner — carrying passengers to Dallas Los Angeles San Francisco Phoenix and Las Vegas.

Other smaller executive jets also head skyward during this period along with general-aviation planes.

For residents down below it can be an ear-shattering window-rattling ordeal — one many of them are increasingly upset about.

Among them is Ray Sawhill who lives with his wife Polly on Austin Road on More Mesa east of the airport.

They live in the home where Polly grew up and have put up with airport noise for years.

But they say that over the last few months the volume of flights — both in numbers and sound — has increased markedly. They also feel as though their complaints about the problem have fallen on deaf ears.

“This morning by 7:02 four big passenger jets had taken off directly over us” Sawhill told Noozhawk recently. “That would be bad any morning — but on a Sunday? Didn’t we used to call Sundays a day of rest?”

The overall impact from the airport noise is unbearable he said.

“It’s like having a Harley motorcycle gang rumbling by your house 36 times per day” he added.

Also bearing the brunt of airport noise is Yaheya Quazi a UC Santa Barbara researcher who lives with his wife and 16-year-old daughter in The Hideaway housing development across from Sandpiper Golf Club on outer Hollister Avenue west of the airport.

“It’s been really bad the last two months” he said noting that things were better when air traffic plummeted during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.

“We hear the planes taking off and landing at least 20 times a day” Quazi said. “That’s a lot.”

The fact that he’s still working at home most of the time due to the ongoing pandemic compounds the problem he added.

A Long-Standing Issue

Aircraft noise is not a new dilemma in Santa Barbara — airlines have been serving the community for decades and airplanes are by definition loud machines.

Not surprisingly that service has always resulted in complaints about aircraft noise a steady stream that ebbs and flows based on a variety of factors.

But in recent weeks Noozhawk has received numerous complaints about aircraft noise and local social-media websites such as NextDoor have been lighting up with airport neighbors complaining and debating about the problem.

The common perception voiced is that there are more flights aircraft are louder and they are flying lower. There is some truth to these contentions but they don’t tell the whole story.

Airport officials confirm that the volume of complaints is now at or above what was happening two years ago prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which severely curtailed commercial air traffic.

“From the standpoint of public engagement on noise we’re back to where we were in 2019” Deanna Zachrisson the airport’s business development manager told Noozhawk.

Airport director Henry Thompson agreed but offered an additional perspective.

“The biggest challenge here is these are coming in as noise complaints” he said. “But in reality what the community is complaining about is airplanes overflying them. It’s not so much a loud airplane; it’s an airplane flying over my neighborhood.

“It’s further complicated by what I call disinformation spreading in the community about aircraft not flying a required route into the airport. There is no required route into the airport.”

Coronavirus Reprieve

There’s no question that the now-18-month-old coronavirus pandemic brought a break from aircraft traffic and noise.

At the low point passenger counts were down about 95% and the number of flights had been trimmed substantially. With diminished passenger counts airlines also downsized many flights to smaller aircraft which tend to be quieter.

Noise complaints as tracked by the airport also abated.

Today there are 23 or 24 scheduled airline departures each day from the airport beginning with United’s early morning Denver flight and ending with an Alaska Airlines flight to Seattle at 7:20 p.m.

There are corresponding arrivals ranging from a 9:50 a.m. American Airlines flight from Phoenix to a 10:35 p.m. United flight from Chicago.

At the peak in 2019 Thompson said the airport had 30 commercial arrivals and departures each day.

Pilots Make the Ultimate Decisions

Commercial aircraft flying into Santa Barbara nearly always approach from over the the ocean before making a hard turn to line up with the 6000-foot main runway which runs east-west.

When that runway is operating east to west which it does about 80% of the time those turns are occurring somewhere between Hope Ranch and More Mesa which is just to the east of Goleta Beach.

Under the airport’s voluntary noise-abatement procedures pilots are requested to make their inbound and outbound turns over the undeveloped open space on More Mesa rather than over adjacent residential neighborhoods.

But the key word here is “voluntary.”

“There is a preferred approach for pilots to take into the airport if they are able to fly it safely” Thompson said. “But just like the name says it’s voluntary.”

Neither the airport nor the Federal Aviation Administration has the authority to mandate where pilots fly.

“Airlines operate in a manner deemed safe by the pilot in command” said Aaron Keller the airport’s operations manager.

Put another way it is entirely up to the pilot to decide — based on a variety of factors most notably safety — what route he or she is going to follow on takeoff or landing.

All this is covered by the Airport Noise and Capacity Act or ANCA which was implemented by the FAA in 1990.

As explicitly outlined in the act the FAA prohibits airports from imposing limitations or violations including curfews on any aircraft aircraft operator or airline. The Santa Barbara Airport is open 24/7 for commercial and general aviation use as required by the FAA.

“A pilot may choose to not accept the voluntary approach due to a number of factors that deem the voluntary approach unsafe” according to a noise report issued by the airport in May.

“These include weather conditions high aircraft altitude aircraft speed position when cleared by air traffic to turn inbound pilot training or proficiency on the approach cabin readiness emergencies of inbound aircraft or air traffic separation needed.”

From the pilot’s perspective there may be another safety-related issue with the landing approach from the east.

According to Keller the industry standard for landing a jetliner is to line up with the main runway on final approach 3-5 miles out. However the designated noise-abatement route over the More Mesa open space means that final approach is occurring only 2¼ miles out.

Complicating that maneuver is the airport’s relatively short runway — just over a mile compared to some 11000 feet at an airport such as LAX.

The bottom line is that the decision on where to fly ultimately lies with the pilot including whether to follow noise-abatement flight paths.

Advising and Educating Airlines

Thompson and other airport officials contend that they work consistently with pilots and airlines to advise and educate them on adopted noise-abatement procedures which have been designed to reduce the impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.

Some airlines Thompson noted are more receptive than others though he would not name names.

“At one time we did have more aircraft that were flying this voluntary noise-abatement approach” he acknowledged adding that adherence has declined.

“We’ve had some of our airlines flight standards folks who have flown this route into Santa Barbara who do not believe it’s a safe approach to fly every single time. The airlines are not going to mandate the routes.”

The airport also has a system that the public can use to track offending flights and make noise complaints one that has been getting quite a workout lately.

For example the airport logged 536 noise complaints in May 2019 which was a record year for passenger counts at the airport according to Zachrisson.

By May 2020 as the pandemic was taking hold and air traffic was cratering that number had dropped to 176 complaints.

This year however the complaints in May jumped back up to 564.

At a recent Airport Commission meeting Keller estimated that about 75% of flights follow the voluntary noise-abatement procedures.

However residents argue that the actual number is lower and there appears to be a lot variability in routes even when the planes fly over some portion of the open space. If the planes cross near the eastern or western edge of the open space they still are fairly close to residences.

Airport officials say a letter typically is issued to the operator of an aircraft that does not follow the procedures. Thompson added that the airport has begun monitoring flight paths more aggressively in an attempt to be more proactive.

According to information provided by the airport during a seven-month period in 2019 38% of the letters involved complaints originating in Hope Ranch with 31.3% from the More Mesa area and 18.3% from neighborhoods south of Hollister Avenue.

How the Noise Advisory Program Works

The Santa Barbara Airport’s Noise Advisory Program includes an automated online system called PublicVue for making complaints about aircraft noise.

There also is an automated noise advisory telephone hotline for registering complaints: 805.967.1900.

The airport reports receiving about 1400 noise complaints per month with the majority involving aircraft that have followed the noise-abatement procedures.

“We’re happy to look at each and every complaint” Zachrisson said.

“Many noise complaints are received from locations directly under the established flightpath of the voluntary noise-abatement approach for Runway 25 (the main east-west runway)” according to the airport’s website.

“For flights landing at SBA that are determined to have not flown a voluntary noise-abatement approach excluding flight tracks flown for safety or spacing requirements education is provided to the aircraft operator for future use.”

Somewhat surprisingly the airport receives more complaints about aircraft landings than takeoffs according to Zachrisson.

Keller explained that likely is because planes are on a gentler glide slope — and therefore lower — when landing than they are when taking off and rapidly gaining altitude.

But Thompson flatly rejected the idea that planes are flying lower than they used to noting that they follow pre-determined glide slopes that have not changed.

“We’ve gotten reports that an aircraft is flying low at 200 feet over Hope Ranch” he said. “That can’t happen because they couldn’t make it to the airport.”

Airport officials say aircraft may also appear to be lower simply because they are larger than the planes that previously were more common.

An additional beef voiced to Noozhawk by More Mesa resident Sawhill and others is that no one ever responds to their complaints. Thompson is matter-of-fact in his response.

“One of things we don’t do is call back on every complaint” he said. “There’s no way we could do that.”

Reasons for More Aircraft Noise

There are several factors contributing to the increase in aircraft noise around the Santa Barbara Airport.

As previously noted the flight volume has jumped considerably over the last year and now exceeds what it was in 2019.

Airlines have added back flights that were dropped at the height of the pandemic. New routes have been added by existing airlines — to Chicago and San Diego — and frequencies have increased to some destinations.

Additionally Southwest Airlines entered the market in May with five flights daily — serving Oakland Las Vegas and Denver.

The airlines also have moved to larger aircraft to accommodate growing passenger counts.

The largest commercial jetliners serving the local airport are the Boeing 737s that Southwest flies exclusively.

“The 737 is a heavier aircraft and carries more people” Keller noted. “Therefore the engines must be more powerful.”

Most of the other airlines have jumped up from the smaller Bombardier regional jets and are now flying primarily Airbus-319s or 320s or Embraer-175s.

Typically only 4-5 of the daily flights are now on the smaller commuter jets.

Also likely contributing to the problem is a change in control tower procedures dictated by the FAA.

Previously aircraft were guided in using the voluntary noise abatement approaches Keller told the commission.

But the FAA citing liability concerns has directed control tower personnel to only vector aircraft for reasons of safe operation and aircraft separation.

“By doing a anything more than that they are putting the FAA in jeopardy of some type of legal liability” he said.

Moreover there is no doubt that on a daily basis there are aircraft that for whatever reason don’t follow a route over the More Mesa open space and instead overfly residential neighborhoods. This can be tracked on the airport’s PublicVue website as well as by using websites such as FlightRadar24 or FlightAware.

Taken together these factors have led to more noise and more complaints.

Airlines Are Not the Only Ones

While the airlines — with their larger aircraft and distinctive liveries — tend to get the most attention they are not the only ones generating noise complaints at the airport.

There is a small fleet of corporate jets that call Santa Barbara home and many others regularly fly in and out of the airport. It’s not unusual for there to be 25-30 corporate jet arrivals and departures on any given day.

These aircraft though much smaller than commercial jetliners generally use the airport’s main runway and are asked to follow the same voluntary noise-abatement procedures as the airlines.

There also are dozens of takeoffs and landings each day by smaller general-aviation aircraft from the ubiquitous Cessna 175s to larger twin-engine planes.

Most of these planes use the airport’s shorter parallel runways — 15 Left and 15 Right — that run north-south roughly from Hollister Avenue to the edge of Goleta Beach.

There is a voluntary noise-abatement program for these runways as well with pilots asked to fly over Highway 101 while inbound to or outbound from the airport.

These runways nearly always operate north-to-south with planes taking off heading out over the ocean while those that are landing make their final turns to line up with the runway over neighborhoods in Goleta including the Lake Los Carneros area.

What Can Be Done?

Asked about the outlook — in terms of flight volumes and noise complaints — Thompson acknowledged that both can be expected to increase.

“In the future is it likely there could be more flights” he said. “We’re not going to see 20 more flights or 10 more flights per day but we may see an additional two or three.”

That surely is not music to the ears of residents most affected by airport noise but there is hope for some improvement.

“We’re working with the FAA on what’s called a ‘charted visual approach’ into the airport that will more precisely bring the aircraft in over the open space using navigational aids” Thompson said.

That process which typically takes about 18 months has been underway for six months he said and will take about another year to be completed.

Alaska Airlines reportedly uses something similar — its own proprietary technology — to help its planes follow the voluntary guidelines.

“It’s not a magic bullet” Thompson said of the charted visual approach “but it should address the nonadherence to the voluntary noise-abatement plans.”

But the wave of coronavirus infections linked to the Delta variant has somewhat clouded predictions about costs remaining high.

When it comes to travel consumer confidence is sagging. The marketing research firm Destination Analysts has been surveying 1200 Americans weekly about their travel sentiments since March 2020 and by Aug. 9 found optimism had crashed 40 percent since early June with only 20 percent of respondents feeling optimistic — a year-to-date low. The majority still believed road-tripping outdoor activities and dining out were safe but less than half considered flying visiting an indoor attraction like a museum or taking an Uber safe.

Fall has traditionally been the season when leisure travel slackens triggering lower shoulder season rates. Last year virtual schooling and work-from-anywhere office policies extended the summer strength for many vacation destinations. Now with rising vaccine rates will flexible schedules continue to allow travelers to change their Zoom backgrounds this fall or will fear of the Delta variant and in-person work or learning curtail it? We looked into travel’s murky crystal ball to find out how prices will fare in the future.

Airfares edge down

Airfares took off this summer as domestic travelers returned to the skies in force. The Consumer Price Index a monthly measure of the change in average prices paid for consumer goods showed airline fares rose 7 percent between April and May after a nearly 3 percent increase in June. They stabilized down .1 percent in July."

I’m not sure who doesn’t love Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter books and movies but she is such a brilliant character and she was so well written. A lot of Harry Potter fans identify with her strongly because she is so strange and unusual and at first introduction she is an outcast. She quickly earns the love of both fans and other characters inside the world of Harry Potter and her character will be loved and celebrated for a long time.

If you love Luna just like I do then you will be excited to hear that Totally the Bomb has created a Starbucks “secret menu” item just for Luna! Not only does it sound good but the flavors seem to just fit Luna. Looks at how distortedly beautiful this drink is!

This drink is colorful and vibrant just like Luna! Here’s the recipe so next time you’re at Starbucks you can give your Barista the directions:

Start by ordering a Venti Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade. Ask for light kiwi base and light strawberry puree as well. Then ask for vanilla sweet cream cold foam with more strawberry puree blended in it.

And that’s it! The flavors are bold and it has a good caffeinated kick to it. If you are able to try this drink next time you’re at Starbucks let us know in the comments if this Luna Lovegood Refresher is just as good as it sounds and looks!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0aXJ3b3JsZC5jb20vc2VlLW5ld3MtaWFsZC1hd2FyZHMtMjAyMS1ob25vdXJlZC1leGNlbGxlbmNlLWluLWdsb2JhbC1saWdodGluZy1kZXNpZ27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IALD Awards 2021 honoured excellence in global lighting design,"The 38th Annual IALD International Lighting Design Awards returned with an online event on June 24 2021 assembling design luminaries from all across the world as it honoured 20 exceptional projects that represented the best in lighting design over the past year.

The 33-year-old Selling Sunset beauty looked leggy as she modeled a colorful Gucci cardigan over an eye-catching pink strapless set.

The platinum haired reality star was seen grabbing a few iced beverages before returning to her yellow Lamborghini Urus.

The realtor-turned-reality star strutted through the parking lot in a black Gucci cardigan with rainbow 'G's' and matching trim.

She opted to use the sweater as a dress before she revealed a bright pink bandeau top and matching skirt set on her way out.

The new mom flashed her very flat midriff in the process just three months after she welcomed her first child Christian with husband Christian Richard.

Adding a touch more glamour to the look she wore a pair of sparkly stilettos with a bow that accentuated her incredible legs and a diamond tennis necklace.

The breakout star of the hit Netflix show has been hard at work filming season four of the show with her equally stunning castmates.

And for a bit of work and play the show recently brought the cast overseas to film in both Mykonos and Southern Italy.

On Tuesday she and her family jetted back to the US by way of private jet as their luxury vacation came to a close.

Though Christine has never been one to play by the rules her ongoing on-screen feud with castmate Chrishell Stause is set to get a bit more complicated after it was revealed the DWTS vet is dating one of Oppenheim Group's bosses Jason.

'We're probably not going to be hanging out as soon as the cameras are down' Stause told PEOPLE last month after saying that the on-screen drama between them 'is still going to be there' because motherhood hadn't changed 'much' of Christine's personality.

“These guys are good — really good” the Lutheran St. Charles senior recalled. “I could really enjoy playing on a team like this.”

That was the beginning of a long journey that will end this fall.

Rustemeyer and several of his teammates from that group of eight years ago make up the core of the Lutheran St. Charles team that heads into this high school season with sky-high hopes.

The Cougars who are the No. 6 small school in the STLhighschoolsports.com preseason rankings return starters at 17 of 22 positions from a group that won six of eight games during last year’s truncated campaign.

Most importantly all but three of those players have started on the varsity level since their freshman seasons.

“They’ve been battle-tested” Lutheran St. Charles coach Arlen Harris Sr. said. “This is their last hurrah to really put it together and get us a championship.”

Yes a state title is certainly a possibility along Mexico Road.

“This year is the one we’ve been waiting for for a long time” said senior Arlen Harris Jr. who is one of the top running backs in the country. “Every year we’ve been getting better. Now it’s our last chance to prove ourselves.”

Harris Jr. is the son of Arlen Harris Sr. who spent four years in the NFL as a running back including three with the St. Louis Rams. Harris Jr. has given a verbal commitment to attend Stanford University choosing the high-level academic school over college football bluebloods such as Florida Iowa Michigan Michigan State LSU and Penn State.

Cut in much the same mold as his father Arlen Jr. stands 5-foot-11 and weighs 190 pounds. Arlen Sr. was 5-11 and 210. He ran for 497 yards in his NFL career with six touchdowns including three in the Rams’ 33-21 win at Pittsburgh on Oct. 26 2003.

Harris Jr. has rushed for 3702 yards and 71 touchdowns over three seasons for the Cougars. He’s recorded 19 games of 100 yards or more.

A difference maker with lightning-quick speed and amazing strength Harris Jr. is expected to have an eye-popping season in his last high school campaign.

He and Rustemeyer are the best of friends. Avid fishermen the two have spent countless hours on a lake dreaming of a state crown.

“This year is going to be something to see” said Rustemeyer a 6-2 280-pound two-way lineman who is headed to Arkansas State University. “I think we all feel really good that we have the ability to do something special.”

Harris Jr. and Rustemeyer form an impressive cornerstone.

But the rest of the team is equally talented and made up primarily of veterans who have been through numerous battles together.

Senior Jaydon Wannstedt a 6-2 285-pound lineman adds even more strength in the trenches.

Senior quarterback Aaron Coffey (6-5 240) threw for 1067 yards in eight games last season and has been running the show since his freshman year.

“Our general — he’s the most underrated (senior) in the area” Harris Sr. said. “I feel like we go as he goes. He’s a huge part of what we do.”

Center Christian Polk anchors the offensive line. Speedy wideout and defensive back Aidan McLean is a two-way threat who goes back to the Renegade days.

Sophomore Ayden Harris a running back and defensive back has the potential to be as good as his older brother Arlen Jr.

“This is the first year that we actually have really good depth” Harris Sr. said. “We’ll be able to play and compete with those bigger schools.”

The Cougars traditionally play a beefed-up schedule. This year is no exception including an early-season battle Sept. 3 at Chaminade after opening the season at 7 p.m. Aug. 27 against Denver Lutheran from Parker Colo.

Lutheran St. Charles was well on its way to a long postseason run last fall when it got derailed by Duchesne 16-13 in its second postseason game. It beat Duchesne 35-13 earlier in the season.

“That didn’t sit well with us” Rustemeyer said. “It took a while for it to sink in. But something like that won’t happen again.”

Lutheran St. Charles reached the Class 3 quarterfinal round two seasons ago before losing to Trinity.

A similar run this time around is a strong possibility.

“This is the year of the Cougars” Rustemeyer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5jaW5uYXRpLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvb2hpby1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL3N0LXhhdmllci1ib21iZXJzLXZzLWxha290YS13ZXN0LWZpcmViaXJkcy1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1mb290YmFsbC13ZWVrLTEvODE3MDQxMzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cincinnati high school football: St. X comes back to beat Lakota West,"When they stepped onto Ballaban Field at RDI Stadium it had been 294 days since St. Xavier and Lakota West had played an epic game in the 2020 regional final.

That game ended with the Bombers winning on a Brogan McCaughey-to-Liam Clifford (Penn State) pass in the final seconds 10-7. Coach Steve Specht's Bombers would add two more wins and bring home the Division I state title in Columbus.

Friday night St. Xavier needed another comeback.

Only this one wasn't as frantic. Down 14-3 midway through the second quarter the Bombers scored 28 unanswered points holding Lakota West scoreless over the next 29 minutes to win 31-14.

""We told them to stay the course at halftime"" Specht said. ""It's week one we're just trying to figure out who we are. It was a very hard-fought game and I thought the kids on both sides of the ball played incredibly hard.""

Down 14-10 at half senior Grant Lyons flipped the script with a 27-yard interception return for a touchdown that gave the Bombers a 17-14 lead.

""God love Grant!"" Specht said. ""He'll do one thing so bonehead then he makes an unbelievable interception for a touchdown. He plays with such incredible heart and he plays so hard. It's my job to teach him how to play smart. God love him he's a warrior!""

By game's end he had picked off another pass to set up a final score and seal the game. For his efforts he was named the Skyline Chili Crosstown Showdown MVP.

""It was awesome!"" Lyons said of his night's work. ""We worked so hard all offseason and it showed up tonight. We keep our heads in the game never put our heads down and fight hard to the end.""

The game began as sluggish as it was late last October. The Bombers could only muster a Mason Rohmiller field goal in the first quarter. Lakota West and Mitch Bolden also struggled until they caught a break.

A bad snap to Max Klare on a punt gave the Firebirds possession at the Bombers 6-yard line. After a few sputters Bolden zipped a four-yard pass to Brennan Remy for a 7-3 lead.

Then after stopping the Bombers and getting the ball on the 30 after a short punt the Firebirds lit up the scoreboard again. Bolden found Alex Afari in the corner of the end zone and suddenly it was a 14-3 Lakota West lead with the visitor's side erupting in joy.

Prior to the half St. Xavier went on a 14-play 80-yard drive that ate up more than four-and-a-half minutes. Charles Kellom plowed in from the 5-yard line and at halftime St. Xavier trailed 14-10.

The Bombers quickly snuffed out an early third-quarter drive by Lakota West when Lyons picked off his first pass and trotted unscathed 27 yards to the blue end zone shifting momentum again.

Add-on points came when McCaughey and Klare hooked up for the first time this season on a 25-yard scoring pass putting the Bombers up 10 late in the third quarter.

The clinching score came with 1:09 left when Kellom surpassed the century mark rushing with a 13-yard touchdown.

It was a victory for the blue-clad fans more than anything according to coach Specht.

""This is living!"" Specht said. ""What happened last year these kids didn't get a chance to live. We're living now. I think that's a bigger victory than anyone winning or losing on the field.""

The Bombers have not been beaten since Sept. 18 of last year and haven't lost to an Ohio team since a loss to Elder in the playoffs to end 2019.

Kellom finished with 101 yards rushing and two touchdowns as St. Xavier took advantage of their returning offensive lineman with more of a ground and pound attack. McCaughey added 41 yards on the ground and was 11-of-21 passing for 113 yards. It wasn't the passing pace he had when he threw for more than 3000 yards last year but that wasn't the game plan.

""When you have your line back and your running backs we thought that was going to be the strength of the offense"" Specht said.

Said top rusher Kellom ""We're looking to run the ball a lot more. This was a good win. They're a good team we're a good team it was just a hard-fought win.""

Bolden led the Lakota West run game with 81 yards and was 8-for-21 throwing for 103 yards.

Both squads are littered with Division I recruits. Corner Jyaire Brown and offensive lineman Tegra Tshabola are Ohio State-bound at Lakota West and safety Alex Afari is headed to Kentucky.

At St. Xavier tight end Klare and lineman Brian Parker II will play at Duke and blocker Cam Collins is going to Air Force. Defensively linebacker Lyons will be a Miami RedHawk with defensive lineman Sam Buerkle going to Fordham.

Coach Tom Bolden's ultimate goal now is to get his Lakota West team into a postseason rematch with his good friend Specht and St. Xavier.

""We played terrible and we were in that ballgame"" Bolden said. ""They're a great football team. They didn't turn the ball over and they made more plays. We're still a really good football team. We'll get better each week. We'll be better for this in the long run for sure.""

St. Xavier travels to Colerain next Friday. The Cardinals fell 20-14 to La Salle Friday. Lakota West will host West Clermont which lost at home to Hamilton.

This global center will service North America procurement activities.

In the first phase of hiring the rapidly growing company plans to fill up to 100 positions to support purchasing reporting supplier management and administrative activities. This is in addition to the more than 350 finance positions already in Costa Rica and expands to two additional floors in the San Antonio Business Park facility.

“We are establishing a global procurement center in Costa Rica based on its well-developed business ecosystem and wide pool of talent to support our business needs” said Rodrigo Cal Vice President Financial Services Stryker. “We already have an existing infrastructure in Costa Rica supporting our global finance team and this move will support our world-class procurement and related operations.”

Andrés Valenciano Minister of Foreign Trade was pleased with the news and emphasized “Since Stryker’s establishment in the country we have witnessed their commitment to Costa Rica and our people. This expansion by a top leader in the medical technology industry is a clear reflection of this commitment which now brings 100 new job opportunities to join the 350 local employees who already work for the company. We want companies like Stryker to continue investing growing and creating both value and quality jobs in our country. Therefore we continue to work diligently to improve our country’s competitiveness.”

“Stryker is looking for qualified candidates who want to work for a global company that helps its customers improve patient and healthcare outcomes every day” said Dale C. Pease CPSM Senior Director Global Procurement for Stryker. “This is the next step in our global procurement’s transformation strategy to design a world-class procurement organization and we need talented and goal-driven individuals to join our team and help us achieve our goal.”

Jorge Sequeira Managing Director at CINDE added “Since Stryker’s arrival in the country just two years ago the company has demonstrated exceptional growth in Costa Rica. We celebrate and appreciate the trust they have placed in our nation through the expansion of their operations to include a global procurement center. Costa Rica offers an ideal business environment where digital capabilities evolve rapidly to respond to the needs of Industry 4.0. Stryker’s performance contributes to our services sector which represents 8.1% of Costa Rica’s gross domestic product thanks to the export of knowledge-intensive services according to data from PROCOMER and the Central Bank. Fourteen years ago that percentage was only 3.9% – a clear demonstration of how Costa Rica has established itself as a strategic destination to deliver knowledge to the world.”

The company will hire candidates with experience across the spectrum of supply chain including purchasing planning spend analysis and process improvement.

Information like Social Security numbers driver's licenses and account PINs were exposed. Here are some steps you can take right now to protect your financial information.

Regardless whether you're a T-Mobile user the exposure of account PINs is a major danger. That's the password that you're asked to give to a T-Mobile employee before any changes can be made to your account. A scammer who knows your account password can call customer care and ask to have the SIM card linked to your phone number changed to a new SIM card and device effectively taking over your phone number. If you've moved on from T-Mobile to another carrier and used the same passcode you should change it immediately.

Sim swapping is not just an inconvenience. Once someone has taken over your phone number they can use it to impersonate you or log into your online accounts. They can get instant access to any two-factor authentication codes you receive through text messages the PIN that an institution texts you to verify your identity.

So if they also have your password or other personal information they're just a few clicks away from logging into your email bank or social media accounts. And if someone gains access to your email account they can change other passwords and search through your email archive to build a list of your entire online presence. Take the time to move away from SMS 2FA codes and use app-based codes instead. Seriously.

Watch this: T-Mobile data breach: What you need to know 02:42

For example Matthew Miller a contributor to CNET sister site ZDNet fell victim to a SIM-swap scam and he experienced the fallout for months afterward. Whoever took over Miller's phone number gained access to his Gmail account and promptly changed his password then erased every email deleted every file in his Google Drive account and eventually deleted his Gmail account altogether.

Miller later discovered he was targeted because he had a Coinbase account and his bank account was linked to it. Miller's phone received his Coinbase account's two-factor authentication code so the hackers were able to log into his cryptocurrency trading account and buy $25000 worth of Bitcoin. Miller had to call his bank and report the transaction as fraud. That's on top of the immense vulnerability he felt.

To be clear this isn't an issue that's specific to T-Mobile. All wireless carriers and customers can fall victim to SIM-swap fraud. Below are some tips to secure your wireless account.

It takes just a few minutes to add a critical layer of security to your account. Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET

How to prevent SIM swapping on your account

You can decrease your chances of someone gaining access to and taking over your phone number by adding a PIN code or password to your wireless account. T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T all offer the ability to add a PIN code.

If you're unsure if you have a PIN code or need to set one up here's what you need to do for each of the major US carriers.

T-Mobile: Set up T-Mobile's Account Takeover Protection service. You need to add the feature to each individual line on your account. I also suggest changing your account PIN (if you're not asked to while setting up Account Takeover Protection).

AT&T: Go to your account profile sign in then click Sign-in info. Select your wireless account if you have multiple AT&T accounts then go to Manage extra security under the Wireless passcode section. Make your changes then enter your password when prompted to save.

Verizon Wireless: Call *611 and ask for a Port Freeze on your account and visit this webpage to learn more about enabling Enhanced Authentication on your account.

If your phone loses service contact customer care right away. Juan Garzon/CNET

If you have service through a different carrier call their customer service number to ask how you can protect your account. Most likely you'll be asked to create a PIN or passcode.

When creating a PIN or passcode keep in mind that if someone has enough information to fake that they're actually you using a birthday anniversary or address as the PIN code isn't going to cut it. Instead create a unique passcode for your carrier and then store it in your password manager. You are using a password manager right?

How to know if your SIM has been swapped



The easiest way to tell if your SIM card is no longer active is if you completely lose service on your phone. You may receive a text message stating the SIM card for your number has been changed and to call customer service if you didn't make the change. But with your SIM card no longer active you won't be able to place a call from your phone -- not even to customer service (more on this below).

In short the quickest way to tell if you've been affected is if your phone completely loses service and you can't send or receive text messages or phone calls.

What to do if you're a victim of SIM-swap fraud

The truth is if someone wants access to your phone number badly enough they will do all they can to trick your carrier's support representative. What we've outlined above are best practices but they're not foolproof.

Researchers were able to pose as account holders who had forgotten their PIN or passcodes oftentimes providing recent outgoing calls from the target phone number called by the actual account holder. How do they know those numbers? They tricked the account holder into calling. Even scarier sometimes the researchers were able to provide phone numbers for incoming calls to the account they want to take over. Meaning the bad guy simply needed to call the target's phone number themselves.

Once you realize you've lost service on your mobile device call your carrier immediately and let them know you didn't make the changes. The carrier will help you recover access to your phone number. I can't emphasize this enough -- do not wait to call. The longer someone has access to your phone number the more damage they can do.

Here are the customer service numbers for each major carrier. Put your carrier's number in your phone as a contact:

AT&T: 1-800-331-0500

1-800-331-0500 T-Mobile: 1-800-937-8997

1-800-937-8997 Verizon: 1-800-922-0204

Once someone gains access to your phone number they'll have access to most of your online accounts. James Martin/CNET

With your SIM card deactivated you won't be able to call from your phone but at least you'll have the number handy to use on someone else's device.

You'll also want to reach out to your banks and credit card companies and double-check all of your online accounts to make sure that the perpetrator hasn't changed your passwords or made any fraudulent transactions. If you find transactions that aren't yours call your bank or visit a branch right away and explain the situation.

Remember no matter how many PIN codes or passwords we add to our online accounts there's still a chance that someone will find a way to break in. But at least by setting a passcode for your account and knowing what to do if you find yourself a victim of SIM swapping you're prepared.

Another critical aspect of strong online security is to use a password manager to create and store unique passwords on your behalf. Additionally enable two-factor authentication on every account that offers it. And make sure you're not falling for robocalls or scammy text messages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9hdHQtdmVyaXpvbi10LW1vYmlsZS1vci11c2NlbGx1bGFyLW1hcC1zaG93cy13aGljaC1jZWxsLXByb3ZpZGVyLWdpdmVzLXlvdXItYXJlYS1iZXN0LWNvdmVyYWdlL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9hdHQtdmVyaXpvbi10LW1vYmlsZS1vci11c2NlbGx1bGFyLW1hcC1zaG93cy13aGljaC1jZWxsLXByb3ZpZGVyLWdpdmVzLXlvdXItYXJlYS1iZXN0LWNvdmVyYWdlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T Verizon T-Mobile or UScellular?

LAS VEGAS — Yordenis Ugas was a 4-1 underdog according to Bet MGM coming into his WBA (super) welterweight title defense against Manny Pacquiao on Saturday. Outside of his family fight team and people in his native Cuba not many gave Ugas a chance to win.



But that is why they get into the ring as Ugas used his power and boxing precision to upset Pacquiao and win by unanimous decision (116-112 116-112 115-113) to retain his belt at the T-Mobile Arena. DAZN News scored the fight 115-113 for Ugas.

""I’m very excited but I want to thank Manny Pacquiao for giving me this moment today"" Ugas said in his post-fight interview.



Pacquiao came out on fire with his patent combinations and appeared to have set the tone. Ugas had a different idea in mind. About halfway through the round Ugas started utilizing the jab to keep Pacquiao at bay and to let the Senator from the Phillippines know that he was here to fight and wasn't going anywhere.



The tide started to shift in the sixth round for Ugas. Along with the jab he started blasting Pacquiao with overhand rights that boxing's only eight-division world champion had no answer for. Any time Pacquiao would get close Ugas would either pop a jab or uncork a power combination.



Pacquiao had one last gasp in the tenth when he countered an Ugas right and unleashed a flurry to wobble the champion. Pacquiao went for the finish but Ugas immediately clinched and curbed the slight bit of momentum.



In the 11th and 12th rounds Ugas fought the best rounds of his life. He applied constant pressure and rocked Pacquiao on numerous occasions with the overhand right to secure the biggest win of his career.



What's next for Pacquiao?



Talk of retirement was the central theme coming into Saturday night. But like he has all of fight week Pacquiao remained non-committal.



""I don’t know"" Pacquaio said in his post-fight interview. ""I’m going to go rest and relax. I will make that decision later.""

The Tesla CEO revealed the Tesla Bot this week during an event devoted to advances in artificial intelligence. Described as ""the next generation of automation"" on the Tesla website the humanoid robot is ""capable of performing tasks that are unsafe repetitive or boring.""

That makes sense as there are many jobs needing done but humans don't want to do Musk says. ""What is the economy? At the foundation it is labor"" he said during the event. ""So what happens when there is no shortage of labor?""

Musk hopes to have a prototype ready for release next year. He also noted that the robot which is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds would not be physically threatening. ""At a mechanical level at a physical level you can run away from it – and most likely overpower it"" Musk said to laughter during the presentation.

A more well-known robot made an appearance this week too: the Boston Dynamics humanoid Atlas which has been shown in previous YouTube videos that it can jog jump and dance along with the company's robotic dog.

Now Atlas is capable of doing parkour and gymnastics the company detailed in a new video and blog post from the company.

The Atlas robot is shown moving through obstacles – jumping and running along uneven platforms and a balanced beam. Then two robots spin and do two flips synchronized and mirroring the other.

The robotics company previously has shown how its robot dogs can go down stairs and open doors. And the dogs are being used by some police departments.

All this robot activity led some on Twitter to be concerned about the future. ""Elon Musk says they're making 'friendly' robots and then immediately proceeds to affirm that they'll be easy to 'run away from' if you know it comes to that"" one person posted.

Another joked – we hope – to put actor Will Smith who fought intelligent robots in the 2004 film ""I Robot"" on alert.

PPV schedule main card start time vs. Yordenis Ugas,"After over two years of inactivity 42-year-old Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2 39 KOs) will face Yordenis Ugas (26-4 12 KOs) for the WBA welterweight championship on Saturday night at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise Nevada.

Pacquiao the only eight-division champion in boxing’s history will look to reclaim a world title against Ugas who was awarded the WBA (super) title in January. Pacquiao held the title after his split-decision victory over Keith Thurman in July of 2019 but was stripped of it in January due to inactivity.

Pacquiao was initially scheduled to fight WBC and IBF champion Errol Spence Jr. though Spence withdrew from the fight on Aug. 10 due to a retinal tear in his left eye. Ugas who was slated to fight Fabian Maidana in the co-main event for the Pacquiao/Spence card agreed to fight Pacquiao on Aug. 10.

Though this fight is perceived to be less intriguing for the general public — Spence is rated as the No. 4 pound-for-pound fighter by ESPN and Pacquiao is one of the greatest boxers in history — Ugas will not be a pushover opponent. He has won 11 of his last 12 fights with his only defeat coming in controversial fashion against former WBC champion Shawn Porter in March of 2019.

Ugas defeated Abel Ramos by split decision in September of 2020 to win the WBA (regular) title before he was upgraded to the super champion in January.

Where is Pacquiao vs. Ugas taking place?

For the first time of his career Pacquiao will be fighting at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise Nevada. Pacquiao has had several of his biggest fights at the MGM Grand Garden Arena including his most recent victory over Thurman and this will be his 22nd career fight in the Las Vegas Nevada area.

Ugas will be fighting at the T-Mobile Arena for the second time of his career and in the Las Vegas area for the sixth time.

Controversy arose between the two fighters in January when Ugas was awarded the WBA (super) welterweight title after Pacquiao had not fought since his victory over Thurman in July of 2019. Pacquiao applied to be reinstated as the WBA champion in July but was denied by the organization.

Recently Pacquiao commented on the WBA’s decision and said his title was “given” to Ugas rather than awarded.

“That is not how you become a champion” Pacquiao said to reporters. “You earn it by winning it inside the ring. We will fight for the title. That is the proper way a champion is crowned.”

Responding to Pacquiao’s stance Ugas said in an interview with Fighthype that he “absolutely” won his belt during his championship fight against Ramos but that Saturday will be a “completely different fight.”

“I got to give him respect until the bell rings and then all that goes out the window” Ugas said.

The mod replicates the entirety of the doomed HMS Titanic in the original Mafia complete with missions based around Salieri’s gang.

The catchily-titled Mafia Titanic Mod has been in development since 2006 and is finally available for release and it’s not even quite completed yet. Part one’s storyline basically goes as far as boarding the infamous ocean liner but does contain a full sandbox where players can explore the Titanic at will. The ship’s interior is not yet complete and most importantly – the actual sinking has not yet been implemented. So this is the less-doomed version of the Titanic.

Lead developer Robin Bongaarts estimates that the final mod will encompass four parts to tell the whole story. Nevertheless part one is available to download now and it’s already very impressive boasting a sizeable portion of the “meticulously recreated and highly populated” ship to explore.

One sad catch – as if the story of the Titanic wasn’t tragic enough – is that the mod is not compatible with the recently released Mafia: Definitive Edition remake of the first game only the original. It has to be the unmodded version of Mafia 1 as well without even the widescreen fix. It’s still available on Steam and GOG at least.

It’s certainly not the only attempt to bring the Titanic to life in games but it’s probably the most impressive – even if after 15 years it sounds like there is still a long way to go before it’s complete. Nevertheless it’s still a fantastic accomplishment and everyone who owns Mafia 1 should check it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“We find ourselves in a dynamic where the consumer demand backdrop is strong while supply chain remains challenging” Scott Roe the chief financial officer of Tapestry Inc. told analysts on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. The retailer which also owns Stuart Weitzman is working on “securing significant expedited deliveries at an additional cost in order to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions at least through the holiday period.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has scrambled the global supply of materials and products fueling inflation and making it hard for retailers and other companies to swiftly meet demand. While renewed outbreaks due to the more contagious delta variant have shaken consumer confidence shoppers still remain eager to spend what they’ve saved during lockdowns and months of restrictions.

Roe told analysts and investors to expect somewhat higher levels of inventory starting in the first quarter intended “to keep the momentum of the business.” The higher cost of shipping those products by air will push up costs but Tapestry’s broader strategy of raising prices while limiting discounts will help to offset the increase he said.

Too much stockpiling can be a warning sign to investors that a company isn’t selling its products. Roe said he wasn’t concerned about the expected increase in inventory. “If we could get more we probably would.”

Todd Kahn Coach’s chief executive officer said he’s not worried about how long it will take to sell through the inventory since the brand’s handbags have timeless styles.

“What is typical in this industry is a very narrow window to sell” he said in an interview. That “is not necessarily the case for us.” Around 40% of Coach handbags are made in Vietnam Kahn said.

Amazon Stores

The retail industry got a jolt early Thursday after a report that Amazon.com Inc. is planning to open several locations that would compete with department stores. Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the possible move “is not surprising” because companies are increasingly seeking to sell seamlessly online and in-person.

Tapestry’s brands have been focused in recent years on decreasing their presence at department stores known as wholesale Crevoiserat said. That reticence could be a sign that higher-end labels may opt to distance themselves from Amazon’s new project which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

“We have a direct-to-consumer model that we value very much” she said in an interview. “That gives us access to a lot of data and an understanding of the consumer that really makes us better as a brand.”

Tapestry shares fell 2.9% at 12:30 p.m. in New York. The stock gained 33% this year through Wednesday outpacing the S&P 500 as demand for handbags and other high-end goods rebounded from last year.

Sales Beat

Tapestry on Thursday posted fourth-quarter net sales of $1.62 billion for the period ended July 3. That narrowly outpaced the $1.55 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share jumped to 74 cents the company said also above analysts’ projections.

The results show how the economic recovery in the U.S. is helping to bolster sales at Tapestry’s three fashion brands. The company reported about 165% year-over-year revenue growth in North America a region where it generates more than half of its sales. Revenue also jumped 60% in mainland China another large market for high-end brands.

Tapestry reinstated its dividend and buyback program promising to return more than $750 million to shareholders in the fiscal 2022 year. The company declared a dividend of 25 cents a share payable on Sept. 27 and said it intends to increase its payout at a faster rate than earnings growth.

Tapestry said it expects revenue of approximately $6.4 billion in fiscal 2022 excluding some anticipated charges. That would mark a record level of sales for Tapestry the company said on a 52-week basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Smart home security cameras. Smart refrigerators. Smart TVs. Smart pet feeders. Smart breast pumps.

From rooftop to basement and the bedrooms in between much of the technology making consumer products smart comes from a little-known Chinese firm Tuya Inc. of Hangzhou.

Tuya says as of 2020 its services cover more than 1100 categories such as healthcare agriculture and apartment management and are sold in more than 220 countries and regions globally in over 116.5 million smart devices.

More than 5000 brands have incorporated Tuya’s technology in their products including Dutch multinational Philips and TCL the Chinese electronics company that makes Roku TV according to the company. Global retailers Amazon Target and Walmart sell consumer products that use Tuya’s technology.

Some cybersecurity experts worry about the lack of protection for the consumer data collected by Tuya tech in household items and in products used in health care and hospitality.

The experts are urging Washington to limit or ban Tuya from doing business in the United States in part because a broad new Chinese law requires companies to turn over any and all collected data when the government requests it.

“If you think about this as a safety issue you can't buy a toy with broken glass in it. You can't buy expired medicines” said Vince Crisler CEO of Dark Cubed a cybersecurity firm in Arlington Virginia. “Could these devices be considered a safety issue and therefore there is a certain level of standards? I think that's absolutely a starting point where Congress could legislate.”

In October 2020 Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced the Adversarial Platform Prevention (APP) Act “which would establish a set of data protection and censorship related standards and restrictions that must be met before high-risk foreign software … is permitted to legally operate in the United States.”

VOA Mandarin contacted Rubio’s office for comment on Tuya but received no response.

Consumer desire

Tuya technology provides the function known as “platform as a service” (PaaS) which enables things to be “smart” by providing them with an internet connection. The smart devices then create a large inter-connected network.

This interlocking chain is the so-called internet of things (IoT). While this allows devices to work with little human intervention and makes life easier the connected devices generate “loads of data that can be used to make the devices useful but can also be mined for other purposes. All this new data and the Internet-accessible nature of the devices raises both privacy and security concerns” according to the website HowStuffWorks.

Backed by Tencent the Chinese tech conglomerate with close ties to Beijing Tuya is one of the leading enterprises in the sector less than a decade after its founding in 2014. It raised

$915 million when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Privacy concerns

Cybersecurity experts see Tuya’s data collection as similar to that of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its 5G-related products because Tuya could “siphon the masses of data – including classified government data – created and shared on its networks and make it available to the Chinese government” said an analysis published on the political website The Hill. “Tuya may well be funneling the information picked up on home security cameras and connected health devices – just to name two examples – back to Beijing.”

The article by two senior researchers from the Washington think tank American Enterprise Institute (AEI) suggests that the U.S. needs to limit Tuya’s expansion in the American market.

Klon Kitchen one of the authors and a cybersecurity expert told VOA Mandarin via email that the central concern is that companies like Tuya must comply with China’s new Data Security Law.

That law stipulates that Chinese enterprises and individuals must support assist and cooperate with law enforcement on data concerning the national economy national security and the public. The June 2021 law also forbids any company in China from providing any foreign law enforcement officials with data stored within China.

“This data might be collected moved and held in a ‘secure’ fashion … but it must still be given to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) and therefore there is a persistent threat that must be addressed” Kitchen said. “Tuya doesn’t have to be incompetent or malicious to be a threat it only needs to be compliant with Chinese law.”

Tuya has not responded to VOA Mandarin’s request for comment. According to an editor’s note that appears with The Hill analysis “Regarding the potential for sharing data with the Beijing government Tuya states that all user data on its platform is assigned to specific regional data centers according to the users’ locations and that servers operate independently with no connection to China.”

Scott Ford CEO of the Kansas City-based tech start-up Pepper told VOA Mandarin that the industry needs to regulate data flows.

“Let's say that a foreign platform has access to 10 million U.S. households or more; that's a growing risk here” he told VOA in an interview conducted via Zoom. “The ability to turn everybody's thermostat up at once and create a power grid issue the ability to access video at any time ... and there's no regulatory environment there's no protections for those types of things today.”

Bob O’Donnell president and chief analyst at the market research firm TECHnalysis Research of Foster City California told VOA Mandarin in an email that there should be concerns about Chinese companies with strong ties to the government.

“The truth is the potential negative impact from a massive [Internet of Things]-related attack could be much worse than any 5G-related concerns” he said. “There are hundreds of millions of connected IoT devices in use today some of which have personal information such as live video feeds or other data that could be used for nefarious purposes.”

Regulating IoT

In March Dark Cubed studied 10 home smart devices sold in the U.S. market. Priced from $20 to $100 Chinese smart technologies were embedded in most of the items.

“Every IoT device we reviewed had a business connection to China and every product was observed communicating with infrastructure in China without our permission” said the report.

Crisler of Dark Cubed told VOA Mandarin that the company found numerous security risks in smart-device apps developed by Tuya.

“There was a lot of potential for information leaks” Crisler said. “Tuya owns the entire chain ... and there's no insight into how they're using that data.”

Last year the U.S. passed the Cybersecurity Improvement Act which covers cybersecurity for IoT devices owned or controlled by the federal government. And the Biden administration has continued an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 to protect sensitive data from foreign adversaries.

“The United States must act to protect against the risks associated with connected software applications that are designed developed manufactured or supplied by persons owned or controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary” said EO 13873.

Kitchen said this is a start.

“Tuya is the overwhelming market leader and is quickly gaining a foothold in the U.S.” he said. “We must address the larger issues beyond Tuya but we cannot wait for the perfect solution while allowing the CCP to dig deeper and deeper into American IoT infrastructure.”

Gray’s searing pace skilful dribbling and intelligent movement impressed throughout a breathless clash at Elland Road.

The standout moment of his performance came five minutes after half-time when he rifled a precision left-footed strike past Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier to put Everton 2-1 ahead.

Raphinha's 72nd-minute equaliser ultimately meant the points were shared however. Dominic Calvert-Lewin had put the Blues ahead from the penalty spot before Mateusz Klich levelled for the home team.

Summer signing Gary credited boss Rafael Benitez’s tactics and man-management for inspiring a sparkling start to his Everton career.

“I am working well with the manager and I feel like I have integrated into the team and the system very well” he said.

“For me that’s the focus. I want to be a threat up top and hopefully put more goals in.

“Personally it is important (to have a good start).”

On his joyous celebration in front Everton’s passionate away following Gray added: “I went flying to be fair – I think I did a front flip!

“I am just delighted to get off the mark help the team and score in front of the away fans.”

A high-octane clash saw both teams aim 17 shots on goal with Everton having double Leeds’ efforts on target (8-4).

The Blues were firmly in the ascendancy after Gray’s strike – with the forward at the heart of a string of purposeful attacks – but the Toffees' potentially decisive third goal proved elusive.

“Against a team like Leeds you have got to try to bury them to kill the game off” he added.

“I think overall. we could’ve taken more out of the game.

“Leeds are always going to apply the pressure with their fans right behind them. They got their equaliser and in the end we have to take the point.”

NTPC commissions largest Floating Solar PV Project in the country



The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC ) Ltd has commissioned the largest floating solar PV project of 25MW on the reservoir of its Simhadri thermal station in Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh. This is also the first solar project to be set up under the Flexibilisation Scheme notified by the Government of India in 2018.

The Solar PV project was inaugurated today by Shri Sanjay Madan RED (WR2 & SR) NTPC .

The floating solar installation which has a unique anchoring design is spread over 75 acres in an RW reservoir. This floating solar project has the potential to generate electricity from more than 1 lakh solar PV modules. This would not only help to light around 7000 households but also ensure at least 46000 tons of CO2e are kept at arm’s length every year during the lifespan of this project. The project is also expected to save 1364 million litres of water per annum. This would be adequate to meet the yearly water requirements of 6700 households.

The 2000MW coal-based Simhadri Station is the first power project to implement an open sea intake from the Bay of Bengal which has been functional for more than 20 years.

NTPC is also planning to set up a hydrogen-based micro-grid system on a pilot basis at Simhadri.

With a total installed capacity of 66900 MW NTPC Group has 71 Power stations including 29 Renewable projects. NTPC has set a target to install 60 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2032. NTPC is also India's first energy company to declare its energy compact goals as part of the UN High-level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE).

The group has over 17 GW of capacity under construction including 5 GW of renewable energy projects. Uninterrupted supply of electricity through environment-friendly energy projects at affordable prices has been the hallmark of NTPC.

Secondly experts say this technology could very well revolutionize the job of military sniper.

Lastly imagine a bullet as a self-guided weapon able to make course corrections in mid-flight.

It sounds a bit crazy but apparently this is a pet project of those mad scientists at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA.

Renowned for funding weird and wonderful military technologies DARPA actually claims that EXACTO or Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance bullets turns .50 caliber bullets into guided rounds capable of zeroing in on a target Kyle Mizokami of The National Interest reported.

Although DARPA is mum on how it does this other sites report that the technology involves optical sensors in the nose of the bullet and fins capable of adjusting the bullet’s flight path in the tail.

The optical sensor apparently homes in on a spot illuminated by a laser designator the report said.

The guidance system is similar to laser-guided weapons such as the Maverick and Hellfire laser-guided missiles. The bullet is even capable of making some remarkably sharp course corrections.

A US Marine with 1st Battalion 3rd Marines 3rd Marine Division provides security during Large Scale Exercise 21 at Marine Corps Training Area Bellows Hawaii Aug. 9 2021. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Jacob Wilson/Released.

Normally military snipers rely on specialized training accurized high power rifles and quality optics to reliably hit targets that are often mere specks on the horizon.

DARPA claims that the system is so easy to use that during testing “a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target” the report said.

Developed by California-based Teledyne Technologies EXACTO technology also has the edge over ballistic computer technology.

While ballistic computers can turn ordinary weapons into precision guided ones once the bullet is fired the computer can no longer assist the shot.

If the target moves during the bullet’s relatively brief — but not insignificant flight time — the shot misses.

EXACTO on the other hand continues to guide the bullet toward the target to the point where it is capable of engaging a moving target the report said.

DARPA claims that snipers can now engage targets more quickly and with greater accuracy at longer ranges.

The technology is unaffected by sudden environmental changes such as a sudden gust of wind. A guided bullet capable of hitting moving targets could also be very useful against drones and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Exact specifications are classified — range maximum crosswinds and how slow a target must be moving.

However DARPA did reveal that it’s looking for a bullet that has the same energy and momentum as current M33 .50-caliber rounds at all ranges greater than 300 meters.

It would also prefer the EXACTO system weigh no more than 46 pounds or the same as the current M107 sniper rifle with a scope and tripod.

EXACTO’s power supply should last for a 14-hour mission and should be compatible with existing sniper rifles such as the M82A1 and M107.

It also wanted a “secure and tamper-proof design to prevent misuse and exploitation of any portion of the system if obtained by an adversary.”

But as always there are downsides.

If EXACTO does use a laser designator to mark a target that laser is visible under the right circumstances alerting those being targeted.

Even worse the laser beam will point directly to the the person lasing the target. The system will also need a long-lasting power supply as a sniper may need to wait for hours for the opportunity to take a shot.

The hardest part of creating a deployable weapon system may be the cost: DARPA wanted a weapon inexpensive enough to actually deploy with the troops.

Strangely enough DARPA has gone quiet on EXACTO and has not released any further details since making it public.

Is it in use? Possibly.

Experts speculate it may have entered classified service with some arm of the Pentagon possibly US Special Operations Command.

It also could have ended up on the DARPA scrapheap — yet another project that proved impractical after millions in spending.

I guarantee other drivers will have like issues in the future will do a search and find this thread.



On a road trip (of course!) my 2012 P85 (#1458) ran into an issue where it showed an orange light around the port refused to Supercharge and returned an error that said that the port could not latch properly. After this it successfully charged at 2 public L2 chargers using the J-plug adapter (SemaConnect and ChargePoint) but repeatedly showed flashing orange lights at 2 different HPWC Tesla Destination Chargers. At the HPWCs it seemed to ""connect"" but at an extremely slow speed --- less than a mile an hour -- and still flashed orange the entire time. As we limped home using L2 we continued to try Superchargers with no luck.



Back home an absolutely AWESOME Tesla Mobile Service Tech Mike Creer came by my house on appointment to check things out. His hunch was that it was a port issue but found the problem with the HPWC strange and wasn't positive. We drove out to a close by Supercharge together and of course the car connected without a problem for the first time since the original issue. So we held off on the port replacement until more failures occurred. There WAS a chance that there was a problem with the charging system itself (thousands) a junction box (also expensive) and he wanted more data before making the call. The port is not a cheap replacement (hundreds) and if it turned out to be something else and a port replacement did not solve the problem it would have been a waste.



Jump to the last 2 days. Yesterday the car showed the dreaded orange light again at an urban Supercharger. By jiggling the connector (to an unusual/atypical degree) it eventually engaged. Then today at a regular Supercharger we could not get the connector out of the port. Long story short it was eventually freed (a bunch of pushing and pulling) and was clear: the problem was the port.



So the port will be replaced tomorrow and the ""good news"" is that it is the least costly fix to the problem. Bottom line is this: port issues do not always present themselves in an obvious way as my case shows. Why the J Plug adapter worked and the HPWC didn't is anyone's guess. If I learn anything more after we take the old port out I will post an addendum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC90ZXNsYS1jbGFpbXMtbW9kZWwtMy1jb3N0cy1qdXN0LWEtZmV3LWNlbnRzLW1vcmUtcGVyLW1pbGUtdG8tcnVuLXRoYW4tYS10b3lvdGEtY2Ftcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Claims Model 3 Costs Just A Few Cents More Per Mile To Run Than A Toyota Camry,"Although it's priced like a BMW the Model 3 is according to Tesla much cheaper to run

Although the Tesla Model 3 in both image and features competes with the likes of premium German manufacturers like BMW and Mercedes its analysis has found that operating costs are significantly lower than those of its direct rivals.

The company noted in its 2020 Impact Report that a Model 3 Standard Range Plus on average costs 55 cents per mile to operate when you consider the MSRP as well as the cost of insurance maintenance and fuel. That it argues makes the true cost of the vehicle only slightly higher than a Toyota Camry and much lower than a BMW 3-Series after just five years and 60000 miles (96500 km).

“Notably running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline) maintenance tires and repairs for Model 3 should cost just over half of a mass-market ICE vehicle such as a Toyota Camry” the company writes.

Tesla uses this as evidence of the Model 3 SR+’s value compared to its competition. Although its MSRP is currently listed at $39990 which is roughly similar to a BMW 330i Sedan ($41450) the cost over time shrinks as a result of the Tesla’s lower running costs.

“Our focus from the beginning has been to develop products that are not only sustainable but also superior to fossil-fuel alternatives in every way” the company writes. “Many incorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or performance but Tesla vehicles combine performance safety efficiency and competitive prices.”

The company also claims that although its vehicles are more environmentally costly to produce than ICE vehicles it becomes greener than a traditional car after just 5340 miles (8593 km) even using the current global energy mix.

That’s an impressive and surprising number because others have estimated that it takes much longer for EVs to amortize the environmental debts incurred by the creation of their batteries but it’s one that Tesla claims is coming from real-world data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy1waG9uZS1rZXktY2FyZC11bmxvY2stc2V0LXVwLWhvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Keys: How To Set Up A Phone To Unlock & Start A Model 3,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy1waG9uZS1rZXktY2FyZC11bmxvY2stc2V0LXVwLWhvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9oaXR0aW5nLXRoZS1ib29rcy1wb3dlci1wbGF5LXRpbS1oaWdnaW5zLXBlbmd1aW4tcmFuZG9taG91c2UtMTUzMDUyMDc1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hitting the Books: How Tesla engineers solved the problem of exploding EV batteries,"Between CEO Elon Musk's often erratic antics strident competition from existing industry titans and a public that is still not fully sold on the idea of traveling via electrical charge Tesla's road to prominence has not been a smooth one.

A panicked letter from LG Chem arrived at Tesla with a dire demand: Return its batteries.

Just as Tesla was proving it could craft a lithium-ion battery pack on its own the battery industry was grappling with the danger that cells posed when they were handled incorrectly. AC Propulsion had learned this the hard way months earlier in one of an increasing number of incidents that sent shudders through the battery industry. En route from Los Angeles to Paris a shipment of AC Propulsion’s batteries caught fire as it was being loaded onto a FedEx airplane while it refueled in Memphis triggering an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and prompting concerns about how to transport batteries in the future. Personal electronics companies such as Apple Inc. were recalling devices with lithium-ion batteries out of concern they could overheat and catch fire. In 2004 and 2005 Apple recalled more than 150000 laptops — with batteries made by LG Chem.

When LG Chem realized it had sold a large number of its batteries to a Silicon Valley startup that planned to use all of them for a single device — a car as it happened — its legal department sent a letter demanding the cells be returned. The battery maker didn’t want to be associated with a potentially fiery experiment.

[Tesla's first CEO Martin] Eberhard ignored the request. He had little choice. His bet that Tesla would be able to find a ready battery supplier was proving harder to cover than expected. Without these batteries there might not be a second chance to get more.

Amid all of the attention on lithium-ion batteries [Tesla Co-Founder/CTO JB] Straubel thought back to his former house in LA where he and [Tesla employee number 7 Gene] Berdichevsky celebrated the idea of an electric car by setting cells afire. If struck with a hammer they put on quite a show. Cars were always in danger of that kind of impact but there was also a more insidious threat. He began to wonder what might happen if one of the cells in the tightly packed cluster that would form a car’s battery pack got too warm.

One day in the summer of 2005 he and Berdichevsky decided to find out. With the office cleared out for the day they went to the parking lot with a brick of cells — a cluster of batteries glued together. They wrapped one of the cells with a wire that would allow them to heat it remotely. Then from a safe distance they flicked the heater on. The individual cell quickly rose to more than 266 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) causing the battery to flash into a blinding flame as the temperature spiked to 1472 degrees then explode altogether sending the remaining skin of the battery into the sky like a rocket. Then another cell in the pack caught fire launching into the air. Soon all of the cells were on fire. Bang. Bang. Bang.

Straubel recognized the implications of his amateur pyrotechnics. If an incident like the one he cooked up were to happen in the wild it could spell the end for Tesla. The next day after they disclosed their experiment to Eberhard they showed him the scorched pavement pitted with holes from the night before. Eberhard urged them to be more careful but he couldn’t deny that more testing was needed. He gathered the team at his rural house on the hills above Silicon Valley for more experiments. This time they dug a pit and put a brick of cells in it then covered it with plexiglass. They heated one of the cells and again the batteries ignited causing a chain of explosions. Straubel had been right: this wasn’t good. They needed outside help to understand exactly what they were dealing with — the team needed battery experts.

Days later a small group of battery consultants were gathered with what at first seemed like a manageable message: Yes even the best battery manufacturers produced a random cell that would have a defect causing it to short and catch fire. But the odds were remote. “It happens really really infrequently” one of the consultants said. “I mean like between one in a million and one in ten million cells.”

But Tesla planned to put about 7000 cells in a single car. Sitting near Straubel Berdichevsky pulled out his calculator and computed the likelihood that a cell in one of their cars might catch fire by chance. “Guys that’s like between one in 150 and one in 1500 cars” he said.

And not only would they be churning out cars with defective batteries that if ignited could set off a chain reaction but their cars could be detonating in the garages of the richest of the rich—burning down mansions and lighting up local TV news. The mood in the room shifted. The questions became more urgent: Was there anything that could be done to avoid defective cells?

Nope. Random cells were always going to get too hot and spark thermal runaway — basically an explosion sparked by overheating.

Straubel and the team returned to their work deflated. The stakes couldn’t have been higher for Tesla. This wasn’t just about solving a hard problem one that threatened to drain limited resources and derail development of the Roadster. If they forged a solution that seemed to work only to see Tesla vehicles catch fire in years to come the company would be doomed. And it would be a failure not just for Tesla; their dreams of the electric car could be set back a generation. They could not only cause injury or death they might kill the electric car in the process.

If they wanted to truly become an automaker they had to face the challenge that GM Ford and others had been dealing with for a hundred years: They had to ensure they were putting safe cars on the roadway. A solution to thermal runaway could amount to a true breakthrough one that would set Tesla apart from the auto industry for years to come. Using lithium-ion batteries had seemed like a smart idea one that a number of thinkers had alighted on. But figuring out how to use them without turning the car into a ticking time bomb could be their greatest innovation.

They stopped work on all aspects of the Roadster project and formed a special committee to find a solution. The team set up whiteboards listing what they knew and what they needed to learn. They began running daily tests. They’d configure a battery pack with the cells spaced differently to see if there was an ideal distance for containing chain reactions. They tried different methods of keeping the batteries cool such as having air flow over them or tubes of liquid brush past them. They’d take the packs to a pad used by local firefighters for training and ignite one of the cells to better understand what was taking place.

The danger of the situation was driven home while en route to one of those tests. Lyons their recruit from IDEO began to smell smoke coming from the back of his Audi A4 where he had loaded a pack of test batteries. It was a sign that a cell was heating up and approaching thermal runaway. He immediately stopped and yanked the batteries out of the car and threw them to the ground before his car could catch fire — a close call.

Eventually Straubel began to narrow in on a solution. If they couldn’t keep a cell from warming maybe they could keep it from reaching the point where it set off a chain reaction. Through trial and error the team realized that if they had each cell lined up a few millimeters from its neighbor snaked a tube of liquid between them and dumped a brownie-batter-like mixture of minerals into the resulting battery pack they could create a system that contained overheating. If a defective cell within began to overheat its energy would dissipate to its neighboring cells with no individual cell ever reaching combustibility.

Where just months earlier they had been struggling to set up a workshop now they were on to something utterly new. Straubel was thrilled. Now he just needed to figure out how to convince the battery suppliers to trust them. Straubel was hearing from Eberhard that the established manufacturers weren’t interested in their business. As one executive at a supplier told Eberhard: You guys are a shallow pocket. We’re a deep pocket. If your car blows up we’ll probably get sued.

And because there’s nothing about the exterior that screams performance you can have some real fun catching out other drivers and leaving them chocking on your virtual fumes.

But for all their good points I’ve always been left with the nagging suspicion that EVs even fast ones are a bit soulless because there’s so much more to an exciting car than purely being pinned to your seat when you floor the right pedal. What’s perfect for everyday cruising isn’t necessarily going to get you excited on a Sunday blast.

I got a chance to test that theory to the extreme recently when I was asked to help out with a short video for Japanese import specialist Torque GT in the UK.

The TGT guys had just taken delivery of a couple of Model 3s as company cars for exactly the same reasons you or I might buy one: they’re fast affordable and fun and in Britain there are some huge tax advantages to running one for your business. Around the same time they were getting ready to send an original 1971 KPGC10 ‘Hakosuka’ GT-R off to its new owner in Australia. Would I like a go? I would and I did.

Related: Original Four-Door Nissan Skyline GT-R ‘Hakosuka’ Is Really Where It All Started

Though I’m not quite ready to switch my own daily driver to an EV I’m a big fan of the Model 3 and always happy to put in more seat time. But more importantly while I’d driven stacks of GT-Rs from the 1989 R32 to a modern R35 Nismo I’d never driven a really early car. And as has been pointed out to me since via YouTube comments I didn’t know how to pronounce its name either. Apparently the ‘u’ is silent meaning it sounds like ‘Hakosska’.

The true OG GT-R was a sedan but the coupe variant looks much cooler to most eyes. It’s tiny in the metal both short and narrow but it packs some real street presence with that steely-eyed stare and rear arch extensions.

Black Vinyl Paradise

Inside well it might as well be 500 years older than the Tesla not 50. There’s no digital media system in here only acres of black vinyl a simple push-button radio and a bank of proper gauges. And the slim pillars means only one of those crazy screen-less supercars like the McLaren Elva has better visibility.

Though the seats look great they’re short on side support but the basic driving position is sound the leather-wrapped steering wheel is the right size of chunky and the five-speed manual transmission is surprisingly finger-tip light.

A Very Different Kind Of GT-R

That transmission sends power to the rear wheels only just one of the key characteristics that separate the first two generations of GT-R built up until the badge was mothballed in 1974 from the all-new four-wheel drive R32 GT-R that appeared in 1989 and with which most of us are far more familiar.

The other important difference is directly under the hood. Yes there’s a DOHC straight-six but it’s a 2.0-liter S20 six not the legendary 2.6-litre RB26. There’s not a turbo in sight and instead of fuel injection the Hakosuka runs a trio of side-draught Weber 45 carbs that sound every bit as good as they look when they’re slurping in air.

One hundred and sixty horses might not sounds like much these days but it was a very healthy output for a 2.0-liter road car in the early 1970s especially one weighing just 2425 lbs (1100 kg).

Less Speed More Sound

I haven’t seen any period performance figures but zero to 60 mph (96 km/h) in around 7.5 seconds sounds about right and would make the old-time GT-R over 2 seconds slower than this entry-level Tesla and a massive 4 seconds slower than the Model 3 Performance. For the racetrack where the GT-R cleaned up much like the R32 did two decades later the engine was allegedly tuned to produce around 240 hp.

This GT-R was in need of a tune the day we filmed so it wasn’t making its original power though even fully fettled it wouldn’t see which way the grippier more powerful Tesla went in a full-on touge battle. Purely judged in terms of handling and performance it would also place second to an R32-R34 GT-R by a long way. But it sounds so glorious and feels so mechanical and involving you’d have plenty of fun doing your best to keep up.

Two-Car Garage Goals

As I concluded in the video the point wasn’t to bash the Tesla. It’s a great car and makes an excellent daily driver as the TGT guys have discovered. The honest truth is even if I could drive the old GT-R every day I wouldn’t and not because I’d be worried about its value. Rather the rawness that makes it feels special would become a PITA faced with a three-hour motorway drive to the airport at 4 am.

But if or more likely when I do make the switch to an EV I think I’ll have to pair it with something a little unrefined and less digital something as characterful as the Hakosuka (though hopefully more affordable) to blow out the cobwebs out at the weekend and remind me I’m alive. New cars like the Model 3 are better in almost every way the cars from the past. But listen to the Hakosuka’s carbs gurgle under load and you’re reminded that ICE cars still have a trick or two up their sleeves."

Its resistance to a Soviet economic blockade backed by lethal violence hastened the evil empire’s collapse.

Now Lithuania’s courage is being tested again by the Chinese Communist Party. It has already withdrawn its ambassador in protest at Lithuania’s invitation to Taiwan to open an office in Vilnius and cut direct rail cargo links. The communist regime in Beijing insists that the offshore democracy is merely a rebel province awaiting imminent reunification with the mainland.

But I can reveal that the pressure on Lithuania is much worse than reported. Thermo Fisher Scientific the country’s flagship foreign investor has been told that its operations in mainland China are at risk if the government in Vilnius does not back down. Together with other Chinese sanctions this could potentially cost Lithuania 2.5% of GDP or more than €1billion

Lithuania’s government has enough on its plate already chiefly dealing with the murderous regime in next-door Belarus. Must it really also sustain a fight with a country more than 500 times its size?

Yes it should. Lithuania’s distinctive and principled foreign policy has already brought international stardom. That will pay dividends for years — cultural diplomatic economic and military.

Czech experience last year suggests that Chinese bullying over Taiwan is — to use Chairman Mao’s phrase — a paper tiger. The more countries that stand up to China the weaker its threats become. Victory by Lithuania would be a decisive blow to mainland China’s image of supposed invincibility.

The cost of groveling by contrast is huge and not just to Lithuania. Any other country thinking of resisting Chinese pressure — on human rights on academic and media freedoms on technology policy on Hong Kong Tibet or Taiwan — will remember what happened to Lithuania.

For that reason any Western decision-maker seeking to regain prestige and credibility following the debacle in Afghanistan could find no better cause than supporting Lithuania.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is standing firm— it deserves plaudits for that. All Western businesses should stand up to Chinese bullying not act as its accomplice. True they may risk losing business in China. But they stand to lose far more if Western governments and other customers exclude them from procurement contracts if employees choose to work elsewhere and if investors sell the shares (I have just bought a tiny quantity of Thermo Fisher Scientific shares to show my appreciation).

Western governments — and other well-wishers — should amplify Taiwan’s efforts to cushion any shock to Lithuanian foreign trade and investment. The cost is tiny against the West’s $40 trillion GDP. The benefit is huge.

Next more countries should follow Lithuania’s lead in pulling out of the 17+1 (a Beijing-run regional beauty contest) in holding hearings about human-rights abuses in China in offering succor to those fleeing Hong Kong and in boosting ties with Taiwan.

This will send the vital message to Beijing that bullying is counterproductive. Lithuania is not small or isolated. It is at the heart of the mightiest military and economic structures in the world. Mess with it at your peril.

Even if such support is slower and patchier than I would like Lithuania should still be unflinching. A concession on the seemingly trivial issue of the exact name of the Taiwanese office (forcing a change to “Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office” for example) will be just the start: the bullies will be back for more.

Much hangs on this. As a friend of Lithuania’s for more than three decades I hope that other countries ride to the rescue. But I remember 1990-91 when they didn’t. And Lithuania won anyway.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzIxL3RoaXMtdW5rbm93bi1iaW90ZWNoLWhhcy1hLXNlY3JldC13ZWFwb24tZm9yLW91dHNpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Unknown Biotech Has a Secret Weapon for Outsized Returns,"Bio-Rad's equity position in a German pharma company is an asset many investors may not realize.

As an investor concerned primarily with fundamentals I'm always happy when my prudent due diligence pays off. For Foolish investors that due diligence includes prioritizing the long term. And over the right time frame a deep understanding of factors like a company's balance sheet business model and return on capital can mean the difference between good investments and great ones.

Such is the case with Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO 3.37%) a global life sciences company that to date has largely flown beneath the radar of investors and analysts alike. The investment case for Bio-Rad includes some interesting economic factors -- for example its strategic return on capital. Here's why this undercover agent is set to unlock long-term upside for investors over the coming years.

A quick recap on Bio-Rad and the industry

Bio-Rad Laboratories manufactures products for the clinical diagnostics and life sciences industries. The life sciences label is actually an umbrella term that covers the fields of biotechnology pharmaceuticals medical technology and biomedicine.

In terms of operations Bio-Rad's clinical diagnostics business which sells laboratory devices and instruments contributes about 50% of its revenue. Meanwhile its life sciences arm develops a whole bunch of gene blood and cell tests making up the other 50%.

Bio-Rad has a market capitalization of $23.09 billion placing it at the midpoint of its life-sciences peers; giant Thermo Fisher Scientific for example has a market cap of $214 billion and Compugen is valued at about $550 million.

While tech and cloud-based advancements were taking place in the industry even before the pandemic COVID-19 accelerated the pace. Global corporate funding for digital healthcare reached $21.6 billion in 2020 up 103% from the year prior. Researchers at Expert Market Research and Industry Research have predicted that the industry could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13% until 2030. Both also agree that further technological advancements are imminent in the industry.

Bio-Rad is certainly well-positioned to capitalize on these two market crosscurrents driven primarily by the newfound digitization of healthcare. And that's cool. But there's one key thing most investors and analysts are missing for this little-known biotech ...

The Sartorius secret

Bio-Rad's equity investment in German pharmaceuticals and lab equipment provider Sartorius AG is a unique value proposition for shareholders that also separates the company from its peers.

It began investing in Sartorius back in 2003 with an initial capital outlay of $10.4 million. By the end of 2004 Bio-Rad held an approximate 23% stake in its German counterpart. The pair's interests align as Sartorius and Bio-Rad operate in similar and adjacent markets (mechanical separations for example).

As of 2021 the company's stake in Sartorius has increased to 37% yielding unrealized capital gains of $4.5 billion to Bio-Rad last year. For context that's 177% of Bio-Rad's total sales revenue.

So what does all this mean for Foolish investors?

Whilst Bio-Rad has much that's obvious to recommend it there is a hidden secret here: The gains on its Sartorius investment aren't reflected on the revenue or EBITDA ledgers on its income statement. Rather they're found further down under ""change in fair market value of equity securities"" in the ""pre-tax income"" section in between operating income and net income. This is because according to accounting rules the position is actually ""potential income"" Bio-Rad could receive in the future if it were to sell its Sartorius shares.

That means that as the market capitalization of Sartorius expands so too does the fair value of Bio-Rad's share price. For Foolish investors with a long-term mindset this ties in nicely to the investment case. We can see the correlation between both share prices on the chart below in which Sartorius has taken off in recent weeks -- another positive for Bio-Rad.

BIO data by YCharts

In addition the Sartorius position has a positive impact on shareholders' earnings per share (EPS) even though its value is not derived from revenue. That's because one half of the EPS calculation -- net income -- stems from pre-tax income where we just said the Sartorius capital gains tuck in. As a result net income and EPS are disproportionately higher for Bio-Rad when compared to operating income and revenue; whereas its Sartorius equity interest grew by 127% between FY 2019 and FY2020 Bio-Rad's top-line revenue growth has actually been quite flat over the past three years at a CAGR of 5.6%.

Consequently even analysts and investors who are bullish on Bio-Rad can tend to undervalue Sartorius's contributions. That's because bullish commentary tends to bake revenue and EBITDA growth into the mix and may neglect these kinds of items lower down.

But will this position continue to be a long-term compounder for Bio into the future? The answer is yes. The remaining 73% of Sartorius is family-owned and Bio-Rad intends to wholly acquire the company when the family trust expires in 2028. That means the potential for a lot more upside for investors over the long haul.

The valuation equation

Knowing all this let's reexamine Bio-Rad from a valuation perspective. The company's enterprise value (EV) is about 30 times its trailing-12-month (TTM) EBITDA which is an approximate 60% premium to its peer group. But the EV calculation contains the Sartorius holding as an equity holding whereas EBITDA does not. To make an apples-to-apples comparison we need to calibrate from the top down.

Factoring in its market capitalization equity value and debt then subtracting cash and equivalents found on its balance sheet we get a current EV for Bio-Rad of $22.7 billion. Stripping its 37% Sartorius stake out of the equation however gets us to an EV of $14.05 billion meaning that after we adjust our calculations Bio-Rad is trading at just 19 times TTM EBITDA. Far from being overvalued then Bio-Rad actually presents as a value proposition -- that valuation is well in line with peers including Thermo Fisher Scientific with a valuation of about 18 times TTM EBITDA and the industry median of 18.6.

Most investors -- and analysts -- miss this fact as well meaning Bio-Rad tends to fly under the radar. Which is terrific for those investors seeking hidden deep-value propositions with a competitive edge.

Due diligence pays off

Foolish investors know that true investment success comes from prudent due diligence and a long-term mindset. Bio-Rad is a prime example of how these elements can combine to skew the risk/reward calculus in the diligent investor's favor. Knowing what we do now about Sartorius's true value and the historical relationship between the stocks' performance and considering that Bio-Rad's management is calling for 10.5% growth in revenue next year and Sartorius predicts 44% it's easy to conclude that the rewards for Bio-Rad's shareholders are likely to continue.",,,,,,,,,

""I started watching some YouTube videos on incubating"" Ingram said. ""After a few weeks of watching those we went to Tractor Supply and we got incubators that I tried out and it kind of just went from there.""

After mastering chicken breeding with her first and favorite chicken Bethany Ingram learned how to raise quails roosters and peacocks. All of these birds live in her backyard barnyard along with all of her family's other animals - pigs rabbits goats and more. While her family all pitches in to help with the animals Ingram said she is the one in charge of the fowl.

Ingram wakes up every day about 5 a.m. to feed and take care of her chickens. Being involved at her school Hebron Christian School and active in sports she has learned to manage her time wisely.

""These animals rely on me"" Ingram said. ""If I don't feed them then that's on me. So I've learned a lot of responsibility and learned how to manage my time by taking care of them.""

During the February winter storm Ingram was outside for hours breaking up ice for the animals so they could get to their water bowls. She said she knows her responsibility is to care for the animals and does whatever she can to help them.

When Ingram established herself as a breeder she decided she wanted to sell the hundreds of birds she was producing. Along with selling at local animal auctions she created ""BB's Barnyard"" on Facebook which gains hundreds of viewers a week and where she has learned valuable marketing and entrepreneurial skills she said.

""It's just a hobby I like to do"" Ingram said. ""I just like being around the animals and now I can sell them to people all across the state.""

Ingram said people come to tour her barnyard regularly to purchase birds or to just visit with some animals. Ingram's mom Joni said her daughter has spent countless hours researching different ways to incubate the birds and how to mix various breeds together.

""She's the one that knows about the incubator"" Joni said. ""She knows when to turn it on when to put them in lock down. She keeps her records.""

After years of raising chickens Ingram said she recently took an interest in selling goats and plans to work with more of them in the near future. While she may be young she said she is excited for what the future holds as a breeder and hopes to work with animals when she grows up.

""I'm not quite sure what I want to do yet when I get older but I know I want to keep working with animals"" Ingram said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaWYteW91LWxpdmUtaW4tYS1zdWJ1cmItY2hhaW5zLWFyZS1tb3ZpbmctaW4tMjAyMS040gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pZi15b3UtbGl2ZS1pbi1hLXN1YnVyYi1jaGFpbnMtYXJlLW1vdmluZy1pbi0yMDIxLTg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If you live in a suburb these chains want to move in next door,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3dyYW5nbGVybmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXNodmlsbGUtaW5qdXJ5LXVwZGF0ZXMtd29ybGQtbm8tNC1iYXJib3NhLWV4cGVjdHMtdG8tYmUtcmVhZHktZm9yLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtbmFuY2UtZGlzbG9jYXRlcy1oaXAv0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3JhbmdsZXJuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hc2h2aWxsZS1pbmp1cnktdXBkYXRlcy13b3JsZC1uby00LWJhcmJvc2EtZXhwZWN0cy10by1iZS1yZWFkeS1mb3ItZm9ydC13b3J0aC1uYW5jZS1kaXNsb2NhdGVzLWhpcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nashville Injury Updates: World No. 4 Barbosa Expects to be Ready for Fort Worth; Nance Dislocates Hip,"By: Justin Felisko

NASHVILLE – A sense of urgency is necessary for the riders chasing Jose Vitor Leme in the world title race after the world No. 1 bull rider picked up his fifth event win Sunday at the PBR Ariat Music City Knockout presented by Cooper Tires.

Dener Barbosa the world No. 4 bull rider has dropped 898.67 points behind Leme in the race for the PBR’s gold buckle and $1 million doctoring out of the championship round after landing hard on his right shoulder in Round 2 following a 90-point ride on Young Man’s Blues.

Barbosa has been competing for the last month with a small fracture of his right scapula and he was clearly in pain throughout the competition this weekend inside Bridgestone Arena.

The 27-year-old told PBR.com after the event that he expects to be ready for next weekend’s PBR Tractor Supply Co. Iron Cowboy presented by Ariat PBR Major in Fort Worth Texas.

One rider can earn up to 345 points toward the world standings and that chunk could get any of the riders back into the world title conversation with Leme.

ADDITIONAL INJURY UPDATES

According to Dr. Tandy Freeman Cody Nance was transported to a local hospital after dislocating his hip when Safe Cracker bucked him off in 1.98 seconds on Sunday.

Meanwhile Rookie of the Year leader Chase Dougherty will get an MRI on his left elbow (riding hand) after spraining it Sunday when Hanna Motors Power Dozer bucked him off against a post in 2.06 seconds. Dougherty who also strained his left hip adductor muscles per Freeman did say following the event he expects to be ready for Fort Worth.

Dougherty holds a slim 25-point lead on No. 2 rookie Rafael Henrique dos Santos.

2018 Rookie of the Year Keyshawn Whitehorse missed Championship Sunday after aggravating injuries he sustained in Little Rock Arkansas last weekend when Punisher ran him over in the 15/15 Bucking Battle. Whitehorse explained the biggest reason he was unable to compete in Round 2 was because of a lower back injury.

2012 PRCA champion Cody Teel missed the 15/15 Bucking Battle and championship Sunday because of a sprained right MCL he sustained when his knee brace broke during his 6.79-second buckoff against Good Night Robicheaux in Round 1.

Lucas Divino is in a battle to qualify for the World Finals and he was able to move up one spot in the world standings despite separating his left lower ribs in Round 1. The now-No. 34 bull rider was pinned against the chutes before riding Big Man for 85 points. Divino competed with the injury Sunday but WSM’s Trail of Tears bucked him off in 3.01 seconds.

Divino earned 11 world points in Fort Worth with a 16th-place finish. He is 12 points ahead of No. 36 Caic Cassio Carvalho.

World No. 21 Cole Melancon doctored out of Nashville Friday morning because of an ongoing hip injury. Melancon will meet with Dr. Tandy Freeman this week in Dallas for treatment but the 27-year-old has every intention of competing at Iron Cowboy this coming weekend.

Melancon won the last Iron Cowboy title last season when he made his premier series debut in downtown Los Angeles at STAPLES Center.

Carol Miller and Alex Mooney have displaced Rep. David McKinley as the wealthiest members of West Virginia’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation according to their 2020 personal finance disclosures filed earlier this month.

All three are Republicans. Miller 3rd District is tops with an estimated net worth of $75.21 million. Mooney 2nd District is second at $14.7 million. McKinley 1st District is third at $10.4 million.

As we reported last week Sen. Joe Manchin’s estimated 2020 net worth was $8.6 million and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s was $2.53 million.

As we stated last week The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probable range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

Here’s a look at each member of Congress.

Carol Miller

Miller has an asset range of $15186062 to $340390006. Her liabilities range from $4365006 to $200800004.

Using the formula that puts her range of worth at -$185613942 to $336025000. From that her estimated net worth comes to $75205529.

Members of Congress are required to report their own and their spouse’s assets. The bulk of Miller’s assets come from her husband’s (Matt Miller) ownership of five Dutch Miller auto dealerships all valued at more than $1 million. In addition he has ownership interest through MFM Realty of the five dealership properties with four of those valued at more than $1 million and one valued at $100001-$250000.

Open Secrets notes the challenge of estimating spousal assets valued at more than $1 million because House reporting rules don’t require a maximum range. For those assets Open Secrets sets a cap of $50 million for its formula and we used the same figure.

Out of curiosity we also calculated an estimated net worth by setting that cap at $5 million. Even with that lower cap Miller still comes in at the wealthiest of West Virginia’s five with an estimated net worth of $30.2 million.

Miller and her husband also hold a variety of stock assets. They have pharmaceutical stock: Abbott AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb CVS Health Johnson & Johnson McKesson Merck Pfizer and Viatris.

Their tech holdings include Apple Microsoft Cisco and Oracle.

Examples of other holdings are: Altria (tobacco products) Coca-Cola Dominion Energy Energizer (batteries) Hormel Foods (Spam) McDonald’s Yum! (KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut) and Proctor & Gamble.

Stock portfolios are subject to frequent trades and updates logged on Periodic Transaction Reports; the companies cited here and for the others are on their annual filings.

Miller’s liabilities include two mortgages a farm loan two loans for the dealerships and a business floor plan loan.

As we reported last week Manchin ranked 67th most wealthy for both houses of Congress in 2018 (the last year for which Open Secrets evaluated and ranked all 535 members) and 19th in the Senate. Capito was 169th and 46th respectively.

Miller wasn’t in the U.S. House in 2018 but plugging her current estimated net worth into the 2018 list would put her at 11th overall and ninth in the House.

Alex Mooney

Virtually all of Mooney’s worth stems from one asset: his wife’s (Grace Mooney) TIAA retirement annuity valued at $5000001-$25000000.

Mooney himself holds nine Maryland Supplemental Retirement Plan 401K funds. All but one of those are valued at $1001-$15000. The ninth is valued at $1-$1000.

His combined asset range is $5009011-$25136000. He reports one liability a home mortgage valued at $250001-$500000.

Using the formula Mooney’s range of worth is $4509011-$24885999. That puts his estimated net worth at $14697505.

In 2018 his wife’s retirement annuity wasn’t factored in and his estimated net worth was just $137005 ranking him 287th in the House and 360th overall.

David McKinley

In 2018 McKinley’s estimated net worth was $6739056 placing him second after Manchin and above Capito Mooney and then-Rep. Evan Jenkins. Jenkins now state Supreme Court chief justice ranked fourth among the five with an estimated net worth of $920023.

For all of Congress in 2018 McKinley ranked 82nd overall for net worth and 59th in the House.

For 2020 McKinley reported assets of $5016118-$15796000. He reported no liabilities.

His estimated net worth came to $10406059.

He and his wife Mary hold a broad array of assets. Stock holdings include Abbott Laboratories Apple Costco Dollar Tree Home Depot Intuit MasterCard Microsoft Starbucks Sysco (food distributor) Tractor Supply and UnitedHealth.

Many of their assets are packaged into IRA accounts and a Black Rock-managed set of exchange-traded funds called iShares.

They own a rental property in Wheeling worth $1000001-$5000000 and co-own with other family members 90 acres of Preston County timber land valued at $15001-$50000.

Curry and her family had difficulty securing a rental car for a recent trip. Read more

Maureen Curry wanted to rent a seven-passenger minivan or SUV in July for a trip to her son’s Marine Corps initiation at Quantico Va.

She’s a rental-car veteran: The 55-year-old Downingtown woman and her husband Rick had rented vehicles more than a half-dozen times a year over the last eight years as their two older children traveled off to colleges and set up apartments saving wear and tear on their own vehicles.

But this time Curry said none of the big rental companies had any vehicles available for the trip. And she had been shopping two months in advance.

» READ MORE: Why are prices for groceries gas and used cars going up? Philly-area experts explain.

“I’ve never ever had to make a reservation for a vehicle more than two days in advance” Curry said “and never had difficulty getting a vehicle before this occurrence.”

It’s no secret that getting a rental car has become tricky in some locations and very expensive in many others.

According to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index average daily car rental rates have almost doubled from $89 a day over Independence Day 2020 to $166 during that same time period in 2021. But some destinations are getting hit much harder with daily prices reportedly ranging from $250 to $600 or more at some airports across the country.

Sue Spinney vice president for ground transport with the Expedia Group said in an email that a comparison of searches for rental cars showed interest more than doubled jumping 115% from June 2019 to June 2021.

The rental-car shortage gained a national audience July 8 after singer-actor Audra McDonald known recently for her role as Liz Reddick in the legal drama The Good Fight posted her frustration on Twitter when she discovered Hertz had no cars in Atlanta tweeting: “lt’s the hunger games out here.”

Jessica Caldwell analyst for the automotive industry go-to site Edmunds explained the tsunami of bad events that befell the rental-car industry.

First came the pandemic and the country went into lockdown. Because so much of rental-car business involves vacationers and business travelers once those industries dried up rental car companies faced a cash-flow cliff.

Executives had to sell off unused vehicles in some cases as part of bankruptcy restructuring.

This business decision seemed wise at the time. Hertz which also owns Thrifty and Dollar brands reported that between April and June last year utilization of its U.S. cars was a dismal 28% versus 82% during the same period in 2019. The 2020 plummet came despite its rental fleet shrinking by almost 50000 cars compared with its 554794 vehicles the prior year. So obviously some of these cars had to go.

And so they did — from 516726 vehicles at the end of 2019 in the U.S. to 298183 at the end of 2020 according to Hertz a 40% reduction in a year. The company achieved utilization rates of about 75% by both the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 according to Hertz.

But Caldwell continued the trouble didn’t stop there. In 2021 the spread of vaccinations had Americans eager to get back on the road and demand for rental cars increased. At the same time consumer demand to purchase vehicles also skyrocketed in part because people were wary of mass transit in the pandemic. Car sales after wobbling in spring 2020 went through the roof by the end of the year — and stayed there.

And finally came the computer chip shortage. Cars couldn’t be finished for lack of computer chips and with a shortage automakers are not interested in fleet business.

“In terms of automakers wanting to sell cars their first priority is retail consumers or people like you and me and secondly is their fleet customers” Caldwell said. “I think rental cars are kind of at the bottom of that list; those are generally the lowest margin in terms of their profit.”

Caldwell shared the experience of a colleague at Edmunds who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Hawaii.

Talia James-Armand Edmunds’ associate director of public relations and communications said finding a three-row SUV for five nights in the Aloha State became an impossibility. Her party settled for a Dodge Grand Caravan but it came at a cost.

Five days with the car cost $2100 James-Armand said or $400 a day compared with about $90 when she’d taken a trip to the Big Island in 2018.

“Finding lodging was no issue but finding a rental car was kind of a nightmare” James-Armand said.

A new wrinkle that may change the rental car market yet again is the coronavirus delta variant and the new masking and travel advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jana Tidwell AAA MidAtlantic manager of public and government affairs said AAA always emphasizes that travelers follow the CDC guidance if they decide to get out of town.

“It feels as though we are having a very different conversation about travel today than we were having just two or three weeks ago” Tidwell said.

She expects demand to drop after Labor Day after a summer season when travel demand was down just 2% overall from 2019 according to AAA’s figures. Business travel has not rebounded in the way leisure travel has Tidwell added.

Keli Laverty of West Chester wanted to explore Glacier National Park in Montana for a week and needed an eight-passenger vehicle for a week-long trip in late August.

“It was really impossible to find a car” said Laverty 43. She particularly worried that she’d reserve the large vehicle her family needed only to be stuck with a sedan.

She learned of the online car-sharing marketplace Turo which is like Airbnb but for cars. There car owners offer up their private vehicles to people looking to rent. Laverty was able to find a Ford Expedition in time for the trip even canceling a minivan also reserved through Turo that would have ended up being a real squeeze.

Various reports found some travelers renting U-Hauls or Home Depot pickups. And even this has had a trickle-down effect.

Curry of Downingtown tells how her daughter Anna Curry 24 recently moved from Wissahickon to Manayunk. She rented a U-Haul as she’d done several times before. But this time the younger Curry hit a snag.

“She paid more and she had to travel farther to get the vehicle” Curry said.

And like traveling itself venturing into the unknown for a rental car — such as on Turo — can have its upside.

Laverty and her husband Nate also 43 had an unusual adventure while on their trip. The group spent an afternoon at a waterfall where people could dive.

Nate and a friend watched another park patron jump into the 50-degree water but not surface. They waited and finally decided to jump in for a rescue. They managed to save the man but in the confusion Nate Laverty forgot the key in his pocket to the Expedition the group had rented on Turo. When they returned to the vehicle the soggy fob wouldn’t start the car.

The owners told the Lavertys that they would travel to the park pick up the car with a spare key and get it to them after the vacationing group hiked an hour and a half for cell service and over the phone explained that they needed the car the next day.

Keli Laverty said that the help from the car owners was an unexpected perk of renting through Turo. “I think the personal communication and the kindness of strangers to help us out essentially make a bad experience better” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2ZseWluZy1wcml2YXRlLXBvaW50cy1taWxlcy0xMjM0NjEzMDI2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Maximize Your Points and Miles When Flying Private,"We may receive payment from affiliate links included within this content.

From setting your own schedule to avoiding crowded airports there’s a lot to like about flying private. If you’re looking for ways to get the most out of your private jet flight bookings we’ve got you covered.

Here’s how to use credit card points to cut the cost of private jets how to earn points and miles from flying private and how to score the most points and miles from your flight.

While there are a lot of perks to flying private scoring free flights using points and miles isn’t one of them. Private jet service providers seemingly have enough demand that none have gone to the trouble to launch and operate a loyalty program.

At least so far. Wheels Up—one of the largest private jet providers—has teased that it’s working on a loyalty program that it expects to launch in summer 2021.

Until then there’s one primary way to use points and miles for private jets: redeeming points for cash back you can then apply toward your travels. Several credit cards let travelers redeem points earned through spending to cover purchases—either as a statement credit or to “erase” eligible purchases.

That said you still have a number of options to maximize your private jet experience using your credit card perks.

American Express is the clear leader in the points-for-private-jets race. For example you can jet around Africa on an ultra-luxury private jet safari with Micato Safari. Or you can book all-inclusive around-the-world trips on private jets through TCS World Travel.

Eligible American Express cardholders can book through the Gold Card Destinations or Platinum Destinations programs for additional travel perks. By doing so you could earn bonus Membership Rewards and get a $100 shipboard credit or instant savings for bookings costing $3000 or more. Plus you can redeem American Express Membership Rewards to offset the trip.

Although there are limited options to redeem miles for private jet flights there are a number of ways to earn points and miles from flying private.

As mentioned above Wheels Up is the wild card here. The company has a partnership with Delta Airlines and is expected to allow reciprocal benefits including the ability to redeem Delta Skymiles for Wheels Up flights in mid-2021. This news is particularly interesting because Delta is an American Express Membership Rewards program partner meaning that you could potentially use Membership Rewards points for Wheels Up flights soon.

Delta used to offer travelers its own fleet of private jets through a service called Delta Private Jets. For years SkyMiles members could redeem 2.5 million SkyMiles for $25000 in credits toward booking travel on Delta’s fleet of private jets.

That came to an end in January 2020 when Delta Private Jets merged into Wheels Up. This merger ended the ability to redeem SkyMiles for private jet flights—at least for now. But you can still score Delta benefits for purchasing Wheels Up flights.

You can earn up to 50000 SkyMiles for joining Wheels Up and up to 25000 SkyMiles each year you renew. The number of miles you get depends on the level of membership tier you choose.

JSX (formerly known as JetSuiteX) is a public charter airline that offers many of the benefits of flying private. You’ll avoid the crowded airport terminals and depart out of a private terminal. Onboard you’ll get business class legroom free snacks and drinks and two checked bags.

Unlike arranging for your own private charter flights JSX flights operate on a set schedule and you may have to share the ride with other passengers. With that said there’s one massive advantage to JSX: the cost. Depending on the route and how far out you book flights can cost as little as $99 each way. That makes a luxury experience competitive with prices on low-cost airlines.

JSX doesn’t have its own loyalty program. Instead it partners with JetBlue to offer TrueBlue points to frequent flyers. The earning chart is simple. You’ll earn 150 TrueBlue points from cheaper “Hop On” fares and 250 TrueBlue points for “All In” fares. But unfortunately you can’t redeem TrueBlue points for JSX flights.

Carrying the right credit card is important no matter how you travel. However it’s especially important if you plan to fly private. By carrying the right credit card you can score discounts and perks on private jet bookings. Plus you can rack up plenty of points and miles from spending.

One of the perks American Express offers to some premium cardholders is access to their Premium Private Jet Program. This program offers a 3 percent promotional discount on flight charges in-flight catering credits and car service transfer credits on Delta Private Jets charter flights booked through Platinum Travel Services.

If you opt to purchase a Jet Card you can pay a reduced entry purchase of $50000—instead of the standard $150000—and you’ll get a 3 percent bonus added to your Jet Card.

In addition to booking private jets you can use this Jet Card to book select fares on Delta commercial flights with a 20 percent discount. Plus you’ll get Delta SkyMiles Diamond Medallion elite status for all Jet Card purchases of $100000 as long as your Jet Card remains active and carries a balance.

Although Delta Private Jets merged into Wheels Up in January 2020 this discount is still available to eligible cardholders that book through Amex’s Platinum Travel Services.

The record income of NIS22 billion recorded from incoming tourism alone in 2019 has been almost entirely decimated with no solution for a recovery in sight.

A short and successful trial in July that let tourists into Israel in groups (a total of 50000 tourists in educational heritage and pilgrimage groups) was cut short recently after the government imposed a complete shut-down on tourist travel to Israel.

There was no real reason for this as the group tourism experiment was a great success. Incoming tourists had to take two PCR tests and an antigen test resulting in only healthy tourists being let in. This proves that the health protocol protects the Israeli population and could enable the tourist industry to commence its recovery.

Ben-Gurion Airport is often described as the ""weak spot"" where the COVID-19 virus and its variants found a way into the country enhancing the contagion factor. This is probably true but the virus is let into Israel by Israelis (500000 in July 2021) and not by foreign tourists who were subject to proper health and safety protocols.

The right way to deal with this weak spot is to improve the process vis-à-vis Israelis and allow tourists into the country using the health protocol that was implemented in July.

Israel is a travel destination that competes against many other destinations that these days are more permissive and let tourists in usually just with a negative PCR test.

If the government is not going to let tourists in soon it will take years and massive investment for the industry to return to its 2019 record of 4.5 million tourists that generated huge revenues for the Israeli economy.

Europeans seeking sustainable travel

I hope tourists will enter Israel soon but it is clear that the travel industry has been completely changed by the Covid-19 virus which has created new travel preferences. The Israeli travel industry will have to make adjustments in order to be attractive and to compete against the leading destinations.

A European study that collected data between August 2020 and February 2021 shows the new preferences of the European traveler. The study focused its findings on sustainable travel seasonal and destination preferences and travel frequency.

Here are the key findings:

1. Reducing travel’s carbon footprint: The pandemic at times brought the world to almost a complete halt giving nature a chance to gain a renewed foothold. Less pollution less traffic should be our responsibility and commitment to the planet and nature. Travel contributes to Co2 emissions mainly due to transportation followed by accommodations.

According to the survey - 37% of European travelers will pay more in order to minimize their carbon footprint. This is a considerable number. It is a good time for the Israel hospitality industry to take measures and look into getting the hotels accredited with GSTC Green Globe Global Key and other organizations that help measure Co2 emissions and improve standards.

Israel can offer travelers a nice choice of campgrounds ( click here for options provided by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority). Another good option is eco-lodging at Carmey Avdat and Kibbutz Lotan . Another great way to travel in Israel and leave a small carbon footprint is to use the Israel Railways network which is cheap and efficient.

2. Supporting local communities: Travel has undergone a huge change in recent years. A big move from sight-seeing to meaningful encounters with communities. Travelers want an authentic meeting with people hearing about their experience first hand. Not only that travelers look to contribute to communities. It is interesting to see that in the European study that 44% of travelers are looking to pay more in order to help communities.

Israel has a lot to offer to travelers in this respect: An example of meaningful personal experiences is Leket which helps support people in need with food and where you can volunteer picking produce from agricultural fields or help out in the logistical center. Another example is aiding refugee children with Elifelet .

3. Low season and longer trips: More than half of those surveyed said they would travel in the off season and for longer periods. This is a huge change in comparison to the trend before the pandemic when Europeans traveled more times for shorter trips. Tour operators should create a new messaging to answer the new travel demand.

This should include that Israel is safe (health-wise) and a place where you can learn about the past (the religious and historical heritage of the Holy Land) meet the people and communities of the present and also contribute to the future through meaningful encounters with people and communities leaving a positive footprint through travel."

“We find ourselves in a dynamic where the consumer demand backdrop is strong while supply chain remains challenging” Scott Roe the chief financial officer of Tapestry Inc. told analysts on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. The retailer which also owns Stuart Weitzman is working on “securing significant expedited deliveries at an additional cost in order to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions at least through the holiday period.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has scrambled the global supply of materials and products fueling inflation and making it hard for retailers and other companies to swiftly meet demand. While renewed outbreaks due to the more contagious delta variant have shaken consumer confidence shoppers still remain eager to spend what they’ve saved during lockdowns and months of restrictions.

Roe told analysts and investors to expect somewhat higher levels of inventory starting in the first quarter intended “to keep the momentum of the business.” The higher cost of shipping those products by air will push up costs but Tapestry’s broader strategy of raising prices while limiting discounts will help to offset the increase he said.

Too much stockpiling can be a warning sign to investors that a company isn’t selling its products. Roe said he wasn’t concerned about the expected increase in inventory. “If we could get more we probably would.”

Todd Kahn Coach’s chief executive officer said he’s not worried about how long it will take to sell through the inventory since the brand’s handbags have timeless styles.

“What is typical in this industry is a very narrow window to sell” he said in an interview. That “is not necessarily the case for us.” Around 40% of Coach handbags are made in Vietnam Kahn said.

Amazon Stores

The retail industry got a jolt early Thursday after a report that Amazon.com Inc. is planning to open several locations that would compete with department stores. Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the possible move “is not surprising” because companies are increasingly seeking to sell seamlessly online and in-person.

Tapestry’s brands have been focused in recent years on decreasing their presence at department stores known as wholesale Crevoiserat said. That reticence could be a sign that higher-end labels may opt to distance themselves from Amazon’s new project which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

“We have a direct-to-consumer model that we value very much” she said in an interview. “That gives us access to a lot of data and an understanding of the consumer that really makes us better as a brand.”

Tapestry shares fell 2.9% at 12:30 p.m. in New York. The stock gained 33% this year through Wednesday outpacing the S&P 500 as demand for handbags and other high-end goods rebounded from last year.

Sales Beat

Tapestry on Thursday posted fourth-quarter net sales of $1.62 billion for the period ended July 3. That narrowly outpaced the $1.55 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share jumped to 74 cents the company said also above analysts’ projections.

The results show how the economic recovery in the U.S. is helping to bolster sales at Tapestry’s three fashion brands. The company reported about 165% year-over-year revenue growth in North America a region where it generates more than half of its sales. Revenue also jumped 60% in mainland China another large market for high-end brands.

Tapestry reinstated its dividend and buyback program promising to return more than $750 million to shareholders in the fiscal 2022 year. The company declared a dividend of 25 cents a share payable on Sept. 27 and said it intends to increase its payout at a faster rate than earnings growth.

Tapestry said it expects revenue of approximately $6.4 billion in fiscal 2022 excluding some anticipated charges. That would mark a record level of sales for Tapestry the company said on a 52-week basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvdXMtYXR0aXR1ZGVzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXdpdGhkcmF3YWwvMjAyMS8wOC8yMS82MmU2YWE3NC0wMTAzLTExZWMtYmE3ZS0yY2Y5NjZlODhlOTNfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's not our fight' vs. 'We owe them': Americans debate what's right in Afghanistan,Larry and Phil Peters don’t agree on much.

One secret to its success is a little more spiritual than you might have guessed according to CEO Pat Gelsinger.

In a recorded message that will play during an international conference on business and religion this week Gelsinger highlights the competitive advantage that comes from building a culture that celebrates personal faith alongside other employee traits. At Intel workers are free to “bring their entire self” to the office he says.

“When we take into account everyone’s nuanced differences we put our organizations in a position to capture truly sustainable business advantages” Gelsinger says.

Intel put itself in that position in part by enabling employees to form resource groups based on religion says Sandra Rivera the organization’s former chief people officer and current executive vice president in the same video. Currently Intel has seven such groups including one for atheists and agnostics she says.

The company champions “how important faith and belief is to our employees” Rivera says.

In so doing Intel improves the lives of more than just its workers argues Brian Grim the founder and president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation which organized the conference. He says leaders like Rivera and Gelsinger are paving the way toward a more peaceful world.

“Businesses that embrace religious freedom can change entire cultures” in addition to influencing faith-related laws he says.

Related The power of religious diversity in the workplace

The goal of Grim’s foundation is to push more companies to acknowledge and even celebrate their employees’ religious identities. One way they work toward achieving that is by handing out awards to business leaders who are modeling the right approach toward faith.

“Businesses can make a huge impact on people’s lives” Grim says.

This year Gelsinger and Rivera from Intel will receive one of three gold medals handed out during the Global Business & Interfaith Peace Awards which the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation puts on in cooperation with the Business for Peace Initiative of the United Nations Global Compact.

Other gold medalists include Dr. Judith Richter who runs Medinol an Israeli heart stent company and founded NIR School of the Heart to help high school students pursue careers in medicine and heal interreligious divides and King Husein the chairman and CEO of Span Construction & Engineering who helped lead a roundtable for business leaders on international religious freedom during the 2019 United Nations general assembly in New York City.

The awards are valuable because they help people understand that there are many different ways for business leaders to create a faith-friendly environment and champion religious freedom Grim says. No two honorees approach religious diversity in the same way.

At Intel Gelsinger Rivera and other company leaders lean most heavily on the employee resource groups that Rivera mentions in the video. Through these groups workers form connections that help them navigate challenges both inside and outside the workplace Grim says noting that he’s heard of a Christian Intel employee connecting with the Muslim resource group in order to prepare for a job-related move to a Muslim-dominated country.

At Tyson Foods on the other hand Chairman John Tyson who is one of this year’s silver medalists honors his employees’ religious identities by having full-time chaplains on staff Grim says.

The chaplains “fill a need that sometimes can’t be met outside of the office especially during COVID-19 shutdowns” he says.

Regardless of what form they come in faith-related resources for employees can help businesses recruit and retain great workers Grim says.

“It’s good for business. That’s ultimately why companies embrace this” he argues.

It’s also good for society says Husein who is being recognized for his advocacy work. He believes religious freedom activism that originates in the workplace has a more powerful impact than government-led efforts.

“I think if businesses can understand that (religious freedom is good for business) and embrace it and promote it within their own countries we then do not need the government to get involved” Husein says.

The Global Business & Interfaith Peace Awards event will take place virtually on Tuesday Aug. 24 at noon Eastern. Attendees will have an opportunity to interact with the winners.

Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and PNC have all decided to opt out according to emails shared with The Intercept.

They are major players in the program which Congress created to offer businesses loans to spend on payroll and other qualified expenses to help weather the shutdowns. As of the end of May JPMorgan Chase was the top PPP lender followed by Bank of America in the No. 2 spot; PNC is No. 11. All told lenders representing just half of all outstanding PPP loan forgiveness applications have opted in according to the SBA.

PNC recently sent an email to Jesse Grund owner of personal training studio Unconventional Strength in Orlando Florida saying “Considering we have already built a streamlined end-to-end digital portal and associated review process for your PPP forgiveness application; we will be opting out of using the SBA’s forgiveness portal.”

Grund still hasn’t had his $5000 PPP loan forgiven and was instead told by PNC that his “Correct Maximum Loan Amount” was just $917 leaving him on the hook for the rest. “It’s PNC’s fault I got this money” he said. “Now you guys want to come back at me for it.”

Early in the pandemic small business owners were urged to flock to the Paycheck Protection Program. The loans were made with the promise that they would be forgiven and essentially turned into grants if used properly.

But many small business owners have struggled to get their loans forgiven by the banks that issued them. Banks were incentivized to issue PPP loans through the fees they generated but they don’t receive any fees to push forgiveness through and they’ve dragged their feet. Of the total PPP loans that have been issued less than half have been forgiven thus far.

In response the Small Business Administration the government agency tasked with running the program announced in late July that it would offer small business owners who took out PPP loans of $150000 or less a way to bypass intransigent banks and seek forgiveness directly from the agency. Congress had at one point late last year considered automatically forgiving all loans under $150000 but it never followed through.

But there was fine print in the SBA’s recent announcement that many may have missed: Banks actually have to opt into the direct process for small business owners to access it. And at least three major ones have refused.

“Forcing lenders to opt-in to the process could have been disruptive” said SBA spokesperson Terrence D. Clark in an email. He noted that lenders continue to opt in and that the agency is conducting outreach to encourage them to participate. “[W]e speak to lenders daily” he said. In a statement SBA Associate Administrator for the Office of Capital Access Patrick Kelley said “We encourage all lenders to opt-in to this tested portal.”

When asked for an explanation as to why the bank decided to bar its customers from the SBA’s direct forgiveness option a PNC spokesperson pointed to a statement that said “[L]enders that participate in the SBA’s forgiveness portal are still responsible for reviewing and issuing forgiveness decisions to the SBA. We would therefore still need to ensure borrowers meet loan eligibility and loan forgiveness requirements regardless of whether we chose to use the SBA forgiveness portal or not.”

Chase offered no explanation in its correspondence to its customers. In an email sent to a small business owner it said simply “[W]e’re continuing with our simple process and not participating in the new SBA direct program.” In response to a request for comment a Chase spokesperson said over email “Chase customers should submit their forgiveness applications through our platform” adding “We have a simple process that takes under 10 minutes to complete.”

For some business owners being cut off from the SBA’s direct program could mean they can’t get some or all of their loans forgiven at all. Some banks have been contacting small business owners in recent months and telling them that they shouldn’t have received the original amount they received — which the banks themselves approved — and requiring the owners to pay back the difference. But many told The Intercept that they used the money correctly and had fully expected to have their entire loans forgiven.

That’s what happened to Warren Davis owner of fundraising consultancy Warren Davis Consulting LLC who received his loan from Chase and was recently told the bank won’t let him seek forgiveness directly from the SBA. After the bank originally issued him a $6812 PPP loan he was later told he was only eligible for $1795.53 in forgiveness. Now he must pay Chase $460.01 on the first of every month with two years to pay the remainder of the loan off. “That loan payment is the second highest payment I now have besides my rent which is also due on the 1st” he said in an email. “I have tried trying to get answers numerous times from Chase with no luck over the months.”

In response to situations like Davis’s the Chase spokesperson said “Small businesses must meet the standards to qualify for forgiveness whether they go through their lender or directly through the SBA.”

When asked why Bank of America has opted out spokesperson Bill Halldin said “Because our portal is simplified and has been out there for six months” adding that if the bank opted in “we would have to develop a new interface.” The bank is reviewing whether to join the SBA’s process but “at this point our simplified portal is delivering what people want” he said.

But that portal is not delivering what Amy Yassinger needs. Yassinger owner of a music company that offers party bands for weddings in Illinois was encouraged by Bank of America to apply for a PPP loan early in the pandemic. The bank helped her with the process assuring her its underwriting team “would make sure everything was solid” she said in an email. She used the $38730 to pay employees as if they were working their regular slate of events despite widespread cancellations as well as to cover some nonpayroll expenses.

Yet 11 months after she got her loan the bank told her it would only submit $2436 to the SBA for forgiveness. “It was one thing to have my life completely gutted for over a year as my company was forced to cancel or postpone over 60 events in 2020” she said. “It is another to have Bank of America want $36000 out of $38730 back in the next 5 years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dpbGwtdGhlLW5ldy1jcm9wLW9mLWNyZWRpdC1idWlsZGVycy13b3JrLWFzLXByb21pc2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will new credit building products work as promised?,"A slew of fintechs are promising consumers that they can raise their credit scores without the need for a credit check or extensive credit history.

Varo’s credit-building program Believe will launch in the coming weeks. Chime debuted a no-interest secured credit card in June of 2020. Other companies like Extra and Grain offer revolving lines of credit that are linked to regular debit cards. MoneyLion extends a loan meant to bolster its users’ credit history. Esusu a service that reports rental payments to the credit bureaus has backing from the tennis champion Serena Williams; the NBA star Stephen Curry has invested in a startup called Kikoff .

There are other products with a niche. Step  a challenger bank touts credit-building benefits for its teen customers. Sequin a debit card that fronts money for purchases and repays itself from a linked bank account is targeted at women who founder Vrinda Gupta formerly of Visa concluded were disproportionately being rejected by credit cards or getting lower limits and higher interest rates.

Some banks have recently launched products along these lines. Others offer secured credit cards that may require a sizable upfront deposit.

All these efforts are designed to serve a wide range of customers who could benefit from boosting their credit scores from young consumers and immigrants establishing a credit history for the first time to military veterans who spent years abroad and retirees whose records may have stagnated to those recovering from past mistakes or misfortunes. And most have shortcomings or drawbacks for borrowers or for lenders which partially explains why they’re not more widely available.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s most recent report on this topic from 2015 found that 11% of the adult population in the U.S. was “credit invisible” or without records from the national credit reporting agencies and another 8.3% were “unscorable” because of insufficient or stale history.

Anecdotal evidence suggests this hasn’t changed dramatically in the past six years. “We survey our customers all the time"" and credit score help ""was one of the top two to three things they were asking for” said Aaron Plante vice president of lending products and banking strategy at Chime.

There is also room for improvement in these initiatives. Alex Johnson director of fintech research at Cornerstone Advisors says some of these products are loaded with fees and interest charges. Others such as credit-building cards or services that report rent and utility payments to the credit bureaus may not be as effective as the marketing hype leads customers to believe.

“Just because this stuff exists and could end up on a credit report doesn’t mean that a mainstream legacy lender sees the same empirical value in this information” said John Ulzheimer a credit expert witness and formerly of FICO and Equifax. “You can’t load up a credit report with gym memberships and Hulu and expect to have a FICO score of 800.”



Pros cons of credit-building tools

Credit-builder cards such as the one offered by Chime have their users set aside a sum of money each month that will be drawn upon to make payments often automatically. Unlike with traditional secured credit cards customers don’t need to hand over a large deposit initially and typically won’t need to pay interest or fees.

“The odds that they will spend more money than they have or miss a payment are extremely low” Johnson said.

Chime customers can move any amount they choose from their spending accounts to their Credit Builder secured accounts and charge up to this amount on their Credit Builder card. At the end of the month Chime automatically pays off the balance from the secured account if the customer enables automation and it reports the successful payment to all major credit bureaus. Credit Builder does not charge an annual fee or interest.

Millions of Chime customers are using this product Plante said.

The downside to such cards is that the repayment data is not as indicative to the credit bureaus of a customer’s “willingness to repay” because the regular risks and decision-making of repaying loans are taken out of the equation Johnson said.

That may not be a problem right now as these products are still new. “But as credit-builder products become more popular it wouldn’t surprise me if the bureaus and FICO which are constantly tuning models and approaches look at them and try to better understand how the data correlates to someone’s creditworthiness” Johnson said.

For Plante the upsides to the product are still key.

“The consistent thing we hear from the credit bureaus is this is bringing more people into the credit world” Plante said. “The credit invisibles now have a trade line.”

Another fintech trying to bring more people into the credit world is GO2bank  the digital bank belonging to Green Dot that serves low- to moderate-income customers.

Its secured credit card does not charge an annual fee and keeps the minimum deposit to $100 rather than the more typical minimum of $200. It also recently partnered with Experian to offer its customers glimpses of their FICO score credit monitoring the ability to lock and unlock their Experian credit files and access to Experian Boost which lets them improve their scores by paying bills like video-streaming services phones and utilities on time.

These additions are expected to launch later this year.

Most of these features can be assembled for free through other sources. For example consumers can sign up for Experian Boost directly. GO2bank and Chime are the only two neobanks to partner with Experian Boost so far.

Abhi Chaudhary head of direct to consumer at Green Dot said GO2bank sets itself apart by consolidating this suite of tools in one place.

“Our goal was to create a financial ecosystem for customers in one mobile app” Chaudhary said.

One potential issue with rent and utility reporting services is that lenders may not rely on scores that incorporate it. FICO 8 for example takes utility data into consideration but not rental data. FICO 9 incorporates both but is not yet widely used by lenders.

“The older credit-scoring systems specifically used in mortgage lending don’t see those cool things [like rent and utility payments] that consumers can add to their credit reports” Ulzheimer said.

Chaudhary still sees plenty of benefit in fostering responsible behaviors among his customers.

“Our intent is to ensure our customer’s credit profile is getting better and once it is getting better this is over time reflected in other models” Chaudhary said.

Other products such as credit-builder loans levy fees and interest. In exchange they say they help customers improve their credit scores while amassing a chunk of savings.

“I’m not a big fan of the credit-builder installment loans” Johnson said. “I don’t think it’s worth locking up that much money and paying interest.”

Johnson pointed out that banks have followed in the footsteps of fintechs by rethinking overdraft fees and granting customers early access to their paychecks .

“We will see a resurgence of credit-builder products and secured credit cards coming from banks in much the same way” he said.

Austin Capital Bank in Texas launched Credit Strong in 2019. It's a credit-building product that includes an installment loan and a federally insured savings account. With Credit Strong the $341 million-asset bank funds a loan and the proceeds are placed in the savings account. Users make fixed monthly payments that cover principal which is credited toward the loan and interest which compensates the bank for the product. There are no prepayment or early withdrawal penalties.

These payments are reported to all three credit bureaus and once the loan is repaid the savings are released.

“What they spend in credit building they will save in thousands of dollars of interest expenses over their financial life” said Erik Beguin the CEO and founder of Austin Capital Bank.

Credit Strong will report both positive and negative data which Beguin says is important. Anywhere between 3% and 7% of Credit Strong customers pay late.

Credit-building products ""that only generate positive payment history could eventually erode the reliability of the credit bureau data and underwriting models based on that data” he said.

Where banks might have edge over fintechs

Beguin said that there were two roads he could have taken: a secured credit card or an installment loan. He chose the latter because he wanted a product with no upfront deposit.

He also says that one of the major advantages his bank has over fintech credit-building products is robust know-your-customer checks.

“Weak KYC programs that are not subject to Bank Secrecy Act [rules] and federal examination could aid bad actors to manufacture synthetic identities at scale” he said.

Johnson predicts that more banks will start offering some of their own credit-building products to compete with the neobanks. This could be as simple as refreshing their secured credit cards.

“More than anything the biggest problem with secured cards is consumers can tell when the companies they are working with don’t want to work with them” Johnson said. “Secured cards always had that vibe like ‘Here are all our great cards we want you to have and oh yeah here is our secured card.’ ”

In contrast Chime positions its credit-builder card prominently on its website.

“It’s a subtle distinction but it matters” Johnson said.

The better approach for banks might be rethinking how they underwrite customers and incorporate alternative data. That would mean more customers get approved for regular products.

There are a few examples on the market. Petal has started selling its cash-flow-based underwriting technology to banks and fintechs in addition to offering its own credit card directly to consumers. TomoCredit launched a credit card in March that assesses creditworthiness exclusively on cash-flow data. Nova Credit helps usher immigrants into the American credit system by making sense of foreign credit bureau information for U.S. banks’ underwriting systems. American Express partnered with Nova Credit in 2019.

In May The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the largest U.S. banks will start sharing data on customers’ deposit accounts to expand access to credit. This pilot program grew out of Project REACh (Roundtable for Economic Access and Change) an initiative by the Officer for the Comptroller of Currency to promote financial inclusion. JPMorgan Chase is one bank involved with Project REACh. Mark Brucker chief risk officer at JPMorgan said the goal is to broaden access to credit responsibly.

“Depending on what we learn through this effort underwriting models may evolve in the future to account for new alternative data sources” Brucker said by email. “While we’re beginning with deposit account information as we gain experience we’ll consider expanding the techniques to evaluate other areas such as rent utilities and other payment information.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9wcHAtd29yay1oZWxwZWQtbWlubmVzb3Rhcy1jb21tdW5pdHktYmFua3MtZ2Fpbi1ncm91bmQtb24tYmlnZ2VyLW9uZXMvNjAwMDkwMDg4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PPP work helped Minnesota's community banks gain ground on bigger ones,"Steve Simenson veteran owner of Goodrich Pharmacy in Anoka County was worried in spring 2020.

Two of his four pharmacies were shuttered because they were in medical clinics shut down by COVID-19. Revenue dropped by 25% across the entire business and Simenson was faced with the prospect laying off half of his employees.

Simenson contacted his banker about securing a forgivable loan from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. He was a long-time customer of one of the Twin Cities' ""big banks"" but it wouldn't help him. He declined to say which bank it was.

An employee referred him to Village Bank which has most of its locations in Anoka County. There banker Chris Schroepfer helped gather the requisite information from Simenson submitted the application and got the first of two $200000 loans funded within two weeks.

""Village Bank made it happen"" Simenson said. ""We also moved a loan to them from the other bank and they refinanced it at a significantly competitive rate.''

Goodrich employees doubled down on telehealth consultations and also got 16000 Anoka County residents vaccinated at no charge from nursing homes to homeless shelters.

Village Bank turned a government business-relief program into a growth strategy. And it's not the only community bank that disproportionately used PPP to take business from the likes of U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

Village Bremer Bank and Sunrise Banks as well as nonprofit community-based financial institutions such as Meda were aggressive in working overtime to assist customers and non-customers to get PPP funds of $50000. And the SBA last year and earlier this year gave preference for periods of time to small borrowers disproportionately female and minorities to get their loans processed.

""The SBA did a wonderful job and we invested and implemented quickly to do the best we could for those Main Street customers"" Aleesha Webb president of Village Bank said. ""We've now had time to work with them and the relationships are resulting in growth in assets. And revenue and income.""

The SBA paid a loan-origination fee to bankers that ranged from 5% for loans under $350000 to 1% for loans over $2 million. The bankers also got six-figure fees for loan processing.

Webb said Village Bank didn't make much money on the 827 PPP loans it originated because it invested in related software and paid workers for nights and weekends plus bonuses.

About 50% of the PPP loans that Village Bank made were to non-customers. And the financial benefits are starting to show according to bank and regulatory filings.

Village Bank started in 1993 by Chairman Don Kveton Webb's father earned $3.2 million in 2019 on assets of $302 million in 2019. Earnings were only $3.3 million on a 33% bigger asset base of $403 million last year. In the first six months of this year Village Bank already has earned $3.2 million on assets that ballooned to $428 million.

Village Bank has grown over two years from one of the 10 largest to one of the five-largest SBA lenders in Minnesota.

Meanwhile Bremer Bank the state's largest PPP lender with 7240 loans worth $1.27 billion has seen its results improve in 2021.

In the first six months of 2021 Bremer earned a strong 14.5% return on equity and net income was $102.3 million compared with $77.1 million in the first half of 2020.

CEO Jeanne Crain cited improved credit quality which allowed the bank to release some reserves taken last year into earnings and also the PPP.

Sunrise Banks the second-largest PPP lender in Minnesota according to iBanknet declined to discuss the impact of PPP on its results.

Regulators allowed community bankers to take on more loans through PPP than supported by their equity capital last year because it was an emergency and the government backed the loans.

The huge national banks have denied that they favored larger customers with PPP loans. Wells Fargo pledged the $420 million it made in fees on PPP loans to nonprofit Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that assist capital-thin minority entrepreneurs.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said in June that community banks and CDFIs were critical for getting PPP funds to small businesses.

""While I have heard from community groups that small businesses struggled to navigate the PPP application process especially those that did not have a preexisting banking relationship community banks and (CDFIs) made a concerted effort to meet small-business needs"" Bowman said according to the American Bar Association Journal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi10YWxpYmFuLWZhY2UtZmluYW5jaWFsLXNxdWVlemUtZnJvbS13ZXN0L2EtNTg5MDQxODLSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tdGFsaWJhbi1mYWNlLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zcXVlZXplLWZyb20td2VzdC9hLTU4OTA0MTgy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The West forces cash crunch on Taliban,"With military retaliation against the Taliban ruled out the West is turning to financial reprisals. The US has frozen Afghanistan's central bank assets and global development aid is halted.

The speed of the Taliban's capture of Afghanistan last weekend has left the West scrambling to curtail the Islamist militants' grip on the country. Military action has been all but ruled out and instead the United States and its NATO allies have turned to financial warfare.

US President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve have frozen billions of dollars in Afghan currency reserves held in the US. Nearly $9 billion (€7.7 billion) in assets are kept in the US and other countries including $1.2 billion in gold and more than $300 million in international currencies.

In anticipation of the fall of Kabul Biden last week halted shipments of US dollars to Afghanistan — a move the country's former central bank chief Ajmal Ahmady said would lead to ""dire"" prospects for the people.

US financial newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington is also blocking Taliban access to government accounts managed by the Federal Reserve and other US banks.

Cash 'close to zero'

Ahmady wrote on Twitter that the country was “reliant on obtaining physical shipments of cash every few weeks” due to a large currency account deficit. ""The amount of such cash remaining is close to zero"" he warned.

Several countries including Germany have halted development aid. Afghanistan relies heavily on foreign assistance to keep its fragile economy running. Last year the country received nearly $8 billion in aid.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suspended around $340 million foreign exchange reserve assets that the Taliban could turn into hard currency citing a ""lack of clarity within the international community regarding recognition of a new government.""

Any Afghan bank reserves the militants can acquire will be insufficient to run the country raising the prospect that one of the world's poorest nations is set to fare much worse.

Hans-Jakob Schindler a former coordinator for a United Nations team that monitored the Taliban and other extremist groups told DW that the reserves are not enough to ""run the country in a sustainable manner.""

""There’s not much cash if you think on a national scale"" he said.

Drug trade funded militants

Having long faced international sanctions as a terrorist organization the Taliban's insurgency was fueled by the huge Afghan poppy trade drug trafficking and extortion.

Afghanistan is the largest exporter of opium in the world and the latest UN report put annual funding from the source for the Taliban anywhere from $300 million to $1.6 billion.

The country's new rulers have vowed to put an end to the narcotics trade a promise that has been viewed with much skepticism especially in light of the financial reprisals from the West.

""I very much doubt that they want to eradicate drug production in Afghanistan and their ability to do so"" Schindler said adding: ""The commanders on the ground basically have no other income.""

A confidential NATO report revealed that the militant group also raises money from illegal mining property and customs revenue from seized checkpoints. Several unnamed benefactors from Iran Pakistan the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and Qatar also make regular donations.

But the Taliban will clearly require international legitimacy to rule effectively. The freeze on assets and development aid could help pressure them to agree on a power-sharing government acceptable to the West.

Any bank reserves seized by the militants during their recent offensive are unlikely to amount to much Schindler warned making new sources of revenue critical.

""We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are perhaps 0.1-0.2% of Afghanistan’s total international reserves. Not much"" Ahmady who left the country on Sunday wrote on Twitter.

Afghanistan is estimated to have between $1 trillion and $3 trillion worth of minerals including copper and lithium needed to power the global energy transition. Much of it remains untapped due to endemic corruption and woeful infrastructure.

Some analysts are skeptical about the Taliban's willingness or competence to exploit those natural resources despite several recent mining deals with China under the previous government.

""The Taliban do not intend to rebuild the Afghan economy and will likely put an end to foreign business deals in the country"" Tilman Brück Founder and Director of the International Security & Development Center (ISDC) in Berlin told DW. ""By their nature and ideology the Taliban are not interested in economic growth.""

While China already has a footprint in the country Western investors will likely shy away from involvement with a group that openly rejects liberal values to the extent the Taliban does Brück believes.

""The scope of private sector-led investment was always very limited and is even more limited with the absence of western military powers on the ground"" he said.

Ahmady predicted that Afghanistan's new rulers will have to introduce currency controls — limiting access to dollars immediately — and said that inflation would rise as the local currency continues to drop hurting the poorest the most."

Voters approved the law as ballot initiative Proposition 22 in November with companies like Uber Lyft and DoorDash spending more than $200 million to campaign for the measure. Labor organizations including the Service Employees International Union opposed it.

California Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled Friday that the law illegally “limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law” adding that “The entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable.” He also ruled that it was unconstitutional to that the law required any future amendments to have a seven-eighths vote of approval to pass the legislature.

In January a group of Uber and Lyft drivers along with the SEIU filed a lawsuit seeking to have the measure overturned. The law exempts gig employers from providing benefits and protections to workers but requires that they offer healthcare subsidies and minimum hourly earnings.

“It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies...”

Roesch took issue with the part of the law that requires any future California state law concerning collective bargaining for gig workers to comply with the Prop 22 law. “It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies in having a divided ununionized workforce which is not a stated goal of the legislation” he wrote.

Geoff Vetter a spokesperson for the Protect App-Based Drivers & Services Coalition (PADS) which includes Uber Lyft DoorDash and Instacart said in a statement emailed to The Verge that they plan to appeal. The judge “made a serious error by ignoring a century’s worth of case law requiring the courts to guard the voters’ right of initiative” Vetter wrote noting that a majority of California voters had approved the measure. “All of the provisions of Prop 22 will remain in effect until the appeal process is complete.”

Bob Schoonover president of SEIU California State Council praised the judge’s ruling in a statement emailed to The Verge.

“The gig industry-funded ballot initiative was unconstitutional and is therefore unenforceable. Companies like Uber and Lyft spent $225 million in an effort to take away rights from workers in a way that violates California’s Constitution” Schoonover wrote. “They tried to boost their profits by undermining democracy and the state constitution. For two years drivers have been saying that democracy cannot be bought. And today’s decision shows they were right.”"

The customer is always right. Or at least that's what retailers have said for years.

But that adage has never been more true than during the last year and a half when people — many for the first time — tried a host of alternatives to in-store shopping.

""Nothing compares to the last 18 months for retail"" said Kim Sovell a business professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""Nothing.""

The pandemic dramatically set in motion a new age of consumer behavior that many retail experts say will persist.

Stores like Best Buy and Target which posted record sales growth during months of the pandemic are experimenting with store formats technology and experience concepts.

""The customer is really in control of how they want to shop"" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in an interview with the Star Tribune. ""Every customer is going to decide based on what they believe is safe based on what they believe is convenient based on what's right for their schedule and their time.""

Best Buy employee Lizzie Michalak from left helped Cathy and Patrick Peick of Mendota Heights check out in a newly designed customer service checkout and order pickup area at the Best Buy store in Eagan.

Cathy and Patrick Peick a recently-retired couple didn't venture out to stores during the height of the pandemic last year. Instead they relied on Amazon drivers to bring packages to their doorstep.

""It was darn near a daily delivery"" Cathy Peick said. ""It was fun like Christmas every day.""

Last week the pair made a rare trip to a store. They were at Best Buy in Eagan one of four in the metro the electronics retailer remodeled in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak reallocating half of the shopping area as space to fulfill orders. The store installed lockers last week near the entrance for customers to pick up products. It also has a larger Geek Squad help section.

In many ways the pandemic accelerated changes already occurring at retailers.

Before the pandemic a growing percentage of shoppers used online sites and social media. But when COVID-19 forced many people to stay at home digital shopping became more common.

""Along comes COVID and it turbocharges an already raging change in behavior"" said Mark Cohen director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. ""For customers who were partly in on e-commerce they went all in.""

In three months at the onset of the pandemic the country vaulted forward 10 years in e-commerce penetration research firm McKinsey & Co. estimates. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported last week that e-commerce sales accounted for 13.3% of total retail sales in the second quarter this year.

People are often creatures of habit but the pandemic provided a rare disruption and opportunity for retailers. In the United States 75% of consumers have tried a new store brand or different way of shopping during the pandemic according to research by McKinsey.

""Groceries were until recently one area in which many people were reluctant to shop online but COVID-19 has quickly changed that"" said Jill Standish senior managing director for retail at Accenture. ""The findings show how people who haven't been as comfortable with e-commerce and other digital technology have been pushed to overcome their hesitancy — and this shift is huge.""

Target and Best Buy were prepared because of their earlier investment in contactless services technology such as mobile apps and store fulfillment before the crisis. Both companies had been shipping items directly from their stores and offering versions of order pickup for years.

Last March Best Buy temporarily closed stores to in-store shopping and ramped up curbside pickup so it expanded nationwide. Online revenue for Best Buy's total fiscal year grew nearly 145% to about $18.7 billion. As it expanded same-day options it even started having employees deliver items to customers. It plans to continue to test different store prototypes including small 5000-square-foot format stores as it prepares for a more hybrid world.

""Best Buy has always been good at omnichannel. ... I think that one of the things that really served Best Buy very well [at the start of the pandemic] is that they could very quickly ramp up their model"" said Neil Saunders managing director of retail at GlobalData.

Target's online sales skyrocketed last year. Digitally-originated sales went from 8.8% of total sales in 2019 to 17.9% in 2020. Much of Target's digital growth was from its contactless same-day services. It expanded its pickup options to include fresh produce and frozen groceries and more recently alcoholic beverages. It even updated its mobile app so customers could specify exactly where in a car they want their items placed.

""Target in my mind is one of the biggest winners"" said Scott Mushkin retail analyst and founder of R5 Capital. ""They never really shut down. They have done a good job and people are comfortable going to Target.""

Target customers haven't shirked away from stores even as digital and contactless options grew. When it announced quarterly results last week Target revealed that its store and digital-originated sales were relatively similar to the same time last year leaning more to stores. Target will spend $4 billion a year opening new stores remodeling as well as engaging in supply-chain projects such as expansion of its robotics solutions one of which started at a local warehouse.

""Target consumers like many want to be in charge and have the tools at their fingertips"" said Christina Hennington Target's chief growth officer. ""We've seen incredible digital acceleration across our business and our investments in supply chain store operations and technology capabilities ensured we were ready to meet such unprecedented demand last year. But the safety ease and convenience that guests needed last year remains popular.""

This past week Target began to open mini Ulta Beauty sections in select stores complete with trained Target staff who can offer beauty consultations. This month Kohl's is also opening the first of its Sephora sections at different locations.

To Best Buy's Barry there is no going back to pre-pandemic retail practices. Customers have become too accustomed to services like curbside pickup. ""We now have a whole suite of customers who got very used to the convenience of curbside"" she said.

But she added ""The store is pivotal in the customer experience and it's not just in the shopping journey. It's in the fulfillment journey. It's in for us the repair and support part of the journey. It is sometimes the consultative part of the journey.""

Sandra Ocampo of Maplewood with her daughter Sandy 2 got sit down help with her phone from Geek Squad consultation agent Julian Rios Rodriguez at the Best Buy store in Eagan.

In the past week there have been reports that Amazon which also recently launched Amazon Fresh grocery stores will open department stores.

""Amazon is not a stupid retailer"" Saunders said. ""It's really savvy. If Amazon is moving more into physical stores it kind of suggests there is probably a future for physical stores.""

For in-store experiences customers are still concerned about hygiene and cleanings. Most stores during the pandemic adopted more stringent cleaning schedules and retail leaders such as Target have said cleanliness will be key in how remodels are imagined.

A big challenge for retailers will be to make sure the services consumers became accustomed to including curbside pickup are cost-effective in the long term.

The picking of items from shelves has to be done by a store associate who otherwise could be working on other tasks like helping customers so there's a labor cost as well as a cost in the in-store customer experience Mushkin said.

""What you run into is a really bad store experience"" he said in some instances.

There are also costs and inefficiencies in shipping items to people's homes. Traditional mail carriers have only been increasing shipping prices. At the same time the consumer has been conditioned to expect things fast and at the same time free or very cheap.

""One of the things we really learned about ourselves was how convenient we like things"" Sovell said.

Retailers' first test in how to approach a post-COVID world will likely be this back-to-school season. Target executives last week said the season is off to a strong start.

Best Buy's Barry said ""I think you are going to have parents preparing for a variety of outcomes and at the same time likely catching up in some ways on shopping that they haven't done for quite some time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuc2hlYWx0aG1hZy5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2EzNzMzMTA1MC9lc3NlbmNlLWxhc2gtcHJpbmNlc3MtbWFzY2FyYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Essence Lash Princess Mascara Review: The $5 TikTok Viral Makeup,"Women's Health may earn commission from the links on this page but we only feature products we believe in. Why Trust Us?

If I had to choose a desert island makeup product it would without a doubt be mascara. More than any concealer foundation brow gel or contour palette a good curling thickening lengthening mascara that highlights my eyes makes the biggest impact on my overall look. When I first started becoming the full-blown product junkie I am today I was on a serious budget—but mascara was the one thing I would splurge on.

While I've found some budget-friendly mascaras here and there that I do like nothing has really fully replaced my affinity for the finer things in (mascara) life. That's precisely why I was super intrigued when Essence's Lash Princess Mascara started to blow up on TikTok ( ) for being better than pricey alternatives. At just five dollars it's about as affordable as you can get when it comes to drugstore mascaras.

After weeks of using it I found that it totally lived up to the hype. No it doesn't look like I'm actually wearing false lashes. But it made my lashes look just as thick and long as pricey mascaras have.

Here's my honest review of how it compared to the luxe mascaras in my rotation:

It thickened and lengthened my lashes but didn't curl them.

Personally I have a ""more is more"" attitude so when I first used this I got overexcited and swiped on about five layers of product on my lashes before I realized that I had way overdone it. It totally weighed down my lashes and made them extra clumpy. A little goes a long way with this so I found that two quick swipes was perfect for transforming my sparse short lashes in to being thick and long.

The only con I'd say is that this doesn't curl my straight lashes as much as I'd like. If you're anything like me definitely try the Curl version of the mascara ( ). It doesn't quite offer the same lengthening qualities but it offers more of a curl and natural look. (See below for before and afters of me using it alone!).

Courtesy

It lasted on my lashes all day through humid weather.

I find that most mascaras rarely continue to look good on my lashes for more than a few hours after the initial application. The first time I used this I went all out and used it on a humid day through an outdoor workout and rooftop dinner with a friend fully expecting to have panda eyes once I looked in the mirror. To my shock the mascara completely held up even better than the cult-favorite $30 mascara I've been using for a decade.

It's not water or cry-proof.

I thought the first-time use was a fluke since this mascara isn't even waterproof so I continued to test its boundaries by wearing it through outdoor runs and even the Bachelorette finale I cried my way through (don't judge). It survived the run but unfortunately not the final rose. The good news is the mascara is available in a waterproof version ($4 Amazon) which is even less expensive so I suggest that if you're prone to tears.

TLDR?

I was truly shocked by how good Essence's Lash Princess Mascara is at lengthening and thickening lashes given its low price tag. My ideal scenario is using two swipes of the False Effect version to lengthen and thicken my lashes and then I go in with two swipes of the Curl on my upper lashes afterward.

At such an affordable price what have you got to lose other than $5?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZXZpbGxlZXllLmNvbS9pbi10aGUtbmVpZ2hib3Job29kL2FydGlzdHMtY28tb3AtcmVzaWRlbnQtZ2FyeS1nLWItY2Fyc29uLXJlbWVtYmVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artists’ Co-Op Resident Gary “G.B.” Carson Remembered,"Emeryville Artists’ Co-Op resident Gary “G.B.” Carson died peacefully at home surrounded by family on July 29. He was 71.

Born and raised in Montana he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in the History of Art program studying under Peter Selz (also the founding director of the Berkeley Art Museum). Gary had a long career as an art advisor and appraiser in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the 1980s he was the agent for artists Bruce Conner and Stephen De Staebler and later became the representative of the Wally Hedrick estate. He was also a chronicler of the San Francisco Punk scene contributing to such underground publications as Search and Destroy and Damage.

Two decades ago he began dividing his time between California and Montana. He built a home overlooking the Missouri River near Townsend Montana where he continued his lifelong passion for bird hunting. During the winter season he and painter Catherine Courtenaye lived in Emeryville. Most mornings they could be seen briskly walking their beloved dog Enzo at the off-leash area of César Chávez Park at the Berkeley Marina which they cared deeply for.

Gary was equally at ease with hunting as he was in discussing Surrealism Situationism Bay Area figurative painting contemporary pulp writers or Montana literature. Gary possessed a particular passion for Northern California modernist art with an admiration for the Funk Art movement and the art that sprung from the Beat Generation. His connoisseurship for the arts was vast and infectious. He had an innate sense of culture and life fully lived. Gary had what some might call “the touch of the marvelous.”

He was honored to have served on the Montana Arts Council. G.B. is survived by his mother P.M. Dagenais of Helena; his daughter Miranda Carson of Berkeley; his wife Catherine Courtenaye of Bozeman and Emeryville; and his French Brittany pup Jasper primed to carry on the long line of Carson’s hunting companions.

Gifts in his memory may be given to the Montana Historical Society Planned Parenthood of Montana or the ACLU of Montana.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is prepping to craft yet another regime for internet service providers (ISPs)—the seventh in 13 years.

Even by contemporary standards of partisan unpleasantness the debate about net neutrality is acrimonious. In 2018 a man was convicted of threatening to kill then–FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's family because he didn't like Pai's approach to the issue. The hysteria does not reflect reality. The ""open internet"" that regulatory rules purportedly preserve emerged from a world without net neutrality rules.

Early commercial internet innovations such as AOL and voice over internet were impeded by ""common carriage"" and ""universal service"" rules which imposed an array of costly requirements (including compliance with licensing and pricing rules tax liabilities and network build-out mandates). Deregulation brought progress bountiful new networks and a cornucopia of content. The launch of broadband was itself a product of liberalization as unregulated cable TV operators challenged telephone franchises by building ""fast lanes"" to the internet.

Meanwhile the carriers that were expected to use Bell Labs technologies to bring high-speed data to the masses lagged behind. When the phone companies were unleashed in the early 2000s they began pressing for market share against cable systems and both platforms upped their game.

By 2008 however the FCC worried that cable TV would squelch streaming services offering ""walled gardens"" stocked with proprietary content. Critics accused ISPs of stunting the ecosystem by taxing innovation ""at the edge."" Net neutrality rules were devised to pry markets open.

Even when briefly in effect the rules had no such impact. A 2011 complaint accused MetroPCS then the fifth-largest wireless carrier of anti-competitively selling cheap subscriptions with unlimited YouTube videos. T-Mobile then the third-largest mobile operator was investigated in 2016 for ""Binge On""—giving low-cost access to low-bandwidth video streams.

The companies did favor certain popular content to the benefit of consumers. Happily the FCC never got around to blocking such practices. Through open markets and without net neutrality apps like Skype FaceTime and Zoom flourished. Google search took the internet by storm partnering with AOL when it was the world's largest ISP to swamp established search engines.

Broadband ISPs ditched ""walled gardens"" voluntarily since the vast content available via millions of independent websites drives demand for broadband. Americans have been gorging: From 2010 to 2020 average data consumed by U.S. households rose 37-fold. And U.S. markets in the broadband stress test created by the pandemic withstood massive increases in traffic. In more regulated Europe major video streaming services had to abandon HD to save the network.

Instead of ""vertical foreclosure"" by ISPs we saw the rise of independent video streams—Netflix Hulu YouTube Amazon Apple HBO Max etc.—come to dominate internet traffic. ISPs competing in data delivery built a new marketplace of remarkable diversity and choice.

Basic cable channels were tied to their wires just as newspapers bundled news with ads. Both have become pterodactyls. Basic cable subscriptions fell from 100 million in 2013 to under 80 million in 2021. AT&T paying $64 billion for DirecTV in 2015 is dumping it for $15 billion; the satellite platform delivers channels that no longer need it.

In 2015 the FCC announced that it would henceforth treat ISPs as ""common carriers"" under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act implying that broadband networks could not treat content from rival sources differently. This presumably precluded ""fast lanes"" for YouTube videos or Peacock shows (especially on Comcast cable since Comcast owns NBC/Peacock). That policy presented as a way to counter ISPs' anticompetitive conduct ironically implemented the scheme that AT&T used to monopolize old phone markets provoking the antitrust suit that ultimately busted up Ma Bell.

To assuage fears that the new regime would replay the AT&T debacle the FCC pledged to refrain from doing much with it. Rate regulation the heart of the old system would be avoided via bureaucratic ""forbearance."" In short the commission reinstituted the threat of regulation but decried its substance.

When the FCC abandoned that approach in 2018 apocalyptic forecasts darkened the sky. New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo declared that the ""freewheeling internet has been dying a slow death"" and that the end of mandated net neutrality ""would be the final pillow in its face."" This fatalism reflected widespread misunderstanding.

Consider a 2015 ""explainer video"" produced by The Wall Street Journal. By way of analogy it asks whether FedEx should be allowed to charge Amazon extra for shipping because the giant retailer soaks up so much capacity. It ominously suggests that FedEx might even make Amazon ""chip in"" for truck maintenance by threatening to slow down deliveries. To counter such shenanigans the narrator intones the FCC decided to treat broadband ISPs as common carriers: ""It's why FedEx can't discriminate against Amazon deliveries.""

But Federal Express is not a regulated common carrier. It sometimes volunteers to be an unregulated common carrier as when the federal government accuses it of shipping pharmaceutical products not approved for use in the United States. Still FedEx has every legal right to negotiate terms with Amazon and it exercises those rights: ""Amazon Loses Contract With FedEx as It Builds Out Competing Delivery Network"" blared a 2019 headline in The Verge.

Meanwhile United Parcel Service states that it ""is not a common carrier and reserves the right in its absolute discretion to refuse carriage to any shipment tendered to it for transportation.""

The lesson: Market competition even with small numbers (as in national package delivery) often protects customer interests so well that regulatory enthusiasts mistake those open market outcomes for results imposed by ""neutral"" rules.

A 2018 Burger King ad makes the same blunder. The three-minute Whopper Neutrality video recorded with a hidden camera shows Burger King customers surprised by a new menu: $25.99 for ""Hyperfast MBPS"" Whoppers delivered without delay $4.99 for ""Slow MBPS"" Whoppers served after a long wait. (MBPS: Making Burgers Per Second.) ""The sandwich is ready"" says the counter person. ""I'm just not allowed to give it to you.""

Hungry patrons go ballistic. ""The sandwich is ready but you can't give it to me?"" one guy exclaims. The clerk responds ""Whopper neutrality was repealed. They voted on it."" The angry dude: ""God this is the worst thing I've ever heard of!"" Outside after being let in on the game the customer tells the camera: ""The Whopper taught me about net neutrality.""

Sorry but no. Under net neutrality rules broadband providers may charge higher prices for faster service or additional bandwidth as AT&T did back in the day. Net neutrality aims to eliminate discrimination against rival services.

With Burger King as the ""MBPS"" supplier there's a tiny problem: Burger King offers only Whoppers. There is no Big Mac Wendy's or Triple Bonus Jack on the menu. The platform is vertically integrated making burgers and serving them and it ""forecloses"" competing products. That no one would think to ban those practices is testimony to market rivalry and to the efficiency of ""burger non-neutrality.""

Also note this whopper: Burger King does charge extra for faster service. The chain delivers! That cuts out the whole waiting-in-line thing for a fee. Not a shocker. And the option is great for customers. But when it comes to broadband premium prices for faster service are supposed to be an outrage.

Cosmetic policy initiatives may come and go but the price controls licensing access fees access obligations taxes restrictions and cross-subsidies attached to the old AT&T Title II rules are gone for good reason. Even when touting common carriage regulators will be leery of actually following through. It is better for consumers to have companies like FedEx or Burger King which set their own terms rather than lobbying for business models dictated by commissioners. And that only look regulated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS9yb25hbGQtZWRlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xNTk4OTEyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ronald Eden Obituary (1945 - 2021) - Homosassa FL - Citrus County Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/chronicleonline/name/ronald-eden-obituary?id=15989128 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS9yb25hbGQtZWRlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xNTk4OTEyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

I will show you how to book Virtuoso rates directly and access other VIP programs where relevant so that you’ll get those extras that add value to your vacation.

With housing being a basic need besides food and clothing the United Nations (UN) recommends that monthly rent should not exceed 30% of a household’s income.

However research shows that some Kenyans spend up to 40% of their income on rent due to a lack of knowledge on the market and poor financial skills.

According to a report by Hass Consult the Gigiri suburb is home to the most expensive houses in the city while Kitengela was placed as the least expensive neighbourhood.

The house price index quarter one 2021 report stated home buyers were opting for semi-detached houses as they were more spacious than apartments but at the same time are more affordable than detached houses.

“Working and schooling from home has shed light on the importance of more space leading to increased demand for homes with compounds. However since most household incomes declined or were affected semi-detached houses have become a more favorable housing option as they offer more space than apartments but at a less expensive price than detached houses” said Sakina Hassanali head of development consulting and research at HassConsult.

The survey showed house prices in Muthaiga saw the biggest rise at 8.4%. Rental front prices across all property types on the other hand continued to improve increasing by 1.2% over the quarter.

Schwartz age 52 of Coppell Texas was indicted yesterday and accused of conspiring with ValueWise CEO Michael T. Mann to defraud companies that loaned millions of dollars to ValueWise subsidiaries.

The announcement was made by Acting United States Attorney Antoinette T. Bacon and Janeen DiGuiseppi Special Agent in Charge of the Albany Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Schwartz was charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud along with four counts of wire fraud and will be arraigned at a later date. The charges in the indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.





According to the indictment Mann obtained millions of dollars in loans from two financing companies located in New York and Colorado by falsifying his companies’ receivables. Mann falsely told the financing companies that Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (“UHG”) and its subsidiary OptumInsight Inc. (“Optum”) owed millions of dollars to his companies. Mann routinely created fake invoices reflecting the fictitious debt and assigned them to the financing companies as collateral for loans.





Schwartz was a high-level executive at Optum and then began working for ValueWise in about October 2013. Until about August 2016 he operated TrueHR LLC a ValueWise subsidiary based in Dallas Texas.

According to the indictment in or about October 2013 Schwartz recruited a UHG/Optum employee Luke Steiner to falsely represent to the financing companies that the fake invoices created by Mann were valid and payable by Optum. With Schwartz’s encouragement and direction Steiner regularly made these false verifications for six years ending in August 2019.

Schwartz also allegedly took other actions in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme including according to the indictment:

If convicted of any of the charges in the indictment Schwartz faces up to 20 years in prison and up to 3 years of post-imprisonment supervised release. A defendant’s sentence is imposed by a judge based on the particular statute the defendant is charged with violating the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other factors.

Mann pled guilty to various crimes in connection with his fraudulent scheme and was sentenced earlier this month to 144 months in prison. Steiner age 33 of Minneapolis Minnesota pled guilty in February 2020 to conspiring with Mann and is pending sentencing.

This case is being investigated by the FBI and being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Barnett and Cyrus P.W. Rieck.

YINCHUAN Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Prognosis using big data intelligent diagnosis instruction on transnational remote surgeries -- the booming development of digital technology is driving healthcare more than ever accelerating the building of the community of common health for mankind.

""Harnessing the power of digital technology is critical to achieving universal health coverage"" said Dr. Gauden Galea World Health Organization representative to China at a healthcare forum of the ongoing fifth China-Arab States Expo in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Over the years China has continuously developed digital health promoting the deep integration of internet technology and healthcare.

So far the country is home to more than 1600 internet hospitals and nearly 49 million people took online diagnosis and treatment in 2020 with the prevalence of online healthcare services said Yu Xuejun deputy head of the National Health Commission at the forum.

Yu pointed out that Internet Plus Healthcare has become an indispensable part of medical care and its advantages such as being contactless have been fully displayed during the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

From pre-registration to health management digital technology has been applied in almost the whole medical care process in many Chinese cities and even people in remote villages can now enjoy quality medical services via intelligent diagnosis and telemedicine.

Benefitting from the development of digital technology China is also sharing its experience with other countries especially those with underdeveloped medical care.

Since 1978 China has already dispatched 25 batches of medical teams to Benin in support of its medical care service.

The China-Benin telemedicine cooperation center was launched in 2019 with an aim to provide China's online medical services to medical institutions in the West African country.

Besides offering vaccines and medical supplies as well as dispatching medical teams China has also shared its anti-pandemic experience with Arabian countries through video conferences.

""I can clearly see the benefits of cooperation with China in this field for our part of the world"" said Mahmoud Hassan Elamin head of the Mission of League of Arab States in China.

In recent years China and Arab countries have brought their willingness to collaborate and cooperate in health care sector to the next level by introducing new mechanisms and scope deepening the cooperation on health care institutions medical technology research infectious diseases prevention and control traditional medicine and healthcare human resources development he said.

""A new pattern for corporation has been created for both parties"" he added.

China is willing to work together with friends worldwide to grasp the opportunities brought by the digital revolution and promote the building of a community of common health for mankind said Yu Xuejun. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2Nyb2xsLmluL2FydGljbGUvMTAwMzEzNS93aHktaW5kaWFzLXB1YmxpYy1oZWFsdGgtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWRvZXNudC13b3JrLXZlcnktd2VsbC1hbmQtaG93LWl0LWNhbi1iZS1maXhlZNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjcm9sbC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDMxMzUvd2h5LWluZGlhcy1wdWJsaWMtaGVhbHRoLWluc3VyYW5jZS1kb2VzbnQtd29yay12ZXJ5LXdlbGwtYW5kLWhvdy1pdC1jYW4tYmUtZml4ZWQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why India’s public health insurance doesn’t work very well – and how it can be fixed,"Three years after the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana was launched in September 2018 the scheme has been unable to meet one of its most important objectives – of providing “cashless and paperless” access to healthcare for patients at the point of care.

The “world’s largest government-funded healthcare program” was a step towards Universal Health Coverage the government said and would provide quality health services to eligible patients and protect them from financial hardship.

However as a study from Chhattisgarh has found PM-JAY has failed to plug the shortcomings of previous publicly funded health insurance schemes – it has not decreased families’ out-of-pocket expenditure on health or increased use of hospital care substantially. In addition it does not offer outpatient consultation and the programme is underfunded to support its beneficiaries we found from studies and speaking to experts.

What is PM-JAY?

Ayushman Bharat aims to provide 110 million “poor deprived rural families” and specific occupational categories of urban workers’ families such as those of beggars rag pickers domestic workers and street vendors with an annual family health insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh for the treatment of diseases that cannot be cured at a primary healthcare centre. The beneficiaries were selected based on 2011 Socio-Economic and Caste Census .

PM-JAY subsumed two other centrally sponsored schemes – the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana  which was launched in 2008 and insured families of informal sector workers below the poverty line for up to Rs 30000 per family and the Senior Citizen Health Insurance Scheme  which was launched in 2006 and provides an additional Rs 30000 for every senior citizen in families eligible for Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana.

PM-JAY is India’s largest public-private partnership wrote Sulakshana Nandi  the national joint convenor of the People’s Health Movement a grassroots network of health activists and organisations. The government enters into a contractual agreement with private and public hospitals – called Empanelled Health Care Providers – which undertake to provide services and treatments at fixed rates. The government forbids these hospitals from charging any additional payment to cover any part of the medical expenses called “co-payment”.

The central scheme is implemented at the state level by State Health Agencies as health is a state subject in India. As on May 18 33 states and Union Territories have implemented this scheme. While Delhi and Odisha stayed out of the scheme West Bengal had reportedly joined the scheme but withdrawn on January 10 2019.

Out-of-pocket expenditure

There is no national evaluation of the impact of PM-JAY on out-of-pocket expenditure but one year after the launch of the programme insured patients in Chhattisgarh spent similar amounts out-of-pocket as uninsured patients found a study by authors from the Raipur-based State Health Resource Centre which works with Chhattisgarh’s health ministry. Those insured spent more in public facilities than those not insured the study found.

In India nearly 63% of healthcare expenditure was out-of-pocket in 2018 – the fifteenth highest in the world and fourth highest after Afghanistan Myanmar and Bangladesh among neighbouring countries show data from the World Bank. Out-of-pocket expenditure is one of the main causes of the financial burden on poor families as per a study on its impact on patients at a public hospital in Kerala. About 18% of Indians spent more than 10% and 4% of Indians more than a quarter of their income on healthcare IndiaSpend reported in December 2019.

Catastrophic health expenditure when paid for out-of-pocket often impoverishes already poor families. Health expenditure is considered catastrophic when catastrophic health expenditure turns out to be more than 40% of a household’s remaining income after meeting basic needs according to a technical brief by the World Health Organization.

Catastrophic health expenditure for PM-JAY beneficiaries in Chhattisgarh was also found to be larger at 51.2% compared to 47.4% for non-beneficiaries the study found.

Beneficiaries enrolled in PM-JAY were charged for diagnostics medicines and pre-hospitalisation costs found a 2020 Economic and Political Weekly study of the programme in Jharkhand between September 2018 and March 2019. As many as 93% of respondents in this study reported that they were charged for these services and that they received no reimbursement for them.

“Continuing out-of-pocket expenditure due to fraudulent practices by private hospitals is one of the reasons the scheme has not been able to provide financial protection for healthcare that is the main objective of the scheme” Nandi of People’s Health Movement told IndiaSpend adding “Health care is no longer viewed as a right but a commodity.”

To ensure the quality of healthcare services the National Health Agency has partnered with the Quality Council of India  as per the 2020 PM-JAY annual report . The National Health Agency conducts monthly quality audits of services provided by empanelled hospitals but information on the results are not publicly available.

No outpatient consultation

Daily wagers the targeted beneficiaries of PM-JAY or the precursor Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana avoid hospitalisation so as not to lose their daily income. So it is important that insurance cover expenditure on OPD facilities diagnostic tests and medicines for non-hospitalised care according to a 2020 study on previously run pilot projects on the incorporation of OPD into RSBY in Odisha Gujarat Punjab Andhra Pradesh Mizoram and Uttarakhand.

The National Statistical Office ’s Health Survey does not collect data on people availing OPD facilities. However people who do not need hospitalisation outnumber those who do by 135 times in rural areas and by 122 times in urban India show data from the 75th NSO health survey .

Unlike PM-JAY the Central Government Health Scheme for employees of the central government provides OPD consultation at the rate of Rs 150.

Overall the Chhattisgarh study found that public health insurance resulted in only a small increase in access to healthcare facilities: 6% of those enrolled in PM-JAY and the state’s Mukhyamantri Swasthya Bima Yojana utilised healthcare facilities compared to 5.7% of those who were not enrolled in the programme.

Inadequate funding

The budget for PM-JAY is split between the centre and state in the ratio of 60:40 for all states other than the northeastern and hilly states where the break-up is 90:10.

The central government had allocated Rs 6400 crore in 2021-’22 to PM-JAY but revised estimates of the budget reduced it to Rs 3200 crore. In 2020-’21 31 states and Union Territories were allocated a total of Rs 2544.09 crore lower than the Rs 2992.93 crore in 2019-’20 as per a Lok Sabha response in August 2021 .

“Healthcare is chronically underfunded in India and in many states and rural areas there is a shortage of hospitals” Nachiket Mor visiting scientist to the Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health told IndiaSpend.

“State government allocations towards health care are close to 1.25% of their Gross State Domestic Product – of which about 0.25% comes from the central government. 1.25% is a very limited amount of money as the required sums for comprehensive healthcare are close to 4% to 6% of Gross State Domestic Product for each state” Mor explained.

Programmes like PM-JAY run the risk of further fragmenting the provision of healthcare; not only can they not address hospital supply gaps but by reducing the money available to the state health departments they may even delay the creation of such critical infrastructure Mor added.

Our Correspondent

Kohima | August 21

The Nagaland Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Vision 2030 in its goal three on Good health and well being stated that by 2030 Nagaland will ensure healthy lives and promote well being of all ages by providing equitable affordable and quality health care services to the people of the state.

It aim to reduce Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) to less than 70 per 100000 live births end preventable deaths of new born and children under 5 years of age reduce by one third premature mortality due to non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well being end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis malaria and neglected tropical diseases and provide equitable and affordable and quality health care services to the people of the state.

Challenges

On health financing the vision statement stated that norms for allocation of funds are based on population and not on requirements of gaps faced in certain locations among vulnerable populations.

“There is also a low utilization of funds due to delays in the releases of funds difficulty in observing the complicated implementation guidelines and negligible private investors in health” it stated.

It stated that there is adequate provision under the National Health Mission (NHM) to supplement Human Resources regiments. However while majority of the doors nurses and other technical manpower have availed the state quota/sponsorship to undergo their studies only a few respond to contractual employment creating an apparent scarcity of technical manpower.

Traditional health providers function in parallel or sometimes in conflict with modern systems and there is lack of coordination/collaboration between the government agencies and such practitioners to support and promote indigenous system of medicines.

It stated that widespread absenteeism among medical staff is hindering factor to provide effective health care access to the people of the state.

In addition to lack of awareness and poor health seeking behavior shortage of general facilities poor communication and difficult terrain are factors contributing to lack of access to healthcare.

“Another reason for inaccessibility is poor referral transport network. This is mainly due to poor road connectivity shortage of ambulances lack of proper ambulance network management system and lack of skilled personnel in emergency care” it stated. The vision statement also stated that consequent to financial constraints there is a wide gap in terms of health infrastructure: hospital buildings and quarters equipment instruments diagnostics and drugs power supply water supply approach roads to hospital etc.

On the other hand many assets are not being effectively utilized.



Strategies for success

The vision statement stressed the need for promotion of institutional deliveries and care around birth/respectful maternal care.

It also emphasized on the need to improve the quality of care in labour rooms and operation theatres National Laqshya Certification is being implemented at district hospitals and other high case load facilities.

It aim to improve the quality of maternal and new born care during intra and immediate postpartum periods through providers who are competent and confident Dakshata training’ will be expanded to all health care personnel involved in maternal and new born care.

Other areas include operationalisation of High Dependency units at district hospitals and other high case of facilities providing blood services along with appropriate skill HR for Caesarean Sections in all district hospitals and CHCs- First Referral Units promoting institutional deliveries through Laqshya implementation and Dakshata training along with SBAS and to operationalize Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres to health and Wellness centre for delivery of comprehensive primary health care.

For home delivery the state will ensure one auxiliary nurse midwife /General Nursing and Midwifery/Community Health Officers attend each delivery with use of misoprostol tablet and proper birth planning.

The state will saturate all facilities with Skilled Birth Attendance and Dakshata trained staff line listing of all pregnant women by ASHAs and consequent follow-up to ensure delivery.

The state will strengthen community death reporting through ASHAs and monthly review of all deaths (maternal and child deaths including stillbirths) will be done at facilities and at the district level.

State-level review meeting will be held under the principal secretary on quarterly basis and action points will be implemented accordingly.

The vision statement also emphasized on strengthening home based new born care for provision of essential new born care to all newborns up to 42 days of life including counseling of mothers on exclusive breastfeeding appropriate infant and young child feeding practices and hygiene by ASHAs so as to ensure that there is a continuum of care from health facility to home during the most vulnerable period.

Follow up of new born discharged from the special new born care units is also to be undertaken by frontline workers through home visits.

The vision statement also emphasized on elimination of malaria by 2022.

On vaccination coverage the vision statement called for ensuring all infants receive vaccines against seven vaccine preventable diseases (Tuberculosis polio diphtheria pertussis tetanus measles and hepatitis B).

Current status of Nagaland

• Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) per 100000 live births is 97 compared with the national average of 122.

• Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) per 1000 live births is 30 compared with the national average of 41.

• Under-five mortality rate (U5NR) per 1000 live births is 37 compared with the national average of 50.

• Children immunization coverage stands at around 35.4 percent compared with national average of 62.0 percent.

• HIV prevalence rate of 0.76 percent among adults third highest in the country as per the Nagaland State AIDS Control Society.



Focus for tomorrow

• Promote institutional deliveries neonatal care and respectful maternity care and train health personnel for home delivery

• Ensure all infants receive vaccines against seven vaccine preventable diseases

• Strengthen Adolescent Health Services

• Universal Health coverage and aces to quality essential health care services

• Upgrade medical health centres and abilities/ faculties to national and international levels",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbmR1bGEuY28uencvMjAyMS8wOC8yMS9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWhhcy1jb21taXR0ZWQtMjcwLW1pbGxpb24tZm9yLXZ2aXAtaG9zcGl0YWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government Has Committed $270 Million For VVIP Hospital,"Ncube said in his recent mid-term budget review statement:

Construction of Manyame VVIP hospital is progressing well with an amount of $2695 million having been availed to the project during 2021. Latest itel S24 (128GB) $124 (108MP camera)

WhatsApp: 0783 450 793 This has seen the first-floor deck being completed while plumbing and electrical works on the second and ground floor are underway with the project now expected to be completed by October 2021.

Community Working Group on Health executive director Itai Rusike Friday said the money used to build the political elite’s state-of-the-art Manyame Hospital could have been channelled towards the refurbishment of public hospitals which were in a sorry state. Rusike said:

The proposal to construct a VVIP hospital is highly misplaced and not a priority as that money can be used to refurbish and equip the existing public health institutions in the country such as Parirenyatwa Harare Mpilo and UBH Central Hospitals for use by the VVIPs. The government should appreciate that equity and universality are implicitly in universal health coverage. Having differences in service availability and quality of care for the VVIPs while neglecting health institutions used by the general public should be condemned as it will widen the equity gap and will not move us towards achieving universal health coverage. Instead of building a VVIP hospital there is need to address equity in terms of access to health services in the country.

In his budget review statement Ncube added that over $400 million had been set aside for refurbishment of public hospitals dotted around the country.

Ms Tina Gifty Naa Ayele Mensah the Deputy Minister of Health at the launch in Accra said the programme would boost leadership in healthcare delivery for improved health outcomes for both Ghana and Africa.

“You will agree with me that the health sector thrives within a system and critical within the system is leadership and governance. Leadership is central to our stewardship function as a Ministry. Leadership and governance transform our book knowledge into impact” she stated.

She said in line with this the WHO in collaboration with the Department of Health Policies Planning and Management at the University of Ghana and MoH were providing support to build such capacity through a Master of Health Economics Programme funded under the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund Programme” she said.

The expected outcomes she said would include improvements in the administration of the health sector particularly in the quality of planning coordination human and financial resource management.

Ms Mensah said the programme was also expected to enhance high-level advocacy and ownership of Ghana’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC)agenda and provide better support as well as motivation for staff of the health sector.

He stated that Ghana had defined UHC as ensuring that all people in the country had timely access to high quality healthcare services irrespective of the ability to pay at the point of use and to achieve that there was the need for an improvement in leadership and governance.

In the national UHC road map leadership governance strategic partnerships had been mentioned as some guiding principles which the Leadership for Health Transformation in Ghana programme would facilitate she said.

Dr. Francis Kasolo the WHO Country Representative said recognising leadership development as an essential tool in improving national health outcomes the 70th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa recommended the extension of the Pathway to Leadership Programme at the regional level to ministries of health in the region.

This Programme he said was one of the many capacity building initiatives being rolled out by the WHO in Ghana and it was designed and piloted in Congo with 34 health officials at sub-national level participating in the pilot phase.

Dr. Kasolo said the objective of the programme was to help increase health professionals’ personal and interpersonal awareness sharpen their analytical skills and help them to gain a greater understanding of complex issues facing managers and leaders as they facilitated the operationalisation of the new National Health Policy and the national UHC roadmap.

He said in the coming weeks WHO Ghana would sign a memorandum of understanding with the University of Ghana through the Colleges of Health Sciences to facilitate the capacity building.

Under the Leadership for Health Transformation Leadership programme 20 policy makers advisors and analysts in the health sector would be sponsored to pursue a one-year master’s in health economics at the School of Public Health.

In addition the School of Public Health would support the MoH and its agencies through health financing economic analysis economic evaluations and data analytics to help build their capacity he explained.

Dr Kasolo said the WHO would continue to advocate with development partners policy makers for budget items for building technical capacity on essential technical skills that were important to the successful implementation of the UHC road map.

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti the WHO African Regional Director in a speech read on her behalf said the programme was first designed for WHO AFRO staff but following its success the Regional Committee of 2019 recommended that the programme should be extended to member states.

She thanked the Government of Ghana for its effort in introducing extensive changes to health sector governance through this programme which would contribute to making Ghana’s health leadership community more results-oriented accountable and better equipped to deliver on its mandate."

Se cumplieron 17 meses del cierre de los puentes para viajes no esenciales y el escenario en el centro de Laredo es desolador. Al menos 8 de cada 10 negocios permanecen cerrados o sus edificios vacantes.

Arterias de élite comercial como la avenida Convento otrora la más atractiva y “peleada” por los comerciantes para poner sus tiendas lucen desiertas y sobresalen en sus edificios los anuncios de “Se Renta”.

Debido a la pandemia de Covid-19 el 21 de marzo del 2020 el gobierno de Estados Unidos decretó el cierre de la frontera para viajeros no esenciales medida que afectó principalmente a los dueños de tiendas en el centro de Laredo donde el 90 por ciento de sus clientes son mexicanos.

Esta medida poco a poco fue mermando la economía de los comerciantes del centro que sin ventas comenzaron a cortar horas de trabajo a sus empleados cortar horarios de operaciones y luego se vieron en la necesidad de despedir a sus trabajadores.

El congresista federal Henry Cuéllar acaba de realizar una visita al sector centro de Laredo para hablar con los pocos comerciantes que aún tienen abiertos sus establecimientos y según dijo están desesperados y sin dinero.

“Algunos de ellos ya están por cerrar y otros atienden sus tienditas ellos mismos y sus esposas tuvieron que dejar ir a los empleados porque sus ventas son mínimas ellos son las principales víctimas del cierre de la frontera” dijo el legislador.

Consideró injusto que el gobierno de Estados Unidos deje pasar a miles de migrantes sin documentos de 55 diferentes países y les niegue el cruce a mexicanos que tienen una visa láser y que gastan miles de dólares en compras viajes hoteles y comidas.

“Antes de la pandemia las cifras oficiales establecían que cada año cruzaban a EU unos 18 millones de mexicanos en plan de turismo y gastaban unos 19 billones de dólares tomando en cuenta estos números las pérdidas tras 17 meses de cierre son de unos 28.5 billones de dólares para la economía estadounidense” indicó.

Miriam Castillo presidente ejecutiva interina de la Cámara de Comercio dijo que se han hecho esfuerzos desde diferentes frentes para pedirle al gobierno de EU la reapertura de los puentes a los viajeros no esenciales pero no se ha logrado nada.

Dennis Nixon presidente del Banco Internacional de Comercio (IBC) un banquero influyente con conexiones poderosas en Washington ha solicitado de diferentes maneras la reapertura de los puentes y tampoco ha logrado una respuesta positiva ni con la Administración del ex presidente Donald Trump ni con Joe Biden.

“Es frustrante no obtener una respuesta positiva ya les propusimos un plan para abrir de manera segura pero ni eso han considerado desafortunadamente la pandemia de Covid volvió a repuntar y esto hace más complicado la reapertura” dijo.

El alcalde Pete Sáenz acaba de ir a una reunión recientemente donde estuvo Alejandro Mayorkas secretario de Seguridad Nacional y a quien le pidió considerar abrir los puentes a viajeros no esenciales para que los mexicanos con visa se vacunen contra el Covidy proteger la región pero tampoco hubo respuesta.

Kumar Satinder dueño de una tienda de perfumes en la cuadra 1200 de Zaragoza ya perdió la esperanza de reabrir pronto su establecimiento.

Otros comerciantes como José López decidieron buscar un trabajo y cerrar sus tiendas porque las escasas ventas no eran suficientes para pagar renta servicios y además surtir mercancía.

Todos los fanáticos quieren tener la nueva camiseta de la leyenda que retoma su carrera siete años después en una compañía que no existía cuando decidió retirarse en 2014. Apenas está iniciando la aventura y de la misma manera apenas está iniciando su éxito. Porque cuando se habla de CM Punk y lucha libre el cielo es el límite.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWxwZXJpb2RpY29kZWxhZW5lcmdpYS5jb20vbGEtY2FycmVyYS1tdW5kaWFsLWRlLWxvcy12ZWhpY3Vsb3MtZWxlY3RyaWNvcy1zZS12YS1jYWxlbnRhbmRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La carrera mundial de los vehículos eléctricos se va calentando,"Los vehículos eléctricos de batería serán la forma dominante de transporte por carretera para 2050 representando el 56% de todas las ventas de vehículos ese año. Según una nueva investigación de Wood Mackenzie en 2050 veremos 875 millones de vehículos eléctricos de pasajeros 70 millones de vehículos comerciales eléctricos y 5 millones de vehículos de pila de combustible en las carreteras. Esto eleva el total de vehículos de cero emisiones en funcionamiento a 950 millones a mediados de siglo.

Además más de tres de cada cinco vehículos en las carreteras serán vehículos eléctricos en China Europa y EEUU para 2050. Casi uno de cada dos vehículos comerciales será eléctrico en la misma fecha en esas regiones.

El crecimiento proyectado en las ventas de vehículos eléctricos augura malas noticias para los vehículos con motor de combustión interna (ICE). Las ventas de vehículos ICE incluidos los híbridos caerán a menos del 20% de todas las ventas mundiales para 2050. Casi la mitad del stock restante de ICE residirá en África Oriente Medio América Latina y Rusia y las regiones del Caspio a pesar de esos mercados solo poseen un 18% combinado de las existencias de vehículos mundiales ese año.

Según Prachi Mehta analista de investigación senior de NGL en Wood Mackenzie “las políticas de cero neto están transformando el panorama mundial. El transporte es uno de los mayores contribuyentes a las emisiones así como uno de los frutos más fáciles de alcanzar. Los países que representan más del 50% de las ventas mundiales de automóviles y los fabricantes de automóviles que representan el 80% de las ventas mundiales han expresado su deseo de ser neutrales en carbono y muchos han presentado planes concretos para hacerlo”.

Con nuevas cadenas de suministro y nuevas dependencias los OEM tradicionales están innovando sus modelos comerciales. El escenario parece estar listo para una revisión del transporte por carretera pero con los fabricantes de equipos originales que hacen anuncios llamativos de vehículos eléctricos con frecuencia la cuestión de cómo cuándo dónde y quién es un tema de debate frecuente.

Los cinco principales fabricantes de vehículos eléctricos proyectados por Wood Mackenzie (Tesla Volkswagen General Motors Nissan-Renault y Hyundai) se han comprometido a un total combinado de 89 millones en ventas anuales de vehículos eléctricos de batería para 2030 casi el 50% de las ventas de vehículo eléctricos de batería proyectado a nivel mundial. Las compañías alcanzarán el 39% de su objetivo para esta fecha y la ambición de Tesla de 20 millones de ventas anuales para 2030 sesgará fuertemente la tasa de éxito. Sin Tesla los otros cuatro fabricantes de automóviles alcanzarían el 79% de sus ventas objetivo para 2030.

Aunque Tesla está actualmente a la cabeza con poco más de medio millón de modelos de vehículos eléctricos vendidos en 2020 la competencia de los fabricantes de equipos originales y en particular de Volkswagen se está intensificando.

Según el análisis de Wood Mackenzie Volkswagen superará a Tesla a mediados de la década de 2020 para ser el principal fabricante de vehículos eléctricos vendiendo cerca de 3 millones de vehículos eléctricos al año para 2030. Tesla se quedará atrás en casi 15 millones de vehículos. Nissan-Renault y Hyundai también superarán a Tesla en ventas anuales a finales de esta década. La ausencia de General Motor en Europa será significativa durante la próxima década y verá a la compañía en el quinto lugar en la tabla de líderes en ventas globales.

La falta de infraestructura de carga de vehículos eléctricos y el alto precio de los automóviles eléctricos se han citado ampliamente como barreras para la adopción generalizada de vehículos eléctricos. Sin embargo vemos avances en ambos frentes.

El precio proyectado de los paquetes de baterías utilizados en vehículos eléctricos sigue cayendo. Esperamos que el umbral de los 100 dólares / KWh se supere en 2024 un año antes de lo esperado en las proyecciones anteriores de Wood Mackenzie.

Se proyecta que los puntos de recarga públicos y residenciales acumulados crecerán a 58 millones y 6 millones de puntos de venta respectivamente para el 2030. Se espera que el sector tenga un valor de inversión acumulada de 57.000 millones de dólares y 111.000 millones respectivamente entre 2020 y 2030.

Los consumidores también vigilan de cerca la economía. Y aunque la mayoría está impulsada en gran parte por preocupaciones climáticas los beneficios financieros de cambiar a vehículos eléctricos de batería híbridos enchufables y de cero emisiones también son un factor importante. La paridad de precios con los vehículos ICE en el punto de venta se ha logrado en el segmento de los sedán de lujo y se extenderá más allá de ese nicho antes de las proyecciones originales un cambio que realmente hará que se acelere la adopción de vehículos eléctricos.

El panorama del transporte en rápida evolución está atrayendo nuevas estrategias. A medida que los fabricantes de automóviles tradicionales se incorporan a la carrera de los vehículos eléctricos están ampliando su papel de solo productores de automóviles al invertir en la fabricación de celdas y baterías minas e infraestructura de carga”. La integración vertical será clave para mantener bajos los costos y garantizar la disponibilidad de material para respaldar el crecimiento” concluye Mehta."

More than 130 residents activists politicians journalists and others have been arrested under the law despite the government’s initial promise the law would not affect ordinary citizens.

Discussions revolving around how it might affect the city’s valued financial sector have become more heated.

Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yu whose agency’s responsibilities include maintaining Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center sought to reaffirm the city’s financial stability in a February blog post saying concerns are often “misinformation or disinformation” reassuring investors that the level of capital flowing into the city has not been declining and the number of asset managers is still growing.

Yue refused to offer updated comments related to more recent arrests under the law when approached by VOA.

This year Hong Kong’s stock exchange recorded the third-highest level of IPO proceeds following the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq with some experts predicting a continuing momentum in coming months.

Asset freeze rattles international investors

However global risk firm Verisk Maplecroft’s principal geopolitics analyst Hugo Brennan stressed that the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily’s forced shuttering and frozen assets “have rattled investors.”

“Companies and investors based in Hong Kong that fail to toe Beijing’s political line face the greatest exposure to asset seizures” Brennan told VOA.

With the founder Jimmy Lai in prison and a few executives arrested under the national security law the newspaper’s financial assets had been frozen before any conviction. It is widely considered to have been a government move to silence opposition voices and a crackdown on press freedom.

Hong Kong’s score on Maplecroft’s Freedom of Opinion and Expression Index over the past three years has worsened from the 112th worst-performing globally in 2018 to now 73rd Brennan said.

A law expert warned of the potential risks to company assets under the law that “can be highly unpredictable and changing like wind.”

“The national security law is capable of breaking a company. Assets can be frozen under some causes vaguely defined by the law so investors will certainly have to be mindful of this risk” Horace Yeung associate professor at the University of Leicester law school told VOA.

This concern has been shared by close to half of the expats based in Hong Kong according to a May survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. The report showed that there have been “growing underlying tensions and nagging fears” mostly stemming from “discomfort due to the national security law.”

Losing its place even as a gateway to China’s vast market?

While AmCham spokesperson Tara Joseph told the BBC earlier this year that capital flow between Hong Kong and the mainland China “is very hard to replicate” Brennan predicted that the portion of Chinese investment into Hong Kong compared to international capital flowing into Hong Kong “is likely to increase over the coming decade.”

“International investors are increasingly wary of being caught in the crossfire in Hong Kong as Beijing tightens its grip via the national security law and Western states counter with international sanctions” Brennan said.

Alfred Wu associate professor at the National University of Singapore specializing in Chinese politics said companies are now forced to choose between moving their offices to mainland China which would shift more of their business toward China or shifting their offices overseas. He also said companies might choose to move their offices to mainland China because Hong Kong’s advantage derived from rule of law is now fading.

Earlier this year major commercial bank HSBC announced plans to start an office in China’s Greater Bay Area – China’s effort to link Hong Kong Macao Guangzhou and several other cities as a unified business hub – after the Asia chief signed a petition in support of the national security law in June last year.

“These implications can be boiled down to the fact that Hong Kong’s financial status has been jeopardized. In the future the city will likely become China’s financial center instead of an international hub” said Wu.

Brennan added that the city’s rule of law was Hong Kong’s traditional competitive edge over its rivals but the recent erosion will “likely induce some international companies to move their regional hubs to alternative commercial centers such as Shanghai or Singapore.”

China’s support of Hong Kong’s capital flow between Hong Kong and China might keep the city afloat as a domestic financial hub “as a means to increase its control over the territory” said Brennan.

Yueng said that both domestic and international corporations will “reconsider their options of HQ locations so as to control their exposure to political and legal risks.”

“Hong Kong has always played and capitalized on its role as the middleman between the East and West. If it becomes ‘One Country One System’ in Hong Kong I do not think Hong Kong will continue to be appealing to international corporations.

“They can choose any major cities in China notably Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Shenzhen to be their regional HQs especially if China is their target market.”

Hong Kong might still have a role to play as a financial gateway to China if there are still restrictions on movement of capital in the mainland Yueng added.

Wu added that Hong Kong can still be an appealing location for money laundering from mainland China’s wealthy families and corrupted officials despite losing its international luster.

“But now Hong Kong is very much a part of China in terms of jurisdiction. If China steps up its anti-corruption campaign it can affect Hong Kong so money and talents might also switch to Singapore” Wu said.

The group’s Aug. 15 event which awed guests with the tremendous collection of classic cars and memorabilia in the private collection raised more than $75000.

There were 120 or so beautiful vintage cars a stunning collection that included makes and models from mob mobiles to muscle cars. The Americana memorabilia was also spectacular. It included a bevy of items from bygone eras: radios clocks early tiny screened televisions beautiful art deco pieces vintage furniture-radios most of which we’ve only seen in old-time movies.

It was a memorable experience.

In keeping with the milieu the event also featured roller-skating waitresses decked out in 1940s-era frocks and hairdos.

As guests perused the silent auction items the skaters passed trays of delectable hors d’oeuvres and beverages and were on the ready throughout the evening. The ice cream stand was very popular as was the beverage bar. A scrumptious “period” menu was delicious and was served on checkered tablecloths with car motif centerpieces (created by members). The menu choice was meatloaf or fried chicken with peach dessert. Delightful music kept the energy flowing.

Stramski Center Medical Director Dr. Gary Feldman expressed appreciation of the audience and spoke of the extraordinary needs of the children with developmental delays behavioral and learning challenges and other special needs. He stressed the importance of the support of the Steel Magnolias.

Dynamic Randy Gordon meanwhile coaxed more than $34000 from the exuberant crowd as auctioneer.

Susan Hill was determined to win the bid for a weekend getaway in Monterrey. Linda and Allen Rahn had the high bid for the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach package. Judy and Don Black along with Barbara and Ned Gaylord will share a fabulous party at Keesal Young & Logan. Tickets to USC vs UCLA athletic competitions were snapped up by John and Liz Krummell and Katherine Bowser.

Some would say Randy saved the best for last: An adorable 9-week-old Micro Golden Doodle named Maggie (for Steel Magnolias) went home with Anne Emigh and her granddaughter Madi who made the winning bid for Maggie’s heart during the very lively bidding competition.

The silent auction highlights meanwhile included “Driving the Coast” an original painting created by Dr. Pal from the Stramski Center going to event chair Bobbie Fesler and the Magnolia Golf Tournament (on Oct. 25) package getting snapped up by Craig Vansickle.

Sugarbush Resort in Vermont is preparing for a busy winter season but looming over the effort to host hundreds of guests is the need to ramp up hiring – both domestic and foreign.

Coming out of the winter months employers prepared for staff to return and gear up for the busy summer season as tourists headed to beach towns amusement parks and resorts after a devastating year. Instead some workers opted not to return bringing the labor shortage across the US into clear focus.

“There’s a newer sense of urgency about this” said Neil Bradley executive vice president and chief policy officer and head of strategic advocacy at the US Chamber of Commerce. “It was a problem pre-pandemic. It’s a crisis now that we’re coming out of the pandemic.”

Resorts looking toward the winter season took notice.

In recent weeks Sugarbush announced raising the minimum wage and expanding benefits to attract American workers. Even so the resort will still have to supplement its workforce with people from overseas a process that’s been bogged down by backlogs resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and increasing demand.

“One of the struggles right now is this whole process is crawling a little bit more either because embassies are shut down or limited hours limited staffing” said John Bleh public relations and communications manager at Sugarbush. “This whole process has been backed up.”

The process for employers to obtain visas to bring in workers from abroad is already long and cumbersome and requires extensive planning. For one there’s a limited number of temporary worker visas split between seasons – spring and summer and fall and winter – and it can be pricey.

The arduous process met with increased demand for foreign workers is posing a challenge for employers seeking to bolster their workforce.

“Our immigration system is so outdated and so unresponsive to the needs of the 21st century it’s literally doing economic damage to our country” said Charles Kuck an immigration attorney based in Atlanta who has been fielding numerous calls from employers trying to obtain guest-worker visas. “I think employers are realizing ‘I’m not going to get these people back.’”

Ski resorts have relied on foreign workers before. In December 2019 a survey of 137 ski areas revealed that nearly 52% of those areas used some sort of foreign labor according to the National Ski Areas Association. The most common visas were J-1s which provide short-term visas to students for example and H-2Bs for temporary nonagricultural workers.

But this year slow processing and possible vaccine requirements are making obtaining those visas more difficult.

“It’s an enormous challenge for us given the fluidity of the Covid situation and vaccine situation” said Dave Byrd director of risk and regulatory affairs at the National Ski Areas Association.

Ski resorts have been trying to staff up with American workers but are running into hurdles like housing costs exacerbated by the pandemic demand for labor and rising wages Byrd added.

The H-2B visa allows employers to bring foreign workers to the United States for temporary non-agricultural jobs such as landscaping hospitality and other industries. Congress sets a cap for the number of visas allowed per fiscal year. Currently that cap stands at 66000 with 33000 for workers starting employment October 1 to March 31 and 33000 for those employed April 1 to September 30.

“It’s a race for those 33000 visas” said Jeff Joseph an immigration attorney based in Colorado.

“More employers are filing than in the past and that’s directly related to unemployment. Where they may have found more workers in the past there’s a struggle” he added noting that obtaining a visa is an extensive process and not an easy or simple alternative for those seeking employees.

Acknowledging increased labor demands the Department of Homeland Security announced in April it would make an additional 22000 temporary non-agricultural worker visas available.

“The H-2B program is designed to help U.S. employers fill temporary seasonal jobs while safeguarding the livelihoods of American workers” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in a statement at the time. American businesses that rely on the program during the summer months expressed a need for more temporary guest workers according to DHS.

The scramble for workers extends to a host of industries like the construction sector which lost more than a million workers when the industry shut down temporarily during the pandemic. While the industry has since recouped an overwhelming part of its workforce it was still below pre-pandemic levels as of June.

Businesses across the board are taking steps to attract more workers. Companies such as Under Armour Amazon and Walmart have raised their minimum wage – and smaller businesses are also offering incentives.

That’s the hope for Sugarbush which is rolling out its own set of incentives as it prepares for busy winter months ahead.

“We’ve had trouble hiring people and we feel this is hopefully a good way to get people into the workforce for us” Bleh said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZW9wbGUtdGhpbmstc2hhbmctY2hpLWZpZ2h0LTAwNTE0MjIwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People Think The “Shang-Chi” Fight Scenes Appear To Be Inspired By Jackie Chan Movies — And That's Because ...,"Jackie Chan is a legend full stop. But he's especially a legend when it comes to stunts.

Just...check the stats. Gareth Cattermole / Getty Images

almost literally We all know that the actor and martial artist performs his own stunts only using stunt doubles when absolutely necessary — so much so that he currently holds the Guinness World Record for most stunts completed by a living actor. Oh and let's not forget how many times he's died while performing his absolutely mind-boggling action sequences.

Some of his most famous stunts include intricate choreography and the hilarious usage of props — whether that be furniture (like in Rush Hour 2 ) or ladders and construction equipment (like in First Strike ).

The clip (which is incredible and demands to be watched) features Simu's character fighting with the help of his (fashionable and reversible) varsity-style jacket. He deftly takes it half off to punch a bad guy and in the next instant puts it back on to resume his attack.

That use of a jacket? We've seen it before in Jackie's 1995 film Rumble in the Bronx. In the clip you can see Jackie use his jacket in a similar way twisting it and letting it hang on his arms halfway to fight off an enemy.

Well it turns out that was no mere coincidence! Members of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team — a group of martial artists and stuntmen — were involved in coordinating the majority of the stunts in Shang-Chi.

@marvel_shots Bro got the Jackie Chan flair 04:53 PM - 20 Aug 2021

Speaking to Fandango recently director Destin Daniel Cretton shared that the movie is heavily inspired by kung-fu classics and in his words ""every Jackie Chan movie ever made."" He continued ""We watched a lot of these classic movies to make sure that we were paying proper respect to them and to the long history of martial arts and kung-fu movies that came before us.""

For those comparing this SHANG-CHI fight to Jackie Chan's work remember that it was choreographed by Chan's protégé and stunt team leader Brad Allan. He was a genius at designing fights who always acknowledged Chan's influence. And he left us too soon. We miss you Brad. https://t.co/pIpkPHGwOB 04:15 PM - 21 Aug 2021

Some even joked that Jackie could single-handedly take on Thanos and I 100% believe it.

@mofromyt @marvel_shots Jacket Chan would’ve saved all of New York and beat Loki with just his jacket. He’d need a ladder for Thanos though. 05:35 PM - 20 Aug 2021

Some 300 top players at Endeavor — which owns Ultimate Fighting Championship and the Miss Universe Pageant in addition to the powerful WME and IMG talent agencies — were told just before Endeavor’s initial public offering in April that their stock options were worthless sources told The Post.

The shocking news came on a conference call with company president Mark Shapiro who told the agents and executives that their Endeavor options were severely “underwater” according to a source with direct knowledge of the call.

According to sources Shapiro left out the fact that employees’ options had been diluted well below the company’s stock price not only because of the pandemic that hammered Endeavor’s business but also a massive trove of stock awards that had been granted to Emanuel the fast-talking Hollywood dealmaker whose brash style was the inspiration for the Ari Gold character on HBO’s “Entourage.”

Adding insult to outrage Shapiro claimed that while Endeavor could have chosen to make employees’ options obsolete he and the firm’s other top executives had devised a plan to make them whole since they were “good guys” the source bitterly recalled.

Stunned staffers then received entirely new stock options that they learned through an online portal came with harder-to-reach strike prices and longer vesting periods sources said. Indeed some said stock that had already vested got replaced with unvested options.

Endeavor declined to comment.

“Nobody is happy. There’s a lot of complaining” one employee told The Post. “They cut my equity from what I was told when I got it but it doesn’t look like Ari was cut.”

Adding to the upheaval employees who raised a fuss walked away with better terms sources said — pointing to an agent who allegedly bragged about having finagled a one-time bonus of over $200000 after complaining to management about his new stock terms.

“Everything here is bespoke” said a source adding that it’s the company’s culture to reward people for “making noise.”

“Whoever yells the loudest and whoever they’re most worried about leaving that day or that month will likely get something” the source said.

The company behind the WME talent agency which represents A-list clients like Christian Bale Gal Gadot and Matt Damon moved forward with its IPO plans this year after a failed attempt in 2019. The April launch came despite the company having been left weakened by the pandemic which slammed the brakes on Hollywood production and live events.

Emanuel and his partners Patrick Whitesell and Shapiro pulled off the IPO by cutting a deal at the same time to buy 100 percent of mixed martial arts company UFC of which Endeavor already owned half and whose business has boomed through the pandemic. Endeavor sold 21 million shares to investors at $24 each on April 29 raising $511 million.

Since the debut Endeavor’s stock has since hovered mostly in the $25 range hitting a high of $31.95 in May and a low of $23.17 in June. On Friday it closed at $24.99.

According to a source close to the situation Emanuel owns roughly 30 million Endeavor shares — a cache worth $735 million at current market prices. Emanuel’s only barriers to selling include an IPO lockup period that expires at the end of this year as well as the vesting of 4.1 million stock options he received in the year or so leading up to the IPO according to sources and regulatory filings.

5 Endeavor which owns the Miss Universe Pageant issued stockholding employees new stock with harder-to-reach strike prices and longer vesting periods. AP

Those 4.1 million options alone slated to vest in three tranches by the end of 2023 will make Emanuel eligible to reap a $100 million windfall if Endeavor’s stock keeps its value until then. Meanwhile roughly 80 percent of his total holdings carry no such restrictions enabling him to cash in when he likes.

“Ari basically made himself whole by issuing himself a ton of UFC equity in the last 12 months when no one else was getting much stock and then those units converted to a huge amount of Endeavor equity” a source said. “No one else’s slice of the pie got bigger.”

While some 150 Endeavor executives who joined the company before 2014 appear to be getting bonuses in line with what they were promised in dollars some groused they were half what they should have been given the company’s growth. Meanwhile another 150 executives hired after 2014 saw their bonuses slashed to as little as a quarter of what they’d been promised

“The stock has to go up a lot before I get what was agreed when I signed on” one insider kvetched.

5 Employees complained that Emanuel (far left) and Whitesell (center left) were responsible for some Endeavor stock dilution over the years. Getty

It’s unusual for a company to IPO with underwater shares. But when it does particularly through a complex merger it results in “tricky” calculations that can upset and confuse people said compensation expert James Reda.

“What the company has to be really concerned about is making sure everybody is getting treated the same”… and that the “top people” are not “bending the rules” to benefit themselves he said.

Questions surfaced in 2017 when Emanuel and Whitesell sold $165 million in closely held Endeavor stock — and were later rewarded with $100 million each in replacement stock at the company’s expense diluting other shareholders according to securities filings.

As Endeavor announced a restructuring in March 2020 that resulted in more than 1000 layoffs during the pandemic Emanuel said he would not take a salary that year. Nevertheless he collected a $1.2 million bonus for the first three months of the year and managed to grab his full bonus of $5.8 million for what Endeavor’s S-1 filing called “his leadership and contributions through the COVID-19 disruption.”

Whitesell got a $2 million bonus while Shapiro scooped up a $1.6 million bonus Chief Financial Officer Jason Lublin grabbed a $1.4 million bonus and Chief Legal Officer Seth Krauss raked in $2.4 million.

By contrast sources said most of Endeavor’s roughly 5700 employees without stock options — who weathered layoffs furloughs and pay cuts with many of them working overtime ahead of the company’s IPO — were given $500 Visa gift cards after the launch.",,,

(WCTV) - Thomasville Police responded to a report of a man attacking Walmart customers with a machete Sunday night according to a Facebook post from the agency.

Police have identified the suspect as Malik Thomas.

According to the report a man attacked a woman with a machete injuring her arm. Other shoppers allegedly intervened containing the suspect until law enforcement arrived.

A man who calls himself the ""vaccine police"" entered a Walmart in Springfield Missouri to put staff ""on public notice"" telling pharmacists they could be ""executed"" if they carry out COVID-19 vaccine shots according to reports.

The man identified as Christopher Key an anti-vaxxer from Alabama live-streamed the confrontation on Facebook last week on August 16 according to the Springfield News-Leader.

The video shows Key and a handful of supporters praying in the parking lot of the supercenter before entering. During the prayer a person could be heard saying: ""Thank you Lord Jesus for waking up Springfield"" and ""help us put the fear of God in these pharmacists.""

""Okay guys this is the vaccine police. We're outside of Walmart about to go in. We're going to put Walmart and the pharmacists on notice to let them know that there in violation of the Nuremberg Code"" Key said in the 30-minute live stream.

He continued: ""We're going to let them know that 45000 people within three days of receiving the vaccine dropped dead. And if they give one more vaccine after today after being put on notice then they can be hung up and they can be executed.""

In the video as the group walks towards the pharmacy staff members are seen locking up and placing a ""No Pharmacist on Duty"" sign on the door. A local resident told the News-Leader that they had warned the staff ahead of Key's arrival after seeing his plan online to show up.

""I'm not trying to give you any fear and intimidation"" Key told a staff member in the video. ""I'm just letting you guys know that if you continue to do this that you guys will be held accountable.""

Key spewed multiple baseless claims in the video stating that more than 40000 people died in three days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Towards the end of the video the group walks out of the store and Key told a police officer outside that the pharmacists shut the door ""when all I wanted to do was get the vaccine"" ranting that it's ""discrimination.""

The Washington Post reported that Key also went to a CVS and Walgreens that same day. According to the Post he has made false medical claims in the past.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the vaccine is an effective tool to help combat COVID-19. The CDC said those who are fully vaccinated may experience a ""breakthrough case."" Still a small percentage will be hospitalized die or suffer illness due to the virus.

Missouri has experienced a heavy surge of COVID-19 throughout the summer as the Delta variant spread throughout the country. Local news reported that hospitals in the state have seen over 600 patients in ICUs since July 30. Data shows that only 43% of the population in Missouri are fully vaccinated as of Friday.

With Disney World being the size of San Francisco there is plenty of room to place things that may not be in use. In the past we have talked about the now-abandoned airport that was active on the property for a few years. There has also been an entire water park River Country that was empty for many years and before Disney’s Art of Animation was built the space was home to what many Guests called a “ghost hotel” as it was abandoned during construction.

Now it seems that Walt Disney’s personal airplane the Grumman G-159 Gulfstream 1 which Walt used to travel between Burbank and Orlando is looking rather unattended to as well. Walt’s airplane currently sits in a service area north of Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

In a recent snapshot from photographer Bioreconstruct (@bioreconstruct) we can see that the cover on the plane is starting to come apart which could be caused by water pooling in the aircraft casing.

Aerial look at Walt’s plane in a service area of Walt Disney World. Seems like part of the tail is exposed and rain could be collecting inside if plastic is well-sealed below. @WDWGuestService could you pass this report along to appropriate maintenance to check on conditions?

Hopefully the exposed area of the covering has not caused any damage to the plane’s exterior. Personally I would love to see this plane used in one of the Disney World Parks considering the historical significance that it holds. It almost seems wrong not to have the plane in an area that Guests can look at!

Theme Park Architect (@ParkArchitect) responded to the Tweet with an interesting update on why the plane was moved and why it has not moved since.

It was repainted when we started the DHS expansion and at one point it was planned for relocation to Glendale but no one wanted to fund the shipping cost. Disney optioned it to Florida air museums but no takers. The inside is gutted. This is where it landed (pun intended).

For now it seems that the plane will remain in its current location for the foreseeable future.

In April 2020 Disney released a recipe for Dole Whip which requires only pineapple chunks vanilla ice cream and pineapple juice.

The pineapple Dole Whip served at Disney parks however is listed in Disney World's guide to plant-based dining meaning it's made without dairy.

According to Disney Food Blog the version shared by Disney is a suitable at-home substitute though it's not the true vegan and gluten-free pineapple soft serve you can get at Disney.

Fans can also buy the official Dole Pineapple Soft Serve Mix on Amazon. The only other ingredient required is cold water and you will need a soft-serve ice cream maker.

The treasures inside also include items from Solo and Rogue One and with both of those films sat near the era of both Kenobi and Cassian Andor there’s always the chance some of these props could once again see the light of day.

The Walt Disney Archives recently received multiple large trailers full of significant props—more than 3000 actually—from the most recent Star Wars films beginning with 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens and including The Last Jedi The Rise of Skywalker Rogue One and Solo. “The containers are full of costumes props and set decorations that were actually used during pre-production and filming and the vast majority appear on screen” says Rick Lorentz acquisitions manager Walt Disney Archives. “Among the collection are a full-size X-wing starfighter an A-wing and the cockpit set of the Millennium Falcon.” Aside from the films most of these items have rarely—if ever—been seen aside from the occasional Star Wars Celebration or D23 Expo. The 2019 D23 Expo featured an impressive retrospective called “The Evolution of the Stormtrooper” which included the wildly popular Sith stormtrooper featured in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker the final film in the Skywalker saga.

Keeping track of this otherworldly collection and making sure it safely arrives at its new home at the Walt Disney Archives is not an easy task. And with Dok-Ondar busy tending to his own collectibles and creatures in his Den of Antiquities at Black Spire Outpost (part of the Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge lands at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts) the job of overseeing this collection transition falls on Madlyn Moskowitz the Lucasfilm collections & exhibitions archivist. As custodian of the stolen plans er… Star Wars props artifacts and costumes Moskowitz is herself also making the journey from a galaxy far far away to join the Walt Disney Archives. “I’m very excited to join” she says. “I’ll be part of the research team working directly with Kevin Kern. I’ll be a good point of contact for all things Lucasfilm.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2Rlc2lnbi93YWx0LWRpc25leS1yb3ktZmlyc3QtbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtaG9tZdIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2Rlc2lnbi93YWx0LWRpc25leS1yb3ktZmlyc3QtbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtaG9tZT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restoration Underway on Walt and Roy Disney's First Los Angeles Home,"In 1923 a young man ventured west to seek his fortune — specifically to Los Angeles where his brother was already living. It’s a familiar enough narrative but most young men seeking their fortune are not Walt Disney. Still Walt at 21 wasn’t far removed from many other young people looking for a job then or now which in this case involved staying with family members while getting on his feet.



Walt Disney and his brother Roy ended up staying with their aunt and uncle at 4406 Kingswell Avenue. An article at Frommer’s offers some specifics about the home including that it was built in 1914 in Los Feliz. Walt lived and worked there spending time creating animation in a shed behind the Craftsman house.



Ever since then the house has held a significant place in Disney lore even as its ownership has changed hands over the years. (Along the way it evaded being demolished.) Now however the house where a storied animation career came to fruition is in the process of being renovated according to a new report at Deadline.

The article doesn’t offer many details about the renovation only that the house has been designated a Los Angeles Historical Cultural Monument and that the effort will “restore the house to its 1914 Craftsman bungalow standards.”

Suffice it to say Disney fans will have yet another stop to add to their California trips."

The next project NetherRealm Studios is currently hard at work at is still a complete mystery to the public but ongoing questions on the business side of things may be pushing their hand in one direction.

Specifically the Chicago-based development studio may be prioritizing a new Mortal Kombat sequel over a third Injustice title due to the uncertainties brought about by the Warner Bros. and Discovery merger.

Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb recently stated in a video he'd been hearing these revelations from his sources even if the company isn't in immediate danger of being sold off.

""It lines up with the reality and it lines up with what I've heard where Mortal Kombat 12 would make the most sense because that's a game they know will make money. It will sell well"" said Grubb. ""Mortal Kombat 11 was great. it's doing well but if you come out with Mortal Kombat 12 it will also sell and do well.""

Rumors began to circulate in 2020 that AT&T was looking to sell off WB's games division NRS included to help reduce the corporation's debt.

That never came to pass however as the telecommunications giant instead formed a merger agreement with Discovery to essentially combine them together with Warner Media.

The early announcement of this deal led to further rumors and reports that documents showed some of the video game studios would not be included in the merger leaving NetherRealm still under the AT&T umbrella or shopped around to a new home.

It continued to grow to a point where a WB Games representative had to release a statement to affirm that the makers of Mortal Kombat would remain with them through the merger.

Though they may not be for sale at this moment the credible sources reporting the rumors suggests those talks were at least on the table so it would make sense that NRS would still be wary of their fate in the coming months and years.

Injustice being owned by DC Comics and WB could present a licensing problem if the developers were to be spun off in the middle of production or after release but Mortal Kombat as their own creation would still give them control over their own plans.

These uncertainties could have also very well factored into the six months of silence Mortal Kombat 11 faced before NRS suddenly announced their soon to be best selling title ever would be receiving no more development support.

This is all somewhat under the assumption that their next project in development would be either of those properties which a good bit of evidence suggests that it's not.

Earlier this summer an industry insider claimed that the next game to come out of NetherRealm would actually be a fighting game based on Marvel Comics who are generally viewed as the direct competitors of DC Comics.

NRS Creative Director Ed Boon himself even stated back in May 2020 they ""have other stuff in the oven"" but obviously he didn't extrapolate further on what that could be.

Since they opened in 2010 NetherRealm has only really worked on Mortal Kombat and Injustice titles on rotation so it would also make sense they'd want to try branching out to something different for a change.

At this rate however fans will still likely be waiting a year or perhaps even longer to learn exactly what Boon and company have up their sleeves next.

Injustice fans may want to begin bracing themselves though that their game may not be next in line like the previous release patters would suggest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcncuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvc2hvd3MvdGhlLWJ1c2luZXNzL3NwYWNlLWphbS1qZWZmLWJlcmdtYW4vdm9pY2UtYWN0b3ItYnVncy1idW5uedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Bergman on voicing some 200 characters from Bugs Bunny to Trump: 'There's so much you have to consider',"In “Space Jam: A New Legacy” LeBron James finds himself turned into a cartoon and forced to play a high-stakes basketball game. At first the only one in the entire Warner Bros. universe willing to help him put together a team is a famous carrot-munching rascally rabbit.

Jeff Bergman was the first person to voice Bugs Bunny after the death of Mel Blanc — known as the man of a thousand voices. Bergman doesn’t have quite that many but he does scores of characters for Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera.

Bergman also performs Sylvester the Cat Yosemite Sam Yogi Bear and Fred Flintstone in the new “Space Jam” film. And in Stephen Colbert's “Our Cartoon President” on Showtime he did the voices for both Trump and Biden.





He tells KCRW about how as a college student he had a fateful meeting with Blanc that set him on this career path. He also discusses the intense casting process for “Space Jam: A New Legacy” and then learning he got the part of Bugs Bunny in March 2020 just days before going into pandemic shutdown. He ended up recording the entire movie remotely.

Reflecting on the many auditions he did for the new “Space Jam” movie Bergman explains that most people probably don’t realize how much goes into a strong voice acting performance.

“A lot of people can muster up a line to mimic” Bergman says. “But when somebody gives you a line that you’ve never read before and then they give you a direction that you didn’t think about when you were preparing for the line you really have to have a sense of who that character is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3Bpbm9mZi5jby5uei9zb2NpZXR5LzIyLTA4LTIwMjEvYS1icmllZi1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLXRoZS1odW1pbGlhdGluZy1wbGFjZXMtaS1oYXZlLWZhbGxlbi1hc2xlZXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A brief history of the humiliating places I have fallen asleep,"Sleep Week: Duncan Greive attempts to count the ways and places he has inappropriately nodded off.

The Spinoff has been tossing and turning through a range of perspectives on sleep – read more Sleep Week content here.

My parents told me I was such a poor and light sleeper that it’s a miracle my younger sister ever made it onto this earth. Too much energy howling through the night a thoroughly unlikeable baby and toddler. Plus ça change.

What followed was a decade or so where I was basically “normal”. I slept at night. It wasn’t difficult. I did typical teen lie-ins nothing extravagant. Certainly my now 20-year-old daughter who could pull 12 hour shifts with ease put me to shame. But something happened in my late teens that radically transformed my relationship with sleep and it hasn’t ever recovered.

Put simply I started to find sleeping at night extremely difficult. I would rest very lightly waking at the slightest disturbance with a major convulsion and a sense of terror. Sometimes anchored in real-life stresses just as often non-specific. As far as I can tell this is not common but not unknown – a significant number of my friends report a basically horrible relationship with sleep often coinciding with the arrival of children. Others like my colleague Mad Chapman can do it anywhere for as long as they like and it’s the waking that’s the problem. I struggle to sympathise.

What seems less common than bad sleeping is the corollary I’ve developed: the absolutely overwhelming and irresistible onset of sleep in entirely inappropriate scenarios. This is something which has persistently plagued me from my late teens to the present day. What follows is a brief (and necessarily incomplete) survey of places I have fallen asleep over the past 20 or so years.

Concerts

This is where it all began in some ways. In my early 20s I was a young father working as a postie (5am starts very physical work six days a week) and also desperate to be a music writer (late nights reviewing gigs for Real Groove RIP). Very good preconditions for falling asleep at the wrong time in the wrong place.

More commonly it was noisy guitar bands which got the nod out. Mogwai and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion both at the Power Station both wildly loud both had me slumped by the end. Probably the most notable was The Dead C Port Chalmers noise monsters playing a hugely anticipated early ‘00s Kings Arms set. I had to be awoken after falling asleep – against a speaker. Looking back some shows I reviewed with incomplete information. I still stand by my verdicts.

Higher learning

It’s hard to know where the line is between “entirely acceptable place to sleep” and “you absolute freak” in tertiary education. All those young people still growing learning how to feed and water themselves burning the candle at both ends often away from home for the first time – it’s unsurprising that sleep creeps up in odd places. Of course I slept in lectures. Who hasn’t? But tutorials tend to be a different animal.

During my first year in some long-forgotten sociology paper I was in a tutorial with about 10 people. We were discussing some theory and taking turns to give our interpretation on it and I was in the brutal race against time. I had nothing of consequence to say obviously and I could feel sleep’s hands on my shoulders hauling me back. Just before it was my time to speak I succumbed. I awoke to a room of faces on a spectrum between confused and aghast.

I mumbled grabbed my bags and left never to return. I did not pass.

Comedy & theatre

I’ve been a critic longer than I’ve been any other type of writer and while pop music is easily the form I’ve written most about I’ve also engaged with and been a fan of live comedy and even indie theatre for periods. There’s a natural roll from the wildness of live music in rough venues in your teens and twenties into seated and staged productions in your thirties. The act of admitting this would have disgusted my young self but it also happens to be true.

It’s also true that the venues for these performances tend to be all of the following: dark warm low ventilation the audience gets to sit and watch and not move around or talk for long periods – all strong predictors of me falling asleep at any time of the day or night. There’s probably no venue I have a higher hit rate for sleeping in than The Basement Auckland’s subterranean delight. I used to try and cram three shows into a night during the comedy festival and almost always fell asleep during the third (often kicking off at 10pm) and sometimes the second if it was dull. The only third show I know for sure I was awake right through was Chris Parker and Tom Sainsbury’s incandescent Camping which is why I still believe it’s maybe the best thing I’ve seen in that perfect venue (perfect for everything but my mind-body).

I’ve also fallen asleep at many bigger budget productions which is basically fine. The funniest and most-embarrassing part for my wife who often has had the misfortune to accompany me to these things is that grand old theatres were designed for shorter humans than me and the stalls’ seats tend to have no headrest. So she’s had to sit quietly while my head slowly tips backwards at The Book of Mormon (people say it’s good I couldn’t possibly comment) and John Cleese (falling asleep is my review and I stand by it).

Professional life

Standards are changing fast in 2021 and falling asleep while wfh is basically mandated. But some situations are still inviolate. A friend shared The Spinoff’s downtown offices with his now very successful parking startup when both our orgs were just little babies. He had a hugely important pitch to prospective investors in our “boardroom” (more accurately described as just a room).

The offices were already on the wrong side of the grungy/dilapidated divide and he was naturally nervous as hell about the stakes involved. My contribution was to fall asleep during the financial projections (which being fair to me are an exercise in pure fantasy at that point in a company’s lifecycle). He was not thrilled with me afterwards but they closed the round so it’s fine.

I have since nodded out during important pitches to our own clients (again airless rooms and not talking) particularly when they have the gall to book them after lunch. Sleep is inextricably linked to my metabolism and if I’ve had any kind of carb intake then it’s over. This also explains (without excusing) a consistent habit of falling asleep at conferences. At one in Sydney a couple of years ago my colleagues had to consistently nudge me awake from as early as 10am (the jetlag really got me) to the point where I stopped eating breakfast and started pouring even more black coffee than usual down my throat.

No dice – a whole room full of 50-odd media people I was desperate to impress saw me nodded out in a plastic chair while a world expert lectured us on something I really really needed to know.

Life

Outside of the above contexts is everything else. Falling asleep on a couch at home is time-honoured dad stuff they’ll never take that away from us. I did it so frequently that my wife began cataloguing the instances on Instagram in both stills and moving images the latter often culminating in one of my daughters waking me up with a start and me swearing. Eventually my sister-in-law – who cruelly but accurately made the side-by-side of me and Mr Bean – compiled these into a short book pictured above.

Other places I have slept were less routine. We had a mid-afternoon obstetrician’s appointment for my second daughter. The wait had been relatively long and the waiting room pleasantly warm. I could sense I was in trouble – I always know when it’s coming but feel powerless to resist especially in spaces where a particular standard of behaviour is expected. We were eventually called and the doctor things happened. About 10 minutes in I started nodding out over and over much to the disgust of the medical professional involved. I remain acutely mortified about that one.

For all the hundreds of humdrum and embarrassing sleep incidents which have plagued my life and the lives of my friends and family the one I think about the most is the one which almost ended it. It combines many of the elements above and yet it’s quite different. It was the early ’00s and I was still in my postie prime. It had been a long shift stretching well into the afternoon. As was my custom after a long day biking mail up the long harshly pitched hills of Remuera I stopped in at Foodtown Greenlane for my daily treat: a pesto and cheese pullapart $2.99. I ate it all.

Then I hit the Southern motorway headed for Manurewa where my then-partner and daughter were visiting whānau. The nod came on very fast but I was trapped on the motorway and almost at my destination. I gave in. All of a sudden there was a huge screech of metal on concrete as I hit the median barrier and bounced off into mid-afternoon traffic. By sheer unaccountable luck I skated across three lanes and ended up on the Hill Road off-ramp. I pulled over shaking and sweating but mercifully unharmed. After a few minutes I tried to restart the car and discovered that it was done with all that.

I wandered up the road and borrowed a phone and eventually I was scooped up. The loss of the car was the bigger deal at the time but with more distance I now dwell upon just how unlikely it was that I walked away from that incident. Now when I feel the first breath of sleep on me at the wheel I pull over and trade driving do star jumps or just have a good old-fashioned nap. A hot car on an afternoon with nowhere to be is about as good a place to sleep as I could hope for. Certainly much better than in bed at night which continues to be the place it most infuriatingly evades me.

The studio has generally alternated between Injustice and Mortal Kombat games leading some to speculate that Injustice 3 could be next up but there have also been reports of a Marvel vs DC game being the studio’s next project.

According to journalist Jeff Grubb however neither of those two is in the pipeline right now. During a recent episode of GrubbSnax for Giant Bomb Grubb claimed that given NetherRealm’s shaky future within Warner Bros. right now and the shaky future of WB Games as a whole it wouldn’t make sense for the developer to be working on a game that would require licensed characters especially if NetherRealm is sold off in the coming year or so. Grubb says that based on what he’s heard Mortal Kombat 12 is the game NetherRealm is working on next with WB Games being confident in the game’s prospects.

Reports of WB Games’ internal studios getting sold off – which includes the likes of NetherRealm Rocksteady Monolith Productions and more – have been doing the rounds since earlier this year what with the Discovery and AT&T merger bringing Warner Bros’ future in the industry in doubt. In June Warner Bros. said that rumours of NetherRealm Studios being sold off were inaccurate.

Warner Bros. has said that its internal studios are going to focus on making games based on their own properties so an Injustice game developed by NetherRealm would actually fall in line with that- if the studio isn’t sold off that is. Then again given the incredible commercial and critical success Mortal Kombat 11 has enjoyed it wouldn’t be surprising to see them immediately moving on to another instalment in the series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nYW1pbmctbmV3cy9uZXRoZXJyZWFsbS1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXdvcmtpbmctb24tbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xMi1vdmVyLWluanVzdGljZS0zLTMwMjUzNjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NetherRealm reportedly working on 'Mortal Kombat 12' over 'Injustice 3',"NetherRealm Studios is reportedly working on Mortal Kombat 12 instead of Injustice 3 as the studio faces being separated from DC superhero licence holders Warner Bros Games.

Journalist Jeff Grubb – who has a good track history with leaks and insider information – has claimed that NetherRealm is working on creating Mortal Kombat 12 instead of Injustice 3. Speaking as part of a new Giant Bomb video Grubb stated the following:

“It lines up with the reality and it lines up with what I’ve heard where Mortal Kombat 12 would make the most sense because that’s a game they know will make money it will sell well…Mortal Kombat 11 was great it’s doing great but if you come out with Mortal Kombat 12 it will also sell and do well.” (Thanks VCG)

The studio is reportedly choosing to work on a new Mortal Kombat entry over another Injustice game due to Nether Realm’s uncertain relationship with WB Games – which holds licences for the characters used in the superhero fighting game.

Elaborating Grubb said prioritizing Mortal Kombat 12 over Injustice 3 means “you don’t have to use any of these Batman or Superman characters that might be tied up in licensing if you try to get rid of NetherRealm or sell it to whoever”.

Earlier in the year NetherRealm confirmed that the studio was moving to focus on an unannounced game and there would be no more DLC for Mortal Kombat 11.

The decision likely follows news that Warner Bros Games is reportedly being split up following a merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. A spokesperson for AT&T stated that “some of the gaming arm will stay with AT&T and some will go with the new company” however didn’t specify which studios would be leaving.

If true this means that licencing availability for the characters necessary to make Injustice 3 could be up in the air meaning Mortal Kombat 12 is the safer title to work on as uncertainty looms.

Public Services Commission. Development of the energy sector in the USVI has been problematic with the main challenge being the absence of comprehensive public policy and a sector development strategy.

The energy sector analysis being commissioned by the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority could go a long way towards addressing the afore-mentioned challenge. The objective of the analysis is to identify investment opportunities rather than prepare a sector development strategy but a rigorous analysis could provide the background for both efforts.

That said the proposed waste to energy proposal by one of the companies brought to mind the lack of public policy for waste management. A waste to energy strategy using solid waste necessitates making tradeoffs. Will a waste to energy business be financially viable if components of the waste stream are diverted for use in soil enhancement (for agriculture horticulture or landscaping) for production of paper products or for other uses? Was the proposal by the V.I. Waste Management Authority to make building blocks from solid waste scrapped? Has the USVI decided that it is unable to effect waste minimization at source through agreements with suppliers? A comprehensive waste management strategy would guide future investments ensuring that initiatives support USVI development goals.

Another aspect of any waste to energy proposal in the USVI that should be considered is the issue of ownership. It is here assumed that such a facility would be largely dependent on the local waste streams. In that case considering that the V.I. Waste Management Authority and the V.I. government are in dire financial straits any waste to energy facility should be partially owned by the V.I. Waste Management Authority.

No private company would be expected to give raw materials to another private company for free especially when producing the raw materials is costly. If the raw material for the waste to energy business is not purchased from the V.I. Waste Management Authority the government would be providing a substantial subsidy to the firm. It should also be as expected that the firm will apply for benefits under the government’s economic development incentive program. An alternative approach is a public private partnership.

The Government of the United States Virgin Islands has stated its receptivity to public private partnerships and a waste to energy business offers an opportunity to pursue such a strategy.

In fact if the government wants to diversify and grow the USVI economy it should consider establishing a waste to resource development firm through a public-private-civil society partnership as one mechanism for implementing Vision 2040.

With all the interest in blue economy green economy re-use economy circular economy and the various iterations thereof waste management offers a window to a strategy for creating enterprises that can grow the USVI economy.

Making good choices starts with sound public policy.

Until that moment the now 31-year-old had romanticised Australia. As a young engineering student in Brazil he had been working to develop methods to safely recycle old photovoltaic (PV) solar cells but when he tried to take it outside the lab he found himself hamstrung.

“There was no advanced processing in Brazil” Dias says. “It was only low-end processing manual separation shredding – the stuff you do with very little infrastructure or investment.

“Once I found that out I started looking for a geographically similar country that had a more advanced e-waste set-up.”

His search eventually led him to Australia which had operated a sophisticated recycling scheme called the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) since 2011 with the goal of stopping old cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions laptops and computer accessories going to landfill.

On paper the scheme was impressive but in application Dias found it amounted to a good logistical operation that was let down by a lack of follow-through.

“What I found slowly but surely is that Australia didn’t have any advanced processing either” Dias says. “You’re doing all this work you have all this legislation you have all this stuff set up to achieve the same thing we have in Brazil without legislation only because our [labour] market is cheaper.”

‘Set and forget’

To date the NTCRS has diverted 290000 tonnes of e-waste material from landfill but a series of loopholes a “set and forget” approach by government and “light-touch” regulation has allowed the system to suffer neglect.

With some estimates now forecasting that more than 100000 tonnes of solar panel waste will enter the country’s waste stream by 2035 what Australia does with its old gadgets and electrical equipment represents a new challenge the industry says needs to be dealt with quickly.

Dias says meeting that challenge means first understanding what went wrong – a question he spent 18 months trying to answer when he set out in April 2017 to visit every recycler in the country to see their operations.

Thanks to his persistence he managed to visit half of those working in Australia – usually after signing a non-disclosure agreement that has since lapsed. The others generally refused outright.

What he found was an industry that was opaque by design. At the apex sat four organisations known as “coregulatory arrangements” that liaised with product manufacturers who fund the scheme and deal directly with government.

These organisations were charged with monitoring the work of 31 recyclers operating at the time but these entities also sometimes doubled as recyclers themselves making for a confusing mess of overlapping obligations.

Crucially Australia had very little no “downstream capacity” to process these items after they had been dismantled. Once collected by the scheme items broken down into constituent parts – circuit boards plastic and glass – were until recently sent offshore.

With enough time this became a problem as due to the design of the scheme government regulators had no real direct oversight of the recyclers doing this work – a bug highlighted by a scathing Department of Environment and Energy review of the scheme in 2017.

“The frustrating thing is it could all be so much better” Dias says. “[The NTCRS] system is a good system. It could be so much better with just a few extra-tweaks – almost effortlessly better. The hard work is all there.”

‘E-waste mountains’

The long-running issues of traceability transparency and enforcement were colourfully illustrated in September 2017 when a group of investigators from the Basel Action Network (BAN) – a non-for-profit group that monitors compliance with the 1989 United Nations Basel Convention on the trade of hazardous wastes – attempted to learn where exactly Australia’s e-waste was going.

The group fitted 35 old CRT televisions LED monitors and printers with GPS devices of a special make. Out of this sample the team quickly focused on the fate of three LCD screens dropped at Officeworks storefronts around the Brisbane metro area.

Hayley Palmer BAN’s chief operating officer was on the team that followed where they went afterwards. As the signals left the country Palmer her nine-month-old and a colleague tracked the monitors to a warehouse in Hong Kong and then on to an illegal dump-yard in a rural part of Thailand where they talked their way inside.

“I remember being overwhelmed by the smell of burnt electronics” Palmer said. “The residue smells were still there despite how there was no evidence of anything happening at that moment.”

While the site was not in operation during their visit Palmer says it was indicative of other operations across south-east Asia where people desperate enough to work in unsafe conditions use toxic chemical processes to wash circuit boards for their precious metals and then burn what’s left.

Palmer says that since her investigation the focal point for the illegal e-waste trade has shifted from China after a government crackdown when photos of the “e-waste mountains” in Guiyi went global in 2016 scattering the industry’s operators across the region.

Since neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam have followed suit Pakistan has recently emerged as the final destination for the world’s e-waste.

The road to change

There have also been consequences for the lack of oversight closer to home.

In 2020 a stockpile of used lithium batteries caught fire at a recycling facility managed by e-waste recycling facility MRI in Campbellfield Victoria. The resulting blaze billowed toxic smoke and contaminated a nearby creek in the five hours it took 75 firefighters to bring it under control.

Since then environment regulators in Victoria have laid a total of 36 new charges against the company and its directors while authorities in New South Wales announced an investigation after they found nearly 200 tonnes of used batteries sitting in an MRI warehouse at Warwick Farm in Sydney’s west. MRI is understood to be defending the charges.

The company – which was once a major player in the industry but has since had its operating licence cancelled – was also dumped by Officeworks in 2019 in the wake of the BAN investigation. The retailer now works with the Australian New Zealand Recycling Platform (ANZRP).

When contacted by the Guardian a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment said it takes compliance with the NTCRS “very seriously” and has introduced several new measures to strengthen the scheme.

“The department has begun a new program of work that is focussed entirely on solutions for e-stewardship [and] e-waste” they said. “The recent cancelation of MRI PSO Pty Ltd is an example of the department’s strong response to serious non-compliance.”

ANZRP chief Warren Overton says renewed government interest in the industry over is positive but some feel things aren’t changing fast enough.

The ban means that while the circuit boards that contain precious metals can be exported the plastic and glass can’t without further processing.

In the last 18 months the federal government has concluded a review of the NTCRS established the $190m Recycling Modernisation Fund (RMF) and introduced a ban on the export of unprocessed plastic waste that came into effect on 1 July.

The ban means that while the circuit boards that contain precious metals can be exported the plastic and glass can’t without further processing.

“Recyclers are stockpiling [the plastic] at the moment” Overton says. “They’re trying to figure out is the ban really going to have an impact on their businesses? It is because there’s a decided lack of [domestic] capacity to take that plastic and process it.”

One area where Overton would like the government to move on quicker is expanding the scheme to include PV solar and other items not currently included like computer modems.

“The solar industry has been tracking this for 20 years so we know when these panels are going to come off the roof or out of solar farms” Overton says. “Federal and state governments know it’s an issue. They’ve got the numbers they know that in the next two-to-three years we’re going to be hit by a deluge of end-of-life solar panels.”

What is a problem to some also represents a significant commercial for the 45 plastic recycling projects currently being planned across the country that includes companies like the Singaporean-based eco-tech company Clean Earth Technologies.

The organisation’s chief commercialisation officer Mark Fowler says they are looking to build a recycling plant to process printed circuit boards in Adelaide by the end of the year.

“We’re looking to try and take a position with a clean technology and a clean process to recover those materials” Fowler said. “We can do this in a way that ensures nothing goes to landfill.”

The proposal relies on a new process invented by Flinders University chemist Justin Chalker that allows for precious metals to be extracted from circuit-boards without hazardous chemicals and for the residual plastic waste plastic to be combined with a “novel” polymer to create other products.

The goal Fowler says is to create a truly circular economy capable of turning abandoned iPhones into gold dead laptop motherboards into kitchen counter tops and solar panels into building blocks.

“Getting this right is important” Fowler says. “If we just let it go to landfill it’s a whole lot of human effort wasted. The amount of things you could create is whatever you could think up. There’s no limit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJpYWwtZmlyZS1ob2NrbGV5LXdhbGxlci1jb3VudHktZXZhY3VhdGlvbnMvMTA5NjYwNjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large industrial fire near Hockley prompts evacuations,"Large industrial fire near Hockley prompts evacuations

HOCKLEY Texas -- A large fire at an industrial facility ignited Saturday and firefighters from multiple agencies were on the scene as people were being warned to avoid the area.

It happened around 9:30 a.m. in the 17300 block of Premium Drive near Hockley at a recycling and waste facility just south of the Hockley Recreational Complex off Old Washington Road.

Firefighters from multiple departments were dispatched to a large building where thick smoke billowed into the sky and could be seen from a far as 15 miles away.

The fire began when steel drums fell over inside the facility that handles recycled plastics and other petrochemical materials according to Harris County Fire Marshal spokesperson Rachel Neutzler.

The fire at the waste management facility started around 9:30 a.m. Saturday and prompted authorities to order a half-mile radius evacuation.

The fire spread to other portions of the building and grew into a massive incident due in part to a lack of a water supply for firefighters. Dozens of tanker trucks were dispatched to unload water for the suppression efforts which were expected to continue for hours Saturday.

Neutzler said there were no specific details on the chemicals involved but said the substances believed to be used motor oil and plastics were part of the facility's mission to convert materials for recycling or incineration.

""It's a number of different chemicals but nothing stored in large amounts"" she said.

While the immediate threat didn't appear to be grave the evacuation order would remain in effect until crews could contain the incident and on-going air quality monitoring showed the air quality was safe.

No injuries were reported at the site Neutzler said.

The fire is at VLS Recovery Services a waste management company with two facilities in the area including a railcar cleaning facility and a solid waste processing facility.

As firefighters worked to contain the flames rail crews were also dispatched to move a group of rail cars out of the adjacent yard.

Two of his four pharmacies were shuttered because they were in medical clinics shut down by COVID-19. Revenue dropped by 25% across the entire business and Simenson was faced with the prospect laying off half of his employees.

Simenson contacted his banker about securing a forgivable loan from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. He was a long-time customer of one of the Twin Cities' ""big banks"" but it wouldn't help him. He declined to say which bank it was.

An employee referred him to Village Bank which has most of its locations in Anoka County. There banker Chris Schroepfer helped gather the requisite information from Simenson submitted the application and got the first of two $200000 loans funded within two weeks.

""Village Bank made it happen"" Simenson said. ""We also moved a loan to them from the other bank and they refinanced it at a significantly competitive rate.''

Goodrich employees doubled down on telehealth consultations and also got 16000 Anoka County residents vaccinated at no charge from nursing homes to homeless shelters.

Village Bank turned a government business-relief program into a growth strategy. And it's not the only community bank that disproportionately used PPP to take business from the likes of U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

Village Bremer Bank and Sunrise Banks as well as nonprofit community-based financial institutions such as Meda were aggressive in working overtime to assist customers and non-customers to get PPP funds of $50000. And the SBA last year and earlier this year gave preference for periods of time to small borrowers disproportionately female and minorities to get their loans processed.

""The SBA did a wonderful job and we invested and implemented quickly to do the best we could for those Main Street customers"" Aleesha Webb president of Village Bank said. ""We've now had time to work with them and the relationships are resulting in growth in assets. And revenue and income.""

The SBA paid a loan-origination fee to bankers that ranged from 5% for loans under $350000 to 1% for loans over $2 million. The bankers also got six-figure fees for loan processing.

Webb said Village Bank didn't make much money on the 827 PPP loans it originated because it invested in related software and paid workers for nights and weekends plus bonuses.

About 50% of the PPP loans that Village Bank made were to non-customers. And the financial benefits are starting to show according to bank and regulatory filings.

Village Bank started in 1993 by Chairman Don Kveton Webb's father earned $3.2 million in 2019 on assets of $302 million in 2019. Earnings were only $3.3 million on a 33% bigger asset base of $403 million last year. In the first six months of this year Village Bank already has earned $3.2 million on assets that ballooned to $428 million.

Village Bank has grown over two years from one of the 10 largest to one of the five-largest SBA lenders in Minnesota.

Meanwhile Bremer Bank the state's largest PPP lender with 7240 loans worth $1.27 billion has seen its results improve in 2021.

In the first six months of 2021 Bremer earned a strong 14.5% return on equity and net income was $102.3 million compared with $77.1 million in the first half of 2020.

CEO Jeanne Crain cited improved credit quality which allowed the bank to release some reserves taken last year into earnings and also the PPP.

Sunrise Banks the second-largest PPP lender in Minnesota according to iBanknet declined to discuss the impact of PPP on its results.

Regulators allowed community bankers to take on more loans through PPP than supported by their equity capital last year because it was an emergency and the government backed the loans.

The huge national banks have denied that they favored larger customers with PPP loans. Wells Fargo pledged the $420 million it made in fees on PPP loans to nonprofit Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that assist capital-thin minority entrepreneurs.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said in June that community banks and CDFIs were critical for getting PPP funds to small businesses.

""While I have heard from community groups that small businesses struggled to navigate the PPP application process especially those that did not have a preexisting banking relationship community banks and (CDFIs) made a concerted effort to meet small-business needs"" Bowman said according to the American Bar Association Journal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdmVyeS1tZWFuaW5nZnVsLXBsYXllci1ob3ctdXMtYmFuay1pcy1mb3JnaW5nLWFoZWFkLXdpdGgtaXRzLXJldGFpbC1leHBhbnNpb24tY2hhcmxvdHRlL05UQ1A0WkdDTEJHUkhFWENUVE83SEFCWlQ0L9IBpAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdmVyeS1tZWFuaW5nZnVsLXBsYXllci1ob3ctdXMtYmFuay1pcy1mb3JnaW5nLWFoZWFkLXdpdGgtaXRzLXJldGFpbC1leHBhbnNpb24tY2hhcmxvdHRlL05UQ1A0WkdDTEJHUkhFWENUVE83SEFCWlQ0Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘A very meaningful player’: How U.S. Bank is forging ahead with its retail expansion in Charlotte,"We’re Sorry!

You can take it to the bank.

Actually that’s exactly where the couple had to go between their ceremony at Zion Lutheran Church and reception at Le Voltaire French Restaurant when they realized that their wedding license wasn’t notarized.

They had neglected to read the small print.

It caused quite a stir when they showed up in gown and tux at the Wells Fargo near 168th and Maple Streets.

Autumne didn’t want to take care of business before the wedding because she was adamant that Samuel not see her before the ceremony. It’s tradition.

“We got a lot of stares. A lot of ‘what in the worlds’ ” Autumne said of their afternoon arrival. “It was quite entertaining.”

They were greeted by the notary and 10 to 15 minutes later headed off to take more pictures.

They took the time to snap a few at the bank too because who doesn’t want pictures from the local bank in their wedding book?

“They were incredibly wonderful and helpful and got us where we needed to be” Autumne said.

Of course they did have to wait for Autumne’s sister Amberlyn Berndt to arrive with the paperwork. She got lost which Autumne said isn’t surprising in her family.

Anything that can go wrong usually does she said. Like realizing at the rehearsal dinner that your paperwork isn’t in order. Or that your rental car is the one that starts smoking on vacation.

“If you knew me I’m just a woman of unfortunate events” Autumne said.

Luckily for the couple the rest of the day was perfect.

They were married on Aug. 9 because that’s the same day that Autumne’s parents Kimberly and Lance Berndt and grandparents Richard and Margaret Berndt tied the knot.

There were just 17 guests.

“I always wanted a really small intimate ceremony” Autumne said. “I wanted to elope but this is my version with still having family around.”

After pictures the day ended with dinner at Le Voltaire. It’s normally closed on Monday so they had the place to themselves.

Afterward the couple took a “mini moon” to Miami to visit granny Margaret. It was a surprise from Samuel.

“It was everything I ever dreamed of and more” Autumne said."

Kanye West and Jay-Z are undoubtedly two of the biggest celebrities in the rap industry. They re-invented the game and were once considered the kings of hip hop. Jay-Z discovered Kanye West and for several years Kanye worked at Roc-A-Fella Records under his mentorship. They had a falling out at some point but they seem to have reunited in recent years.

So what really determines which celebrities are better? Is it their net worth or their affluence? Sometimes it all boils to the cars in their collections and these two rap gods have some pretty exotic ones to choose from. Here’s a quick overview of how Kanye West’s cars stack up against Jay-Z’s cars.

A quick overview of Kanye West’s car collection

Kanye West is currently worth $1.8 billion according to Forbes and for a man who was deep in debt around three years ago he’s doing pretty well for himself. There was a time when Kanye’s bank account held no water against Jay-Z’s but his car collection did.

Kanye West seems to have a thing for armored cars and while they wouldn’t hold up in a street race they are very pricey. His collection includes a Mercedes-Benz McLaren SLR Aston Martin DB12 Mercedes-Benz SLR Stirling Moss and Lamborghini Aventador the last of which was a gift from his ex-wife.

Kanye West also owns a Dartz Prombron Red Diamond Edition Porsche 911 (991) Carrera 4S Lamborghini Urus and a Sherp which is an incredible all-terrain vehicle.

There have been rumors that this rapper owns a Bugatti Veyron and while these allegations are unconfirmed it does seem to fit his style. One of Kanye West’s earlier cars was a 2002 Lexus ES300 which he later crashed. West would’ve sustained serious injuries but the five-star safety features of the vehicle saved his life.

A quick overview of Jay-Z’s car collection

Jay-Z has a ridiculous car collection and with a net worth of $1.4 billion it’s not surprising. He was also hip hop’s first billionaire and from exotic supercars to vintage rides it seems as though he has a car for every day of the month.

According to The Sun his car collection includes a 1957 Corvette C1 Alfa Romeo Spider Pagani Zonda F Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport and a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud which he later gifted to Beyoncé as a birthday gift.

Jay-Z also owns a Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet Rolls-Royce Phantom Ferrari F430 Spider Maybach 57S Bentley Continental GT Maybach 62S and Maybach Exelero. Whether it’s one of Beyoncé’s cars or one from his collection this rapper always shows up in head-turning machines. With the quality of luxury and exotic vehicles in his garage it shouldn’t be any other way.

Kanye West’s cars vs. Jay-Z ‘s Cars

From the above list it’s clear that Jay-Z has the most expensive car collection. According to Robb Report he also just bought a $28 million car a Rolls-Royce Boat Tail as a new addition to his many other multi-million-dollar fleets of cars. One of the things that set the Boat Tail apart from the rest is that it is one of the most expensive cars in the world. For example the Pagani Zonda Roadster is one of Jay-Z’s most expensive cars and it only sells for $1.7 Million.

Even though Kanye’s car collection is estimated at $6.4 million not all of the car purchases he’s made are public. This leads us to believe that he may have a couple more surprises in his garage but we may never know. One of his most expensive cars is the super-rare Mercedes SLR McLaren that goes for around $750000.",,,,,,

Why it’s worth checking out: Just like Val Kilmer Soleil Moon Frye has long been obsessive about capturing nearly every moment of her life on film and Kid 90 does a remarkable job of turning boxes and boxes of videotapes into a moving story of a young woman trying to discover who she is and what she wants to be.

Xcel Energy names Frenzel as new CEO; other moves

Xcel Energy announced that Bob Frenzel has been appointed president and CEO of the company according to a news release.

Ben Fowke the current chairman and CEO will remain at Xcel Energy as executive chairman of the Board of Directors. Tim O’Connor was also named executive vice president and chief operations officer.

“I am humbled and honored today to take over as CEO of Xcel Energy. It’s been a privilege to work alongside Ben for the last five years. I am grateful for his leadership vision and careful stewardship of this great company. This is an exciting time to be in the energy industry and I look forward to leading us into the future with a focus on our strategic priorities including being an agile and innovative company and our commitment to elevating the customer experience” Frenzel said. He joined Xcel Energy as chief financial officer in 2016 and was named president and chief operating officer in March 2020.

“Bob is an outstanding leader and I am confident he will champion Xcel Energy’s strategic priorities including leading the clean energy transition and enhancing the customer experience while keeping customer bills low” Fowke said. As executive chair Fowke will focus on national energy policy and will continue to work closely with Frenzel.

Tim O’Connor has served as Xcel Energy’s EVP and chief generation officer since 2020 and now moves into the role of chief operations officer where he will oversee nuclear generation energy supply supply chain commercial operations distribution transmission and the company’s natural gas business.

Fowke was named Xcel Energy’s chair president and CEO in August 2011 and during his tenure the company has met or exceeded its carbon reduction goals and financial commitments every year.



Xcel Energy is number one in clean energy

Xcel Energy recently announced that it is the largest clean energy provider in the country when it comes to wind solar and battery storage according to the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

In its recently published annual report the ACP ranks investor-owned utilities based on the amount of clean power on their systems at the end of 2020 and Xcel Energy came out on top according to a news release.

“The nation has seen tremendous growth on the wind and solar front and we’re proud to be leading the charge in providing our customers with clean energy” said Xcel Energy's Ben Fowke. “This is a time of significant change for our company and industry as we embrace renewables and other technologies that provide value to our customers communities and the environment.”

Xcel Energy is the first major U.S. power provider to announce a vision of delivering 100 percent carbon-free electricity to its customers by 2050 and it’s more than halfway there. The company has also proposed plans to retire most of its coal generation ahead of schedule which will help reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by 2030 one of the most aggressive interim targets in the industry consistent with the Paris Agreement targets.

At the end of 2020 Xcel Energy had 11205 megawatts of wind and solar on the system edging out its peers by 43 megawatts according to the report. In 2021 the company surpassed 10000 megawatts of wind on its system after wrapping up the largest multi-state wind expansion in the country.

By the end of this year Dakota Range a large wind farm in South Dakota is expected to come online. In addition to reducing carbon emissions 80 percent by 2030 Xcel Energy expects to serve customers company-wide with electricity that is nearly 80 percent carbon free including approximately 65 percent renewable sources by the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuc3ByZXNzLmNvbS90aGVuLWFuZC1ub3ctZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1hY3RpdmlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Then and Now: Environmental Activists – Minnesota Women's Press,"Ecolution reporting made possible by Seward Co-op which has been a community-owned grocer since 1972: Together we continue to cultivate a cooperative economy.

Patty O’Keefe: From MN350 to Sierra Club

When Patty O’Keefe was interviewed in 2015 she was working at MN350 a climate justice organization supporting students faith leaders and public employees in running fossil fuel divestment campaigns. “The goal of the divestment movement was/is to take away the social license of the fossil fuel industry to pollute with impunity” O’Keefe said.

Today O’Keefe works as an organizer at the Minnesota Sierra Club supporting communities in encouraging Xcel Energy to ditch fossil fuels and embrace a just transition to clean energy. “And by just we mean supporting more local and distributed energy like community solar that prioritizes community wealth over corporate wealth” she says.

O’Keefe says she has a mix of good and bad feelings regarding our current environmental state. “I feel frustration at the continued lack of political will to address the issue at the scale the science demands. Optimistic because in the last ten years I have seen a dramatic increase in public awareness concern and action being taken. And solidarity with racial and economic justice issues that are at the heart of the fight for climate justice” she says.

In order for climate justice efforts to be successful O’Keefe says they need to be intersectional.

“I once heard that we are in the situation we are in because certain people certain communities and our planet as a whole are treated as disposable” she says. “The exploitation of people and particularly people of color and the poor is directly connected to the exploitation of the planet. It is the same destructive mindset. That’s why it is not enough to change fossil fuel companies into clean energy companies and call it good. If we switch to renewables but the same racist and classist power dynamics are at play then we will continue to harm each other and the natural world.

O’Keefe adds that we are at a point where we need both individual action and collective action to stop climate change. Individual actions are about finding ways to reduce personal impact on the environment — biking more reducing plastic consumption buying used eating less meat. Collective action can look like volunteering or donating to an organization or progressive political campaign attending marches and protests supporting Indigenous land rights movements or asking legislators to support climate justice.

“Sharing your individual and collective actions with family friends and on social media will help others take action too” she says.

It is easy to feel grief fear and hopelessness when it comes to climate change O’Keefe says but she maintains hope by practicing good self-care and taking actions that make change in her immediate community.

“The more I have done those things the more hopeful I have become” she says.

Amy Freeman: Boundary Waters

Amy and Dave Freeman during the Year in the Wilderness Expedition

When Amy Freeman was first interviewed by the Minnesota Women’s Press she had just completed Paddle to D.C. a 2000-mile journey by canoe to raise awareness about proposed sulfide-ore copper mining in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

“Since then we spent a whole year in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for the same cause. In both instances we were supporting the work of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. That was 2015-2016” she says. She wrote a book about the experience A Year in the Wilderness: Bearing Witness in the Boundary Waters (Milkweed).

Now she and her husband Dave spend time in Ely guiding dog sledding trips in the winter and canoe trips in the summer.

“We spent about a year sailing from Lake Superior to the Bahamas and then Nova Scotia. Like most people we made a major pivot in 2020” Freeman says. “Future sailing plans were put on hold. As schools shifted to virtual learning we saw an increased demand for virtual school assemblies which we had been offering through the educational nonprofit organization that Dave and I have run (Wilderness Classroom Organization) since 2007. We have been doing a lot of virtual assemblies drawing on our human powered expeditions in various places around the world.”

Regarding the current state of our global environment Freeman says she feels a mix of optimism and overwhelm.

“We have a lot of work to do but it is encouraging to see some progress. For example the cause Dave and I have dedicated years to — protecting the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from upstream sulfide-ore copper mining — is finally making progress” she says. “Keep tabs on H.R. 2794 the Boundary Waters Protection and Pollution Prevention Act introduced by Betty McCollum.”

Freeman says she wishes more people understood the significant role that wild lands play in combatting climate change. Each acre of terrestrial boreal forest she says stores an average of about 180 tons of carbon in its vegetation and soils and soil carbon levels in wetlands are nearly double the level of those in terrestrial boreal forest.

The best way to learn about and teach others about the environment Freeman says is simply to go outside. “Get outside and take young people with you” she says. “I think it is incredibly important to instill a love of wild places in as many people as possible — especially young people. The more interactions people have with nature the more respect they have for it.”

Kristel Porter: Climate Change

Kristel Porter (they/she) was interviewed by the Minnesota Women’s Press in 2020 which was not that long ago. But they were busy — kicking off their second year of the Power North Program and engaging residents in North Minneapolis about the Solstar Project — and we wanted to make contact again.

As executive director of MN Renewable Now Porter is wrapping up this year’s Power North Program and has been able to transition 173 households to wind power 33 households to community solar gardens and connect 82 households with energy efficient audits and installations for their homes in North Minneapolis.

“We are also completing the applications for our Solstar program recipients and will be bulk buying the solar panels materials and supplies for 24 properties in North Minneapolis” they say. “We are super excited to get these households solar arrays while increasing the value of their properties saving them money and lowering North Minneapolis’s carbon footprint by 150 metric tons of Co2 annually!”

Although Porter has seen a lot of progress made around Minneapolis she says she is worried about our current state as a nation.

“We just suffered a pandemic which drove people to fear reusable containers the bulk section in our grocery stores restaurants were forgiven for using styrofoam containers and were using much more due to no enforcement and the demand for carry-out food doubling” they say. “Not just that but since people were staying inside more they were ordering more common household items online which required a lot more packaging. I also live in a community where the participation rate in recycling is low and the littering rate is high so I could be a little biased.”

However they say they feel hope in other ways. Because of the pandemic Porter says we had an entire year without “black billowing clouds left behind by school buses and more people getting outdoors and reconnecting with nature.”

“I was so excited to see the Climate Justice Movement I had been waiting for my entire life led by youth across our entire country” Porter says. “Later I was deeply saddened and dismayed to see it come to a screeching halt once those youth were separated and sent home prematurely due to a global pandemic. I think that the pandemic hindered the movement for environmental justice in many ways yet offered some very positive pieces to it as well.”

For the first time in her adult life Porter says she was given the opportunity to pause think strategically reflect on her own growth and offer aid to other movements such as the Line 3 movement tree planting initiatives and collaborations with organizations doing similar work.

“Instead of throwing events and conferences we went to work making real change such as getting folks to switch where they sourced their energy getting their homes updated to prepare for the high temperatures we are experiencing today and getting actual solar panels installed onto the homes owned by families that would have otherwise never been able to afford them” they say.

Though climate change once seemed like an intangible signs of the climate crisis are all around us Porter points out.

“Have you seen any mosquitos yet this year? I know it feels good but think about the many animals that depend on that as a food source. Have you noticed fruit trees such as the mulberry trees ripen an entire month early? Have you noticed the lack of rain? More than 50 percent of the United States is experiencing anywhere between severe to exceptional drought which is projected to have long term effects” she says. “This is serious. Short term effects impact agriculture and grasslands however long term effects will impact our ecology and hydrology. Which means that right here in Minnesota we may see our landscape change indefinitely.”

Shalini Gupta: Ecological Justice

The last time Shalini Gupta (she/her) spoke to the Minnesota Women’s Press she was executive director of the environmental justice research and policy nonprofit the Center for Earth Energy and Democracy. Now she is an independent consultant and strategic advisor for integrating a racial and environmental justice lens into policies and strategy for philanthropy individual donors government agencies integrative BIPOC artist-led projects and grassroots community based organizations. She also is a commentator and writer of children’s books focused on ecological justice.

“The moment we are in around racial justice is shining light on multiple systems of oppression including the pollution industrial complex that is harming communities of color and white working class communities across the country and here in Minnesota/Twin Cities” she says. “There is much hope in this awakening of the repressive toxic policy structures [industrial zoning permitting land access who does and does not have the right to have access to clean air and water] that we need to critically interrogate.

“Stopping extractive profit-only driven actions that extract land and people are linked and have never been tenable. I worry about my kids future who will be in their late thirties in 2050. I worry about the relatives I have back in India and the local and global sacrifice zones being created by not being serious about climate change and who is most impacted” she says. “The urgency is great an all-hands-on deck moment — where movements come together for real change.”

Gupta says she wishes more people recognized that solutions to our multiple societal woes [climate change compromised water quality stress low wages racial injustice] exist right now — not in the future.

“We must acknowledge and rectify the deep injustices to our Indigenous brothers and sisters and the level of hurt to the land to move forward. We must ensure the benefits of the green economy are grounded in those that have borne the disproportionate harm of pollution [largely BIPOC and white working class communities]” she says.

Gupta says the best way for people to become more aware of climate change and to connect with nature around them is to learn about the trees and animals nearest you.

She also recommends getting engaged to make sure candidates with an environmental and racial justice lens and a track record in community work are elected in November. Groups Gupta suggests donating to Minnesota-based environmental justice organizations like Community Members for Environmental Justice Honor the Earth Dream of Wild Health the Urban Bird Collective.
