A chemical engineer he never put chemicals on his lawn. A trained scientist he sang for more than two decades in the choir of Westminster Presbyterian Church and in the Masterworks Chorale. And he loved nature spending time ""Up North"" as he reveled in the marvels of the world even though his job was to tinker with them. Lloyd who earned eight patents for his work died June 20 in the Twin Cities at 84 after a brief struggle with AML leukemia. ""He was someone who had all these pursuits and found who he was and what he valued in resolving these contradictions"" Carl White his son said. Born Jan. 2 1937 in Brainerd Minn. he was the second child of jack-of-all trades Marvin ""Bud"" White and nurse Esther White. Ever curious he excelled in school and was the valedictorian of the 1955 class of Columbia Heights High School. Lloyd received his bachelor's degree in 1959 from the University of Minn. and a master's degree in chemical engineering a year later from Columbia University. He earned his doctorate also in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota where he would teach as adjunct faculty for 30 years. Nicknamed ""Jockey"" by his father Lloyd had a long love with Carol Mae Johnson with whom he grew up. Lloyd's big sister Carol was best friends with Carol's older sister Romelle. The sisters' parents Ingvald and Alma Johnson provided a loving example of what family life could be and Lloyd strove to emulate them. Lloyd and Carol attended the same schools most of their lives and began dating while students at the University of Minnesota. They married in 1959 and had 61 years together. Their children were born as they moved for work and education. Sons Stuart and Carl were born in 1961 and 1963 in Appleton Wisc. where he worked at the Institute of Paper Chemistry. Daughter Paula was born in Minneapolis in 1966 while he finished his doctorate. And daughter Erika was born in Charleston West Virginia in 1968 a year after the family moved there for Lloyd's job at Union Carbide. The family returned to Minneapolis in 1976 where he worked at Fluidyne Engineering Corp. for five years before he moved to 3M where he had a 20-year career. His patents were for intellectual chemical engineering processes primarily at 3M. Outside of work Lloyd greatly enjoyed camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and fishing for trout in southeastern Minn. He also was a lifelong singer. A highlight of his time at Westminster Presbyterian Church was his trip with the Global Choir to Cuba to sing and sightsee. Lloyd passed his love of music to his children all of whom studied music and learned stringed instruments in the Suzuki method. He fondly remembered the many summers spent at the American Suzuki Institute where the sounds of hundreds of students practicing wafted through the air across the campus at University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Long car rides were usually spent listening to classical music and Lloyd would quiz everyone to guess the composer piece and performer of what we were hearing. He was preceded in death by his parents Esther and Marvin ""Bud"" White; aunt Lucille Nacker; in-laws Ingvald and Alma Johnson; Faye Provenzano White; sister Carol Haugen; brothers-in-law John Haugen Kenneth Johnson and Larry Piekos; and son Stuart White. Lloyd is survived by wife Carol; son Carl (Nora Wildgen) of St. Louis Park; daughter Paula (Patricia Wegner) of Berkeley CA; daughter Erika (Glenn Sacks) of Plymouth MN; brothers James Provenzano White (Carol) of Geneva IL and Marvin ""Corky"" White (Linda) of San Carlos CA; sister Marcy Piekos of Woodstock IL; sisters-in-law Romelle Haugen (Lee) of Fridley MN and Ruth O'Keefe (Mike) of Alaska; brother-in-law James Johnson of Columbia Heights MN; nieces Ruth Haugen Romano of Minneapolis and Sara Haugen Young of Austin TX; nephew Mark ""Scooter"" Piekos of Woodstock IL.; and grandchildren Sara of Berkeley Leo Quinn Kenny and Jordan of the Twin Cities. The last few years were a struggle for Lloyd as Carol's dementia advanced. Lloyd wore himself out managing her care. Throughout his life he worked tirelessly and did his best to support his family. Memorial services will be at 2 p.m. Sat. July 17 Westminster Presbyterian Church 1200 S. Marquette Av. Mpls. Memorials preferred to the Lloyd R. and Carol M. White Memorial Scholarship College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota and Westminster Presbyterian Church.

An infamous Birmingham tax fraudster who built a ‚Äòpalace‚Äô in Pakistan has been released from jail despite still owing more than ¬£3 million in crime proceeds and interest.

Mohammed Suleman Khan nicknamed ‚ÄòThe General‚Äô was originally jailed for four years in 2014 following a ¬£450000 tax fraud.

The scam was exposed after police searched his Moseley home and found plans for his own ‚ÄòBuckingham Palace‚Äô in Pakistan complete with library cinema and servant quarters.

In 2016 the fraudster‚Äôs sentence was increased by 10 years when he failed to pay a ¬£2.2 million confiscation order.

Khan has since been released after serving half his default sentence.

The fraudster still has not repaid the ¬£2.2 million order nor the additional ¬£1 million interest.

It is believed Khan is still living in the same house he lived in when he was jailed.

The property is subject to a financial restraint order which was obtained by the CPS.

In non-payment cases eight per cent interest is added annually to the original sum meaning Khan now owes a total of ¬£3221034.

In a statement West Midlands Police said:

‚ÄúPOCA (Proceeds of Crime Act) Asset Recovery is often extremely complex and time-consuming.

‚ÄúOur progress to date has been slower than we would like in this case.

‚ÄúIt is the obligation of Mr Khan to pay the confiscation order and remains so despite having served the default sentence.

‚ÄúThere are a number of significant complications surrounding the recovery of the Birmingham assets.

‚ÄúWe have however acted on intelligence from the community and we conducted a warrant at the house in Moseley on 30 May. No weapons were found.‚Äù

The statement added the Crown Prosecution Service and the force ‚Äúfought strongly to get this confiscation order we continue to work together as we remain fully committed to enforcing it and getting back what we can as soon as possible.

‚ÄúOur work continues however much of it has to remain in the background for now.

‚ÄúWe appreciate this is frustrating for people who want to understand more but it doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt doing anything.‚Äù

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman had said:

‚ÄúI can confirm that on 10 April 2015 Birmingham Crown Court made a confiscation order for ¬£2209090 against Mohammed Suleman Khan.

‚ÄúThe court gave him six months to pay the order and fixed a period of imprisonment of 10 years in default of payment of the confiscation order.

‚ÄúOn 4 February 2016 Birmingham Magistrates‚Äô Court activated the default sentence of 10 years to run consecutive to the period of four years imprisonment for the offence of Cheating the Revenue.‚Äù

The CPS confirmed the outstanding unpaid money but did not say how it plans to recover it.

The original tax fraud case heard Khan had lived in a ¬£500000 house and drove a BMW but had no obvious job.

The home belonged to relatives and only small amounts of money went through his bank accounts.

Despite concealing his wealth detectives found he had secretly paid for a ¬£2.3 million mansion to be built in Pakistan.

In court his defence said he was a legitimate businessman who had earned around ¬£400000 over a nine-year period from debt collecting and other business interests in the UK and abroad.

However police found no evidence of a legitimate debt collecting company.

Instead they found he made over ¬£1 million without paying the required tax and National Insurance.

A search of the fraudster‚Äôs home found plans for the ‚Äòpalace‚Äô in the Attock region.

The building‚Äôs outer shell and roof had cost Khan ¬£893000. Once completed the property would have been valued at ¬£2.3 million.

Khan did not say anything apart from ‚Äúguilty‚Äù when he admitted cheating the public revenue at Birmingham Crown Court in November 2013.

Judge Menary QC had agreed that Khan was living beyond legitimate means.

He said of the ‚Äòpalace‚Äô:

‚ÄúIt is enormous with dozens of rooms a library servant quarter cinema underground parking and guard rooms.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is the size of Buckingham Palace.‚Äô‚Äô

At the time of the fraud case police said:

‚ÄúThe sentence handed out sends a clear message to all members of the community that evasion of tax and National Insurance are serious criminal offences.

‚ÄúNo matter your standing within the community police and other agencies such as Her Majesty‚Äôs Revenue and Customs will seek to investigate and where appropriate prosecute individuals who are perceived or seen to be living a lifestyle or own property inconsistent with legitimately earned income.‚Äù"

In a delightful piece of symmetry Barty the singles No.1 beat the No.1 doubles players back to back ‚Äì first Katerina Siniakova in the third round and then reigning Roland Garros champion Barbora Krejcikova in the last 16.

That set up an historic meeting with against Ajla Tomljanovic the first Wimbledon quarterfinal between two Australian women in 41 years.

Appropriately one of those players back in 1980 was Goolagong who went on to win that year‚Äôs title.

By now Barty was deep in the second week of the Championships which coincided with NAIDOC Week in Australia ‚Äì a celebration of the nation‚Äôs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples‚Äô history culture and achievements.

The fact Barty an indigenous woman herself ultimately won her first Wimbledon title 50 years after another indigenous player in Goolagong did the same in a Goolagong-inspired dress all while Australia celebrated its indigenous heritage?

Destiny indeed.

‚ÄúThe stars aligned for me over the past fortnight‚Äù said Barty who also triumphed on the 10-year anniversary of her girls‚Äô singles victory at the All England Club.

‚ÄúIncredible that it happened to fall on the 50th Anniversary of Evonne's first title here too.

‚ÄúEvonne is a very special person in my life. I think she has been iconic in paving a way for young indigenous youth to believe in their dreams and to chase their dreams.

‚ÄúShe's done exactly that for me as well.‚Äù

Learning and growth

Barty once described her junior breakthrough at Wimbledon as both the best and worst thing to happen to her.

It forever set in stone her connection to this most prestigious of tournaments.

But it also perhaps added an extra layer of pressure and significance every time she competed on its famous lawns.

Until 2021 it was the one Grand Slam tournament at which she had comparatively underperformed; a third-round loss in 2018 followed by a fourth-round exit in 2019 as the top seed were defeats Barty described as some of her ‚Äútoughest weeks‚Äù and ‚Äúdarkest times‚Äù.

However as she continues to demonstrate she learned from those disappointments and rose to create something undeniably special.

‚ÄúI'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason the good moments and the tough moments‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI think over the past fortnight I've had massive amounts of growth. Certainly been able to use my experience as a tennis player to get me through some tough matches. I felt like I was able to get better with each match and trust myself more each and every time I stood out on the court.

‚ÄúSome of my toughest moments have come at Wimbledon. Now some of my most incredible moments have come here as well.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMDkvc3BvcnRzL3NvY2Nlci9pdGFseS1lbmdsYW5kLWV1cm8tMjAyMC1jaGllbGxpbmktYm9udWNjaS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Euro 2020: Chiellini Bonucci and the Art of Defense,"LONDON ‚Äî There are plenty of stories.

His motivational coach Alberto Ferrarini had given them to him later explaining that ‚Äúhundreds of years ago soldiers ate garlic to keep them strong healthy and alert.‚Äù The tablets were intended to give Bonucci the same traits.

There was of course another benefit. Ferrarini also told Bonucci to ‚Äúbreathe in the faces of Gervinho and Francesco Totti‚Äù Roma‚Äôs star attackers.

Hawke‚Äôs Bay Today revealed the Ministry of Health would give the funds to ‚ÄòKahukura‚Äô a marae-based rehabilitation initiative that takes groups of 10 people three times a year and attempts to wean them off the drug.

Kahukura is led by the Chaindogs a cluster of Mob chapters with affiliation to the Notorious chapter of the Mongrel Mob.

National‚Äôs crime spokesperson Simeon Brown told Te Ao Maori News ‚ÄòWhile we all acknowledge that meth is a scourge on our community and getting people off it is vitally important the Mongrel Mob is an criminal organisation which peddles meth‚Äù.

The Ministry of Health's deputy director-general mental health and addiction Toni Gutschlag told Hawke‚Äôs Bay Today drug use was prevalent in gangs and ‚Äúthere was a gap in current service provision which the proposed initiative provided a way to fill engaging with a hard-to-reach segment of the community.‚Äù

The $2.75 Million for Kahukura will be sourced from funds collected under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009.

""The Proceeds of Crime Fund was set up to support victims of crime ‚Äì not the perpetrators... The Mongrel Mob is organised crime which has been caught selling meth very recently"" Brown said.

In May Hawke's Bay Police seized $2 million in assets and made six arrests during a major methamphetamine operation centred on Senior Mongrel Mob members in the region.

Stuff reports the programme involves participants working on a ""community garden"" at the house of the president of the gang Sonny Smith.

Sonny's wife Mahinaarangi Smith is the programme's facilitator.

Brown told Te Ao MƒÅori News ‚ÄòWe should be funding organisations like the Salvation Army which have a proven track record of working with gang members to help them get off meth.‚Äù

""They also have proper measures to ensure the accountability for any government funding.‚Äô he said.

Central Hawke's Bay mayor Alex Walker told HBT ""Meth is scourge in our communities and anything which will remove its influence from our families is important.""

Walker acknowledged the controversy over the funding saying it would not be ‚Äúwell received"" by the community.

Brown wants the government to explain if ministers signed off on the funding. ""Almost any other organisation would be more appropriate"" he said.",,,,,,

The Governor was joined for the briefing by Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd and Adjutant General of Texas Tracy Norris. During the briefing the Governor and Colonel McCraw provided an update on the state's efforts to secure the border. Governor Abbott thanked the sheriffs for working tirelessly on the frontlines of the border crisis and reaffirmed the state's commitment to partnering with local officials to secure the border and keep communities safe. The briefing also included updates from sheriffs about their own efforts to stop the influx of drugs weapons and other contraband into the state.

On Wednesday the Governor named border security funding as a priority item for the first 2021 Special Session. During his remarks at the briefing the Governor Abbott urged legislators to swiftly act on this item during the session in order to keep communities safe and help secure the border.

""President Biden's open border policies have led to a disaster on our border and the State of Texas is stepping up in the federal government's absence to keep our communities safe"" said Governor Abbott. ""Our efforts would not be possible without our partnership with local law enforcement. With their support we are working tirelessly to stop the influx of unlawful immigrants and prevent the smuggling of contraband into the state. But more help is needed which is why I called for legislation this Special Session to provide more border security funding for law enforcement and counties. This funding will help us better step up to meet this challenge and gives our border communities the resources and support they need. I strongly urge the legislature to take up this issue and I thank our law enforcement partners for their continued efforts to secure the border.""

Huffines is challenging Abbott in the 2022 Republican primary for governor. The underdog candidate hopes to appeal to the party‚Äôs most conservative voters and he used his speech at the CPAC meeting to convince GOP activists that he‚Äôd make a better governor than Abbott.

On Sunday outgoing Texas GOP chairman and candidate for governor Allen West will address the CPAC gathering.

Huffines‚Äô speech Saturday revealed that he could have a name recognition problem. He was introduced to the small crowd as ‚ÄúDan‚Äù Huffines.

Border security has long been a hot-button issue for conservative Republicans and Huffines hit it hard.

‚ÄúLet me be clear. The federal government never has and never will secure the border‚Äù Huffines said. ‚ÄúThe only chance we have of having a secure border is with a courageous governor.‚Äù

A spokesman for Abbott‚Äôs campaign did not comment on Huffines‚Äô blistering attack on the governor.

Abbott has committed to building a wall along the state‚Äôs border with Mexico and recently visited a stretch of the unfinished barrier with former President Donald Trump. Trump who will address CPAC attendees Sunday afternoon has endorsed Abbott for reelection for a third term.

On Saturday Abbott held a border security briefing at the Capitol with sheriffs from border areas. He was joined by Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd Adjutant General of Texas Tracy Norris and Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw.

But that meeting didn‚Äôt stop Huffines‚Äô attacks on the governor‚Äôs record.

The former state senator who lost his seat in 2018 to Dallas Democrat Nathan Johnson has been critical of Abbott‚Äôs decision to shut down businesses in the early months of the pandemic and his order last year mandating the wearing of masks to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier this year Abbott allowed businesses to open at 100% capacity and scrapped the mask mandate prompting President Joe Biden to blast his decision as a Neanderthal approach.

‚ÄúHe put 3 million Texans on unemployment and dependent on the government in one day‚Äù Huffines said of Abbott‚Äôs pandemic response. ‚ÄùHe closed all of our churches on the holiest week of the year Easter.‚Äù

Huffines also blamed the inability of the state‚Äôs power grid to hold up during a February winter storm on Abbott. The crisis resulted in numerous power outages water shortages and deaths.

‚ÄúEarlier this year we were within four minutes of our electrical grid having a complete meltdown and sending us all into the Stone Age‚Äù Huffines said. ‚ÄúTexas is the energy capital of the world. It‚Äôs another embarrassment of failed leadership ‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt even keep the lights on.‚Äù

Huffines also contended that Abbott has failed to stop a clinic from conducting ‚Äúsexual mutilation chemical castrations and sex change surgeries on children.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt he here?‚Äù Huffines asked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not here because he doesn‚Äôt want to face you.‚Äù

Abbott is not attending the CPAC convention. Last week he set 11 agenda items for lawmakers to tackle during a special session that started Thursday.

Huffines said he would make a better governor and stand up to Biden‚Äôs plan to flip Texas in favor of Democrats.

Greg Abbott says he wants more funding for border security,"In a meeting at the Capitol with sheriffs from counties near the Texas-Mexico border Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday said the state should allocate more money to help local law enforcement agencies cover the costs associated with unauthorized border crossings.

""I'm asking for additional appropriations from the state Legislature during the special session to in part fund the needs that the sheriffs have articulated but also to fund in part additional strategies that will be conducted by the state of Texas"" said Abbott who on Thursday summoned lawmakers back to Austin for a special legislative session.

Among the tasks he laid before the Legislature was to take even more steps to pay for what the governor called a ""comprehensive border security plan.""

Abbott earlier said Texas would continue the halted federal effort to build more fencing along the border. And during the regular session lawmakers allocated more than $1 billion for border security efforts that state Republican leaders say the Democratic Biden administration has allowed to lapse.

That $1 billion does not include $250 million Abbott and legislative leaders have agreed to reallocate from other state projects to pay for more border fencing. In addition to the state commitment about $800000 has been raised from private sources for the project the governor's office said.

The sheriffs all wearing white cowboy hats and assembled around a long table in one of the governor's office suites on the Capitol's second floor said local resources are being stretched by a surge in unauthorized border crossings.

Some of the sheriffs spoke of encountering drug traffickers and human traffickers and sometimes engaging in high-speed chases in the efforts to apprehend them. Another said his officers have encountered the bodies of migrants who died trying to make their way north.

According to figures posted online by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol apprehensions of people crossing the border without authorizations have been escalating each month since January. Figures for May the most recent available show nearly a 700% increase from May 2020 in all sectors from Brownsville to San Diego.

However apprehensions in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic were down significantly from 2019 and this May's apprehensions were more comparable to May 2019 in both the Rio Grande and El Paso sectors.

In May 2019 the Rio Grande sector had 49821 apprehensions while the same region saw 50793 in May 2021. The number had plummeted to 3698 apprehensions in May 2020 amid the pandemic.

In the El Paso sector apprehensions were 22219 in May which is lower than the region‚Äôs 38637 in May 2019. The region had 2617 apprehensions last year.

Abbott asked the sheriffs if they were turning the migrants over to federal authorities. At least one answered yes. The governor said that under his plan migrants arrested on state criminal charges should remain in state custody.

""Our goal is not to release them"" Abbott said. ""Our goal is to jail them.""

Domingo Garcia president of the League of United Latin American Citizens the oldest Latino civil rights organization in the country said Abbott's proposal would do nothing to help the border.

""This is Gov. Abbott overreaching his power and politicizing and militarizing a humanitarian crisis at the border. It's spreading the big lie and will accomplish nothing except waste taxpayer dollars‚Äô Garcia said. ‚ÄúSheriffs your governor or National Guard have no authority on immigration. That's a federal matter that's best left to those who have been trained to be engaged in it.‚Äù

Abbott has been critical of Biden's border policies since the new president took office Jan. 20.

On June 30 Abbott joined former President Donald Trump in the border town of Pharr where a section of unfinished border fencing served as the backdrop for the event that had many of the trappings of a campaign rally.

Abbott did not say how much additional money should be allocated for his efforts on the border. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said his week that his revised revenue estimate shows the state will likely take in $7.85 billion more than lawmakers allocated for the two-year budget cycle that starts Sept. 1.

Paolo Ghia MD PhD

CAPTIVATE is a multicenter phase II study of first-line ibrutinib plus venetoclax in CLL. At the 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition results from the minimal residual disease (MRD) cohort were presented. Undetectable MRD was achieved in more than two-thirds of patients with a fixed-duration of 12 cycles of treatment with the combination and progression-free survival rates were greater than 95% regardless of subsequent randomized treatment.2

Study Details

The primary analysis of CAPTIVATE reported on the fixed-duration cohort of 159 patients with untreated CLL/SLL aged 70 or younger who received 3 cycles of the all-oral once daily regimen of ibrutinib followed by 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Median age was 60 years. High-risk features included del(17p)/TP53 mutations in 27; del(17p) in 20; del(11q) in 28; complex karyotype in 31; and unmutated IGHV in 89. There were 139 patients (86%) without del(17p). Among 159 patients 147 completed 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax. The median time on study was 27.9 months and the median treatment duration was 13.8 months. Median follow-up time after treatment cessation was 14 months.

The complete response rate was 56% in patients without del(17p) and 55% in all treated patients. These rates were consistent among high-risk subgroups except for those with bulky disease who had a complete response rate of 31%. The objective response rate in all treated patients and in those without del(17p) was 96%. ‚ÄúThese responses represent a 40% improvement over the historical comparator FCR regimen in the CLL10 study‚Äù Dr. Ghia stated.

Secondary Endpoints

Among the 88 patients who achieved complete response 78 (89%) had durable responses lasting longer than 1 year. Among the 66 patients without del(17p) who achieved complete responses 76 (87%) were durable lasting longer than 1 year. The rate of undetectable MRD in peripheral blood was 77% in all treated patients and 76% in those without del(17p); the rates of undetectable MRD in the bone marrow were 60% and 62% respectively.

At 24 months progression-free survival rate in patients without del(17p) was 96% and 95% in all treated patients. The 24-month overall survival rate was 98%‚Äîidentical in all treated patients and those without del(17p). Median follow-up was 27.9 months.

‚ÄúAll of these results together support the idea of the combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax as an all-oral once daily chemotherapy-free fixed-duration treatment that may achieve deep responses and undetectable MRD in a vast majority of patients‚Äù Dr. Ghia stated.

The phase III GLOW study is currently ongoing in an older population and includes a study arm of ibrutinib plus venetoclax.

Godoy was the trusted advisor of the clueless Spanish King Charles IV and the ambitious Queen Maria Luisa who was rumored to be Godoy‚Äôs lover. Branciforte married Godoy‚Äôs sister Maria Antonia in 1790 and with the Queen‚Äôs help Godoy was appointed Prime Minister in 1792. Godoy got Branciforte appointed the 53rd Viceroy of New Spain in 1794 over protests the Sicilian-born Branciforte was a ‚Äúforeigner.‚Äù This gave Godoy influence over the King of Old Spain and Viceroy of New Spain. Yet the Spanish Empire was corrupt crumbling and in financial ruin.

The French Revolution had thrown a scare into Europe‚Äôs monarchies and tainted the image of Democratic reformers as just mob-ruled anarchy. When Louis XVI was beheaded Spain joined an alliance against the French Republic leading to a French border war with Spain. As former Commander General of Spain‚Äôs military Viceroy Branciforte looked to the security of the Americas. Fearing a local French uprising he declared all French residents of New Spain and the Louisiana province (then under Spanish control) to be enemy aliens subject to arrest and confiscation of their property.

Trade route

Alta California was geographically remote and cut-off from the rest of New Spain yet it was where Spain‚Äôs Manila Galleons arrived before heading down the coast to central Mexico. Any French British or Russian settlements on this coast would threaten New Spain‚Äôs lucrative trade route with piracy so this unappreciated coastline had to be protected. Alta California had only 1275 Spanish citizens defended by 218 soldiers divided between four inadequate presidio forts built to control the indigenous populations not defend the coast.

The presidios had few canons: San Francisco two San Diego three Santa Barbara two unmounted and Monterey the only eight working canons but with just six cannon balls. Viceroy Branciforte consulted a report and letter both by Catalonian engineer Miguel Costanso (one of Portola‚Äôs explorers) about reinforcing California‚Äôs defenses. Costanso said the Britain succeeded through colonies and commerce showing permanent settlers they were more important than temporary soldiers. California had to get soldiers to settle the province instead of taking their skills back to central Mexico when discharged.

Yet Spanish authorities feared replicating California‚Äôs other two pueblos San Jose and Los Angeles considered unproductive and ungovernable centers of vice. Costanso felt this could be remedied by establishing the new town as a ‚ÄúVilla Palatine‚Äù with royal privileges. It would be a retirement community for the elite Catalonian soldiers men with engineering skills and disciplined habits who could be called out of retirement at a moment‚Äôs notice as an unpaid militia to defend the province. It would be named ‚ÄúVilla de Branciforte‚Äù in the Viceroy‚Äôs honor.

California Governor Diego de Borica was an Enlightenment progressive advocating science and civic improvements. Borica said the Villa should follow the 1789 ‚ÄúPlan of Pitic‚Äù in Chihuahua. By this plan the Villa would be 10 square miles with a grid of orderly streets laid out around a Spanish Commons and governed by a ‚Äúcomisionado‚Äù serving as magistrate and land agent. The Viceroy provided generous royal privileges offering each patriarch an adobe home with tile roof a nearby rancho and farm equipment and a yearly pension for the first five years. Each settler would be selected for his skill in a craft or trade. For assimilation every other house was supposed to be an indigenous leader but the Santa Cruz tribal bands were too democratic making decision by general consensus rather than singular authority.

In April 1796 Viceroy Branciforte sent a contingent of 90 highly-skilled Catalonian volunteers to California 72 headed by Alberto de Cordoba the most talented engineer in California. In 1796 Cordoba collaborated with Borica exploring sites with six escorts. They determined Santa Cruz was the most important coastal site between the tip of Baja and San Francisco Bay for its fertility and abundance of resources both for construction and export. It was expected the 5-year-old Santa Cruz Mission already destroyed three times (twice by flooding once by roof collapse) had converted all the natives that could be converted and was dying out.

Settlement

Failing to find soldiers who‚Äôd stay in California or Mexicans of good character willing to be exiled to California the government sought the least objectionable members of its prison population for whom California was a less punitive confinement. The 17 settlers were chosen from among vagrants debtors and petty offenders like gamblers and drunks. They were each given $20-to-$25 to board the Concepcion for a life of ‚ÄúRoyal Privileges‚Äù in California. Except the ship was headed not north but due west to Asia the only Spanish route to California. This was one of the Manila Galleons. Under good conditions the voyage took four to five months crossing the Pacific to Manila in the Philippines then returning via Hawaii and California.

The settlers traveled with seven California missionaries Padre Gonzales bound for Santa Cruz Mission others sent to replace two insane and two sick padres. The Concepcion arrived in Monterey May 12 1797 and Borica was shocked as the settlers disembarked in tatters some half-naked many ill from the voyage with a few cases of syphilis. They were not just convicts but spoke the Spanish cockney dialect of Guadalajara by dropping their H‚Äôs. All nine convicts were named Jose; two had nicknames Joker and Gallant. There were three farmers three tailors a miner a saddler and a carpenter. And the government had failed to include settlement supplies.

On July 17 Borica appointed the stern Gen. Gabriel Moraga as Comisionado of the new town and they escorted the settlers on horses plus two ox-powered carts full of Borica-provided tools for farming carpentry and ironwork.

Then on July 24 1797 Borica dedicated the new township. Yet nothing had been built except for arrow-straight North Branciforte Avenue a marvel as the first surveyed road in California. After the ceremony they crossed the San Lorenzo River to the Mission where accommodations were provided. The mission was undergoing repairs for storm-damage and padres Fernandez and Gonzales resented those setteling in the mission‚Äôs designated buffer zone which by law was supposed to be at least three miles from a pueblo but was 3/4ths of a mile instead.

In October the bill to construct an adobe town was calculated at $23405 in materials alone. Spain went to war with Great Britain that month so construction was put on hold to fund the war. Borica got his soldiers to at least construct two large temporary thatched-hut dormitories for the settlers. The free-living settlers may have made the Mission neophytes (converted natives) homesick for their ancestral lifestyle. In January 1898 after a crackdown on neophyte fornication a rainstorm damaged the mission and 138 neophytes escaped leaving only 30 to do the mission labors. Three months later 90 were caught and returned to the mission. The padres used this as proof that settlers had a bad influence on Mission discipline and that settlement funds should wait until a ‚Äúlegal‚Äù site was found elsewhere.

The next batch of 22 settlers arrived in Monterey on March 31 1798 and Borica learned the soldiers had been withheld for the war effort sending instead Guanajuato convicts so hardened only six were permitted to live in Branciforte. Unable to build in adobe the settlers resorted to building six homes of split logs rammed upright in the earth as palisades and covered in a thatched roof.

While each family was assigned ranch land they were not allowed to live on it only in town where guards could watch them. Workers were to end each day at the guard house reciting the rosary had mandatory church attendance and at one point were forbidden any trips to the gambling mecca of San Jose. Every week guards would go through each house to make sure they had all their assigned goods. They were not allowed to sell or exchange them for needed supplies or gamble them away. Punishments were fines whippings or hours in the stocks.

Viceroy Branciforte left office in May 1798 leaving Borica as the Villa‚Äôs last advocate. In 1799 Borica grew ill and requested retirement to Mexico but stayed into 1800 to settle 10 veterans at the Villa. The new Viceroy Azanza was loath to send money to build a Villa glorifying the ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù Branciforte. Borica returned to Mexico and was dead within six months. His successor Gov. Pedro de Alberni spent all his time in Loreto Baja California and Monterey couldn‚Äôt further the Villa‚Äôs construction without the governor present.

In his absence Brancifortians feared Alberni could only know them through government criminal records and the Padres‚Äô depiction of gun-toating convicts undermining the morals of Mission neophytes. The Mission blocked Villa use of water arable land and funds hoping to force the Villa to fail. Yet the settlers were not allowed to speak for themselves simply because they had no political government. However the Plan of Pitic said once a settlement surpassed 30 residents they could elect their own leaders. Branciforte had reached 83 residents in 1801.

Taking the initiative they elected an Alcalde (judge-mayor) several City Councilmen and a Justice of the Peace thus becoming the birthplace of Democracy in Spanish California.

Politically Villa de Branciforte was the opposite of what the Spanish wanted. Far from defending the coast for the Empire they were the first to call for California‚Äôs independence from Spain the first to call for the closing of the Mission system and the first to welcome non-Spanish settlers.

Santa Cruz may credit its activist streak to the settlers of Villa de Branciforte.

This dynamic duo used their math physics and electrical engineering skills to revolutionize computer graphic imaging technology. They literally built the first computer graphics simulation engines and they and their students pioneered the field of CGI (Computer Graphics Imagery). Out of their labs came Adobe Pixar Atari Xerox and PARC a subsidiary of Xerox which invented the first GUI (graphical user interface and which Apple copied and built into the Macintosh) and a host of graphic simulation engines used by the U.S. Military.

How did this happen in the sixties when Utah was just a small blip on the tech pioneer map?

In 1965 the University of Utah recruited Evans to establish a state of the art computer science program. In 1968 he convinced his friend from Berkeley Ivan Sutherland to leave his teaching position at Harvard and move to Utah which he agreed to do under the condition that they would eventually launch a computer graphics company together.

This power collaboration shaped the history of the computer industry and built one of the most influential university computer graphics programs in the country. Students were encouraged to experiment and discover creative solutions based on the theory that computers could be used interactively for a variety of tasks.

Evans and Sutherland envisioned the use of computers as simulators by using graphics technology to replace real objects aiding in cheaper costs for military and other development projects. The genesis of the Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation (E&S) started in the barracks on the University of Utah campus with students recruited from the university. E&S made advances in real-time hardware accelerated 3D computer graphics and printer languages and continues today as a major supplier of military and commercial graphics systems.

The creative and inventive atmosphere Evans and Sutherland fostered as professors and employers stimulated some of the most successful minds in the field of computer science. Many of Evans and Sutherland‚Äôs students went on to further expand the field including Alan Kay inventor of Smalltalk language; Ewin Catmull cofounder of Pixar and currently President of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios; John Warnock the founder of Adobe; and Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics.

In Robert Rivlin‚Äôs book The Algorithmic Image: Graphic Visions of the Computer Age he says ‚ÄúAlmost every influential person in the modern computer-graphics community either passed through the University of Utah or came into contact with it in some way.‚Äù

67% of Japanese consumers answered that they used to use online shopping frequently or regularly even before the pandemic or March 2020. Out of all non-online shoppers last year 80% bought something online this year.

Japanese visitors to online retail shops were up 19% and a total of order amount was also up 15%. The conversion rate however was down 16% and the average time to stay in a shop and page views a visit have been declining in the last three years.

By device sales on smart phone was up 61% in Japan the highest ratio among five target countries. The ratios were particularly high at 65% among Millennium Generation and at 48% among Generation X.

In the meanwhile the ratio of Japanese consumers who avoided visiting a real shop was 35% higher than 23% in US or 26% in UK maybe because of slower vaccination than others.

Interestingly more than half of Japanese consumers (52%) answered that they will not change their online shopping behaviors even after the pandemic.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2lmLWludmVzdGVkLTUwMDAtaW4tYW1kLTIwMTUtaG93LW11Y2gtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Invested $5000 in AMD in 2015 This Is How Much You Would Have Today,"Advanced Micro Devices has delivered massive returns over the past six years for risk-tolerant patient investors.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.41%) became one of the more notable comeback stories of the last few years. The chip stock bounced back as CEO Lisa Su orchestrated a comeback and built a technical lead on longtime rival Intel (INTC 0.48%). Consequently investors who dared to buy the stock at the lows hit in 2015 when many feared bankruptcy have earned a high-risk but massive reward.

AMD stock fell to a low of $1.61 per share in July 2015. At this level $5000 would have bought an investor around 3105 shares. At the current price of roughly $91 per share this investment would hold a value of about $282640 -- a return of approximately 5550%. This far exceeds the roughly 110% return for the S&P 500 over the same period. Also the stock may have more room to grow as many analysts still consider AMD a hot growth stock.

AMD in 2015

One can forgive investors for not wanting to buy AMD in the summer of 2015. At that time AMD and other PC-related chip stocks such as Intel and NVIDIA (NVDA -1.09%) found themselves supporting what many saw as a dying product. Once companies such as Apple and Samsung introduced consumers to smartphones and later tablets many consumers felt they no longer needed PCs. In 2015 alone PC sales fell by more than 8% marking what was at the time the fourth consecutive year of declining sales according to Gartner.

This hit AMD particularly hard since it had consistently lagged Intel in market share. According to Passmark Software Intel controlled 77% of the PC market in mid-2015 and that percentage had steadily climbed since 2012.

Furthermore due to the three- to five-year cycles required for developing chips an AMD comeback looked like a gamble at best. Since Su had only become CEO the year before investors had no way of knowing if her plan would succeed.

How Su changed AMD

It would also take more than a successful career to convince investors that Su could turn AMD around. After graduating with a doctorate from MIT she worked for both Texas Instruments and IBM later rising to the chief technology officer position at Freescale Semiconductor. Su then started at AMD in 2012 as senior vice president and general manager of global business units before becoming CEO.

Su applied her engineering and business experience to bet the company's fortunes on high-performance CPUs and GPUs letting other businesses fall by the wayside. Also Intel had prospered through the tick-tock cycle advancing manufacturing in ""tick"" years and offering new microarchitecture during the ""tock"" cycle. To buy time AMD pursued both processes simultaneously according to an interview Su gave to CNN.

Through these efforts AMD released its first Ryzen and Epyc processors in 2017. This helped send the stock above $10 per share by January of that year. In time AMD began challenging NVIDIA in the GPU space. It won several contracts and today AMD processors help power Tesla's vehicles as well as gaming consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and the Sony PlayStation. Moreover due to internal problems at Intel AMD took a technical lead in the CPU space. Now AMD sells 7nm processors at a time when Intel has delayed the release of 7nm processors until 2022. This should ensure AMD's technical lead for the foreseeable future.

Putting the AMD comeback into perspective

The AMD story shows how much investors can profit from taking a chance on a troubled stock.

To be clear though articles like this do not convey the dangers risks and emotions that come with buying a stock below $2 per share when investors see no concrete prospects for recovery. You can lose everything on such holdings and you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.

Still as AMD has shown these investments can sometimes succeed -- even wildly succeed. If you have some spare cash a small position in such a company could deliver outsized returns to the risk-tolerant patient investor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3RzbWMtZWFybnMtcmVjb3JkLXJldmVudWUtaW4tanVuZS10by1wb3N0LXN0cm9uZy1zZWNvbmQtcXVhcnRlci0yMDIxLXNhbGVzL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3RzbWMtZWFybnMtcmVjb3JkLXJldmVudWUtaW4tanVuZS10by1wb3N0LXN0cm9uZy1zZWNvbmQtcXVhcnRlci0yMDIxLXNhbGVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSMC Earns Record Revenue In June To Post Strong Second Quarter 2021 Sales,"This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) revenue for the second quarter of 2021 has grown significantly year-over-year reveals data shared by the company today. TSMC earned NT$148 million in revenue in June it outlined earlier today with the revenue demonstrating a 28% year-over-year growth over June 2020. The growth comes as demand for semiconductors remains high and analysts question whether current supply levels will outstrip demand next year or as 2021 comes to a close.

TSMC Sustained Multi-Year Revenue Growth In Second Quarter 2021 After Posting Record Revenue Last Month

In addition to sharing its financial data during regular reports TSMC also lists down the revenue that it earned each month on its investor relations website. The company's revenue for the previous month shows that sales were strongest in June pushing revenues higher than what it had earned in the preceding months.

Additionally it marks a significant growth over the previous year's performance as the demand for technology products booms in the consumer electronics and other sectors. This demand has been helped by new products launched by several semiconductor companies and the booming orders from automotive manufacturers who have dealt with a pandemic-induced component shortage nearly throughout this year after cutting down their product demand forecasts last year.

When added to TSMC's revenues in April and May the June revenue pushes the contract chip manufacturer towards 20% year-over-year and 3% sequential growth. Both of the growth metrics are higher than what TSMC achieved last year. At the end of its second quarter of 2020 it posted NT$311 million revenue which was flat sequentially and 30% higher annually.

During the full second quarter the Taiwanese fab brought in NT$372 million making it one of its strongest quarters. In comparison the first quarter allowed TSMC to rake in NT$362 million and 2020's March quarter brought it NT$310 million through sales. The first half of the year is generally a slow one for TSMC whose major customers often procure their orders as the year matures.

A snippet from TSMC's investor relations website showing its monthly revenues for 2021.

At its upcoming earnings release for the previous quarter TSMC's management might provide details bout what it expects the future to hold. Some quarters believe that the current demand for semiconductors only reflects a 'demand-boom' ushered in by the ongoing pandemic and worry whether a buildup of inventory with the company's customers will reduce this demand moving forward.

Some TSMC's customers such as Santa Clara California-based chip designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) and Cupertino tech giant Apple Inc have either launched new products or plan to do so in the near future. Apple's plans for the iPhone and a new notebook computer and the demand for AMD's products such as graphics processing units (GPUs) will influence the creation of this hypothetical supply glut.

More importantly the world's largest personal computing chipmaker Intel Corporation has also reportedly sought access to TSMC's advanced chipmaking process technologies. Intel is the only company in the world that manufacturers its own processors for the x86 computing microarchitecture and the company's chip processes have traditionally enjoyed a strong advantage over rivals such as TSMC or South Korean chaebol Samsung Electronics' chip foundry arm Samsung Foundry.

However this lead which now requires the latest chip manufacturing machines from a Dutch firm is believed by many to have been reduced. Conventional monikers for chip processes often describe them through one of the dimensions of a transistor - billions of which are present on modern-day processors graphics processing units and other silicon products built with newer technologies.

TSMC's '5nm' process node is theoretically equivalent to Intel's 7nm node and some industry watchers speculate that it is equivalent to the latter's older 10nm node. Intel expects to manufacture and ship its 7nm products next year which is when TSMC will churn out chips manufactured on its 3nm node.

The Taiwanese company is also building a chip plant in the American state of Arizona which it expects to be operational from 2024. This facility intends to produce 5nm chips but TSMC should expand it to include newer processes should its customers express the need suggest previous management practices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYWJlLXJ1dGgtbWlja2V5LW1hbnRsZS1vdGhlci0xOTA4MDA5ODkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Babe Ruth Mickey Mantle other sports cards sell for over $21.5 million in auction,"Babe Ruth Mickey Mantle other sports cards sell for over $21.5 million in auction

A Florida doctor's collection of sports cards and memorabilia has fetched a total of more than $21.5 million in a public auction that ended on Sunday.

Dr. Thomas Newman of Tampa who assembled the collection over the course of five decades died of COVID-19 complications in January at the age of 73. He left behind a treasure trove of rare items including a 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth card (graded PSA 9 on a scale of 1 to 10) and a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card.

The 1933 Ruth card -- which Newman purchased for $20000 in the mid-1990s -- was the single most valuable item in the collection selling for $4212000 according to Memory Lane Auctions.

Three of the most valuable items in Dr. Thomas Newman's collection are (from left) a 1916 Sporting News Babe Ruth rookie card a 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth card and a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card.

In addition a 1916 Sporting News rookie card of Ruth sold for $1452000. The 1952 Mickey Mantle card (PSA 8) brought in $2112200.

All prices include a 20% buyer‚Äôs fee and reflect the final price paid by the winning bidders.

The collection included over 1000 baseball football and hockey items some dating back as far as the 1880s.

""He was just a quiet collector. He didn‚Äôt brag about it to anybody. Only his friends and close family really knew it"" Newman's widow Nancy Newman told USA TODAY Sports in May. ""He‚Äôd get them out and play with them. He called them his ‚Äòpaper babies.‚Äô‚Äù

Newman said her husband kept the most valuable cards in a safe in their Tampa home while others were stored in locked closets and cabinets or at his office.

""Until he died I didn‚Äôt really have a figure (on their value). It was surprising"" she said. ""I did know it was a lot but not this many millions.""

NVIDIA (NVDA -1.09%) shareholders have been benefiting mightily from the ongoing chip shortage as well as from the popularity of the company's offerings for GPU-based applications. The chip stock has rallied by nearly 240% since January 2020.

The magnitude of that surge has plenty of investors questioning whether there's still a chance to buy in or if they have essentially missed out on their opportunity to profit from this particular rally. Let's take a closer look at NVIDIA and attempt to provide an answer.

The state of the stock

NVIDIA's share price has increased by just over 100% in the last 12 months and its scheduled four-for-one stock split is less than two weeks away.

That stock price surge has taken NVIDIA's P/E ratio to almost 95. The stock has not seen such high valuations since the early 2000s. Moreover when NVIDIA rallied in late 2016 and early 2018 P/E multiples above 50 amounted to sell signals -- the stock plummeted soon after hitting those levels.

Additionally it has become expensive compared to its peers. Archrival AMD sells for under 40 times earnings Qualcomm trades at 20 times earnings and Intel sports a P/E ratio of less than 13.

Competitive advantages

On the positive side NVIDIA possessives competitive edges in a number of tech niches. It has gained traction in the cryptocurrency space with a popular and powerful GPU specifically designed for mining digital tokens. It has built a presence in the realm of supercomputers -- its Cambridge-1 supercomputer will be used by businesses and academics to accelerate research in healthcare and genomics. Furthermore assuming its proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings goes through it could further widen its competitive moat as many manufacturers use Arm's chips in devices such as digital TVs and smartphones.

And its longtime core products -- GPUs for video gaming -- are helping it foster innovations in the growing market for artificial intelligence systems. Its chips will power key applications in self-driving cars data centers and cloud computing among others. Additionally its AI-on-5G platform will also aid in deploying AI-based applications across 5G networks.

Financials and outlook

Given these innovations investors can easily understand how NVIDIA's successes have boosted its financials. In its fiscal 2022 first quarter which ended May 2 revenue rose 84% year over year to $5.66 billion. This included a 106% increase in gaming revenue and a 79% surge in data center revenue.

That lifted its GAAP net income by 109% to over $1.9 billion. Slower growth in operating expenses along with a boost in earnings from unrealized gains contributed to the bottom-line gains.

That performance for the most recently reported quarter also outpaced NVIDIA's results for its full fiscal 2021 when revenue rose 53% and GAAP net income increased 55%.

The company saw nearly $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the latest quarter and close to $4.7 billion in fiscal 2021.

Nonetheless its outlook may give investors pause. For its fiscal Q2 the company expects revenue to be within 2 percentage points of $6.3 billion a massive increase from the $3.9 billion it reported in the same quarter last year. However the company declined to offer an outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. This could reflect management's uncertainty about macro conditions as global economies attempt to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic.

Should I still consider NVIDIA?

Although the company's long-term growth story could easily continue investors may want to avoid NVIDIA stock for now. Management's decision not to provide an outlook beyond Q2 indicates it could hit a rough patch ahead. Moreover it doesn't appear wise to pay almost 95 times earnings for this chipmaker under current conditions especially when the stock rarely traded at a P/E ratio above 50 before 2021. While it may not be too late to buy NVIDIA stock investors should probably assume that they have missed out on the chance to benefit from this rally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zb24tcmVzdG9yZXMtcGFyZW50cy1iZWxvdmVkLW11c2NsZS0xOTAwMDA2NDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Son Restores His Parents' Beloved Muscle Car,"‚ö°Ô∏è Read the full article on Motorious

Looks like he was raised right.

It‚Äôs hard to let a beloved old car go even if it‚Äôs in bad shape. That‚Äôs why this couple in Australia kept the Ford Falcon XA Superbird they purchased brand new in 1973 even after it was in a rollover crash and sat on their farm for two decades. We‚Äôve featured many cars which have sat in the elements rotting away which is a sight that saddens and even angers enthusiasts. Thankfully this story involves the Ford getting a full restoration thanks to the son.

Tommy decided his parents‚Äô muscle car had sat in a state of disrepair more than long enough. He took on the restoration work and took five years to complete it. When all was said and done he dropped $106300 breathing life into the vehicle. Not everyone has those kinds of financial means but if you do it‚Äôs a great way to spend the money.

Part of what made the restoration work so long was the painstaking attention to correct details. If you‚Äôve restored a car and cared about accuracy you know it‚Äôs a far more involved process filled with delays and puzzles.

This wasn‚Äôt just any car it was the family vehicle. Tommy and his siblings had a lot of precious memories tied to it. As you can see in the video when he shows the restored Superbird to his parents it‚Äôs an emotional moment.

As Americans we‚Äôre obviously not that familiar with the Superbirdthat isn‚Äôt a Mopar. However it‚Äôs obvious the setup was made for fun performance. An Australian Ford 302ci 4V Cleveland V8 provides plenty of power. Helping keep that in check is a 3-speed Cruisomatic transmission plus a rear end with differential and 2.92:1 ratio.

What really makes this Australian muscle car impressive to everyone is the factory color called Lime Glaze. Tommy‚Äôs parents purchased this car with power disc brakes a sport handling suspension and rear louvres already installed. The black vinyl interior has also been restored to its factory condition. That includes seatbelts the sport console carpeting and other optional equipment.

So when COVID-19 hit and no one was inviting people indoors he turned to the air-cleaning part of his operation.

He sent cards in the mail advertising air purifiers using ActivePure technology to new homeowners: ‚ÄúKILL COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS IN YOUR HOME!!‚Äù

One card landed on the desk of a postal inspector who called it false and misleading in a court record. Shumaker then told an undercover agent on the phone on April 24 2020 that the air purifier ‚Äúkills the Coronavirus Virus on the spot‚Äù according to a criminal complaint.

Weeks later as Shumaker was heading out the door to his daughter‚Äôs tennis tournament eight law enforcement officers detained him. In August he pleaded guilty to distributing ‚Äúa pesticide device that was misbranded in that the product label was missing an EPA establishment number.‚Äù In other words he failed to follow the letter of a little-known law.

Shumaker told KHN he was just a salesperson and the devices were being shipped straight from the manufacturer. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt know‚Äîwhat am I supposed to do?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHow do I know if there‚Äôs a sticker on there or not? I don‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù

The company that makes the devices ActivePure Technologies said Shumaker was not an authorized or known salesperson of its products.

The sting is a rare example of enforcement in an arena where money is gushing like a geyser but oversight is nearly nonexistent. Electronic air cleaners heavily marketed to gyms doctors‚Äô offices and hospitals companies and schools awash in federal COVID relief funds tend to use high-voltage charges to alter molecules in the air. The companies selling the devices say they can destroy pathogens and clean the air.

But academic air quality experts say the technology can be ineffective or potentially create harmful byproducts. Companies that make the devices are subject to virtually no standardized testing or evaluation of their marketing claims. A KHN investigation this spring found that over 2000 schools across the country have bought such technology.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the reasons these companies thrive is that there‚Äôs nobody nobody checking every aspect of what they do‚Äù said Delphine Farmer a Colorado State University associate professor who specializes in atmospheric and indoor chemistry.

Regulatory patchwork

An alphabet soup of federal agencies have truth-in-advertising or product medical device oversight powers but have done little about air cleaners or left broad loopholes. That has left a handful of states to take the most decisive action on the industry.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not regulate the devices but like academic air quality experts recommends time-tested portable HEPA filters to clean the air in rooms. In comparison ionizing and dry hydrogen peroxide air purifiers have a ‚Äúless-documented track record‚Äù in air cleaning the CDC says.

The CDC also urges consumers to research the technology and ‚Äúrequest testing data.‚Äù Those reports though can be difficult to parse. They include arcane terms like ‚Äúnatural decay‚Äù and test conditions that only an expert could spot as different from those that prevail in real life.

The Food and Drug Administration regulates medical devices. But only air purifiers for a direct medical use or that make a medical claim like relieving allergies qualify. The FDA doesn‚Äôt consider ads saying a device can kill a microorganism a ‚Äúmedical claim‚Äù spokesperson Shirley Simson said in an email.

Instead the air purifiers fall under the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs authority as devices marketed to destroy ‚Äúpests‚Äù which include bacteria or viruses. But ‚Äúunlike chemical pesticides the EPA does not register devices and therefore does not routinely review their safety or efficacy‚Äù the agency said.

Trying to fill the gaps California bans the sale of air purifiers that emit more than a certain level of the toxic ozone gas. The New York State Education Department is ‚Äúnot recommending‚Äù that schools buy air purifiers it describes as ‚Äúion generators‚Äù or ‚Äúcorona discharge technology.‚Äù

Jeffrey Siegel a University of Toronto civil engineering professor who studies indoor air quality said more meaningful national regulation might clarify for consumers how the devices would work in an actual room.

‚ÄúIf you get any serious government oversight a big chunk of this industry will go away‚Äù said Siegel.

‚ÄòI was alone‚Äô

While ‚Äúpesticide‚Äù might evoke the idea of a roach killer the EPA applies the term more broadly: A pesticide is any substance that claims to kill or mitigate pests. Technologies that claim to do the same through physical means‚Äîincluding air purifiers that inactivate bacteria and viruses‚Äîare considered pesticide devices.

And while the agency requires proof that pesticides such as some types of Clorox wipes are safe and work in its premarket review it has no such requirement for so-called pesticide devices‚Äîsuch as electronic air cleaners that deploy ions or ‚Äúreactive oxygen‚Äù to purify the air.

Instead manufacturers need to obtain what‚Äôs known as an establishment number indicating where the device is made and then they and their sellers must label their products with it. That‚Äôs the step Shumaker pleaded guilty to skipping.

‚ÄúThere is no review associated with that‚Äù said James Votaw a lawyer who specializes in chemical regulation law at Keller and Heckman in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThat is automatic. It‚Äôs like trying to get license plates for your car.‚Äù

So Shumaker told KHN he was baffled as to why he was targeted instead of the corporate level which in this case would be the company Aerus which is now ActivePure Technologies. Dr. Deborah Birx former adviser to President Donald Trump joined ActivePure in March as chief medical and science adviser.

‚ÄúI was alone‚Äù Shumaker said in an interview about facing charges. ‚ÄúNobody backed me up.‚Äù

Joe Urso CEO of ActivePure Technologies told KHN that its studies showing its devices inactivate the virus that causes COVID were not completed until the fall long after the postcards were sent. Urso said in a statement that his company‚Äôs devices do have establishment numbers and that he supports the ruling against Shumaker.

Federal Trade Commission officials have written warning letters to some air cleaner companies during the pandemic. The commission requires claims about a product‚Äôs safety and efficacy to be supported with ‚Äúcompetent and reliable scientific evidence.‚Äù

One of the last high-profile actions the FTC took against an air purifier company was in 1997 when the Justice Department filed an action on its behalf against Alpine Industries which made ozone-generating air purifiers. In 2001 a judge fined Alpine $1.49 million for failing to stop making unsubstantiated claims about its devices which it had said relieved allergies and removed indoor pollutants.

Alpine is a related company to EcoQuest International according to the FTC. And a majority of EcoQuest International assets were bought in 2009 by ActivePure Technologies according to its 2021 press kit. ActivePure makes the device Shumaker got into trouble for selling.

Siegel of the University of Toronto consulted with U.S. government agencies targeting the misleading marketing claims of some air-cleaner companies about 10 years ago. He finds the company-by-company approach to be a game of ‚Äúwhack-a-mole.‚Äù

‚ÄúA company goes away because they have regulatory scrutiny and reinvent themselves a few months later‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only solution I see to this problem is a government agency really takes ownership of this ‚Äî the information dissemination to consumers and the claims by manufacturers. I see no other path forward.‚Äù

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just buyer beware‚Äô

The Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act which regulates pesticide devices was written decades ago and applied to things such as flypaper long before anyone anticipated machines that would blast ions to clean the air.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just pushing EPA to try and get updated‚Äù said Patrick Jones president of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just buyer beware.‚Äù

Even before the COVID pandemic Jones‚Äô group was ringing the alarm over the increasing public health claims around pesticide devices. The pesticide control association wrote in a 2019 public comment to the EPA of its concern about the growing use in health care facilities of ‚Äúnon-government evaluated pesticide devices that make unsubstantiated human health claims‚Ä¶with no scientific data being submitted to EPA to prove their effectiveness.‚Äù

EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said in an email that the agency is developing more outreach materials for schools on air purifiers.

But as few independent authorities assess the effectiveness of the devices school officials have been snapping them up.

Last summer the private St. Thomas More School in Kansas City Missouri bought ionizing air purifiers to fight COVID. Scott Dulle the director of building and grounds said he went with technology he saw health leaders buying.

‚ÄúWe followed the doctors and the hospitals and the government‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey would not put their patients and staff in harm‚Äôs way.‚Äù

AAPCO‚Äôs Jones said changes to federal oversight are needed to better deal with the flood of devices. His solution: If a pesticide device makes a public health claim it should be evaluated with the same rigor used for pesticides like ant spray.

But to alter the law fundamentally would take congressional action EPA‚Äôs Carroll said.

The EPA can prosecute pesticide device companies and sellers under existing laws if a product makes misleading or false claims‚Äîand fines can reach into the millions according to Brandon Neuschafer a lawyer who specializes in agricultural regulations at the St. Louis-based firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. He noted companies are often turned in by their competitors.

Last fiscal year Carroll said the agency issued 19 import refusal notices and sent six advisory letters for COVID-related air-purifying products‚Äîa small fraction of its 2020 pesticide actions. Carroll said such investigations are ongoing and a high priority.

But EPA‚Äôs resources were not the same as they were many years ago Neuschafer said as the agency is working with smaller staffing and budgets.

‚ÄòWorse indoor air quality‚Äô

Almost a decade before COVID emerged New York‚Äôs education department asked state health officials to test an AtmosAir bipolar ionization unit to see if it would improve the air quality.

During a test in an empty classroom they found that levels of harmful ozone gas and ‚Äúultrafine particles‚Äù that can cause cardiovascular problems were elevated indicating ‚Äúworse indoor air quality when the AtmosAir Bipolar ionization unit is operating‚Äù the 2013 state Bureau of Toxic Substance Assessment report said.

New York State Department of Health officials released the study in response to a KHN public records request about the education department‚Äôs COVID-era guidance which urges schools not to buy ionizers.

AtmosAir spokesperson Sarah Berman said the device studied in 2013 is discontinued and ‚Äúall current products have no affiliation to‚Äù it. She also said in an email that tests by third-party labs found that ‚Äúour bipolar ionization products do not contribute to unacceptable levels‚Äù of volatile organic compounds which are potentially harmful substances.

The California Department of Public Health advised in September against using ‚Äúair cleaning devices that generate harmful pollutants (i.e. ionization devices or ozone generators)‚Äù on the third page of a single-spaced 44-page document. That guidance was widely overlooked. Districts from Berkeley to Fontana to Culver City bought ionization systems.

But the state does have a one-of-a-kind law: It bans air purifiers that emit anything above a certain level of ozone.

New Jersey doesn‚Äôt have the same kind of regulation: KHN reported that a public school district there bought thousands of ozone-emitting Odorox devices on the California Air Resources Board‚Äôs list of ‚Äúpotentially hazardous‚Äù air purifiers. Since then the New Jersey health department posted guidance warning schools about the air purifiers ‚Äúthat may harm health‚Äù listing the specific hazards of ozone to children‚Äôs health.

Back in Georgia Shumaker was fined more than $9000 and is on two years‚Äô probation.

And the postcards that got him into trouble? Those led to only a handful of sales. ‚ÄúSo it was just like setting money on fire‚Äù he said.

KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues. Together with Policy Analysis and Polling KHN is one of the three major operating programs at KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). KFF is an endowed nonprofit organization providing information on health issues to the nation.",,,,,,,,,

One host said he made $160K in a year,"When a wildfire raged through the Great Smoky Mountains in 2016 burning over 17000 acres of land some Gatlinburg neighborhoods had no plans of rebuilding.

Two years later Zack Shields his mom and stepdad got to work. Lot by lot. Cabin by cabin.

Between the three of them 10 of the 13 lots in one Gatlinburg community were bought and they began rebuilding. But Shields' mom and her husband realized managing properties wasn't for them so Shields took over.

Now in 2021 Shields owns two properties manages another two and is in the process of building seven more which are scheduled to be done by 2023.

According to short-term rental analytics company AirDNA Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge are ranked No. 5 and No. 6 respectively on the Best Places to Own Rental Property for 2020-21 list. Sevierville is ranked third behind Palm Springs and La Quinta California.

There are over 1800 active properties in Gatlinburg with an annual revenue potential of $55439 according to AirDNA. In Pigeon Forge there are over 1000 active properties with an annual revenue potential of $51857.

Shields said it's possible to clear $55000 in three months depending on the season. In the summer his properties bring in between $15000 to $18000 a month. But during slow months like January and February the average is about $5000 to $7000.

Buying into the investing game

Shields got in the investment property game right out of college.

He bought his first house near the University of Central Florida in Orlando in 2013 about a year after he graduated and charged two of his friends for rent. When he moved to California in 2015 he kept the house and rented it out. He made a small profit he said but it paid off.

His entrepreneurial nature carried over into his mom and stepdad's venture to Gatlinburg in 2017.

When Shields' mom remarried they celebrated with a cross-country RV trip and passed through Gatlinburg. That's when they learned of the wildfire from the year before. They relocated from Florida to the Gatlinburg area bought some land and started building. Within months their first cabin was listed on Airbnb and Shields couldn't believe the outcome.

""I had never seen real estate give those kind of returns and though it just seemed way too good to be true"" Shields said. ""It wasn‚Äôt.""

In 2018 the three of them purchased 10 of 13 lots in a burned down neighborhood.

Managing rental properties through a pandemic

Shields first solo cabin business venture went online in March 2020.

""Perfect timing"" Shields said. ""Three days before my loan was supposed to close I received a call from my lender and they were shutting down with no re-opening date in site.""

Things were not looking good Shields said. The vacation rental business and the real estate business were unpredictable as ever. All of his family's properties sat vacant for about two months.

But in late May of last year the bookings across his family's properties started to roll in.

Shields put his cabin on the market again in June 2020 when it could actually be rented out. It was booked 100% through August he said. In August he was able to close on the cabin with his lender.

""It was absolutely insane he said. ""Gatlinburg was poppin'.""

Shields said from June 2020 to May 2021 the gross revenue for the cabin was about $160000.

Next door is Shields' second property that was finished this week. Now in the furnishing phase the Airbnb is online. Within hours Shields said he had three confirmed bookings‚Äî and he hadn't even uploaded photos yet. These bookings would bring in about $5000 a week he said.

""Why someone would pay $5000 for a cabin that they haven‚Äôt even seen photos of yet is beyond me but it happened multiple times"" Shields said.

This property is expected to bring in about $200000 in revenue annually Shields said.

The two properties that Shields manages that belong to his mom and stepdad bring in about $100000 a year each he said.

Gatlinburg vs. Nashville rental home market

Shields said he has seven cabins left to build ‚Äî but he's probably going to be a little bit closer to the action this time around. In the next three to five years Shields is looking to expand his vacation rental homes into the Nashville market.

Nashville is ranked No. 18 on financial company IPX1031's ""Best Cities to Invest in Airbnb"" list compiled from data made available by short-term rental analytics database AirDNA. A host can make $17100 a year based on the average $209/night price.

The Nashville rental home market is where another Airbnb investor and YouTuber Michael Elefante thrives. In a TikTok video Elefante shared how much his two Nashville and two Gatlinburg properties made in June.

For four vacation rental homes Elefante said the revenue totaled over $65000 before operating expenses and debt service were factored in. He said the total cash flow for the month of June was about $37500.

His Gatlinburg properties alone accounted for $26835 of the total cash flow for the month of June.

One property a renovated four-bedroom that sleeps up to 16 people was booked all 30 nights of June. The total revenue was over $22000 operating expenses totaled just over $2400 and the debt service was about $2000 so he made a $17655 profit.

The second Gatlinburg property is also a renovated four-bedroom house. It was booked 27 nights in June bringing in about $24200 in revenue. Operating expenses totaled over $3800 and the debt service was about $2000. After splitting this rental property with another investor in half he walked away with $9180 he said.

Home prices:Knoxville is rising faster than Nashville Tennessee and nationwide

According to grandviewresearch.com the global vacation rental market ‚Äî an $87 billion industry ‚Äî is expected to grow 3.4% from 2020-27.

Shields spoke to his cabin-owning friends and even in the worst economic times ‚Äî COVID-19 and The Great Recession ‚Äî there's always family reunions there's always bachelorette parties and there's always vacations.

""Despite the very lucrative financial aspect it's also rewarding to read reviews of amazing memories that families were able to make for visiting my properties"" Shields said. ""Or hearing the excitement on my security cameras when they open the door for the first time.""

Crow Island's new owner has big plans

Crow Island once described in the late 1800s as place where squatters built their lean-tos and shanties has a new owner who is working to convert the island into an Airbnb.

Al Santos bought the island about two years ago and while he isn‚Äôt making any drastic changes to the main house he has spruced up the landscaping and the nautical artistic pieces and sculptures that dot the grounds.

The island had been owned since 1979 by Carl Pimentel the New Bedford entrepreneur and restaurateur who owned the Smuggler‚Äôs Den nightclub in New Bedford‚Äôs South End. Pimentel turned the property into his own private paradise and kept it that way until his death in August 2018.

Ever notice that fork in the road?

There‚Äôs a larger-than-life carving of an actual fork placed at the River and Old Harbor Roads split .in Westport and it's the brainchild of Tom Schmitt who constructed the fork back in 2010 after the idea came to him when he was at a local sawmill to get wood for a different project.

The project kept him busy as he pieced the fork together using a real fork for scale.

The fork gets dressed up for the holidays. It dons a heart for Valentine‚Äôs Day a Santa had on Christmas and a hot dog on the Fourth of July.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Anyone who has wandered around downtown Albemarle after 5 p.m. realizes there‚Äôs not much to see. Most of the area is sparse with few people around and few businesses open. It‚Äôs been a point of frustration for many residents who want to see a vibrant and exciting nightlife where they can relax and unwind after a busy day.

Joshua Hicks hopes his new business Badin Brews will inject some new life and energy into the area. He‚Äôs set to open at 124 S. First St. by July 20 if not sooner.

A native of Denton Hicks who grew up visiting Badin Lake with friends worked an assortment of odd jobs including in construction and as a massage therapist before finding his passion working at a bottle-house in Kernersville.

After gaining knowledge and insight about the industry and wanting the challenge of working for himself Hicks 43 decided a few years ago to open his own place.

‚ÄúI know the business I know everything that has to happen and I‚Äôm just tired of doing all the work and all that money going to someone else‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt if you‚Äôve got the time and the patience you can do it.‚Äù

After eyeing several small cities in the area he zeroed in on Albemarle precisely because it lacked the type of place he was wanting to open: somewhere people of all backgrounds could come together to bond over beer and fellowship.

Knowing that Pfeiffer University‚Äôs health sciences center had recently opened in downtown Hicks wanted a location close to the facility and one that had outdoor space.

‚ÄúHaving an outdoor area makes people feel grounded‚Äù he said.

He worked with Mark Donham the city‚Äôs former economic development director Joy Almond Main Street Manager and director of the Albemarle Downtown Development Corporation and Lee Allen broker and owner of Re/Max Town and Country who helped him secure the building a few months ago. He has already received several grants from the ADDC.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm always thrilled to see new faces in our downtown especially those who bring such a positive energy as Joshua Hicks has‚Äù Almond said in an email. ‚ÄúNot only has Josh put in a tremendous amount of work to breathe new life into a long-vacant space he also wants to use his business to create a lively atmosphere for the community to enjoy. I look forward to what is sure to be an amazing customer experience at Badin Brews.‚Äù

It became evident that people in the community were clamoring for this type of business Hicks said once he started an Instagram page about a month ago. Within about a week the social media account had more than 400 followers. The business also has an active Facebook page.

‚ÄúBeers are recession-proof‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople are going to drink in bad times and in good times and it‚Äôs something that brings people together. It‚Äôs a mood lifter.‚Äù

And there‚Äôs a strong trust that often forms between regular patrons and the bartenders that get to know them.

‚ÄúPeople tell bartenders things that they wouldn‚Äôt even tell their closest family members‚Äù Hicks said. ‚ÄúThey come in to get it off their chest.‚Äù

As for the name of the taphouse? Hicks said he was going through several possible options in his head and Badin Brews was simple and just sounded good.

‚ÄúI just wanted something that you could remember‚Äù he said.

The 2400-square-foot brick building which is painted bright blue and yellow can seat 35 people though there will be an outdoor patio with string lights and corn hole which will include extra seating. Hicks has a movie projector and wants to host weekly movie nights featuring classics like ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù and ‚ÄúGremlins.‚Äù

There will be 18 beers on tap featuring ones from Wicked Weed Brewing in Asheville Catawba Brewing in Charlotte and Deep River Brewing in Clayton along with six to eight wine options.

‚ÄúEvery style you can think of I‚Äôm gonna have‚Äù Hicks said about the beer options.

Hicks has already talked with local food truck operators who have expressed interest in collaborating. He plans to have several food trucks stationed outside the taphouse five nights a week (he‚Äôs even talked about eventually having a food truck festival) along with live music every weekend. Badin Brews will also have a variety of snacks for people to enjoy such as beef jerky peanuts and popcorn.

The taphouse will not just be geared exclusively for people 21 and older. Families with young kids can enjoy craft soda a foosball table and pool table arcade games and an array of board games.

As of now there are five employees including Madeline Hana who runs the social media and is one of the bartenders. She quickly applied for a job after the logo on the window piqued her interest.

Hana who‚Äôs from Albemarle is looking forward to meeting new people in the community.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be a really good place to pick up some new connections and good vibes‚Äù she said adding she thinks it will be an inclusive ‚Äúall-are-welcome-type atmosphere.‚Äù

Drawing from his many years of working in the industry Hicks hopes that while the drinks initially draw people into the taphouse the sense of community will keep them coming back.

‚ÄúThis is a place that they know they can come and bring their friends and family or meet new friends‚Äù he said.

Like the old adage ‚Äúa rising tide lifts all boats‚Äù Hicks hopes the potential success of Badin Brews can extend to the rest of the downtown and help other businesses.

‚ÄúI want to be the Pied Piper that leads all the businesses around here to stay open later‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bring the people if they can just rally behind me.‚Äù

The hours will be 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A day later the move received justificiation as it turned out Annett had suffered a leg injury that will also force him out of the seat for the Xfinity Series event at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Austin Dillon will replace him in the #1 JR Motorsports car.

With less than an hour before the Xfinity Series‚Äô Credit Karma Money 250 Annett pulled himself from the driver‚Äôs seat due to his injury; specifics of the ailment such as when it occurred and if it will impact his schedule were not disclosed beyond it happening to the leg. The injury forced him to abort the Knoxville Truck start which would have been his first in the series since 2014 after only participating in practice.

As there was not much time before the green flag JR Motorsports approached Jordan Anderson and B.J. McLeod‚Äîboth owner/drivers at the track to oversee their respective teams‚Äîbefore deciding on Dillon. Incidentally Anderson‚Äôs driver Josh Berry is a JRM part-timer who has subtitute experience for Justin Haley at Dover in May and he also filled in for Kris Wright at the Atlanta Truck event in March. Such a process is not as simple as picking the most qualified driver as a team also has to ensure the replacement can fit into the original person‚Äôs seat.

Dillon a Cup Series driver running his main series‚Äô race on Sunday is the 2013 Xfinity champion. It will be his first Xfinity oval race since Indianapolis in 2019 though he has only raced sporadically in the series since 2018. He has top tens in all three starts at Atlanta with the most recent being an eighth in 2017.

‚ÄúWe were calling and scrambling and I‚Äôm gonna tell you right now: if I had my helmet and my HANS device I would have left you in a New York Minute Rick (Allen)‚Äù said JRM owner and NBC commentator Dale Earnhardt Jr. ‚ÄúWe went through a bunch of different drivers and reaching out to everybody scrambling to try to find out who was even here who could do the job. A lot of the Cup guys don‚Äôt come in until tomorrow[.]‚Äù

Had either been selected Anderson and McLeod would have easily received their best ride to date. According to Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic McLeod said it was ‚Äúa dream just to be considered.‚Äù

While Annett will likely receive a waiver to remain eligible for the playoffs missing the Atlanta race will leave him in a more precarious position to make the postseason. After seventeen races he is currently tenth in points with 67 points on twelfth-placed Brandon Brown who sits on the cut-off line. Annett was coming off his best finish of the season at Road America last Saturday where he finished third.

The #1 was set to start sixth but the driver change means Dillon will begin the day at the back.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That‚Äôs partly why when Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion the deal was such a shocker. The sticker price was generally referred to as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù Google may have overpaid for YouTube at the time but some consider it to be the best tech deal ever. Here‚Äôs why it was important for Google.

Video was about to be king on the web YouTube was launched in February 2005 by Steve Chen Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. Vimeo actually beat YouTube to the punch but it wasn‚Äôt well funded. YouTube was supported by Silicon Valley venture capital. Google Videos was actually a thing too but not a real ongoing concern as far as video destinations on the web went at the time. Related: YouTube Premium: Is it worth it? Here‚Äôs what you need to know

YouTube‚Äôs launch coincided with the famous Saturday Night Live ‚ÄúLazy Sunday‚Äù skit which helped bolster the video-sharing site‚Äôs visibility with the web-viewing public. After that it was off to the races. By July 2006 people were uploading 65000 videos per day and video views reached 100 million per day. In 2011 those numbers reached 48 hours of content being uploaded each minute and three billion views per day. Today the numbers are staggering. YouTube has 500 hours of content uploaded each minute and counts 2.3 billion monthly visitors. It‚Äôs a behemoth on the web. In fact it‚Äôs the second-most-visited website online after Google itself.

YouTube has 500 hours of content uploaded each minute.

User-generated content is central to YouTube‚Äôs success. Anyone and everyone can post videos to YouTube. (Check out Android Authority‚Äôs YouTube channel!) Google an ad-selling company knew that it could monetize YouTube videos. It later chose to share that revenue with content creators which in turn led to higher-quality content. It also led to the creation of YouTube superstars. Creators such as PewDiePie Little Nastya and Dude Perfect amassed tens of millions of subscribers and generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue and earnings.

The numbers game

YouTube‚Äôs own revenue climbed quickly. Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. It hit $800 million in revenue in 2010 and rose to $19.8 billion in revenue by 2020 representing about 10% of Google parent company Alphabet‚Äôs total revenue of $182 billion for that year. What‚Äôs unclear is how much profit YouTube generates.

Google has not shared details on the costs to run YouTube which are surely massive. Consider the storage requirements alone. The number of servers needed to host all those videos must create quite a drain on Alphabet‚Äôs finances. Then there‚Äôs all the cash that Google shares with top creators many of whom are multi-millionaires. More reading: How to set up a YouTube channel ‚Äî a step-by-step guide

Google hasn‚Äôt always been so lucky. Google famously paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility back in 2012. It later sold the company to Lenovo for $2.91 billion marking a massive $9.6 billion loss. Google also paid $1.1 billion for certain assets of smartphone maker HTC back in 2017 to boost its own Pixel smartphone business. It‚Äôs unclear what return on investment Google has received from that particular purchase. Other $1 billion-plus Google acquisitions include DoubleClick for $3.2 billion in 2007 Waze for $1 billion in 2013 Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014 Looker for $2.6 billion in 2019 and Fitbit for $2.1 billion in 2021. Google integrated these acquisitions into its existing product families and unfortunately the company doesn‚Äôt provide a detailed breakdown of its individual business units‚Äô performance in quarterly earning statements.

A Florida doctor's collection of sports cards and memorabilia has fetched a total of more than $21.5 million in a public auction that ended on Sunday.

Dr. Thomas Newman of Tampa who assembled the collection over the course of five decades died of COVID-19 complications in January at the age of 73. He left behind a treasure trove of rare items including a 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth card (graded PSA 9 on a scale of 1 to 10) and a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card.

The 1933 Ruth card -- which Newman purchased for $20000 in the mid-1990s -- was the single most valuable item in the collection selling for $4212000 according to Memory Lane Auctions.

The collection included over 1000 baseball football and hockey items some dating back as far as the 1880s.

The cigarette-maker which is owned by Altria Group bought the 18000-acre ranch in 1999 according to the Wall Street Journal which first reported the sale. A price was not given.

The buyer was Lone Mountain Land Co. a private equity firm that owns other resorts in the state including the Yellowstone Club in Big Sky.

Philip Morris hosted corporate events there and over the years offered all-expenses-paid trips to the ranch to thousands of loyal Marlboro smokers according to the Journal.

States like Montana Wyoming Colorado and other Western locales have seen a surge in homebuyers during the pandemic as urbanites paid big money for more space.

The uptick in demand for ranches and other large properties has also pushed up prices for those compounds which can have hundreds or thousands of acres.

Marlboro Ranch was known as Crazy Mountain Ranch before Philip Morris USA bought and renamed the property. It‚Äôs a working ranch with myriad hospitality facilities including an ‚ÄúOld Western Town‚Äù with a saloon hotel rooms an events barn and a spa. Because every Old West town had a spa.

Activities available to guests included horseback riding cattle driving snowmobiling clay pigeon shooting and fly fishing.

Amazon's 1997 shareholder letter offers brilliant business lessons from Jeff Bezos.

Alex Lieberman executive chairman and cofounder of Morning Brew recently posted on Twitter about those lessons.

His tweets outlining what Bezos did right have been reprinted with permission below.

Editor's note: The below article began as a Twitter thread and has been republished with permission.

Amazon's 1997 shareholder letter provides a glimpse into the brilliance of Jeff Bezos. It's a free MBA class in strategy and leadership. Here are four lessons from it.

Alex Lieberman.

Morning Brew



Lesson 1: Choose your words wisely

The letter is 1617 words. The word 'customer' occurs 25 times.

That word focuses Bezos and focuses the people that look to him for guidance. Jeff knows that while Amazon's mission is simple execution is nearly impossible.

To succeed the company's north star must be unmistakable to everyone. Everything in this letter comes back to the customer.

Lesson 2: Have conviction

Every great entrepreneur has one thing in common: Conviction.

It's about having a deep-rooted (likely contrarian) belief in an opportunity. An opportunity that is untapped undervalued and unappreciated.

Jeff Bezos shows wild conviction in the early days of Amazon. He sees a tidal wave that is the Internet and he knows that if Amazon is in the best position to surf that wave it'd become massive.

Lesson 3: Always acknowledge trade-offs

You can't be a clear thinker without being honest about a decision's trade-offs. Every decision has them. Despite his confidence Bezos saw incredible risk in Amazon's grand plan.

Jeff observed two major risks:

1) Other large public companies saw opportunity in the internet like he did

2) It's a market defined by network effects. Coming in second wasn't an option.







This meant speed and heavy investment were mandatory.

Lesson 4: Set expectations early and often

I have found that the No. 1 failure of managers is an inability to set expectations. Sometimes it's out of fear. Other times it's an inability to communicate. But it is crucial to building any business for the long-term.

Jeff Bezos does this masterfully. From day one he made it crystal clear to shareholders that investing in Amazon is opt-in. If you expect business performance quarterly ‚Ä¶ don't invest. If you expect business performance over the long-term ‚Ä¶ join the party.

CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Northeast Ohio‚Äôs transition away from an economy of heavy industries continues as the first tenant is revealed for the former Ford Motor Co. engine and casting plants in the Cleveland suburb of Brook Park. That tenant according to two sources familiar with the redevelopment is e-commerce giant Amazon.

The 210-acre Ford Motor Brook Park Target Industrial-Advanced Manufacturing Campus as the city calls it will involve a multi-phase redevelopment of the 1.7-million-square-foot Ford Engine Plant No. 2 and its neighboring Cleveland Casting Plant site.

In their place will be millions of square feet of warehousing logistics/shipping and light-industrial facilities representing a half-billion-dollar investment to serve what so far has been an insatiable market.

Once Ford‚Äôs remaining buildings on the site (not including the still-active Engine Plant No. 2) are cleared away new road sewer and utility infrastructure will be built. Then multiple new buildings will be constructed to serve big-name tenants offering thousands of jobs. Amazon represents only the first phase the sources said.

The 210-acre Ford Motor Brook Park Target Industrial-Advanced Manufacturing Campus is anticipated to add millions of square feet of new industrial and distribution facilities employing thousands of workers (Google/KJP).

Developing the site is a partnership of Weston Inc. of Warrensville Heights the DiGeronimo Cos. of Independence and Scannell Properties of Indianapolis IN. They created a joint venture called DROF BP I LLC (spells ‚ÄúFord‚Äù backwards and ‚ÄúBP‚Äù referring to Brook Park) which purchased the 210 acres of land in April for $31.5 million according to county records.

All three partners have experience in developing Amazon delivery stations and other distribution centers for other clients. In Northeast Ohio Weston built a 168750-square-foot speculative building in 2019 at 10801 Madison Ave. in Cleveland. NEOtrans was first to report Amazon would retrofit and lease the building from Weston. DiGeronimo Companies‚Äô Independence Construction was the building contractor.

In 2015 Scannell and DiGeronimo joined forces in redeveloping the Twinsburg Chrysler Stamping Plant that closed in 2010 into the Cornerstone Business Park. Among the buildings constructed was a 248000-square-foot Amazon distribution center representing an investment of $17 million.

When Brook Park‚Äôs two Ford plants closed in 2007 and 2012 nearly 3000 well-paid union workers and others lost their jobs. The casting plant was demolished in 2013. Its neighbor at 18300 Snow Rd. will soon follow said Brook Park Mayor Michael D. Gammella in his Summer 2021 newsletter to Brook Park residents.

Interior of an Amazon distribution center which is highly automated. But most centers employ hundreds if not thousands of workers inside the facility and in trucks and vans outside each Amazon distribution facility (Clay Corp.).

‚ÄúShortly you will see demolition crews leveling the old engine plant and aluminum foundry‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn its place will be a new building for a major corporation. Other new buildings will follow with even more new companies. This mega project will bring thousands of new jobs into our city. It is the beginning of a new era and there is more to come.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe project will absolutely be transformational to the region‚Äù said TJ Asher president of Weston‚Äôs Acquisitions and Development in a written statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking forward to tapping into the potential this property offers and developing a unique commercial area with the potential for significant job creation and economic impact for Northeast Ohio.‚Äù

Asher called it a once-in-a-generation redevelopment project due to its scale and location. It is next to Cleveland Hopkins Airport Interstates 71 and 480 busy mainline railroads of Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation and is within a 20-minute walk of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority‚Äôs Red Line rail transit station on Brookpark Road.

The project will respond to strong market demand. Real estate firm Newmark recently reported that Greater Cleveland‚Äôs industrial market achieved a new low 4.5 percent vacancy rate in first-quarter 2021 with 2.9 million square feet under construction. In the region‚Äôs southwest submarket that vacancy rate was even lower ‚Äì a mere 3 percent.

flight had to be canceled Monday after a group of teens refused to wear masks. Other passengers said the group who were on their graduation trip were being ""terrible kids.""

The flight which was headed to the Bahamas didn't take off until the following morning.

An American Airlines flight to the Bahamas was canceled and its passengers were delayed overnight after a group of high school students refused to wear their face masks.

Flight 893 was about to depart from Charlotte North Carolina on Monday night when a mechanical issue forced 172 passengers to switch to a different airplane.

As they were waiting to be reboarded some of the students in the group refused to follow mask instructions from the crew a spokesperson for American Airlines told Insider.

""Passengers traveling on American Airlines Flight 893 from Charlotte to Nassau Bahamas were reported to be noncompliant with the federal mask mandate became disruptive to other customers and refused to follow crew member instructions while onboard"" the spokesperson said.

According to the Washington Post some group members were also playing music with ""profane"" lyrics through a speaker and failing to stay in their seats on the plane.

A fellow passenger identified as Malik Banks told WSOC-TV 9 that around 80 percent of the people in the group - which was seated near him - ""were being terrible kids.""

Another passenger Christina Randolph said: ""All they had to do was follow the rules put the mask on sit there. No smart-mouth comments. And they couldn't do it"" according to WSOC-TV.

Randolph is a nurse who said she doesn't get much time off. ""So when you finally get time off you really want to be somewhere you want to be"" she added.

Travel company Breakaway Beach which organized the trip for the students claimed only one person out of 47 was behaving badly even though American Airlines said 30 of the students were involved in the incident the Post reported.

""(T)he act of one individual is not the responsibility of others and the students that were abiding by the rules should not have had to endure this type of treatment"" Breakaway Beach president Eugene Winer said in a statement to the Post. ""The group was treated in an improper and overly harsh manner causing unnecessary stress and aggravation to the travelers and their parents from afar.""

As a result of the incident the flight had to be delayed overnight and passengers had to stay in airport hotels.

The teenagers were allowed to board the new flight the following morning after employees in Charlotte confirmed with them that they would comply with the mask policy according to CNN.

The incident is one of the latest involving passengers refusing to comply with coronavirus safety measures aboard planes.

Since January 2021 the Federal Aviation Administration has received 2500 reports of unruly behavior by passengers most of which involve travelers refusing to comply with the federal mask mandate.

Or follow us on Google News

I love seeing the tremendous growth of electric vehicle sales in Europe which is likely to achieve more than 10% of new car sales being plugin vehicle sales this year but there is something bittersweet about it. The bitter part is that Europe‚Äôs quick EV adoption makes the story in the United States quite a bit depressing.

It‚Äôs wonderful that we have Tesla ‚Äî no doubt. It‚Äôs great to see Teslas all over the place in the area of Florida where I live and I‚Äôm sure in many other places in the United States. Tesla is indeed a wonderful American business and sustainability story and it‚Äôs simply stunning that this still-young automotive company has broken into the big time and is producing and selling nearly a million vehicles a year many of those in the U.S. However those sales don‚Äôt approach 10% market share and neither do all EV sales combined. When I create our quarterly U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales reports there‚Äôs a truly inspiring side and a side that is not so uplifting. We need more models at or near the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y level in order to make significant progress.

That said even though Tesla still dominates the U.S. market (through the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y) and even though no other models are close to Tesla‚Äôs in terms of sales it seems that we are seeing signs of life from a few others. If you can look beyond the two Tesla mountains in the sales charts you can see that there are a few brands that are increasing their EV sales significantly on the backs of a few nearly high-volume models.

Notably two of those models ‚Äî the Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford Mustang Mach-E ‚Äî were the two contenders for 2021 CleanTechnica Car of the Year that got the most votes from readers and the third model (the one with the most sales aside from Tesla‚Äôs top models) was the 2017 CleanTechnica Car of the Year. It seems that our writers and readers might know what they‚Äôre talking about when they highlight top electric models.

It should also be said that we don‚Äôt have data for some electric models ‚Äî the Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV most notably. All indications imply that they are not achieving many sales in the U.S. but we can‚Äôt really evaluate that like we can with the other models because Hyundai and Kia didn‚Äôt build them on dedicated electric platforms and don‚Äôt break out their sales from the sales of their gas-powered twins in their monthly sales reports.

Getting more specific with regards to the models that we do have data for you can see that the Chevy Bolt EV + Chevy Bolt EUV combined for more than 11000 sales in the quarter (which is sort of like combining the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y as Tesla does in its sales reports). The Bolt EV/EUV led the market outside of Tesla‚Äôs top sellers. The Ford Mustang Mach-E (6356 sales) and Volkswagen ID.4 (5756 sales) were significantly below the Bolt but these are young faces. I do expect more from them in the future as production ramps up and word gets around that they are on the market and they are great vehicles.

The old-timer Nissan LEAF is also still doing its part getting 4804 sales in the 2nd quarter. This vehicle likely gets its sales from low prices at dealerships around the country that notably undercut the prices of other popular electric models. Also the vehicle has been on the market for so many years that there may still be repeat buyers upgrading their LEAFs rather than jumping to a Tesla (as many early LEAF buyers have done) Chevy Bolt Ford Mustang Mach-E Volkswagen ID.4 or other new electric car.

That‚Äôs the story of the U.S. electric vehicle market for now. The trend lines are up for several models and they have plenty of room to rise this year if their makers are willing to push them much faster now.

What are your predictions for these models for the rest of the year? Are any of these non-Tesla electric models going to one day get to 100000+ vehicle sales in a year? Or starting at a lower step which models will surpass 50000 sales a year in the U.S.?

Aides are set to brief Mr. Biden this week on plans to invest between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in spending and tax credits on a wide range of efforts meant to bolster the economy.

Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world KUER reports.

Milford ‚Ä¢ Just outside Milford a town of about 1400 people in southwest Utah researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean reliable power.

The energy exists thousands of feet below us where the natural heat from the Earth‚Äôs core can be used to create electricity.

Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world KUER reports.

Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just .4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it‚Äôs largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County.

FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they‚Äôll use to develop the tools to build ‚Äúenhanced geothermal systems‚Äù or EGS ‚Äî human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs which pump water through cracks underground heat it and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings.

If successful the project and others like it could lead to ‚Äúa 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity‚Äù according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

‚ÄúThe world is looking at Milford‚Äù said Joseph Moore a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with groups around the world who are watching this because this is a first. A lot of people are very interested.‚Äù

Moore said the project is not designed to generate electricity per se but to develop the tools to create geothermal energy in a reliable cost-effective way.

At a time when the effects of climate change have become increasingly pronounced and electric utilities are facing pressure to move towards renewable energy geothermal offers great promise as a reliable source he said. There are little to no emissions. Unlike solar and wind power can be created at any time. The groundwater used can also be recycled continuously.

But no one has managed to create EGS at a commercial scale.

Some of the primary barriers have been upfront cost and the technical challenge of creating cracks in the rock underground.

There have also been concerns that the process of creating those fissures can lead to earthquakes. Moore said small mostly imperceptible ones have occurred at the Milford location but researchers closely monitor any seismic activity and are getting better at identifying areas that are low-risk.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre learning how to manage and mitigate risks and be more and more careful‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an opportunity here to develop these tools where we can do it anywhere and that‚Äôs important. We see this as an important potential energy source in the future.‚Äù

The project is funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy which provided about $220 million for research through 2024. Moore said he expects the funding to be renewed so they can continue to work past that date.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL3RoZS13ZWVrZW5kLXJlYWQtbG9va2luZy1hdC10aGUtZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zaXRpb25zLWJpZ2dlci1waWN0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The weekend read: Looking at the energy transition's bigger picture,"From pv magazine 07/2021

pv magazine: It‚Äôs been more than 10 years since you first published work on a 100% renewables system ‚Äì what has changed since then?

Mark Jacobson director atmosphere/energy program Stanford University: The first article I published was back in 2009 in Scientific American. At the time utilities didn‚Äôt think much more than 20% renewables on the grid was possible and when we proposed to go to 100% people laughed at us.

Since then everything has changed. There is a lot more discussion as to how we can get to 100% renewables and whether the costs will go up. In the U.S. we now have around 24% renewable electricity. So we are about 8% to 9% of the way there in terms of how far we need to go to get to 100% renewables for all energy not just electricity in the country.

There has been this huge growth of wind and solar and now beginning with battery storage and electric vehicles as well. In the building sector people are starting to talk about more laws being passed to ensure new buildings are energy efficient and all electric. Heavy industries and air and ship transport are also starting to electrify. There is a lot of good news but we still need very aggressive policies to be put in place to ensure that rapid transition ‚Äì at least 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.

I think that the biggest obstacles right now are competing interests all of these technologies being proposed that are actually much less helpful than renewables ‚Äì so carbon capture new nuclear power bio energy direct air capture geoengineering. All of these things are basically opportunity costs and distractions from real solutions.

You‚Äôve talked about a need for increased efficiency and energy demand reduction in a 100% wind water and sunlight scenario. How do these fit with the model?

Actually just by transitioning to 100% electricity and providing that electricity with clean renewable energy we would reduce global power demand by around 57%. Using heat pumps instead of gas heaters for example reduces your energy demand for heat by 75%. Same thing with electric vehicles ‚Äì in a gasoline vehicle 20% of the energy is used to move the car and the rest is waste heat. Whereas in an electric vehicle 80% to 85% is used to move the car.

Additionally 12% of energy worldwide is used for the mining transport and refining of fossil fuels and uranium ‚Äì and we eliminate all of that. Electrifying industry has a smaller benefit but about a 3% to 4% reduction is possible. And then there is another 6% to 7% in energy efficiency measures beyond ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô. That all adds up to around a 57% reduction in energy requirements just by going to 100% clean renewable energy. And if you‚Äôre using 57% less energy the cost per unit energy being the same you‚Äôre paying 57% less per year. We calculate that worldwide the total annual cost that people pay will be about 60% lower. So about 57% less energy use and another 10% reduction in cost per unit energy.

So the cost per unit would fall by around 10%?

That‚Äôs a conservative estimate because wind and solar right now are half the cost of natural gas. But OK you need backup and you have more transmission and distribution ‚Äì when you account for everything it‚Äôs a minimum 10% lower cost of energy but you are using 57% less energy. It‚Äôs a huge reduction in cost.

How does this backup look in your models? Is it all storage?

Demand response is also a very big component and you have transmission interconnection over large areas. On one extreme you could have 100% storage and minimal interconnection on the other you could just interconnect the world and have no storage because you can always get renewable power from somewhere in the world. In reality you are going to have somewhere in between and I think storage is winning because it is just getting harder to put up new transmission lines.

There is plenty of disagreement around the price trajectories for certain materials particularly in lithium-ion. How do you work this in?

All the trajectories I see for Li-ion they keep coming down and it should be at $60/kWh by 2030. And for a lot of applications you don‚Äôt need huge numbers of batteries. In my own home I have batteries these cost 10% of the solar system it‚Äôs just an incremental cost. And that doesn‚Äôt take me completely off the grid but it gets me to almost 90%. And if you use heat pumps as well and reduce your energy use you need even fewer batteries.

We calculated that even if you deployed 3 TW of batteries in the United States the overall cost of energy is still so much cheaper. I expect around $60/kWh by 2030. At those costs it is still 60% cheaper than fossil fuels to power the entire U.S. for all purposes. The batteries are only a portion of those costs so even if batteries were 50% more expensive it would be something like 50% cheaper instead of 60%. Even at today‚Äôs prices it‚Äôs going to be cheaper because you are using much less energy.

There is also plenty being said about shortages and environmental issues with some of the materials needed for renewables to keep growing. Do you see an issue here?

We will see periods of shortage for a lot of materials. But I don‚Äôt see limits in terms of actual resource available. Neodymium used in permanent magnets for wind turbine generators for example ‚Äì there is seven times what you need to power the whole world with wind. For solar there are so many options that if one material is a problem there will be others available.

You might think that platinum for hydrogen fuel cells would be an issue but actually we use platinum in catalytic convertors for ICE cars. If we don‚Äôt have these any more we have a new source of platinum both in the existing convertors that can be recycled and in the platinum currently being used for those.

Recently you published some work on extreme weather ‚Äì what did you find here in terms of renewables and resiliency?

I looked at correlation between heat demand for buildings and wind power supply. And I found remarkably strong correlation between wind power supply and heat energy demand in large cold regions. So when it is colder and you have more demand for heat there is also on average more energy supply from wind to meet the demand.

This correlation is strong over very large regions; Canada Russia Europe and the U.S. It is stronger in northern latitudes but even as far south as Texas there is correlation between cold and wind conditions.

Your argument has long been that we already have all the technology we need to reach 100% renewables. Is there anything that is still lacking where more research is needed?

We have 95% of the technologies that we need already commercialized and ready to go. What‚Äôs missing is long-distance aircraft or ships but we know what we need to get there. There are also certain processes in industries like cement and steel that haven‚Äôt been commercialized but we know how to transform steel already for example.

The problem we‚Äôre having mostly is competition of ideas. The correct idea of electrifying everything and supplying that electricity through wind water solar and storage has really hit the mainstream now. But still a lot of effort and money is being spent on appeasing the fossil fuels industry with carbon capture and related technologies.

Nuclear as well has had decades to prove itself and it has just got more and more expensive and plants are taking longer and longer to build. Yet people still insist on spending on it. Agriculture players are pushing for biofuel crops to be used in energy but we know that is very inefficient ‚Äì photosynthesis is only 1% efficient whereas PV is 20% efficient so you need 20 times more land for a biofuel to give the same energy as PV. And then you have to burn the biofuel and produce pollution. It makes no sense.

Is there a danger that these could serve as distractions slowing down the transition to renewables?

Exactly you have special interests pushing these inefficient or polluting technologies. Carbon capture is a polluting technology because it doesn‚Äôt reduce air pollutants aside from CO2 and all the others go up because of the fact that you need more energy to run carbon capture equipment and then you have more mining as well. There is no reason for it except to distract us and waste money.

Until I did a study showing the impacts of carbon capture where I looked at air pollution mining and social cost impacts nobody had looked at anything except for the CO2 impact. It‚Äôs really sad that you have scientists pushing carbon capture when they don‚Äôt even bother to look at the side effects of it ‚Äì how could you look at a technology and not even look at air pollution impacts or mining impacts and just make assumptions while looking at no metrics other than CO2 change?

If you look at models that have assumed the cost of carbon capture in future scenarios all they do is assume it reduces CO2. They don‚Äôt usually look at anything else ‚Äì energy inputs or costs. And now it has been taken up by the fossil fuel industry because they have seen that spending on carbon capture can delay us getting off fossil fuels. But it will never reduce air pollution or mining and will always incur equipment and energy costs.

So how do we move away from this?

There‚Äôs no great mystery: If we‚Äôre going to spend money innovating lets innovate with things that are already working or that we know are 100% clean. Like offshore floating wind and solar all sorts of solar technologies some marine wave and tidal power. Those as well as more storage: batteries gravitational storage flywheels compressed air storage. These are things that are relevant not small modular reactors or better ways to capture carbon out of the air. It‚Äôs just a complete waste of time and money.

Despite this I am optimistic that we are going in the right direction. But we need to accelerate much faster. If we look at the U.S. there are now 14 states that have passed 100% renewables laws on various timeframes. And that is really awesome this is what we need. The U.S. is still not there although the Biden administration is doing a lot more than the previous administration to promote renewables and energy transition.

The problem right now is that the Biden administration is still appeasing the fossil fuel industry with carbon capture and then there are nuclear and bioenergy interests ‚Äì all of these special interests are unfortunately very much ingrained in policy. That is what‚Äôs slowing us down."

The debut of the new American Express Platinum Card had me thinking a lot about the Apple Card the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. collaboration that came out nearly two years ago. So far it doesn‚Äôt appear that the card has made much headway: It‚Äôs still U.S.-only the rewards are mediocre and the revenue impact for Apple Inc. doesn‚Äôt seem significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vZ2V0LXRoZS1wcmludC1lZGl0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1uZXcteW9yay10aW1lcy13aXRoLXlvdXItZGlnaXRhbC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWNyZWRpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get the print edition of the New York Times with your digital entertainment credit,"On this week‚Äôs episode of Frequent Miler on the Air I noted that one of the reasons I am not enthusiastic about the Amex Platinum card‚Äôs new ‚Äúdigital entertainment credit‚Äù is because I have no interest in reading long-form New York Times-style articles on my phone (and yes I noted the irony in that statement given the length of some of my own posts). I said I‚Äôd be interested in a print edition (if it were actually available in my area; it isn‚Äôt). Commenter NK3 alerted me to something I‚Äôd missed in the Terms & Conditions of the digital entertainment credit: it can be used for the print edition of the New York Times. While that still won‚Äôt do me any good personally it would make me much more enthusiastic about this deal if I could take advantage of it.

I‚Äôd skipped over the key fine print of the Digital Entertainment Credit that says:

The New York Times: Eligible purchases for the New York Times include any subscriptions (including digital or print news NYT Cooking and New York Times Games) made directly through www.nytimes.com. Eligible purchases do not include advertising services NYT conferences gift cards the TimesDigest or purchases from the NYTimes company store.

That‚Äôs good news to fans of print media since it means you could use this $20 monthly credit toward home delivery of the print edition. Unfortunately home delivery is not available in my area but in the several zip codes I checked half off for the first year meant that $20 every 4 weeks would get you home delivery of the Sunday edition.

I‚Äôd be very happy to get home delivery of the Sunday edition for a year and not just because they quoted me in the Sunday New York Times Magazine this year.

I figured that I‚Äôm probably not the only cardholder who missed this tidbit so it was worth sharing NK3‚Äôs comment for those who may be interested in print media or one of the other New York Times subscriptions available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9sYXMtdmVnYXMtYWlycG9ydC1sYXMtbG91bmdlLWd1aWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Airport 101: A guide to the lounges at LAS,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) is located minutes from the strip and is five miles south of downtown Las Vegas. It is the ninth busiest airport in the United States serving over 51 million passengers in 2019. It serves as a focus city for Allegiant Frontier Southwest and Spirit.

LAS is divided into two terminals: Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Terminal 1 solely serves domestic flights and houses concourses A B C and D while Terminal 3 serves both domestic and international flights and houses concourses D and E. Although the airports are housed in separate buildings you can easily connect between the terminals and the satellite D concourse using an automated people mover.

Bottom line

Although terminal 1 and terminal 3 have the same number of lounges those found in terminal 1 are superior. Although it might get crowded at times the Amex Centurion Lounge provides the most elegant pre-flight experience and is easily accessible. Terminal 1's The Club is also bigger and offers a greater food selection than the one in terminal 3. Fortunately since the entire airport is connected airside you can easily visit a lounge in a different concourse than you're flying out of without reclearing security. Aside from the USO Clubs all lounges at LAS are easily accessible with the right credit cards so if you're a Vegas-based flyer it might be time to reconsider what's in your wallet.

The industry is thriving with record-breaking sales and with projections for dramatic growth. While some states allow it federal law classifies cannabis as illegal thereby prohibiting its possession and use.

How does an industry flourish that is banned by federal law shunned by the credit card networks (Visa Mastercard American Express) and rejected by most banks? How do cannabis retailers accept payments when credit cards and merchant accounts are unavailable?

I‚Äôll examine those questions and more in this post. I‚Äôll address the workarounds that payment service providers offer to cannabis businesses. Some of these benefit from gray areas in the regulations. Others use clever but risky techniques to conceal rule-breaking from banks and credit card networks.

State of Cannabis Payments

The state of cannabis payments is a confusing mess of semi-viable workarounds. Credit card companies and acquiring banks will not allow their networks to process cannabis sales so long as it‚Äôs illegal federally. Cannabis retailers have limited options.

Cash is the primary payment method for cannabis sales. However accepting cash payments comes with logistical and security challenges. Cash must be counted stored transported and secured. Moreover cash cannot be accepted online.

In-store ATMs. Automated teller machines allow customers to withdraw cash for in-store purchases. But ATMs are expensive for both customers and merchants. Customers pay approximately $5 for a single cash withdrawal. Storeowners pay about $4000 per machine plus monthly maintenance and cash-reload fees.

Cashless ATMs are relatively new to the payments industry. They seem to have been invented for cannabis retailers. Instead of inserting a bank debit card into an ATM the customer inserts her card into a countertop point-of-sale terminal which authorizes the card and PIN code and then allows the customer to make a direct payment to the merchant via an account provided by the cashless ATM provider. Merchant fees for cashless ATM transactions are reasonable. Most vendors provide the equipment and technology for $5 per month provided the merchant has purchased a physical ATM from that vendor. However consumer fees are not reasonable at roughly $5 per transaction. Some vendors share those fees with the merchant.

Cryptocurrencies. With exaggerated claims of anonymity and lack of government control cryptocurrencies are seemingly ideal for cannabis purchases. But cryptocurrencies are primarily speculative investments rather than cash alternatives. Cannabis consumers ‚Äî like all consumers ‚Äî are mainly cryptocurrency observers not investors.

Real-time peer-to-peer payments are immediate transfers of funds from a payor to a payee. Cannabis retailers have adopted various forms of real-time payments mostly to circumvent the prohibition on credit card transactions. The retailer asks the customer to send a real-time bank-to-bank or account-to-account payment. Upon receiving and confirming the real-time payment the merchant will either ship the products (an ecommerce transaction) or allow the customer to pick up his order. Merchants must be careful however. Many P2P payment systems ‚Äî PayPal Venmo Zelle Square Cash App more ‚Äî including the financial institutions that maintain the merchant‚Äôs account do not allow their networks to be used for cannabis sales. Retailers can sidestep this issue by concealing the nature of their business and P2P providers sometimes ignore their own rules allegedly.

Credit cards. Some cannabis retailers accept credit card payments. How is this possible? Payment providers will sometimes help by assigning cannabis transactions to legitimate categories. For example instead of classifying as a cannabis seller the dishonest provider will call it a flower shop or a farmers market. Other service providers will open merchant accounts with financial institutions in Eastern Europe where law enforcement is lax. In all cases these gray-area providers charge remarkably high fees ‚Äî roughly 6% per transaction on top of monthly maintenance charges. Moreover the merchant accounts often require large reserves. Plus merchants who mislead payment networks and U.S. banks risk penalties account closures and worst of all a permanent ban from accepting credit cards.



Ecommerce?

When cannabis becomes legal in the U.S. federally all merchants ‚Äî ecommerce and brick-and-mortar ‚Äî can expect an explosion of legitimate payment providers. Until then cash is king."

Left back Sam Vines did the damage with a first-half header from seven yards out scoring his first international goal in his first official competitive match.

Gyasi Zardes registered his 10th career assist on the goal becoming the second-fastest USMNT player to reach 10 goals and 10 assists behind only U.S. legend Landon Donovan.











Three players made their USMNT debuts: James Sands Eric Williamson and Sporting KC‚Äôs Gianluca Busio with Busio earning his first cap in his home club stadium to the delight of the fans in attendance.

Vines Sands Williamson and Busio were among the nine players who made their USMNT debuts in official competition tonight joining goalkeeper Matt Turner defenders Shaq Moore and Miles Robinson midfielder Nicholas Gioacchini and forward Daryl Dike. Turner Moore Giaocchini Dike and Busio are all now cap-tied to the USMNT.

The U.S. started on the front foot and nearly got on the board after six minutes when defender Walker Zimmerman put his attempt off the crossbar and a shot by Zardes off the rebound was saved. The winning goal came minutes later with Zardes setting up Vines on a play that started two passes earlier by Zimmerman.

Zimmerman nearly doubled the U.S. lead late in stoppage time of the first half when he jumped over two defenders at the far post to head down a Sebastian Lletget cross on goal from a tight angle. However Haiti goalkeeper Brian Sylvestre was well-positioned to make the save.

Haiti struggled to develop much of an attack in the first half with winger Derrick Etienne having a couple half chances that failed to test Turner in goal.

The teams made a number of changes throughout the second half and the U.S. had the better of the few clear chances either side developed. The two best chances came from substitutes with Gioacchini clanking a shot off the left post and Busio hitting a one-time strike from the top of the box that Sylvestre was able to rise and deflect.

Haiti threatened to find the equalizer with a last-minute scramble in front of Turner but the U.S. defense did well to hold on to the three points.

The USMNT will remain in Kanas City and face Martinique on Thursday July 15 (10 p.m. ET FS1 UniM√°s TUDN) before closing out Group play next Sunday against Canada.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA ‚Äì SAM VINES (GYASI ZARDES) 8th minute: USMNT center back Walker Zimmerman stepped forward and advanced a nice ball to Kellyn Acosta on the right edge of the box. Acosta quickly played the on-rushing Shaq Moore who hit a first-time cross. The ball took a slight deflection before Zardes - back to goal - flicked it over a defender across the six where Vines had run in from his left back spot to easily head the ball in for his first goal. USA 1 HAI 0



KEY DEFENSIVE PLAYS AND SAVES:

HAI ‚Äì BRIAN SYLVESTRE 6th minute: Sebastian Lletget sent a corner from the left side to the back post where Jackson Yueill knocked the ball back towards the middle. Amid a sea of bodies defender Walker Zimmerman‚Äôs half-volley from just outside the six clanked off the crossbar. The quick rebound fell to Zardes who was able to redirect the short-hop towards goal by Sylvester reacted quickly diving to his left on the line and parried the ball wide.

Then he gave another and another until a giant video screen behind him was lit up with an enormous colored map of Fort Worth divided into four quadrants.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL3NjaWVuY2UtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbi9leHBhbmRpbmctQW1lcmljYW4tU2lnbi1MYW5ndWFnZXMtc2NpZW5jZS12b2NhYnVsYXJ5LWRlYWYvOTkvaTI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expanding American Sign Language's scientific vocabulary,"In brief American Sign Language (ASL) which many deaf people in the US use to communicate has a limited number of signs for advanced scientific terms. When people need to say something in ASL and there isn‚Äôt a sign for it they often have to spell the term out letter by letter or use a sign that isn‚Äôt quite right conceptually. The lack of signs for advanced scientific terms significantly hinders deaf people‚Äôs entry into the sciences and it isolates deaf scientists from their hearing peers. Groups of deaf scientists want to remove these obstacles by developing conceptually accurate ASL signs for scientific terms. But these groups are small and understaffed. As a result new signs spread slowly.

In 2016 a summer internship changed Mandy Houghton‚Äôs life. At the time she was a science teacher at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind. Harvard University invited her to attend a summer program at the Center for Integrated Quantum Materials (CIQM) to study science research and education.

Like many of her students Houghton is Deaf. She uses mainly American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate. While taking science classes at Harvard that summer the way the ASL interpreters signed some of the technical terms blew her mind.

Often there isn‚Äôt an ASL sign for scientific terms. For example Daniel Lundberg a Deaf chemistry professor at Gallaudet University estimates that about 80% of chemistry terms have no established sign. When people need to translate something into ASL and there isn‚Äôt a sign for it they sometimes spell it out using the signs for the word‚Äôs letters a practice called finger spelling. So during a class about the components of an atom a deaf student would be lectured on P-R-O-T-O-N-S N-E-U-T-R-O-N-S and E-L-E-C-T-R-O-N-S.

If the word has another colloquial meaning people sometimes use that sign. For example to sign ‚Äúchemical reduction‚Äù ASL users generally borrow the sign for a different meaning of the word‚Äîbringing two hands closer together to signify something shrinking. But in Houghton‚Äôs class the interpreters used a sign that caught her attention. They signed something that looked more like ‚Äúchemical increase‚Äù which Houghton understood as an increase in the number of electrons an accurate description of what chemical reduction is.

Even though using conceptually accurate signs can make a big difference for deaf students their use is far from universal.

Deaf and deaf While the use of these terms is still evolving generally uppercase Deaf refers to the cultural group of deaf people who share a signed language and beliefs about how they relate to hearing society. Lowercase deaf is now used as an all-inclusive term for any type of hearing loss and it includes culturally Deaf people. In this story we deferred to the preferences of those we interviewed. For more general usage and when we referred to a group of deaf people whose preferences we didn‚Äôt know we used deaf.

When a sign doesn‚Äôt reflect the concept deaf students can misunderstand the meaning or process the information incorrectly. Finger spelling or using nonconceptual signs makes lectures more complicated for deaf students. Houghton says that when she attends lectures she often has to determine if what the interpreter is signing matches what the lecturer is saying while simultaneously trying to follow the content of the lecture. She may have to ask the interpreter‚Äîsometimes in the middle of the lecture‚Äîhow exactly the teacher said what the interpreter signed. And interpreters often don‚Äôt have knowledge of highly specialized fields such as quantum science which makes this exchange all the more difficult. Using conceptually accurate signs can avoid much of this confusion Houghton says. At Harvard that summer she says ‚Äúsimply being able to focus and learn was a big change.‚Äù

When Houghton told hearing students and mentors at CIQM about the lack of signs for scientific terms in ASL they were shocked. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt realize how many hurdles I had to be jumping over‚Äù to understand the lecture she says.

Inspired by her experience with more-conceptual scientific signs during this internship Houghton helped launch a project called Quantum Science in ASL to develop ASL signs for quantum physics terms. The project is a collaboration between CIQM and the Learning Center for the Deaf a non-profit which specializes in ASL development.

And this group is not alone. Deaf scientists have recognized that this lack of signs for scientific terms significantly impedes deaf people‚Äôs entry into the sciences as well as isolates deaf scientists from their hearing peers. These deaf scientists want to chip away at the barriers by developing more ASL signs for scientific terms. They‚Äôre devising signs that represent the concepts behind the terms. But because these groups are small and separate from one another deaf people and interpreters haven‚Äôt widely adopted the new signs which prolongs communication struggles for deaf students and scientists. Houghton and others think that to make significant lasting progress on ASL signs for scientific terms more deaf people need to get involved to ensure that the solutions work for the whole community.

Isolating barriers

For the academic year 2015‚Äì16 the National Deaf Center on Postsecondary Outcomes found that 1.1% of hearing students studied the physical sciences at colleges and universities in the US. For deaf and hard-of-hearing students it was 0.8%. These numbers illustrate what many deaf scientists already know: multiple barriers discourage deaf people from going into the sciences.

Fewer deaf people majoring in the sciences lead to fewer deaf professional scientists. And the lack of deaf scientists creates a negative feedback loop. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt see people that look like you speak like you live like you working and doing those things you will assume it‚Äôs impossible‚Äù Houghton says.

She recalls how her students in Florida said they hated science. But when she shared her own research with them their opinions changed. ‚ÄúI think it was very inspiring for some of the students that I worked with to see someone like me who is Deaf and signs like them prove that it can be done‚Äù she says.

Even for deaf people who continue to study science communication issues remain a source of frustration and isolation. Graduate school in the sciences is already a challenge by its nature but when there‚Äôs no one in a deaf student‚Äôs lab group or whole graduate program who can sign it can be very isolating. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to have someone to bounce your ideas off of and deaf people oftentimes are so siloed‚Äù Houghton says.

While in graduate school Alicia Wooten a Deaf biology professor at Gallaudet and one of the cocreators of the ASL science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) site Atomic Hands didn‚Äôt have an interpreter in her lab. ‚ÄúIt was a huge challenge‚Äù Wooten says. ‚ÄúDeaf and hard-of-hearing academics are sometimes left out of communication.‚Äù Writing down what you want to say for hearing lab mates can be slow and awkward especially since written English is a second language for some deaf people. Hearing lab members can gain new techniques and help colleagues troubleshoot problems by overhearing conversations. Deaf students can‚Äôt take part in these conversations even if they have the expertise.

Still one of the fundamental issues facing deaf people interested in the sciences is that it‚Äôs hard to talk about the science itself because the signed terminology to describe some concepts is limited.

This limitation affects a deaf scientist‚Äôs ability to have meaningful experiences at scientific conferences. ‚ÄúI hate going to scientific conferences‚Äù Gallaudet‚Äôs Lundberg says. The conference organizers usually provide interpreters but the quality of these interpreters can vary greatly. In addition these interpreters don‚Äôt know the signs that Lundberg has established and uses in his research so he has to resort to finger spelling to the interpreter during informal chats with colleagues. So the people he‚Äôs talking with may not get all the information that Lundberg wants to convey. ‚ÄúBy the way [my colleagues] are looking at me I know that they‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄòThat doesn‚Äôt sound like Dan‚Äô ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúObviously the interpreters are not doing an accurate interpretation of me.‚Äù

As a doctoral student Lundberg once brought his school‚Äôs interpreters along. That was the only good conference he‚Äôs ever been to he says. But it was ‚Äúterrifically expensive‚Äù because the school had to pay for the interpreters‚Äô plane tickets and room and board. The main purpose of a conference is to network Wooten says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt happen in the same way when deaf people go.‚Äù

Laureen Summers from the office of Science Technology and Disability of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) says the AAAS provides interpreters and real-time captioning for sessions at its annual meetings. When possible the meeting organizers send information from the speakers to the interpreters in advance so that they can prepare for talks. The AAAS did not specify whether the interpreters it provides have experience signing scientific content or have science backgrounds. The American Chemical Society which publishes C&EN and hosts scientific meetings provides computer-assisted captioning and ASL interpreters for all meeting attendees who ask for them. Paula Christopher program manager at the Office of Diversity Equity Inclusion and Respect at ACS says the society has not previously looked into ASL interpreters‚Äô science backgrounds but may do so in the future.

ASL basics

More effective ways to talk about science in sign language could help deaf scientists overcome some of the barriers they face. But fully appreciating the challenges of communicating technical information in ASL requires understanding that ASL is not a signed form of English. It‚Äôs a distinct language with specific rules and grammar.

When there‚Äôs a new phenomenon in English people tend to create a new word for it. ‚ÄúASL tends to use agglutinative structure which means that the signs are composed of different signs which do not change much when strung together to make a word‚Äù says Jon Henner a deaf linguist specializing in ASL at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. ‚ÄúMaking new words in ASL is really just putting together different signs.‚Äù ASL is structured more like Japanese or Turkish he says. That means ASL isn‚Äôt always intuitive for the English-hearing-and-speaking population.

In addition to being a distinct language ASL is also the first language for many deaf people especially those who were born deaf. ‚ÄúThere are many many deaf people whose understanding of English as a second language does not equal their understanding of ASL as a first language‚Äù says Jeanne Reis a hearing ASL interpreter and director of ASL Clear a sign-developing project aimed at K‚Äì12 students. While most hearing people have no particular barriers to learning a second language deaf people can‚Äôt hear the spoken language around them making it harder to connect meaning with written words on a page.

The fact that in the US English is some deaf people‚Äôs second language makes finger spelling scientific terms more of a problem than just being a clunky way to communicate. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre a native English speaker and know Spanish as a second language and each time a lecturer mentions ‚Äútitration‚Äù the interpreter spells out V-A-L-O-R-A-C-I-√ì-N. Interspersing two languages in a single lecture can be jarring and confusing for students. Signs for scientific terms would make understanding much easier for deaf students Reis says.

When you‚Äôre talking about developing signs it‚Äôs not as if you can just create them and overnight you have a bunch of signs‚Äù people start using. Alicia Wooten Deaf biology professor at Gallaudet University and cocreator of Atomic Hands

So why aren‚Äôt there many ASL signs for scientific terms? The reason in part has to do with the history of sign language.

In the late 19th century a movement started by hearing people called oralism sought to change deaf education. Those leading this charge including Alexander Graham Bell who promoted the eugenic idea that deaf people should not marry each other thought that instead of using ASL which was not viewed as a legitimate language deaf people should read lips and talk to better assimilate into hearing society. In 1880 in Milan the members of the International Congress on Education of the Deaf‚Äîall of whom were hearing‚Äîvoted to ban sign language. Oralism‚Äôs policies not only forced speech on deaf people but also may have hindered deaf children‚Äôs linguistic and cognitive development Houghton says. ‚ÄúFor years deaf students were not allowed to sign in schools and would have their hands slapped if they were caught signing‚Äù she says.

In the early 1960s linguist William Stokoe published a paper that began to convince people that ASL is a true language. As a result oralism‚Äôs dominance in deaf education started to wane. Oralists‚Äô nearly century-long condemnation of the open use of ASL delayed both the language‚Äôs development and deaf people‚Äôs ability to contribute to society. But as more deaf people began participating in a wider range of fields including in the sciences the demand for technical signs shot skyward. Houghton‚Äôs project and the others like it aim to fill this science-shaped hole in ASL.

Developing signs

Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is home to one of the groups of deaf scientists working on new ASL signs. RIT is associated with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) but not all the students at the university are deaf. RIT makes interpreters available for classes with deaf students but the interpreters change often says Asma Sheikh a Deaf scientist at Harvard Medical School. She recently completed her bachelor‚Äôs degree in biomedical sciences from RIT. Students might negotiate signs for science terms for the interpreter in one class session but the next session might have a different interpreter using different signs.

This inconsistency caused another Deaf RIT student Kaitlyn Clark to struggle during organic chemistry classes. Clark says she was frustrated because she could understand the scientific concepts explained in the lecture but not how the interpreters were signing the information. Eventually Sheikh‚Äôs class got a consistent interpreter named Todd Thieu who had interpreted for organic chemistry before and understood the concepts. ‚ÄúWe started negotiating a common vocabulary‚Äù Sheikh says.

As a result the small group of deaf students always had the best grades in class. This got the attention of the professor Christina Goudreau Collison. Along with tutor Jennifer Swartzenberg she encouraged the students to develop and record a series of ASL signs for organic chemistry. The group of deaf students got together twice a week for over a year to develop these signs Sheikh says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be there for hours late at night. We were all really invested‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was a real passion project.‚Äù Many of these signs are now posted online by ASLCore a group of interpreters and deaf students based out of NTID that has developed advanced ASL signs in several disciplines.

Deaf scientists think about multiple factors when they develop scientific signs Houghton says. First they must evaluate whether the sign complies with the linguistic rules of ASL. Good signs will follow the patterns and parameters of ASL in terms of the shape of the signer‚Äôs hands how the sign moves and where in space it‚Äôs signed. ‚ÄúIt has to follow those ASL rules‚Äù Houghton says. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt it doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

Next deaf scientists need to assess how conceptually accurate the sign is. Sometimes a sign that follows the linguistic rules and is conceptually accurate already exists in ASL. When Houghton‚Äôs group found one of those signs for quantum physics terms it left the sign as is. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs something that already makes sense and works perfectly in conversation that‚Äôs not something that we would modify‚Äù she says. But if it doesn‚Äôt follow the rules or is confusing that‚Äôs when the work starts.

One way a sign might be conceptually inaccurate is if it‚Äôs an anglicized sign meaning it‚Äôs based on how something is spelled in English ASL Clear‚Äôs Reis says. For example an older sign for ‚Äúatom‚Äù is a signed letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù circling in the air. ‚ÄúThis is not at all what an atom is‚Äù conceptually she says.

The organic chemistry ASLCore team drew inspiration from the images used in the students‚Äô textbook Sheikh says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to be able to represent organic chemistry terms in a way that was simple and easily understandable.‚Äù This means not only how things look statically but also the way things move Sheikh says. For example the sign the team developed for steric hindrance was two curved hands placed back to back tapping against each other. ‚ÄúIt represents the two curves that you often see as a symbol in textbooks‚Äù for two atoms running into each other Sheikh says.

Sign developers also have to consider the context in which a term is used and how that affects its meaning. For example one ASL sign for ‚Äúelectron‚Äù shows a single finger wiggling in the air. This makes sense if you‚Äôre talking about free electrons Gallaudet‚Äôs Wooten says. But in a general chemistry class when you‚Äôre thinking about electrons orbiting a nucleus in an atom that sign is not as conceptually accurate. In that case it makes sense to use the ASL sign for electron that shows a finger circling a closed fist.

Because of differing contexts there can be multiple signs for the same concept. Just on ASLCore alone there are five signs for the word ‚Äúmolecule‚Äù: one in chemistry one in physics and three in biology. The organic chemistry team didn‚Äôt make new signs for a lot of the concepts already presented in the physics or biology sections. But the way the other teams signed ‚Äúmolecule‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite match what the chemists wanted to convey Clark a member of the ASLCore group says. Conceptually the biology signs are more based on large biomolecules like proteins while the physics sign two cupped hands rotating relative to each other didn‚Äôt show how a molecule might interact with other molecules. So the chemists developed their own sign depicting two molecules near each other. ‚ÄúWhen we look at a molecule we‚Äôre not always looking at the molecule by itself‚Äù Clark says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reacting with other molecules.‚Äù

Which sign to use?

With multiple groups creating scientific signs and old signs still floating around how do people know which one to use? This question hits upon an issue that all languages face spoken or signed: no one person or group controls a language.

For example consider the sign for ‚Äúbacteria.‚Äù In the past people used the sign for ‚Äúbug‚Äù as in an insect similar to how the word is sometimes used in English. ASL now has a separate sign for ‚Äúbacteria‚Äù but some scientists continue to use the one for ‚Äúbug‚Äù because it‚Äôs ingrained Wooten says. ‚ÄúPeople just like some signs better than others. They‚Äôre easier to sign or more intuitive or fit the context better‚Äù she says.

Because of this variability in the use of signs professors have to work with their students to decide which signs to use for each class Wooten says. There are even differences in the same university across programs Lundberg says. Wooten‚Äôs intro to biology class and Lundberg‚Äôs intro to chemistry class usually include the same students at the same time. As a result the students may see two signs for the same concept. Sometimes the students protest when a professor introduces a sign they‚Äôre not used to. When she used one of the signs for ‚Äúelectron‚Äù students didn‚Äôt like it at first Wooten says. ‚ÄúThey asked me to actually go back and to use a sign that had been more of an original sign.‚Äù

We are using [ASL] every day in every aspect of our lives. It makes sense that any change would come from us. Mandy Houghton Deaf principal investigator Quantum Science in ASL Project at The Learning Center for the Deaf and Harvard‚Äôs Center for Integrated Quantum Materials

Professors in the two departments try to get everybody on the same page but figuring out the terminology takes extra meetings and time. And even then the professors slip occasionally. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve even noticed myself in class where I‚Äôll use some older sign‚Äù Wooten says. ‚ÄúI have to catch myself and back up.‚Äù

The newer signs under development are part of an ongoing conversation in the deaf community she says. When signs are introduced either people use them or they don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre talking about developing signs it‚Äôs not as if you can just create them and overnight you have a bunch of signs‚Äù people start using Wooten says.

The projects on scientific signs aim to provide a starting place for language development and for the evolution of the language CIQM‚Äôs Houghton says. ‚ÄúWe depend on the community deaf people ASL users to see if they adopt and use the signs that we‚Äôre creating‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd to see whether the information discussed using these signs actually enhances knowledge transfer and the conversation itself.‚Äù

Nobody has a specific right to a final say on a particular sign ‚Äúbecause language belongs to all those who use it‚Äù Wooten says. A new sign might take off in the community she says. Or maybe it doesn‚Äôt quite work and will either drop out of use or change. In some cases signers decide over time that the sign is misleading or too long and people may drop a portion of it. ‚ÄúThen the information becomes more efficient more clear‚Äù Houghton says.

Sometimes useful signs pop up and then feed off one another. One of the math signs that ASL Clear developed was for ‚Äúfraction.‚Äù The old sign was anglicized: the sign for the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù over then under a finger held horizontally Reis says. The ASL Clear team swapped in the sign for ‚Äúdigit‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúF.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you put this handshape over that handshape now what you‚Äôre representing is an unknown digit over an unknown digit which is the actual definition right?‚Äù

This sign later inspired the one for ‚Äúratio‚Äù developed by the Quantum Science in ASL group. While having a conversation ‚Äúwe‚Äôre spelling ‚Äòratio‚Äô over and over and over‚Äù Houghton says. Then one person used the sign for ‚Äúfraction‚Äù but tipped it on its side to show a digit next to a digit separated by a vertical finger. ‚ÄúWe were all like ‚ÄòWhoa that actually makes a lot of sense‚Äô ‚Äù Houghton says. Because the sign for ‚Äúfraction‚Äù was already in their minds the sign for ‚Äúratio‚Äù felt comfortable and easy to use she says.

Many of the people involved in these ASL groups think that the effort needs more deaf people developing signs for scientific terms. But it‚Äôs not a lack of funding preventing people from establishing more of these groups. ‚ÄúThere are people out there who want to collaborate with us and support this work‚Äù Houghton says. But they just don‚Äôt have the time.

The people involved in these projects also agree that deaf people should lead the efforts to create more signs. Those developing these signs should have the language knowledge the native fluency and the content knowledge ASL Clear‚Äôs Reis says. Most interpreters don‚Äôt have specialized science knowledge and while they know ASL it‚Äôs often not their primary language.

When deaf people are the ones to create solutions for scientific signs they are able to take ownership of their language and culture. For many decades hearing teachers have told deaf people what should be done in education and have often pushed aside and marginalized them Houghton says.

So for a long time hearing-based society has made deaf people feel ashamed about their language and culture. They‚Äôve been made to feel that their language is not as good as English. And that‚Äôs why Houghton and others want deaf people to lead the way in making it easier to communicate science via ASL. ‚ÄúWe are using [ASL] every day in every aspect of our lives‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt makes sense that any change would come from us.‚Äù

Ham says the expansion of the theme park‚Äôs grounds in Northern Kentucky will also include ‚Äúan exceptionally well-done scale model of what Jerusalem may have looked like at the time of Christ‚Äù which should be ready sometime in 2022.

He adds ‚ÄúAlso for children we‚Äôll create a themed carousel for them to ride hopefully to open by next summer. These are just a few of the things we will be adding to our 800-acre property.‚Äù

The $100 million Ark Encounter is seeing record crowds. The attendance is returning to pre-pandemic levels with up to 7000 visitors on Saturdays.

‚ÄúOur research shows that over 92% of those who visit our attractions are coming from outside Kentucky‚Äù Ham shared. ‚ÄúThese guests of ours are bringing dollars that would not normally be spent in this state. What an opportunity for local businesses to capitalize on this phenomenon.‚Äù

Previously the Ark Encounter said on its website that it would use Babel to explain the origin of the different languages and people groups.

‚ÄúWe will have an excellent teaching tool in the form of a very detailed Babel diorama. All of these figures and designs were meticulously designed 3D printed and hand-painted in order to present a realistic view of what it might have looked like as these people went about ignoring God‚Äôs command and building a tower that reached into the heavens‚Äù it said.

The top-finishing female amateur was another Team Santa Monica swimmer: 15-year old Amelia Hines who crossed the finishline in 21:24.5. 16-year old Mattea Sokolow was just behind in 21:24.7.

Wilimovsky and Twichell weren‚Äôt the only Olympians to participate: 37-year old Aaron Peirsol who won 5 Olympic gold medals and 2 Olympic silver medals while competing at the 2000 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games also swam the event. He placed 349th overall.

While the Americans‚Äô COVID-19 safety protocols prevent them from congregating with the general public the open water swimmers were given permission to participate briefly in the race though they made a quick exit from the venue to try to stay in line with the spirit of the event.

The open water events will take place after pool swimming at this summer‚Äôs Olympic Games. The women‚Äôs 10km race will be held on August 4 and the men‚Äôs 10km race will be held on August 5. The races will be held at the Odaiba Marine Park in Tokyo Bay.

In the winter Waimea is one of a number of North Shore beaches famed for surfing competitions among massive waves reaching 60 feet or more. In the summer though the Bay is generally clear and calm making for better swimming conditions.

The event is part of the North Shore Swim Series which includes 5 races.

408 swimmers participated in the event this year."

And yet these two films are flipsides of similar themes. The protagonist of Kuosmanen‚Äôs debut feature was a modest country baker serenely content with his place in the world making him an odd fit for competitive sports. The new film revolves around a woman trying on the kind of cultured life she has tasted and admired before ultimately finding peace through simpler self-knowledge and acceptance.

Taking its title from the confined quarters of a second class sleeping car on a train from Moscow to the Arctic port city of Murmansk this is a melancholic drama but also one that‚Äôs unexpectedly uplifting in its insights into human solitude and connection. As dour as it often seems with its reek of stale booze and cigarette smoke there‚Äôs joy here for patient audiences willing to find it and to forgo the easy consolations of a more conventional outcome.

Compartment No. 6 The Bottom Line A journey worth taking. Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Competition)

Cast: Seidi Haarla Yuriy Borisov Dinara Drukarova Julia Aug Lidia Kostina Tomi Alatalo Viktor Chuprov Denis Pyanov Polina Aug

Director: Juho Kuosmanen

Screenwriters: Andris Feldmanis Livia Ulman Juho Kuosmanen inspired by the novel by Rosa Liksom 1 hour 46 minutes

The time is unspecified but clearly in the post-Soviet era with analog devices like a camcorder and a Walkman cassette player suggesting the 1990s still stuck in the ‚Äò80s. Laura (Seidi Haarla) is a student from Finland studying Russian in Moscow where she has been renting a room from Irina (Dinara Drukarova) the high-spirited woman who has become her lover. A single scene at the start shows the consuming impression on unworldly slightly awkward Laura of Irina‚Äôs endless parties in a charming old apartment full of music and art and books and laughter where guests bat philosophical ideas back and forth as they toss back vodka shots.

One thought that stays with Laura is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to understand the present if you study the past.‚Äù That notion is part of her desire as a budding archeology enthusiast to travel to Murmansk and see the ancient petroglyphs on the rocky coast. She and Irina originally planned the trip together but when Irina was forced to cancel because of work Laura decided to go anyway.

She finds herself sharing a train compartment with Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov) an uncouth Russian miner whose obnoxious manner promises to make the long journey even longer. He‚Äôs antagonistic toward the tourist drunkenly extolling the virtues of his homeland: ‚ÄúRussia is a great country! We beat the Nazis. The moon. We went there!‚Äù Laura kills time in the dining car and returns to find him smashed and rowdy his behavior so offensive that she tries to slip the indifferent conductor (Julia Aug marvelously affectless) some cash to find her another compartment. She even briefly considers the overcrowded bunks of third class. Only once Ljoha has passed out does she get some rest.

When the train stops in Saint Petersburg she decides to abandon the trip and return to Moscow until a phone call indicates that she was just a moment in her lover‚Äôs life and Irina already is moving on.

Reboarding the train Laura learns that Ljoha is going to Murmansk to work in the mines but when she tries to explain her reasons for going there he just seems perplexed wondering what she could possibly gain from seeing a bunch of rock carvings. Her slightly awkward defensiveness hints already that there‚Äôs a performative aspect to Laura‚Äôs passion for archeology.

At an overnight stop on the journey she reluctantly agrees to accompany Ljoha to the home of his foster mother (Lidia Kostina a gem) who helps break the ice between the strangers as she shares her peculiar wisdom about women over a steady stream of hooch. But when Laura invites a guitar-playing Finnish traveler (Tomi Alatalo) to share their compartment on the next leg of the journey it‚Äôs as if she‚Äôs broken some pact with Ljoha that was still being negotiated.

Loosely adapted by Kuosmanen with Andris Feldmanis and Livia Ulman from Rosa Liksom‚Äôs novel the film blithely disregards the standard rulebook for this kind of road movie in which two strangers with little in common slowly come to understand and respect one another. A version of that does happen but it‚Äôs not via the usual avenues of sexual attraction or even friendship in any formulaic sense.

The connection is more of a subcutaneous understanding that they are not so different. A scene in which Laura watches Ljoha goof around in the snow on a train platform like a big dumb kid reveals much about the true self beneath her attempts at cultivated sophistication all of which is echoed beautifully later on.

The modulation of tone when the train trip nears its end is gracefully done as a new closeness is formed only to have a moody distance separate them once again and the terrific lead actors navigate the constant shifts between guardedness and openness with an emotional transparency that creeps up on you. The changes in Ljoha especially when Laura breaks through his isolation are quite moving as is her devastation when her memories of her time in Moscow are taken from her.

The disappointment of arriving in Murmansk to find that all of Laura‚Äôs plans are suddenly impractical threatens to conclude the film on a downbeat note. But as he showed in The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M√§ki Kuosmanen‚Äôs storytelling has a fundamental generosity of spirit tender though not sentimental.

Right up to the end he keeps us unsure of where things are headed. The solution to Laura‚Äôs marooned unfulfillment comes with minor-key comedy in the completion of the physical journey across various elemental obstacles but also subtle personal realizations about who she is how she perceives the world around her and how she sees other people. There are no over-articulated epiphanies just gentle satisfying moments of internal illumination.

Cinematographer J-P Passi who brought such evocative high-contrast texture shooting in black and white on the director‚Äôs first film here works in the washed-out color palette of places suspended in time also finding dexterous ways to keep the camera mobile in the tight spaces on the train. The visual aesthetic is more rough-edged this time but no less perfectly suited to the material. Sharp music choices include classic mid-‚Äò70s Roxy Music at Irina‚Äôs party and fabulous late-‚Äò80s French synth-pop (‚ÄúVoyage Voyage‚Äù by Desireless) over the closing credits amplifying the sense of horizons being expanded and barriers broken down. This is a strange scrappy film in its own way quite beguiling.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless this isn‚Äôt the first time Wozniak has marvelled at the wonders of Bitcoin. In an interview in 2018 he argued: ‚ÄúMan makes up currencies controls them issues new US dollars every year; Bitcoin is immune to that.‚Äù

And in another interview with CNBC he said ‚Äúonly Bitcoin is pure digital gold‚Ä¶ and I totally buy into that‚Äù.

However when asked about whether he personally invested in BTC he revealed ‚ÄúI do not invest in Bitcoin but I believe in it for the future‚Äù.

In 2019 Wozniak reportedly sold all of his Bitcoin holdings (bought at $700 per BTC) amid a turbulent and volatile long-winter for the asset.

Speaking at the Nordic Business Forum Wozniak said: ‚ÄúI wanted to experiment with it‚Ä¶when it shot up high I said I don‚Äôt want to be one of those people who watches and watches it and cares about the number. I don‚Äôt want that kind of care in my life. Part of my happiness is not to have worries so I sold it all and just got rid of it.‚Äù

$WOZX ‚Äì Wozniak‚Äôs latest genius?

While Wozniak might not personally hold BTC this doesn‚Äôt mean that he isn‚Äôt a proponent user and visionary in the cryptocurrency space.

The entrepreneur first teased the press with vague comments surrounding a blockchain project in 2018.

Last year he revealed the launch of his first new business since Apple in 1976 ‚Äì Efforce ‚Äì a new online platform empowered by blockchain technology that allows contributors to benefit from and trade the energy savings generated by energy efficiency projects worldwide in a tokenised fashion with $WOZX.

Climate financing has been specifically highlighted as a key role blockchain can play in fighting climate change in a recent report by the UN.

According to Wozniak energy consumption and CO 2 emissions worldwide have grown exponentially leading to climate change and extreme consequences to the environment.

‚ÄúWe can improve our energy footprint and lower our energy consumption without changing our habits‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúWe can save the environment simply by making more energy improvements.‚Äù

Following Wozniak‚Äôs crypto project announcement and the launch of the token in December some on Twitter rushed to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to request his exchange list the new $WOZX token.

The funding round announced by the company on June 29 was led by Luxembourg-

based Alpha Intelligence Capital and Palo Alto-based Vertical Venture Partners.

Uday Sandhu general partner of AI Capital Partners Alpha Intelligence‚Äôs U.S.-based fund joined Retina AI‚Äôs board as a part of the raise.



Retina plans to use the funding to bolster hiring and expand its digital platform through existing integrations and partnerships including its work with Facebook Inc. Google Shopify Inc. Segment and Experian Information Solutions Inc.



Retina was founded in 2017. Its platform ‚Äî Retina Insight ‚Äî uses AI machine learning and data analytics to help businesses discover Customer Lifetime Value or which customers are making repeat purchases.



Its tools are incorporated into platforms like Google and Facebook. The company said its platform is ‚Äúprivacy-centric‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt rely on third-party cookies which track a customer‚Äôs information and browsing history or other identifiers for advertisers to target customers.



Companies such as Apple Inc. and Google have decided to phase out support of third-party cookies on their platforms over the next few years fueling growth for Retina among clients and investors.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an incredible demand for innovation in both marketing and digital commerce now that third-party cookies are coming off the table‚Äù Sandhu said in a statement. ‚ÄúRetina has emerged as the company best equipped to address this demand with its first-party data and privacy-centric platform.‚Äù



The company‚Äôs clients include Dollar Shave Club Inc. Chegg Inc. Nestl√© and Brickell Men‚Äôs Products.



Emad Hasan co-founder and chief executive of Retina told Dot.LA Retina is looking to partner with younger companies that have at least 18 months of data and roughly 100000 customers but don‚Äôt necessarily have the funds or staff to analyze customer data themselves.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been arming ecommerce companies with actionable customer insights that rivals data from the likes of Amazon‚Äù Hassan said in a statement."

In the face of concerns raised about if the company will have GAA designs out in time to keep pace with competitor TSMC it insists that its first iteration of the technology will begin mass production in 2022.

Samsung's public roadmap was presented recently at its Foundry Forum 2021 in China. Particularly conspicuous in its absence from the slide shown however was Samsung's 3GAE (3nm GAA-Early) the first iteration of their 3nm technology. 3GAE was originally revealed in 2019 alongside its follow-up 3GAP (3nm GAA-Plus) but only the latter was shown off in the presentation.

Prior to this roadmap being revealed there had already been concern brewing over the health of the node; 3GAE had originally been planned for risk production in late 2020 and volume production in 2021 but the company only taped out its first 3nm test chips last month.

Furthermore Dr. Chidi Chidambaram VP of Engineering at Qualcomm Samsung Foundry's largest third-party customer was quoted by SemiAnalysis as estimating GAA technology as only reaching production in 2023-24 at a recent event hosted by Applied Materials.

While the estimate is likely intentionally vague for NDA reasons it still puts Samsung a year behind TSMC's plans for volume production of 3nm-class silicon next year. This combined with the absence of 3GAE on the published roadmap led to speculation that the node had been completely skipped over in favor of 3GAP.

Just to explain the naming by Samsung: 3GAE (Gate-All-Around Early) is missing here. This indicates that the early process is not viable for mass production and got killed completely. 3GAP (Gate-All-Around Plus) now planed for HVM in 2023 which is confirming Qualcomm's statement https://t.co/9GeMcLq3jt --- Andreas Schilling (@aschilling) July 7 2021

When contacted for comment by Anandtech the company said that 3GAE was still due for mass production in 2022 and it's possible that the node isn't being publicized simply because it's reserved for internal usage at Samsung LSI.

However while this was done with other ""-Early"" process variants from the company in the past those were still marked on the map; 5LPE saw third-party usage in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 but that node was itself derived from 7LPP.

The company is also putting out a 4LPP based on more traditional FinFET technology. This (and its predecessor 4LPE) are now listed as their own family of nodes instead of being an evolution from 5nm/7nm-class technologies.

It may be that the process has a substantial enough improvement to warrant marketing as a new ""headline"" node or simply because of more significant differences in design and manufacturing.

Still the absence of 3GAE on the public roadmap and the FinFET-based 4LPP node overlapping with Samsung's stated 2022 target for 3GAE draws uncomfortable comparisons with Cannon Lake Intel's earliest 10nm processors.

Those technically shipped in 2018 to meet investor commitments but were so bad that they were passed over in favor of further evolutions of the older 14nm node; the company now ignores that generation completely insisting that Ice Lake was its first real 10nm line-up.

But perhaps at least the oft-mocked 14+++ was more easily understandable than a branching tree of processes and their sub-evolutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY4MzY1OTIxMDAyODY40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Magnetic-responsive hydrogels: From strategic design to biomedical applications,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365921002868 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY4MzY1OTIxMDAyODY40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

The Corporate VP & Chief Human Resource Officer Susan Pietrucha made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$212 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us. In this case the big sale took place at around the current price so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

(1:19)

Open Extended Reactions

The Indiana Pacers have submitted 78 instances of incorrect or non-calls to the NBA that they felt put them at a disadvantage in Games 1 and 2 against the New York Knicks a league source told ESPN.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle speaking after Indiana fell behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 130-121 loss to New York on Wednesday said the team had identified 29 questionable refereeing decisions from Game 1. The source said the Pacers then identified 49 plays from Game 2 that they felt were incorrectly called or not called at all and submitted them overnight to the NBA office.

Carlisle said they had decided not to send the Game 1 calls to the league office for review but reversed that decision after Game 2 had similar officiating issues from their perspective.

As part of NBA protocol the clips will also be shared with the Knicks.

""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight"" Carlisle said after being ejected in the final minute when he was given two technical fouls. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials but we deserve a fair shot.""

A frustrated Carlisle also implied the Pacers were being penalized by officials because they were playing against the league's largest market.

""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""

Carlisle was ejected after growing upset about several calls in Game 2 particularly when officials correctly reversed a double-dribble violation that could have given the Pacers a key possession with the outcome still in doubt.

In Game 1 a kicked ball violation was called in error against the Pacers but not corrected a decision that ended up costing the team three vital points during the 121-117 loss.

The Madison Square Garden crowd which was elated when star Jalen Brunson returned in the second half after missing the entire second quarter to deal with a right foot issue made the environment hostile for the Pacers and Carlisle said he believed it affected the officiating to favor the Knicks.

The Pacers will have to examine their defensive film as well. After allowing the Knicks to shoot 65% in the second half in Game 1 as they lost a lead New York shot 67% in the third quarter of Game 2 and flipped the game outscoring Indiana 36-18 behind Brunson's return.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton who scored 34 points in bouncing back from putting up six in Game 1 wasn't going to put all the blame on the officiating.

""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough"" Haliburton said. ""We just got to be better.""

One other issue for the Pacers to review as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET ESPN) is how to guard Brunson. Backup guard T.J. McConnell was somewhat effective in slowing Brunson in Games 1 and 2 but Carlisle took him out with seven minutes to play and the Knicks up two points replacing him with starter Andrew Nembhard.

Brunson scored 10 of his 29 points down the stretch with Nembhard as his primary defender and is 14-of-21 shooting for 33 points against Nembhard over the first two games according to ESPN Stats & Information. Carlisle said he considered bringing McConnell who had a +10 plus/minus on the night back in but decided against it because it wasn't how the team has played throughout the season.

McConnell supported his coach's decision.

""Rick is a Hall of Fame coach and has been doing this for a long time so the rotations that he plays we trust that they're the right ones and I fully support him"" McConnell said. ""Whenever my number is called I'll be ready.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjY3V3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lbi9zZXZlcmUtd2VhdGhlci9jbG9zZS10by02MC1taWxsaW9uLWF0LXJpc2stb2Ytc2V2ZXJlLXdlYXRoZXItaW4tc291dGhlcm4tdXMtb24tdGh1cnNkYXkvMTY0ODcyNtIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2N1d2VhdGhlci5jb20vZW4vc2V2ZXJlLXdlYXRoZXIvY2xvc2UtdG8tNjAtbWlsbGlvbi1hdC1yaXNrLW9mLXNldmVyZS13ZWF0aGVyLWluLXNvdXRoZXJuLXVzLW9uLXRodXJzZGF5LzE2NDg3MjYvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Close to 60 million at risk of severe weather in southern US on Thursday,"Close to 60 million at risk of severe weather in southern US on Thursday

A volatile weather pattern will fuel more rounds of damaging storms and tornadoes endangering lives and property in the southern United States through the end of the week.

Copied

From flooding in Illinois to destructive tornadoes in Tennessee severe storms left behind a path of destruction on May 8.

The risk of severe thunderstorms some capable of triggering tornadoes will reach across much of the southern United States as well as part of the mid-Atlantic region through Thursday AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

While the intensity of the thunderstorms may not be as ferocious as many that erupted in the Midwest and Great Plains earlier in the week there is still the likelihood that some of the strongest storms will be capable of producing a few tornadoes. Approximately 60 million people live within the anticipated zone of severe weather through Thursday night.

The tally of filtered severe weather incidents as reported by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) from Monday through Wednesday night had reached 936 of which there were 76 reports of tornadoes.

All it takes is one brief tornado to strike a populated area which leads to great risks to lives and property. And like most prior days this week there is the potential for multiple tornadoes to occur. With each passing day the storms have pushed into progressively more densely populated areas and that trend will continue prior to the end of the week.

A reported tornado wreaked havoc in a mobile home community in Portage Michigan on May 7.

""The main threats from the thunderstorms in the East will be high winds and hail"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.

A wedge of cool air will protect areas from Boston to New York City Philadelphia Baltimore and Pittsburgh areas from severe weather into Thursday night. Washington D.C. will be on the edge of the cool air influence. The cool air will occupy the lower part of the atmosphere so any thunderstorms and high winds will be forced to occur several thousand feet up and not at ground level.

The major metro areas and the airport hubs most likely to be affected by severe weather include Richmond Virginia; Charlotte; Columbia South Carolina; Atlanta; Birmingham Alabama; Jackson Mississippi; Shreveport Louisiana; and Dallas. As storms develop over or approach these areas and many regional secondary hubs ground stops can lead to lengthy airline delays and possible flight cancellations.

""It has been nearly a month since much of Virginia had severe storms"" Douty said ""April 15 was the last day with widespread wind and hail in the state and the mid-Atlantic region in general.""

Thursday will be an active day with severe weather from Virginia to Florida and Texas.

One cluster of thunderstorms leftover from storms that rocked the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday night will push southward through Alabama Georgia part of the Carolinas and northern Florida during the day on Thursday. These storms will pack strong wind gusts frequent lightning torrential downpours and some hail. A few of the strongest storms in this cluster could produce a tornado.

Forecasters are particularly concerned about a cluster of thunderstorms that will race eastward across the South on Thursday night. The main risk with these storms would be damaging winds. If confidence in this increases a ""high"" risk may be introduced for parts of the region later Thursday.

As the storms erupt downpours alone can lead to substantial travel delays. Motorists should be alert for changing weather conditions including rapidly rising water on some area streets highways and underpasses.

Severe storms to focus on southeastern corner of US on Friday

The likelihood of severe weather will continue to move southeastward on Friday. To close out the workweek for millions of Americans the severe weather will focus on an area from southern Alabama central Georgia and southern South Carolina to central Florida.

On Friday and Friday evening the main threats will be from storms packing high winds and hail. Some of the strongest storms may also trigger tornadoes or waterspouts.

If the overnight cluster of storms continues to move along the severe weather threat may end by midday in much of this zone except for perhaps central Florida.

People spending time on area beaches and the central Florida theme parks should be alert to rapidly changing weather conditions during the afternoon and evening.

As the Southeast region gets a break from thunderstorms from late Friday to the weekend a vigorous disturbance will drop southeastward across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast.

""This system is likely to produce some locally gusty thunderstorms with small hail but widespread damaging winds and hail are not likely"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.

The system will drop quickly across the Midwest from Friday to Saturday then slow down as it pivots across the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday where it is most likely to spoil many outdoor plans for Mother's Day weekend.

The small disturbance will mark a change in the weather pattern with massive multiday severe weather outbreaks taking an extended break over much of the Central states.

However trouble in the form of torrential downpours and drenching thunderstorms will set up along much of the Gulf Coast states especially in Texas and Louisiana from later in the weekend to the middle of next week. Enough rain may fall to renew flooding in Texas and trigger new flooding elsewhere in parts of the Interstate 10 corridor.

A Boeing 737 plane skidded off the runway at the airport in the Senegal capital Dakar injuring at least 10 people four of whom are in serious condition.

Some 85 people were onboard the plane that trundled off the runway onto the grass.

The Air S√©n√©gal flight operated by TransAir was headed to Bamako late on Wednesday carrying 79 passengers two pilots and four cabin crew Transport Minister El Malick Ndiaye said in a statement on Thursday.

Flights have been suspended near Dakar since the incident authorities said.

The injured were being treated in a hospital while the other survivors were taken to a hotel. Footage shared on social media shows the wing of the plane covered in fire-suppressing foam.

The Dakar accident is the latest in a series of incidents plaguing Boeing's planes. It comes just one day after a Boeing cargo plane was forced to land on its nose in Istanbul after its front landing gear collapsed.

The evolution of cloud artificial technology and IoT has further transformed efficiency and access in a big way.





Gartner has predicted that by 2022 about 50 percent of the existing spend analysis and procurement tools will be replaced by AI-driven cloud-based purchasing platforms. Hence it makes perfect sense to use the same technologies to power procurement.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äî where the business world had to face disruptions in supply chains due to lockdown and movement restrictions ‚Äî e-procurement becomes even more important.





There are foundries and manufacturing industries involved in producing critical need materials who need to proactively source raw materials alongside an emphasis on the quality of the materials. The facility of e-tendering and e-contracting ensures speedy fulfilment of the need.

E-procurement platforms are technology-driven online portals which are owned and operated by companies and in some cases governments.

Businesses register on these platforms and state their requirements which has a list of registered vendors who digitally bid for the requirements. And as per the company‚Äôs considerations the contract is given to a vendor.





In a pandemic impacted business landscape the importance of a robust and shock-proof supply chain can‚Äôt be overemphasised.





Indian metal manufacturing sector requires a constant supply of quality raw materials for production and in the conventional approach there are several risk factors.





For instance the conventional procurement process requires the purchasing department to hold one-on-one interactions with the vendors where bids are submitted and evaluated manually. This inherently puts a limit to the number of vendors that can bid for a requirement and this limitation can impact the quality and reliability of the supply chain.





Through digital procurement a lot of complicated and cumbersome processes are either eliminated or become simplified. Here are a few examples:

E-tendering

Through e-tendering companies can make the procurement process simpler for specific raw materials and specialised goods such as machinery and can easily procure small or large quantities as required.

Vendor management

For any company that requires a steady flow of supplies and raw materials for its operations vendor management is a core need. This has to be done with a focus on production excellence cost control quality assurance and risk mitigation. Vendor management enhances value from the vendors and contracting speedier.

Cloud-based supply chain management

There is a need to compile and organise the supply chain data from suppliers. This is essential for cybersecurity purposes and future procurement planning.





The data collection also provides insights about sources and the flexibility of modifying supply chains in instances of remote working. In the wake of the pandemic cloud-based procurement has become a highly beneficial option for manufacturers.

Data analytics-driven crisis management

Automatic data analysis in the source-to-pay (S2P) process is extremely important for businesses more so in crisis management situations. A good e-procurement platform allows such desired analytics-driven crisis management helping you deal with the changes more effectively and speedily.

Production driven procurement

Traditionally the production process and procurement existed in silos. However with the advent of technology there is an opportunity to ensure better harmony and coordination between these two functions.





As per a study ensuring procurement and production processes‚Äô joint optimisation could result in up to a 25 percent increase in efficiency.





By opting for e-procurement businesses also derive various benefits and can drive leaner and optimised procurement operations. A company can not only purchase the required raw materials but can also maintain real-time inventory records.





As a business you can determine the volume of raw materials in stock and required over a specific time. Considering the standard time taken by the procurement and delivery processes business leaders can proactively manage inventory and place orders for raw materials.





Transparency of operations is another great benefit of e-procurement. At any time all the information is precisely stacked into various segments and there is easy access to process timelines.

BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2RpZ2l0YWwtYmFua3MtdXMtMi15ZWFyLXVwZGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 years on Europe's digital banks are still invisible in the US,"Europe‚Äôs top digital banks are struggling to take off in the US blocked by stiff competition from homegrown counterparts according to data collected by Apptopia.

Download rankings for the first half of this year show local US digital banking apps dominating the top 10 leaderboard. The only contender from Europe was Germany‚Äôs N26 polling in 10th place.

The UK's Revolut came in at number 11 while Monzo did not rank.

It's still early days. N26 launched in July 2019 while Monzo opened its waitlist the same month followed by Revolut in March last year. The latter two are also still pursuing bank licences and are yet to kick off their marketing campaigns.

Nonetheless US peers who launched at a similar time have soared ahead. For instance teen bank Step only opened its waitlist in 2019 (going live in October 2020) and is already at the number four spot boasting a 96% increase in downloads year on year.

While downloads aren't everything they offer a decent proxy for visibility.

For context US leader Chime which launched in 2012 got 6.4m downloads in the first half of this year as well as being the most downloaded banking app in the US in 2020. That's 37x more than N26.

Direction of travel

The most recent data continues to tell the story of European challenger banks‚Äô struggling to attract customers across the Atlantic. They face stiff competition from not only digital-first banks native to America but also banking stalwarts such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo and their mobile app offshoots.

There may be a silver lining however in that the pandemic has given the US audience a penchant for digital-first banks. Digital banks in the US saw a big spike in monthly active users over the course of last year while incumbents now have negative growth compared to 2019 according to Apptopia data.

That might offer some relief to Europe‚Äôs challenger banks as they continue to find their footing in the US.

Data also suggests debit cards are becoming more popular despite the US market having traditionally favoured credit cards.

Standing out from the crowd

Cracking the US isn't impossible for Europeans.

After four years (and heavy investment) Sweden's Klarna announced it was growing at a rate of ~6m new customers in the US annually to take on local Buy Now Pay Later players.

The UK's Wise also eventually secured a good footing in the US now accounting for 25% of its worldwide revenue after nearly 10 years.

However the specific question facing digital banks is how they can differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market. The US has already gotten several lookalikes with large investors behind them leaving a less obvious gap.

""There is nothing that the startups are coming to market with that is new or different"" Ron Shevlin a fintech researcher at Cornerstone Advisors told Reuters last year.

Still Revolut and Monzo might strike a chord with the US audience by becoming fully licenced banks (if their applications are successful). The only other fully licenced neobank at present is Varo offering them a potential advantage if 'embedded fintechs' fall out of vogue.

Indeed US regulators are cracking down on fintechs like Chime for using the term 'bank' without full licences.

Another route for Europe's neobanks is to simply dominate very specific markets rather than becoming mainstream winners says Apptopia's Adam Blacker.

""This is a market all about finding your niche. These banks aren't marketing to everyone they are going after specific cohorts of individuals"" Blacker tells Sifted. ""If banks like Revolut and N26 continue to spend on user acquisition in the US market I think they can carve out a respectable customer base.""

He added that Chime and Current actually grew at a similar pace to N26 in their early days meaning it wouldn't be impossible for the European banks to catch up (in theory).

Battle of the banks

Among the Europeans N26 is still leading the race in the US.

The Berlin-based startup had amassed 500000 customers as of August 2020 and welcomed 172000 more between January and June according to the latest data.

That actually makes America one of N26's fastest-growing markets compared to its download rate in Germany.

N26 now has a team of around 60 people on the ground in New York which it plans to grow by 75% it told Sifted earlier this year. Stephanie Balint is its interim general manager in the US stepping in after the departure of US chief executive Nicolas Kopp over a year ago.

Next in line is Revolut which had amassed 200k retail customers in the US as of late March. Revolut also looks to have the best momentum. Its average daily downloads in the US is trending upwards whilst N26 has slowed according to Apptopia.

Meanwhile Monzo is significantly below both of these with a flat trend line. It recently hired Carol Nelson as US CEO to replace TS Anil who ascended to group CEO. At the last count Nelson was managing a team of10 people according to one person with knowledge of the situation.

The company is said to be intentionally pursuing a small organic launch while it decides on its product and waits for its banking charter.

Still the more they wait the more the US fintechs look to be creeping ahead...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzb2N0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9maXJzdC1jaXRpemVucy1iYW5rLXNodXR0ZXItY2hhcmxvdHRlLWJyYW5jaC10aGlzLWZhbGwvWU5CWUVSWlpZSkVSWEJXTTU0WkFENExJVkkv0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzb2N0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9maXJzdC1jaXRpemVucy1iYW5rLXNodXR0ZXItY2hhcmxvdHRlLWJyYW5jaC10aGlzLWZhbGwvWU5CWUVSWlpZSkVSWEJXTTU0WkFENExJVkkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Citizens Bank to shutter a Charlotte branch this fall,"We‚Äôre Sorry!

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you‚Äôre Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That‚Äôs five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal‚Äôs the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use ‚Äúat least‚Äù two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have ‚Äúwater as hot as you can take it.‚Äù Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then ‚Äúdrink tons of water‚Äù and ‚Äúoff to bed early.‚Äù Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there‚Äôs no way you wouldn‚Äôt be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that‚Äôs like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel‚Äôs method could have negative side effects. ‚ÄúOveruse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose‚Äù she told the website.

Long story short you don‚Äôt need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and ‚Äî I‚Äôm just guessing on this one ‚Äî so will your pipes. (That much salt can‚Äôt be good for them right?)

It‚Äôll hang there until the next time you need to towel off‚Äîunless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There‚Äôs a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

‚ÄúGenerally you should change your towels every three to four uses‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThis helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.‚Äù

It‚Äôs important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

‚ÄúHowever if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúThe same applies to those who live in humid climates‚Äîbecause towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.‚Äù

Your Towel's Material

Your towel‚Äôs material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

‚ÄúThanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel‚Äù explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. ‚ÄúIn our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.‚Äù

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

‚ÄúFactors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes‚Äù say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. ‚ÄúIf your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements‚Äù say the experts at Cozy Earth. ‚ÄúOver time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.‚Äù

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

‚ÄúPersonally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one‚Äù says Gutierrez. ‚ÄúI have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They‚Äôre quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.‚Äù

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong‚Äôs ‚Äúsacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.‚Äù Duke Ellington‚Äôs music was ‚Äúconsidered worldly‚Äù counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking‚Äîand there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery‚ÄîDuke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they‚Äôd been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother‚Äôs Sanctified church. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòwhole ‚ÄòCongregation would be ‚ÄúWailing‚Äî‚ÄòSinging like ‚Äòmad and ‚Äòsound so ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äù he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have myself a ‚ÄòBall in ‚ÄòChurch especially when those ‚ÄòSisters ‚Äòwould get ‚ÄòSo ‚ÄòCarried away while ‚ÄòRev‚Äô would be ‚Äòright in the ‚ÄòMiddle of his ‚ÄòSermon. ‚ÄòMan those ‚ÄòChurch ‚ÄòSisters would ‚Äòbegin ‚ÄòShouting ‚ÄòSo‚Äîuntil their ‚Äòpetticoats would ‚Äòfall off. ‚Ä¶ My heart went into every hymn I sang‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.‚Äù

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn‚Äôt often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including ‚ÄúGo Down Moses‚Äù and ‚ÄúNobody Knows the Trouble I‚Äôve Seen.‚Äù He recorded ‚ÄúWhen the Saints‚Äù the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry ‚ÄúSweets‚Äù Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to ‚Äúget up to shout.‚Äù Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. ‚ÄúPrior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer‚Äù recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished ‚Äúit was understood that we should go ahead and eat.‚Äù

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. ‚ÄúThese are things people don‚Äôt know about him‚Äù said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. ‚ÄúHe had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. ‚Ä¶ He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!‚Äù When a reporter asked how he ‚Äúas a religious man‚Äù could ‚Äúplay in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign‚Äù Ellington whispered ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that exactly what Christ did‚Äîwent into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?‚Äù

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. ‚ÄúSome people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation‚Äù Ellington wrote in his memoir. ‚ÄúI think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.‚Äù The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were ‚Äúthe most important thing I have ever done.‚Äù They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him ‚ÄúYou know Duke you made me put my cross back on!‚Äù

Sacrilegious then isn‚Äôt the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington ‚Äúwas quite taken with the story of the ‚ÄòJuggler of Notre Dame.‚Äô‚Äù It‚Äôs a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. ‚ÄúThe man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.‚Äù

She announced to her colleagues that she had helped create the infamous jingle ""Cars cost less in Wetaskiwin"" a four-second earworm that has been imprinted in the minds of Albertans since the 1980s.

""I told people at that party that I had done it because I'm old now and I don't care"" Baxter told CBC's Edmonton AM on Wednesday.

Before that Baxter had grown quiet about her role in its creation. The jingle had been played so much the people she worked with had grown tired of it.

""They got sick of that jingle because they heard it once every five minutes"" she said.

But last month while on her way to buy groceries Baxter heard Judy Aldous host of CBC's Alberta at Noon mention ""that one from Wetaskiwin"" while talking about jingles.

She decided to call the show and let them know exactly where it came from.

It was 1984 or 1985 ‚Äî Baxter can't recall exactly. She was a new hire at CFRN-TV (now CTV Edmonton) working as a writer and producer in the advertising department.

A colleague went on vacation. Covering for him Baxter was assigned the account for a group of car dealerships in Wetaskiwin Alta. 70 kilometres south of Edmonton.

Coming up with a jingle was not an easy task she recalled.

""I could not for the life of me figure out how to appeal to the demographic of the Toyota and the Ford and all in one"" she remembered.

The tagline ""Cars cost less in Wetaskiwin"" had been given to her. She believes a child had suggested the words to a dealership manager.

It was Baxter's job to come up with a tune.

Around that time Dolly Parton had transitioned from country to pop with songs like 9 to 5 and Islands in the Stream. Inspired by the musician Baxter decided to make the jingle ""nice and bouncy.""

""She's kind of a bouncy character"" Baxter said of Parton.

Even though her creative director thought she was out of her mind he didn't protest too much.

After finding a ""Dolly Parton sound-alike"" Baxter and the rest of the team sat down and wrote an entire song in one afternoon in 30-second and 60-second versions.

The song ended with a ""tag-out"" ‚Äî the ""Cars cost less in Wetaskiwin"" part.

A cassette of the song was played on a boombox to a boardroom full of older men ‚Äî one of whom went as far as calling her ""little lady.""

""I was completely intimidated and shaking in my space boots"" Baxter said.

Unanimously the dealership clients accepted the song for a commercial and it was sold to stations across the province.

For the first few weeks the song ran full-length in commercials. But the ""tag-out"" became so catchy it stuck around. And around.

The more popular the jingle became the quieter Baxter became about its origins.

""I was a victim of my own success"" she said.

These days she's more comfortable with her legacy.

""If you like it great. And if you don't like it too bad. It's sold a lot of cars and that's what makes the world go round.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvZGF2aWQtb2x1c29nYS1oaXN0b3J5LW5ocy1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi0xMDk3MDM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Olusoga: 'The story of the NHS and the story of immigration are completely intertwined',"The historian and broadcaster Professor David Olusoga has made British history uncomfortable ‚Äì and makes no apologies for it. Britons he argues are trapped in a make-believe past which has written out the contributions of a host of largely non-white people who have helped to shape the nation into what it is today.

He fears that because we are unaware or unable to recognise how our history has shaped our nation and its culture we will struggle to reshape our institutions for the better. His latest target is arguably his riskiest yet an institution central to the lives and dearest to the hearts of most ‚Äì the National Health Service.

In his new BBC programme Our NHS: A Hidden History Olusoga investigates how the health service has relied on immigration ‚Äì one of the most divisive social and political issues of the age ‚Äì for its survival. Nurses doctors and health workers who have been arriving for many decades often overcoming prejudice and discrimination to serve Britons in their hours of need describe their experiences of ‚Äúhelping and healing with one hand while fending off the sharp end of discrimination and racism with the other‚Äù as the broadcaster puts it.

Britain ended the Second World War with an acute labour shortage and in dire need of an extra 1.3 million workers. At that moment the Labour government set up the National Health Service which went on to become the UK and Europe‚Äôs biggest employer. The answer as to how to staff the NHS then ‚Äì as now ‚Äì to ensure that it could function was down to a key factor: immigration.

David Olusoga with Malila Noone and Sashi Sashidharan (Photo: Harriet Thomas/BBC)

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we could see how interconnected immigration and the NHS were until the pandemic‚Äù says Olusoga. ‚ÄúThe story of the National Health Service and the story of immigration are completely intertwined. You cannot have one without the other. One is a beloved institution that we see in entirely uncritical terms for most parts and the other is arguably the most fraught political issue of the past half-century. I wanted to show how they are interconnected.‚Äù

It is not simply a tale of race and discrimination although as recently as the late 70s classified advertisements seeking GPs to join existing practices routinely specified ‚ÄúBritish graduate required‚Äù ‚Äì meaning as one doctor says: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre brown and from abroad don‚Äôt bother applying.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also stories from people all over the world being intertwined by their connections whether as patients or as doctors in this great thing called the NHS‚Äù says Olusoga. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also the story of people who have come to our country because they have heard about the NHS and almost could not believe what an amazing institution it is.

‚ÄúThe key point is that the story [of the NHS] doesn‚Äôt change. It has been short of doctors and nurses from its inception. It didn‚Äôt have ‚Äì has never had ‚Äì enough doctors and nurses. It has always been a service that has relied upon drawing in people all over the world.‚Äù

And that diverse workforce is both a strength and a weakness the academic says adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to make a judgement. This is a phenomenon. It is an international NHS. There are lots of positives and lots of negatives. It has made the NHS famous all over the world and it has brought amazing people to Britain who have contributed.

‚ÄúIt has also taken fairly skilled educated people from Africa the Philippines from the Caribbean who could have done amazing things in their societies and brought them to Britain. Doctors and nurses took an enormous decision to come here. They faced difficulties they faced racism but these were proactive people who made very brave decisions to leave their country to train in a new profession thousands of miles away.‚Äù

Olusoga who is no stranger to controversy shies away from commenting on the present-day NHS but acknowledges that there is some way to go before its senior management reflects the diversity of the workforce. ‚ÄúIn terms of management [and diversity] I don‚Äôt think the NHS has a wonderful record‚Äù he notes.

Today about 170000 out of 1.28 million NHS staff ‚Äì almost one in seven ‚Äì are non-British comprising 200 nationalities. About 64000 staff are Asian accounting for 39 per cent of all doctors. And the reliance on immigration has not changed Olusoga says only where the migrants are from.

‚ÄúThe first people to come to fill the labour shortage in the NHS were the first people who came to fill Britain‚Äôs labour shortage in almost every sector the Irish. Ireland has always poured labour into Britain but that has changed as Britain‚Äôs relationships around the world evolved.‚Äù

Most recently that has involved people from the European Union. More than 67000 NHS staff in England ‚Äì 5.5 per cent of the total ‚Äì are from EU countries. One of the reasons why Britain has relied so heavily on overseas staff is also partly down to the number of doctors nurses and other healthcare workers who emigrate ‚Äì a fact which is often forgotten Olusoga argues.

‚ÄúLots of doctors and nurses from Britain in the 1950s and 60s saw opportunities elsewhere and took their training and their skills and went to work in Australia Canada or the US. So the labour shortage in the NHS is partly caused by the expansion of the NHS from 1948 but it is also the story of an organisation that struggled to find people because British people emigrate. For centuries British people have been great emigrators and we often forget that.‚Äù

He is reticent about the NHS‚Äôs future saying: ‚ÄúIt is what we decide it to be. The borders of what it does or doesn‚Äôt do are political conversations. The NHS since its inception has been an enormously diverse and international organisation and we didn‚Äôt really recognise that fully until the pandemic. Many more of us noticed that it was much more international than we presumed previously.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

Warren Buffett told the CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that the greatest threats to the philanthropic behemoth were cockiness red tape and self-satisfaction. The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO who has gifted a total of $33 billion to the foundation and resigned as its trustee in June has warned about those forces in the past.

Mark Suzman took charge of the Gates Foundation early last year and promptly flew to Buffett's hometown of Omaha Nebraska to have lunch with the investor and seek his guidance.

""He told me then that my most important job was to guard against the 'ABC' risks of decay that all very large organizations face: arrogance bureaucracy and complacency"" Suzman wrote in a recent email to the foundation's employees.

Buffett pledged in 2006 to donate over 99% of his wealth to the Gates Foundation and four other foundations and reached the halfway mark towards that goal in June. His advice to Suzman isn't surprising; he wrote in his 2014 letter to Berkshire shareholders that when he retires a big part of his replacement's job will be warding off those exact threats.

""My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay which are arrogance bureaucracy and complacency"" Buffett said. ""When these corporate cancers metastasize even the strongest of companies can falter.""

The Berkshire chief went on to highlight General Motors IBM Sears Roebuck and US Steel as examples of corporate titans that once appeared to have unassailable grips on their industries. ""The destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them to fall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible"" he said.

Buffett noted in the letter that he structured his company to minimize red tape. Berkshire's decentralized web of autonomous subsidiaries underpinned by a culture of trust acts as the ""ideal antidote to bureaucracy"" he said. Berkshire also saves money and boosts efficiency by not having HR PR IR legal acquisitions and other departments in its headquarters he added.

The investor singled out the ""B"" in the ABCs again in his 2009 shareholder letter.

""We would rather suffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come from decisions made too slowly ‚Äì or not at all ‚Äì because of a stifling bureaucracy"" Buffett said.

Given Buffett's clear disdain for the ABCs it's no surprise that he told Suzman that his primary focus should be preventing the Gates Foundation from succumbing to them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vdmlkZW8vcGFydC1mb3J0LWxhdWRlcmRhbGUtYWlycG9ydC1ldmFjdWF0ZWQtMTYwMTUxMTI4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Part of Fort Lauderdale Airport Evacuated Amid 'Security Investigation',"Portions of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida were evacuated due to a ‚Äúsecurity investigation‚Äù on Saturday July 10 airport officials said.

Sixty years of Nobel Prize-winning theory say no it is not possible. But just maybe it is. Ironically the widespread belief that it‚Äôs impossible helps to make it possible.

To see how recall a high-buzz stock market event last December 21 when Tesla became a component of the S&P 500. Research Affiliates chairman Rob Arnott and colleagues made a bold prediction: Tesla stock ‚Äúis likely to underperform the market (S&P 500) in the year after entry‚Äù and ‚ÄúApartment Investment and Management the stock removed from the S&P 500 to make room for Tesla is likely to outperform the index over the next year by as much as 20%.‚Äù

Today just over six months later the only flaw in that prediction is that it may have been too modest. The S&P 500 is up 17%. Tesla is indeed underperforming badly; it‚Äôs flat. Apartment Investment and Management (known as Aimco) is outperforming the S&P and by way more than 20%; it‚Äôs up 44%.

Arnott whose firm develops investment strategies used in managing $166 billion of assets worldwide argues that what happened is no fluke. It‚Äôs a particularly dramatic example of a predictable phenomenon that can be exploited by traders.

The opportunity he says is in the fundamental nature of index mutual funds and ETFs. Their objective obviously is to track the performance of an index which means tracking it exactly. The index fund industry has become intensely competitive and any divergence of a fund‚Äôs price from the index‚Äôs movement known as tracking error will be seized upon by competitors as evidence that the fund is poorly run. The danger of tracking error multiplies when one stock replaces another in the index. The reason: To avoid tracking error every index fund wants to buy the new stock and sell the departing one at the closing prices on the day before that day because the index will be calculated on that basis. The result is trading mayhem on the trading day before the switch.

For Tesla traders the big day was Friday December 18 and trading mayhem duly ensued. On each of the previous few days about 5% of the company‚Äôs outstanding shares had been traded but on December 18 23% was traded as indexers stampeded to buy the stock as near to the closing price as possible. The price jumped 6% then fell all the way back down the following Monday.

But that‚Äôs only half the story for Tesla or any other stock being added to the index. The S&P U.S. Index Committee announced Tesla‚Äôs addition a month in advance on November 17 2020 and for the next month hedge funds and other traders bought it up knowing they could sell it to index funds that had to buy it on December 18. Partly as a result Tesla rocketed 57% in that month from the announcement until December 17.

For Aimco it was the opposite: Over the same period its stock fell 17% as investors dumped it.

The trading opportunity is obvious: Buy the outgoing stock which has been pounded down and sell the incoming stock which has been pushed to the sky on the big day before the switch becomes effective. Those opportunities occur fairly often about ten times a year on average Arnott‚Äôs research shows. Over the past 20 years an average of 23 stocks have been exiled from the index annually to be replaced by 23 newcomers. Most of those deletions are practically automatic when a company merges is bought or goes bankrupt. The rest are discretionary switches like Tesla-Aimco and those are the ones to focus on.

It isn‚Äôt necessary to follow the formula exactly. Individual investors may not own any of the incoming stock to sell and may not have the stomach for short-selling. That‚Äôs fine. Just buying the outgoing stock works great on average.

‚ÄúStocks being dropped from the index inevitably are deep value stocks that have performed badly are struggling as a business and are dropped at distressed prices‚Äù Arnott says.

His firm‚Äôs research finds that buying the outgoing stock in discretionary deletions from the S&P 500 at the closing price on the day it‚Äôs removed from the index has beaten the market by an average of nearly 20% over the following 12 months.

That is supposed to be impossible. The efficient market hypothesis holds that any reliable system for beating the market will quickly become known and almost immediately be arbitraged away as traders jump aboard. Why hasn‚Äôt it happened in this case? ‚ÄúThe big force that prevents it from happening is the sheer scale of the indexers‚Äù says Arnott.

Nearly $5 trillion of assets are indexed to the S&P 500 says the index‚Äôs parent S&P Global. When the managers of all that money must buy a particular stock and sell a particular stock on a given day almost at a given hour that‚Äôs an opportunity for other traders. Everyone knows it‚Äôs coming yet it doesn‚Äôt get arbitraged away because not enough money is trying to do so. In part‚Äîhere‚Äôs the irony‚Äîthat‚Äôs because so many trillions are invested in a wide array of index funds on the belief that picking individual stocks doesn‚Äôt work.

Investors in S&P 500 index funds are the losers. Consider that the fund giants wage war to attract customers by offering the lowest expense ratio; for Vanguard‚Äôs S&P fund it‚Äôs four basis points for Charles Schwab‚Äôs it‚Äôs two for Fidelity‚Äôs it‚Äôs 1.5. Yet the annual cost to clients of rebalancing for additions and deletions is 20 to 40 basis points on average Arnott calculates.

That cost which is significant over time can be at least partially avoided. A strategy of rebalancing three months after the effective date rather than the day before the effective date has beaten the index by 13 basis points on average over 18 years Arnott and his colleagues found. It seems an easy way for a fund to improve its performance. But index funds don‚Äôt do it because it would introduce tracking error‚Äîand never mind that it would be positive tracking error.

‚ÄúThe indexing community has trained customers to think zero tracking error is the goal‚Äù Arnott says. ‚ÄúEven positive tracking error is bad.‚Äù

Index funds on the whole are a boon for investors. Turns out they can be a boon in an unexpected way. An S&P 500 rebalance says Arnott ‚Äúis a great opportunity to do the opposite of what the index does: buy the deletion and sell the addition.‚Äù It may not pay off in every rebalance but over time it ‚Äúhas historically proven to be an excellent investment idea.‚Äù Even if it is supposed to be impossible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA3LTEyL3RoZS1mZWQtbWF5LWhhdmUtbG9zdC10aGUtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktdG8tc3RhcnQtYS1zbW9vdGgtcWUtdGFwZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Fed May Have Lost the Opportunity to Start a Smooth QE Taper,"Wise old market heads often remark that the bond market rarely lies and it often leads the stock market.

That should be expected given the fact that they are made by Apple‚Äôs biggest competitor. But Google‚Äôs Pixel Buds A are excellent wireless earbuds with great fit and decent sound. Long story short they are an impeccable value over the standard AirPods even if you have to make some compromises.



Ear fit and shape

Google‚Äôs Pixel Buds A are in-ear style earbuds rather than universal fit ones like the standard AirPods. Typically the universal fit from AirPods works best for me. AirPods Pro have always been finicky for me despite their incredible sound. None of the ear tips ever fit quite right so I‚Äôve always thought that if Apple can‚Äôt get it right no one else can. I was wrong. Google‚Äôs Pixel Bud design fits my ears much better than AirPods Pro ever have. Unlike AirPods Pro they don‚Äôt move around too much in my ears and never feel as though they are going to fall out. The ear tips are comfortable soft but not too soft. The Pixel Buds A also come with multiple tip sizes so you can choose the one that best fits in your ears.

The one caveat that I have with the design is the lack of any sort of stem or curvature to easily pluck the earbuds out of my ears. AirPods stems can look goofy but the flat circular design of Pixel Buds A require a bit more work to remove. Despite that the circular design is really attractive and unobtrusive.

Earbud & case design

A nice benefit of the flat circular design is that it acts as a capacitive button. The button isn‚Äôt too sensitive but just sensitive enough to be reliable. You can tap once to pause tap twice to go to the next song or tap three times to go to the previous one.

The charging case for Pixel Buds A is very similar to the standard AirPods but it has a really nice soft touch coating rather than a glossy finish. It‚Äôs more comfortable to hold in your hands and almost feels like a pebble. The standard more expensive Pixel Buds have wireless charging but the Pixel Buds A do not. That‚Äôs not a huge deal since battery life has been really good. I haven‚Äôt had to charge them much at all. And when I do have to charge them there‚Äôs a handy USB-C port on the bottom.

Compatibility with iOS

Now let‚Äôs talk about how these actually work when connected to an iPhone. First and foremost these obviously don‚Äôt offer any sort of fast pairing when used with an iPhone or iPad. They connect to your Apple devices like any other legacy Bluetooth accessory. Open Settings go to Bluetooth and select the Pixel Buds A. They will connect automatically when you put them in your ears like AirPods and will disconnect when placed in the case. Because they don‚Äôt have access to Apple‚Äôs more advanced pairing technology they won‚Äôt automatically switch between devices. You‚Äôll need to manually pair the Pixel Buds A to your other Apple devices.

The battery widget has been a super useful tool for keeping track of your paired accessories. Luckily Pixel Buds A do indeed show up in the battery widget. So like AirPods you can make sure they are charged when you need them. The only issue is that you don‚Äôt see the battery life of each individual Pixel Bud.

Pixel Buds A will also pause audio when you remove one from your ear. That‚Äôs a big leg up on the Beats Studio Buds that Apple just released and the Pixel Buds A are $50 cheaper. While Pixel Buds A do not offer active noise cancellation they do have great sound. So their $99 price makes for an excellent value. One other thing to note is that these won‚Äôt work with the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù command but you can tap and hold an earbud to start talking to Siri manually.

No software updates

There‚Äôs one significant drawback to using the Pixel Buds A with an iPhone or iPad. That‚Äôs the lack of a Pixel Buds app for iOS and iPadOS. Like Apple Google regularly releases software updates for Pixel Buds to improve performance and connectivity. If you have an Android device you can connect the Pixel Buds A to it to do software updates. But you‚Äôre out of luck if you don‚Äôt. The earbuds do have good connectivity though. There‚Äôs the occasionally glitch but otherwise I haven‚Äôt had enough issues to say it‚Äôs a problem.

I really wish Google would release a Pixel Buds app for iOS. Microsoft offers one for their Surface earbuds if you use those with an iOS device.

If you use Android

Our pals over at 9to5Google have already reviewed the Pixel Buds A-Series and how they work with Android devices. I highly recommend you head over there to read Ben Schoon‚Äôs review. Ben said in his review that:

There are just no deal breakers with Pixel Buds A-Series. They nail the experience pretty much across the board for a reasonable price tag without giving up anything important from the regular Pixel Buds.

Conclusion

I‚Äôve got the white Pixel Buds A but Google also offers them in a sage green color. I really like the all white design they‚Äôre slick looking both in-ear and in the case. You can order the Pixel Buds A directly from Google or pick them up from your local Best Buy store. Pixel Buds stock has been iffy at Best Buy stores so make sure you check ahead of visiting your store.

I think that the Pixel Buds A-Series are totally worth their $99 price tag. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre a better value than the base AirPods that haven‚Äôt been updated since early 2019 which still cost $159 without the wireless charging case. I‚Äôd also recommend these above Beats‚Äô new Studio Buds. While those do offer noise cancellation they are missing features like device syncing and pausing when you remove them from your ears.

The 11700K's pricing should make it an attractive chip if you want the most performance from a mainstream Intel platform that you can get without paying the flagship price but it faces stiff competition from the AMD chips that have dominated our list of Best CPUs (at least when they're available at retail).



Cypress Cove Intel's first new architecture for desktop PC chips in six years grants the Rocket Lake chips a 19% increase in IPC in most workloads. But the backported Cypress Cove (which was designed for 10nm) comes with a big tradeoff: Rocket Lake is still etched on the 14nm process and tops out at eight cores and sixteen threads. That's a step back from the previous-gen 10-core Comet Lake i9 models and pales in comparison to AMD's beastly 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X flagship.



Rocket Lake's 19% IPC gain largely offsets the performance hit from the reduced core count but it left Intel in a tough spot as it carved its product stack into Core i9 and Core i7 families ‚Äî both series top out at the same eight cores.



The $399 Core i7-11700K fits the definition of being a lower-end Core i9-11900K with the same eight cores and sixteen threads as the $539 flagship. And you could also save some cash by opting for the graphics-less Core i7-11700KF (it's identical in every other aspect) and score the chip for $374. That opens up a $75 gap between the 11700K and the Ryzen 7 5800X which also doesn't come with an integrated graphics engine.



To account for the vagaries of binning and to hamstring the 11700K to create artificial segmentation Intel dropped the 11700K's peak boost frequency by 300 MHz compared to the Core i9-11900K reduced the memory frequencies in low-latency mode and dropped its support for the new Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT). The ABT tech is effectively an auto-overclocking feature that doesn't void your warranty but the 11700K is a fully overclockable chip. That means that losing that feature or the extra 300 MHz of peak boost speed might not dissuade CPU overclockers looking to save $140 over the 11900K.

The 11700K drops into a gaping hole in AMD's product stack ‚Äî AMD has a $150 gap between the $449 Ryzen 7 5800X which also comes with eight cores and the $299 six-core Ryzen 5 5600X. The obvious pricing gap in AMD's stack should give the 11700K some breathing room for now though AMD says that its upcoming Ryzen 5000 G-series chips otherwise known as the 'Cezanne' APUs will plug that pricing gap when the $359 Ryzen 5 5700G comes to market in August 2021.



However the 5700G appears to target the downstream Core i7-11700 instead of the K series model giving the 11700K the opportunity to thrive as a less-expensive 11900K and/or Ryzen 7 5800X alternative. It just so happens that Intel's own strict segmentation impacts the 11700K's performance significantly reducing its appeal.



Lately though the winning chip is the chip that you can actually buy. As such the Core i7-11700K has benefited from one almost insurmountable advantage ‚Äî availability. AMD has been hamstrung by supply shortages spurred by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions coupled with unprecedented demand leading to price gouging on nearly its entire stack.



Supply is improving for AMD though and the Ryzen 7 5800X has been broadly available at or near its MSRP for roughly the past month. And supplies seem to be holding steady setting up a pitched battle with the Core i7-11700K.

Intel Core i7-11700K Specifications and Pricing

We've covered the Rocket Lake family in-depth in our launch-day review so head there for finer-grained details of the architecture and broader product family. Intel spreads the Rocket Lake (RKL-S) chips across the familiar Core i9 i7 and i5 families but Comet Lake Refresh (CML-R) chips step in for Core i3 and Pentium. Those chips feature the same architecture as other Comet Lake chips but come with slightly increased clock speeds. You can learn more about them here.



Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost many with both single- and multi-core ratios that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. You can find more information on Rocket Lake's boost tech and a more expansive listing of all the frequencies here.

The Core i7-11700K uses the same eight-core 16-thread silicon as the Core i9-11900K but there are a few key differentiators. The 11700K has a lower binning that results in lower peak clock frequencies of 5.0 GHz a 300 MHz reduction compared to the 11900K lower peak memory frequencies in low-latency Gear 1 mode (more on that shortly) and culled Thermal Boost Velocity (TVB) and Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) support. Here's a closer look at the disabled boost tech:

Single-Core Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB): Fastest active favored core can boost higher than Turbo Boost Max 3.0 if below a pre-defined temperature threshold (70C) and all other factors adhere to TB 3.0 conditions.

All-Core Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB): Increases all-core frequency when all cores are active and the chip is under 70C.

Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT): Allows dynamic adjustment of all-core turbo frequencies when four or more cores are active. This feature doesn't have a guaranteed boost threshold ‚Äî it will vary based on chip quality your cooler and power delivery.

TVB frequencies only activate if the processor is under a certain temperature limit but most motherboard makers ignore those limits. That means a chip with the tech will likely operate at the faster speeds regardless of chip temperature at least on higher-end motherboards. That also means that culling the feature from the 11700K doesn't have as much of an impact as the drastically reduced frequency ceiling ‚Äî TVB only offers an extra 100 MHz for both single- and all-core boost frequencies.



Think of Intel's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) much like a dynamic auto-overclocking feature that applies to all-core boosts but remains within warranty. ABT doesn't come with a guaranteed frequency ‚Äî peak frequencies will vary based upon the quality of your chip cooler and motherboard power delivery. Still because the chip stays within Intel's spec it is a supported feature that doesn't fall into the same classification as overclocking so it's fully within warranty.

Intel only offers ABT on Core i9 K and KF processors but the basic principle and functionality of the feature should be portable to any Intel chip. That means Intel removed this feature from the 11700K simply to make customers pay more for it by stepping up to its most expensive desktop chips.

Intel lists the Core i7-11700K with a 125W TDP the same as the previous-gen 10700K but this only encompasses the PL1 (Power Limit 1) level that occurs when the chip operates at its base frequency. The 11700K jumps to 251W when it operates at boost frequencies (PL2 - Power Limit 2). That's an increase over the 10700K's 224W PL2 but both chips have the same recommended Tau (boost duration) of 56 seconds. As with all other Intel chips motherboard vendors are free to ignore these limits if their motherboards have adequate power circuitry so these limits are rarely seen on higher-end boards unless you manually force your motherboard to adhere to them.

Finally the Core i9-11900K is the only Rocket Lake chip supporting DDR4-3200 memory in the optimal configuration at stock settings which is called 'Gear 1.' This setting allows the memory controller and memory frequency to operate at the same speed (1:1) thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work like gaming.

All other Rocket Lake chips like the Core i7-11700K only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates. This can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications ‚Äî particularly gaming. We have yet to see a situation where Gear 2 makes much sense for enthusiasts. Instead this setting is most useful for those chasing overclocking frequency records that don't directly equate to real-world performance boosts.

The Core i7-11700K's official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking which voids your warranty. Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty. We've found that Gear 1 provides the best all-around performance so that's all you'll see in our testing for this review. You can take a closer look at the performance deltas we've observed with the modes here.

This is the TV I would get for the best experience,"Now this feels next-gen. Recently Insomniac Games the Sony studio behind the excellent PS5 exclusive Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart released a patch supporting 120Hz displays at 40fps. This bumped the original 30fps frame rate while in full-4K ""Fidelity mode"" by an additional ten.

After playing the game at both its original 30fps and its new 40fps mode on an LG C9 OLED TV it proves without a doubt to be the new standard for 4K console gaming moving forward.

As detailed in the version 1.002 release notes the added 120Hz Display Mode ""reduces input latency when using a compatible display. In this mode the frame rate target for the Fidelity graphics mode increases to 40 frames per second."" What this means is that a game that once looked choppy with its multiple particle and Ray Traced effects became 30% smoother.

While still not as smooth as the lower resolution ""Performance RT"" mode at 60fps it was enough of an uptick in frames that it produced a happy medium between the standard 30fps Fidelity and Performance modes.

How the 120Hz display mode works

Most console games run at either 30fps or 60fps. It makes sense as most TVs have a baseline 60Hz refresh rate. A 60Hz television means the display is refreshing 60 times second. So a game running 30fps on a 60Hz display means a new frame is being introduced every other refresh.

If a game is running at 60fps on a 60Hz display a new frame is being introduced at every refresh making for an even smoother image. And if a 60fps game is running on a 120Hz display it will look just as smooth.

Now I was able to see the full power of the PS5 with Insomniac's intense attention to reflective surface detail at a smooth clip.

In this case of Ratchet & Clanks 120Hz Display Mode Insomniac Games were able to bump the game up to 40fps in its 4K Fidelity mode. For most gamers a 40fps refresh rate might seem odd but it actually divides neatly into a 120Hz display. As noted by The Verge each frame comes in across three refreshes.

A user on the forum ResetEra broke down the frame rate changes in milliseconds. A 60fps game will have a frame time of 16.7ms. A 30fps game will have a frame time of 33.3ms. A 40fps game falls right in the middle at 25ms.

YouTube channel NX Gamer does an excellent job of explaining how this all works at a more granular level.

120Hz Display mode is new PS5 gold standard

This gives Ratchet & Clank a good enough frame rate boost that it's actually noticeable during gameplay. When I first loaded up Rift Apart a played an hour of the game at its original 30fps Fidelity mode. I found the choppiness too jarring given all the effects happening on screen at once.

Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart has proven that a top-end 120Hz television is necessary for the PS5. It really is that much better.

I then decided it would prove to be a better gameplay experience if I opted for the Performance RT mode instead which lowered the resolution to 1440p (with a few drops to 1080p) while also lowering certain effects and Ray Tracing. Even with the graphical compromise the added smoothness eliminated some of that motion sickness.

But after the July 1 patch it was enough of a frame rate improvement that I've stuck to the 120Hz Display mode since. Now I was able to see the full power of the PS5 with Insomniac's intense attention to reflective surface detail at a smooth clip.

Why you need a 120Hz TV like this

(Image credit: LG)

The only downside to this is that it will require gamers to upgrade to a 120Hz display. And ideally one that can produce a rich HDR image. As noted in our best gaming TVs roundup this includes the top-of-the line sets from every manufacturer.

And for gamers that have been desperately checking PS5 restocks to drop $500 on a console only to then require a $1000-plus TV purchase is a big ask.

While I love my LG C9 OLED it's since been discontinued. Luckily there are a bevy of sets that have comparable if not better feature sets that we'd gladly recommend.

I'm personally an LG OLED fan and either this year's C1 Class or last year's CX will perform with rigor. Unfortunately OLED sets are some of the most expensive TVs on the market. Occasionally retailers like Micro Center will have refurbished LG OLEDs on sale. It's how I was able to afford my set. For example it's possible to find last year's 55"" LG CX OLED for $1000. While expensive it's $600 cheaper than the current 55"" C1 Class at Best Buy.

For those that prefer the increased brightness found in QLED televisions our TVs editor Brian Westover has praised both the Samsung QN90A Neo and the TCL 6-Series Roku TV. The latter is the more affordable option at $1099. Not only will these sets support 4K 120Hz output all have vivid and rich panels that can produce a stunning HDR image.

For those looking for a TV under the $1000 mark both the Hisense ULED U8G and Vizio M-Series are solid recommendations. Even then these TVs hover between $700-900. Unfortunately dropping below this price point at the moment will mean losing out on deeper HDR performance that modern games take advantage of.

Bottom line

Of course this 120Hz Display mode ideal might become moot once Sony releases a variable refresh rate patch for the PS5 which would automatically sync fps and refresh rates with compatible televisions eliminating jittering and screen tearing

Moving forward likely every AAA PS5 game will likely have some kind of 40fps/120Hz mode. And for those wanting the absolute best visual experience out of their PS5s Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart has proven that a top-end 120Hz television will be necessary. It really is that much better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvcmV2aWV3ZWQvMjAyMS8wNy8xMC9zb2xvLXN0b3ZlLWZpcmUtcGl0LXNhbGUtc2F2ZS11cC0zMC10aGVzZS1wb3B1bGFyLWZpcmUtcGl0cy83OTI1MDQyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solo Stove fire pit sale: Save up to 30% on these popular fire pits,"Christine Persaud

Specifically he called for a ‚Äúrethink‚Äù of their role as financiers -- instead of lending money themselves to promote development and economic stability the World Bank and IMF would be more useful in the transition to clean energy as insurers that reduce risk for private investors.

Moreover the players dominating the industry are largely ‚Äòpassive‚Äô investors meaning their portfolios are constructed based on pre-determined indices often from third party providers rather than the discretion of scrappy portfolio managers looking to ‚Äòbeat the market‚Äô. This high degree of indexation means investors cannot as a general rule exit investments in individual firms ‚Äì whether as punishment for undesirable behaviour or otherwise.

In light of these quiet but profound shifts the UK has entered a new era: the age of ‚Äúasset manager capitalism‚Äù. In contrast with the image of the activist shareholder on which the prevailing ‚Äòshareholder primacy‚Äô regime of corporate governance is often justified asset manager capitalism is defined by a structural disincentive for shareholders to be concerned with the actions and performance of companies in their portfolio.

Instead managers are motivated by growing their asset pool and market share even going so far as to offer funds with no fees in an effort to capture more of the market. Although financial firms offering products for free seems unthinkable the move ‚Äì spearheaded by the US giant Fidelity ‚Äì is entirely congruent with the fundamental drive of these entities: accumulate accumulate accumulate.

The result is that we are sleepwalking into an economy in which a handful of enormously powerful actors not only have decisive influence over the actions of the corporations in which they hold shares ‚Äì they also have enormous power over the economy writ large.

In theory the position of firms like BlackRock as long-term universal shareholders with considerable stakes across the whole economy should make them uniquely attendant to systemic risks like the climate crisis or widening inequality. Yet independent analysis from ShareAction InfluenceMap Sarasin & Partners Friends of the Earth and others has repeatedly found that the largest asset managers are failing to throw their weight behind these issues and have routinely voted against or abstained on shareholder resolutions on everything from supply chain deforestation to climate targets to exorbitant executive pay packets.

At the same time pressure on corporations to ‚Äòdisgorge the cash‚Äô to shareholders has helped reorient companies toward prioritising these interests above all other stakeholders whether labour or the environment. In 2020 aggregate dividend payouts by the FTSE350 companies represented some 90% of pre-tax profits despite approximately 80 firms not delivering a dividend in the pandemic year. This reflects more than two decades of upward drift in shareholder payouts ‚Äì increasingly paid for with record levels of corporate debt. Over the same period productive investment declined substantially.

In aggregate this type of extractive behaviour undermines efforts to build an inclusive low-carbon economic future by squeezing the labour share of profit and undercutting the investment needed in decarbonisation or changes to unsustainable and unjust supply chains. The rise of asset manager capitalism therefore marks a new era of corporate governance which has important implications for how our economy operates ‚Äì and in whose interests.

However efforts to overcome the extractive and unequal nature of the corporate economy all too often remain stuck in the past striving to dismantle a structure that no longer exists. Today comparatively little productive capital is raised on the stock market and the rise of indexation means that capital is no longer ‚Äòefficiently‚Äô allocated by the invisible hand of aggregate shareholder behaviour. We must therefore ask the question: what are shareholders for?

The corporation is a site of immense productive and organisational capacity but its extraordinary privileges ‚Äì as well as those given to shareholders ‚Äì are publicly endowed. They are not fixed or natural. Going forward the corporation needs to be reclaimed as a social institution that supports generative enterprise and collective endeavour. In the context of the climate crisis profound inequality and increasingly entrenched exploitation in global supply chains this need is urgent.

We can start by reckoning with the role and influence of BlackRock and other asset managers in our economy and designing strategies to challenge and democratise corporate power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1tYXJrZXRzL3JlZGRpdC1zaWx2ZXItYmV0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Reddit's silver 'apes' beat the market?,"Kerry Kraker 56 has worked in kitchens all his life.

Here‚Äôs a clip of Henry Cavill aka Superman aka Geralt of Rivia just being an absolute nerd about Warhammer 40K for a brief shining moment.

Things got incredibly nerdy at the latest WitcherCon a panel put on by Netflix to celebrate the upcoming new season of the show. When Henry Cavill sat down for a panel interview we had no idea that a hidden reference was going to be waiting at the end of it that would reveal hidden depths much like how a band of explorers and a Rogue Trader or two might reveal the path through the ever-shifting maze to get to the heart of the monolithic weapon that pre-dates the Imperium and even the Aeldari known as the Blackstone Fortress.

Which we mention because towards the end of the panel with no prompting no question from the host about his hobbies Henry Cavill did what any true Warhammer player would do‚Äìfind a way to shove a reference to Warhammer 40K in an otherwise perfectly normal conversation. It‚Äôs just a moment of sheer fandom to kick off the end of your weekend. Enjoy.

Stuff like this is why Henry Cavill is an international treasure. That and he plays Custodes which is pretty hardcore. Plus I mean that Chandelier does look like a Blackstone Fortress

The natural world and its wonders remained difficult for mill workers to grasp. The Draper family the owners of the Hopedale Manufacturing Company sought a place of recreation for their workers. After years of trying to squeeze every bit of productivity out of their limited water rights the company had created a massive reservoir used to power their mills. To prevent development around the banks of their mill pond and to give their workers a place of recreation the company undertook an ambitious park development project around their mill pond. The Draper‚Äôs hired noted landscape architect Warren Henry Manning to design their new park. Over the next decade Hopedale spent $2500 a year on developing approximately 1000 acres of land into a public park. More than 4 miles of winding forest trails were created. Picnic areas tennis courts a bathhouse and a boat house were built. Sand was brought in and an artificial beach was created on the shores of the mill pond.



An annual field day event hosted by the company was held on the new park grounds once a year. The company even developed a small peninsular along the lake with mill houses. The ‚ÄúLake-Point Development‚Äù as it came to be known held 10 two-family houses that offered mill workers water-front property. This small community adjacent to the parklands and mill pond became a model of suburban planning. A reimagining of the mill pond and its surrounding which benefitted the workers as well as the employers and still serves as an important reminder to us of the need to get outside and experience nature.

Could data harvested from millions of pregnant women pave the way for genetically enhanced super-soldiers? According to a recent Reuters investigation BGI Group the manufacturers of a popular prenatal test is working with the Chinese military towards that very goal.

BGI group offers a test called Nifty (‚ÄúNon-Invasive Fetal TrisomY‚Äù) which is offered in more than 50 countries and is used to look for genetic abnormalities such as Down‚Äôs syndrome early on in a pregnancy. According to Reuters more than 8 million women have taken these tests and BGI has used the genetic data it has collected to help the Chinese military improve ‚Äúpopulation quality‚Äù. Reuters reports that US government advisers have warned that access to this massive databank could ‚Äúpropel China to dominate global pharmaceuticals and also potentially lead to genetically enhanced soldiers or engineered pathogens to target the US population or food supply‚Äù. BGI has issued a statement rejecting these claims.

‚ÄúChina is stealing your intimate data for evil purposes‚Äù is a popular genre in western journalism ‚Äì see for example the breathless reporting last year about whether the Chinese government is using TikTok to spy on people. But let‚Äôs be very clear here: western companies are doing exactly the same thing. The idea that it is somehow scarier when China does it smacks of Sinophobia. DNA is big business now and there is really no knowing who has your most intimate information who they‚Äôve sold it on to and what those companies or governments are doing with it. Last year for example the private equity company Blackstone acquired Ancestry.com which has 18 million people in ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest consumer DNA network‚Äù. Blackstone has said it has no plans to monetize that DNA but many bioethicists and privacy activists are highly skeptical of those claims. They didn‚Äôt shell out close to $5bn just for the hell of it did they? Meanwhile the British government is on a massive data grab and looks a lot like it is trying monetize the medical histories of everyone in England. The government has been striking secretive deals with controversial big data companies like Palantir which are funded by the CIA.

The Reuters investigation into BGI is a reminder that there isn‚Äôt a single aspect of our lives (perhaps not even our dreams) that isn‚Äôt being murkily mined and monetized. Indeed it seems as if our data is being sold on before we‚Äôre even out of the womb. But beyond the ‚Äúbig business is evil‚Äù element there‚Äôs also another dimension to this story. While I have no idea whether the Chinese government really is using data from prenatal tests to create genetically enhanced soldiers these sorts of tests are being used to cherry-pick the genetics of the next generation. The ability to test a fetus for genetic abnormalities via a non-invasive blood test early on in pregnancy (known as NIPT tests) is a relatively recent phenomenon with enormous ethical ramifications. My partner had an NIPT test as a matter of course during her pregnancy and as we waited for the results I stressed about what we‚Äôd do if the result came back ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù. Would we abort? If we did abort would that make us monsters or was it the sensible thing to do?

We never had to make that difficult decision ‚Äì but plenty of other people have. In an excellent article for the Atlantic last year called ‚Äúthe last children of Down Syndrome‚Äù Sarah Zhang notes that Denmark became one of the first countries in the world to offer prenatal Down‚Äôs syndrome screening to every pregnant woman in 2004: ‚Äúsuddenly a new power was thrust into the hands of ordinary people ‚Äì the power to decide what kind of life is worth bringing into the world.‚Äù Almost everyone in Denmark chooses to take the test and 95% of those who get a Down‚Äôs syndrome diagnosis choose to abort. ‚ÄúFew people speak publicly about wanting to ‚Äòeliminate‚Äô Down syndrome‚Äù Zhang writes. ‚ÄúYet individual choices are adding up to something very close to that.‚Äù We talk a lot about the immense power that large corporations now have thanks to big data ‚Äì but we have some of that power too. Eugenics is slowly and stealthily being normalized.

Haunting images from the seafloor have been released of the cargo plane that made an emergency landing on the waters off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu on 2 July.

The photos released by the National Transportation Safety Board on Friday show the wreckage on the bottom of the ocean.

The Boeing 737-200 cargo jet was located around two miles into the ocean from Ewa Beach west of Honolulu. Both members of the crew were rescued after the pilot ditched the plane in the water.

The NTSB said in a statement on Friday that different parts of the wrecked plane such as the aft fuselage with both of the wings the tail with both engines and the forward fuselage were found in waters at depths spanning 360 and 420 feet (110 and 128 metres).

The board said it is too deep to send out divers to retrieve the flight data and the voice recorders from the cockpit. But an investigative team is forming a plan to recover the jet.

A Side Scan Sonar and Remotely Operated Vehicle were used to find the plane.

The safety board said that another plane fuelled on the same night was tested and that no irregularities were discovered.

One of the crew members on Transair Flight 810 was taken to hospital via helicopter after the crash landing the other was rescued by boat. The plane they flew was built in 1975.

The crew reported that they were having engine issues and planned to turn back just after taking off from Daniel K Inouye International Airport in Honolulu at 1.33am local time. They were flying towards Maui another Hawaiian island.

The NTSB said they have done over a dozen interviews with the crew and with staff at Transair and the Federal Aviation Administration. The cause of the crash remains unclear.

The 50-year-old pilot who suffered a head injury and several gashes was able to leave hospital earlier this week.

The pilot and co-pilot were rescued by the United States Coast Guard as they were holding on to packages and the Boeing 737‚Äôs tail to stay floating in the Pacific Ocean.

The pilots reported that one engine was down and there are indications that the aircraft wasn‚Äôt high enough to be able to return to Honolulu prompting the emergency landing in the sea.

Rhoades Aviation Inc was the operator of the plane. The company flies as Transair which is one of Hawaii‚Äôs largest cargo airlines and has been in business since 1982.

According to a recording on LiveATC a site broadcasting air traffic control communications the pilot told Honolulu air traffic control: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost number one engine we‚Äôre coming straight to the airport.

Federal investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board have released photos of the Boeing 737-200 cargo jet that made an emergency water landing off the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

Transair Flight 810 was found approximately two miles offshore from Ewa Beach after a the pilot made a ditch landing in the Pacific Ocean. Both crew members were rescued from the water.

The major components of the airplane - the aft fuselage including both wings and tail along with both engines and forward fuselage - were located on the sea floor at depths between 360 and 420 feet the NTSB said in a statement on Friday.

The NTSB said the wreckage is too deep to deploy divers for recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. The investigative team is developing plans to recover the aircraft.

The plane took off from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu and was en route to the Hawaiian island of Maui

The plane components were located with a Side Scan Sonar and Remotely Operated Vehicle the NTSB said.

The safety board said fuel samples from another airplane fueled on the same night were tested and no irregularities were found. The agency released photos of airplane components located on the ocean floor.

The two crew members on Transair Flight 810 were injured after being forced to land in the Pacific Ocean. One was taken to a hospital by helicopter and the other was rescued by boat.

The Boeing cargo plane was built in 1975.

The crew reported engine trouble and plans to turn back shortly after taking off at 1.33am local time from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. The plane was en route to the Hawaiian island of Maui.

The NTSB said its investigators have completed more than a dozen interviews including the flight crew other Transair personnel and Federal Aviation Administration employees.

Earlier this week the 50-year-old pilot who was critically hurt with a head injury and multiple lacerations in the crash was released from the hospital as the cause of the incident remains a mystery.

The victim and his co-pilot were rescued by the United States Coast Guard off the coast of Hawaii as they clutched packages and the tail of the Boeing 737 cargo plane to stay afloat.

The pilots reported that one engine was down. Initial reports suggested that there was not enough altitude to return to Honolulu prompting the aircraft to ditch into the sea.

The plane was operated by Rhoades Aviation Inc which does business as Transair. one of Hawaii's largest air cargo carriers. It has been in business since 1982.

'Rhoades 810 we've lost an engine. We're on a 220 heading' one of the pilots told Honolulu air traffic control giving the compass reading.

It's been reported that a 50-year-old pilot suffered a head injury and was in a serious condition. It is unclear from the photo which of the pilots is pictured being pushed in a wheelchair

The recording was posted on LiveATC an audio streaming site that broadcasts air traffic control communications.

Several minutes later the pilot reported: 'We've lost number one engine we're coming straight to the airport.

'We're going to need the fire department there's a chance we're going to lose the other engine it's running very hot.

'It doesn't look good here - you may want to let the Coast Guard know as well.'

They cited a problem with the second engine and attempted to return to Honolulu the Federal Aviation Administration said.

At around 1.46am the pilots reported losing their second engine and radioed that they were going down and being forced to land in the ocean. Flight tracking data stops at around 1:45 with a final recorded altitude of 75 feet.

US Coast Guard Lt. Commander Karin Evelyn said in an email that they received a report around 1.40am of a downed inter-island transport plane.

About an hour later rescuers in a Coast Guard helicopter spotted the debris field and two people in the water Evelyn said.

U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Joseph Gerczak arrived at the Coast Guard base in Honolulu with salvage he and others collected from the area where the plane sank

Several boxes of cargo were retrieved from the water off the coast of Oahu

A fleet of stuffed animals was also retrieved from the crash site over the weekend

The loss of both engines in the 46-year-old plane - a workhorse of trans-Atlantic passenger travel with some of the busiest flight routes in the world - has raised worrying questions.

Engines do sometimes fail when hampered by a bird strike or volcanic ash but it was unclear what caused these engines to malfunction.

Initial tracking data from RadarBox.com showed that the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of just 2125 feet.

The aircraft's descent path 'looks reasonably slow and steady suggesting that the pilots could glide the aircraft down to the ocean in a controlled manner' said SimpleFlying.com."

This week the poster boy for the Big Lie was Michael Avenatti.

Remember the creepy porn lawyer as Tucker Carlson called him.

Michael Avenatti was going to bring down former President Donald Trump. He was the lawyer for Julie Swetnick who had accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault and Stormy Daniels a porn star who said she had an affair with Trump. Avenatti had the goods on Trump. He might even be the next president ‚Äî so said CNN. During his brief moment in the alt-left spotlight Avenatti appeared on network and cable television 254 times.

Then he was indicted by multiple federal grand juries for extortion and embezzlement. Last week Avenatti was sentenced to 30 months in prison. He cried like a baby. He faces more criminal trials next year in New York and Los Angeles.

Would you care to guess how much time the Democrats on TV devoted to the disgrace of their erstwhile idol?

On the three network newscasts Avenatti‚Äôs sentencing got a total of 17 seconds ‚Äî all on ABC.

Nothing to see here folks move along.

The Democrat cheerleaders who masquerade as journalists ‚Äî Jake Tapper Chuck Todd George Stephanopoulos et al. ‚Äî have moved on. NBC ‚ÄúNews‚Äù is already parroting a new Democrat talking point: Any candidates for school boards who oppose Critical Race Theory are likely members of QAnon.

You remember QAnon ‚Äî it spreads conspiracy theories much like you know NBC ‚ÄúNews‚Äù which while promoting the Russian collusion hoax simultaneously suppressed real news about a Democrat serial rapist named Harvey Weinstein.

I‚Äôll try just to scratch the surface of the torrent of calumnies libels and disinformation that the mainstream media is peddling 24/7. Let‚Äôs begin with NBC the network that protected Weinstein:

MSNBC anchor Joy Reid‚Äôs Twitter account was hacked by time-traveling trolls who went back 10 years and put out vile Islamophobic and homophobic tweets under her name.

MSNBC anchor Brian Williams did see a body floating by on Canal Street during Hurricane Katrina. He was also shocked by the murders he witnessed at the Superdome. This happened after his helicopter in the Mideast was almost shot down by a Scud missile.

NBC anchor Matt Lauer‚Äôs predatory sexual behavior was unknown to network suits. Ditto Mark Halperin‚Äôs.

These lists could go on practically forever. Feel free to add your own favorite ‚Äúfake but accurate‚Äù stories in the tradition of ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù and Rolling Stone.

Russian President Vladimir Putin hacked the Vermont electric grid. Trump removed the MLK Jr. bust from the Oval Office.

Hunter Biden is a talented artist. A video made by a Christian caused Benghazi. The walls are closing in on Trump.

Super-spreader events include Make America Great Again and motorcycle rallies Super Bowl victory parties and spring break celebrations ‚Äî generally anything fun in any red state.

However there was no scientific reason to wear masks while looting and burning down cities during bloody anti-police riots because ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say transmission of the virus cannot occur

during ‚Äúpeaceful protests.‚Äù

The Bubba Wallace NASCAR noose was real. Jussie Smollett was the victim of a hate crime. The Covington Catholic kid was a racist.

Fifteen days to slow the spread. If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. The Russian bounties story was real. Ditto Trump calling the World War I dead ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù

Austere religious scholar dies. Five people were murdered at the Capitol on Jan. 6. It was an ‚Äúarmed‚Äù insurrection even though no arms were found.

President Biden still has all his marbles. Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop is Russian disinformation ‚Äî 50 former ‚Äúintelligence officers‚Äù all agree.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is Native American. The science is settled. Social workers should respond to 911 calls. Former Georgia state legislator Stacey Abrams was robbed.

The Steele dossier was totally legit: There was a pee tape former Trump adviser Carter Page was offered an $11 billion bribe former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did go in Prague Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt pay for it.

The FBI is on the level. Ditto the FISA courts. Trump‚Äôs tax cuts were ‚Äúbreadcrumbs.‚Äù AR-15s are used in all mass shootings. The NSA isn‚Äôt spying on Americans‚Äô communications.

The polar ice caps will be gone by the summer of 2013. It must be true. Al Gore said it.

The border is totally under control. Former President Barack Obama didn‚Äôt build those cages that was Trump back in 2014. A broken pipe in Atlanta stopped the vote count on election night.

The Bernie bro who shot up the GOP Congressional baseball practice was ‚Äúapolitical.‚Äù

Trump pays no taxes. CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin did nothing wrong. All women must be believed ‚Äî except Tara Reade who had said Biden had sexually assaulted her in 1993.

At this point I would like to add one of my own ‚Äúdeeply sourced‚Äù scoops to this endless list. It‚Äôs at least as credible as any of the above Democrat so-called reporting.

Here it is: when Avenatti gets to the cell block his nickname is going to be ‚ÄúStormy.‚Äù

Similarly high rates of overall survival and progression-free survival secondary endpoints were observed in the total study population and in high-risk patients with the fixed-dose combination.

‚ÄúThe primary endpoint was met with a complete response rate of 56% in patients without deletion (17p).

Paolo Ghia MD PhD

CAPTIVATE is a multicenter phase II study of first-line ibrutinib plus venetoclax in CLL. At the 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition results from the minimal residual disease (MRD) cohort were presented. Undetectable MRD was achieved in more than two-thirds of patients with a fixed-duration of 12 cycles of treatment with the combination and progression-free survival rates were greater than 95% regardless of subsequent randomized treatment.2

Study Details

The primary analysis of CAPTIVATE reported on the fixed-duration cohort of 159 patients with untreated CLL/SLL aged 70 or younger who received 3 cycles of the all-oral once daily regimen of ibrutinib followed by 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Median age was 60 years. High-risk features included del(17p)/TP53 mutations in 27; del(17p) in 20; del(11q) in 28; complex karyotype in 31; and unmutated IGHV in 89. There were 139 patients (86%) without del(17p). Among 159 patients 147 completed 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax. The median time on study was 27.9 months and the median treatment duration was 13.8 months. Median follow-up time after treatment cessation was 14 months.

The complete response rate was 56% in patients without del(17p) and 55% in all treated patients. These rates were consistent among high-risk subgroups except for those with bulky disease who had a complete response rate of 31%. The objective response rate in all treated patients and in those without del(17p) was 96%. ‚ÄúThese responses represent a 40% improvement over the historical comparator FCR regimen in the CLL10 study‚Äù Dr. Ghia stated.

Secondary Endpoints

Among the 88 patients who achieved complete response 78 (89%) had durable responses lasting longer than 1 year. Among the 66 patients without del(17p) who achieved complete responses 76 (87%) were durable lasting longer than 1 year. The rate of undetectable MRD in peripheral blood was 77% in all treated patients and 76% in those without del(17p); the rates of undetectable MRD in the bone marrow were 60% and 62% respectively.

At 24 months progression-free survival rate in patients without del(17p) was 96% and 95% in all treated patients. The 24-month overall survival rate was 98%‚Äîidentical in all treated patients and those without del(17p). Median follow-up was 27.9 months.

‚ÄúAll of these results together support the idea of the combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax as an all-oral once daily chemotherapy-free fixed-duration treatment that may achieve deep responses and undetectable MRD in a vast majority of patients‚Äù Dr. Ghia stated.

The phase III GLOW study is currently ongoing in an older population and includes a study arm of ibrutinib plus venetoclax.

‚ÄúOur idea was would we enhance the benefit of CTLA-4 by continuing anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibody in the second line but reduce the toxicity by using a lower dose of ipilimumab?‚Äù ‚Äî Jason J. Luke MD

‚ÄúThis study demonstrated long-term responses suggesting that durable survival‚Äîa hallmark of immunotherapy activity‚Äîmay be possible even after failure of an anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody‚Äù the study authors wrote in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.1

Dr. Luke noted that novel combinations of anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibodies being tested by others were yielding response rates of around 20%. ‚ÄúBut now we show the response rate is close to 30% using the drugs we already have. That is probably better than anything else you are going to give on a clinical trial‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis treatment can generate long-term survival in some patients.‚Äù Dr. Luke is Director of the Cancer Immunotherapeutics Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh.

Maintaining Efficacy

At the time the study was being designed an incremental increase in response rate was being reported for ipilimumab and nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma but with ‚Äúa substantial toxicity profile‚Äù for the combination Dr. Luke noted. ‚ÄúThere was a big debate about whether (upfront combination) was the right thing to do. Also at that time there was this idea in the field that we might be able to find other PD-1 combination partners which would have similar efficacy but lower toxicity relative to ipilimumab/nivolumab.‚Äù Delaying exposure to ipilimumab until the second line would reduce toxicity but it was unclear whether efficacy would be maintained.

‚ÄúAnti‚ÄìCTLA-4 antibody alone after anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody progression has a historical response rate of 13%‚Äù according to the study authors. ‚ÄúSo the question for the trial‚Äù Dr. Luke said was ‚ÄúCan you increase that given that you are going to continue the anti‚ÄìPD-1? Would CTLA-4 blockade drive T cells to the tumor and in the absence of PD-1 blockade would some of them get exhausted or dysfunctional? If we continue anti‚ÄìPD-1 will we actually enhance [the response rate]? And that is what we saw.‚Äù

No Gap in Immunotherapy

The open-label single-arm phase II trial involved 70 patients recruited from 7 medical centers across the United States. To be eligible for the study patients had to have unresectable or metastatic melanoma with known BRAF mutation status and measurable disease. The most common subtype was cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma was excluded. The median age of the patients was 64 years old with a range of 27 to 87 and 67% were male.

‚ÄúAll patients must have experienced disease progression during treatment with an anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody immediately before accrual to this study or disease progression within 6 months of adjuvant anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibody without intercurrent therapy‚Äù the authors noted.

The trial was specifically designed so that there would be no gap in immunotherapy to avoid a bias from intervening therapy. ‚ÄúAt the time it was somewhat controversial because BRAF inhibitors are associated with overall survival‚Äù Dr. Luke reflected. In fact some researchers contacted about participating in the trial ‚Äútold us they would not be willing to do the trial because it would be withholding therapy‚Äù he said.

Nowadays however in the academic setting physicians ‚Äúwill tend to use multiple lines of immunotherapy before they use targeted therapy and it is because even in later lines of immunotherapy we all individually have patients who have functionally been cured‚Äù Dr. Luke noted even with third-line immunotherapy. ‚ÄúWe know that with BRAF inhibitors we are not going to cure anybody. So we tend to save that. We‚Äôll give patients immunotherapy and then if they are progressing really rapidly we‚Äôll give them BRAF inhibitors to try to get the disease back under control. Then we will try to transition the patients to a clinical trial at some point.‚Äù

Dosing Strategy

Patients received pembrolizumab at 200 mg intravenously plus low-dose ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks for four doses followed by pembrolizumab intravenously at 200 mg once every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Treatment continued until confirmed radiographic disease progression intolerable toxicity patient withdrawal of consent investigator decision or completion of therapy.

‚ÄúWe used a dosing strategy of low-dose anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibody with low-dose ipilimumab which is now the standard of therapy for a lot of tumor types but at the time we did it that was somewhat controversial. Our idea was would we enhance the benefit of anti‚ÄìCTLA-4 antibody by continuing anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibody in the second line but reduce the toxicity by using a lower dose of ipilimumab? And it seems like that was true‚Äù Dr. Luke stated.‚Äù

Adverse Effects

‚ÄúAlthough high rates of toxicity have previously limited safe delivery of anti‚ÄìPD-1 plus anti‚ÄìCTLA-4 combinations the 27% grade 3-4 adverse event rate observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab reflects a comparatively manageable side effect profile‚Äù the authors noted. Overall adverse effects occurred in 87% ‚Äúwith the most frequent events being pruritis rash diarrhea fatigue nausea and transaminase elevations.‚Äù

The rates of adverse effects ‚Äúare not that much higher than we see in clinical practice for monotherapy PD-1‚Äù Dr. Luke said. ‚ÄúThe primary endpoint concerned increasing the efficacy‚Äù he pointed out. ‚ÄúThe improvement in toxicity is a positive but frankly it is not the important feature here because I think people have become much more comfortable in managing the toxicities.‚Äù

There were 8 nonevaluable patients including 1 patient who withdrew after experiencing grade 3 immune-related hepatitis after 1 dose of study therapy.

No dose reductions of pembrolizumab or ipilimumab were permitted consistent with standard practice use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

‚ÄúOur study was augmented by a large retrospective study by the Melanoma Institute in Australia demonstrating similar outcomes‚Äù Dr. Luke said. ‚ÄúIt was an international aggregated series of around 300 patients with about a 30% response rate with the same treatment given off label.2 In conjunction with our study this has essentially changed the perspective in the field so that it is no longer reasonable to give ipilimumab monotherapy. We now always give it as a combination with anti‚ÄìPD-1.‚Äù

Responses Across Subgroups

‚ÄúMost responses were observed among patients who progressed on a prior anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody within 6 months‚Äù and ‚Äúoccurred predominantly among patients with intermediate to non‚ÄìT cell‚Äìinflamed and PD-L1‚Äìnegative tumors‚Äù the researchers reported. This ‚Äúis contrary to what has been observed in the anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody‚Äìnaive setting where biomarkers of T cell inflammation and PD-L1 expression enrich for response.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe important point is that this shows we can still salvage some of these patients who don‚Äôt have a tumor with an immune phenotype that we think is advantageous‚Äù Dr. Luke noted. ‚ÄúThe patients that are PD-L1‚Äìpositive are more likely to respond to immunotherapy. But even when patients progress if the tumors are low or non‚ÄìT cell inflamed with this treatment we can still get long-term responders. That is a hopeful thing because if it was the case that PD-L1 status was still driving the response then you would assume that in the nonresponder population of our trial‚Äîpeople who progressed already on frontline‚Äîthe response would be pretty low. But we didn‚Äôt see that.‚Äù

Homing in on Drug Development Targets

‚ÄúThe durable responses observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab suggest that this benefit may carry forward when using an anti‚ÄìPD-1 plus anti‚ÄìCTLA-4 antibody combination after anti‚ÄìPD-1 antibody failure‚Äù the authors wrote. ‚ÄúThese findings may be particularly informative for future drug development after failure of an anti‚ÄìPD-1/L1 antibody by setting an important benchmark for therapies in this space.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are going to become better about homing in on which tumors we should really be focusing immunotherapy development on‚Äù Dr. Luke said. ‚ÄúBroadly speaking I have advocated that we should be profiling patients‚Äô tumors for the number of mutations and for the T cell‚Äìinflamed gene expression scores in the microenvironment because independently those two are both very strong biomarkers of response. When we think about selecting patients for new drug therapy trials we should be selecting those patients because that is where it is probably going to work.‚Äù Dr. Luke said.

‚ÄúFor people who have low mutational burden and low interferon response we need to think about what we could do that would enhance immune response to these tumors because low tumor mutational burden means the number of antigens there is not going to be really robust. That said there is a whole field of research to suggest that if we use the right approaches even in those low tumor mutational burden tumors we can still turn them from cold to hot.‚Äù

Thomas Powles MD

As reported in The New England Journal of Medicine by Thomas Powles MD of Barts Cancer Centre Queen Mary University of London and colleagues a prespecified interim analysis of the phase III EV-301 trial has shown improved overall survival with the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin-ejfv vs investigator‚Äôs choice of chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced urothelial carcinoma.1 Enfortumab vedotin consists of a monoclonal antibody specific for Nectin-4 and the antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E.

Based on findings of durable objective responses in the phase II EV-201 trial enfortumab vedotin was granted accelerated approval in December 2019 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant locally advanced or metastatic setting.

Study Details

In the open-label trial 608 patients from sites in 19 countries who had received platinum-containing chemotherapy and had experienced disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive intravenous enfortumab vedotin at 1.25 mg/kg on days 1 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles (n = 301) or chemotherapy selected by investigators before randomization (n = 307); chemotherapy options consisted of docetaxel at 75 mg/kg (n = 117) paclitaxel at 175 mg/kg (n = 112) and vinflunine at 320 mg/m2 (n = 78) given on day 1 of 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score (0 or 1) geographic region (Western Europe United States or the rest of the world) and the presence or absence of liver metastasis at baseline. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.

For the enfortumab vedotin vs chemotherapy groups median patient age was 68 vs 68 years and 79% vs 76% were male. The region was Western Europe for 42% vs 42% United States for 14% vs 14% and the rest of the world for 44% vs 44%. Tobacco use was former for 56% vs 53% current for 10% vs 10% and never for 30% vs 33%; and 19% vs 19% had a history of diabetes or hyperglycemia. ECOG performance status was 0 for 40% vs 40% and 1 for 60% vs 60%. Bellmunt risk score was 0 to 1 in 67% vs 68%. The origin site of primary disease was upper urinary tract in 33% vs 35% and bladder or other site in 67% vs 65%. Histology at diagnosis was urothelial or transitional cell carcinoma in 76% vs 75%; 78% vs 82% had visceral metastases; 87% vs 88% had received one to two lines of previous therapy; and response to previous immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment had been observed in 20% of 268 patients vs 16% of 265 patients.

Overall Survival

At interim analysis (July 2020) with a median follow-up of 11.1 months median overall survival was 12.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.6‚Äì15.2 months) in the enfortumab vedotin group vs 9.0 months (95% CI = 8.1‚Äì10.7 months) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70 95% CI = 0.6‚Äì0.9 P = .001); rates at 12 months were 51.5% vs 39.2%.

Hazard ratios favored enfortumab vedotin in nearly all of the subgroups examined. For stratification subgroups hazard ratios were 0.8 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.1) 0.9 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.5) and 0.6 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì0.9) for Western Europe the United States and the rest of world; 0.8 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.2) and 0.7 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì0.9) for an ECOG performance status of 0 and 1; and 0.7 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.0) and 0.7 (0.6‚Äì1.0) for liver metastases and no liver metastases. Hazard ratios by comparator chemotherapy regimen were 0.7 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.0); 0.7 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.0); and 0.8 (95% CI = 0.5‚Äì1.2) for paclitaxel docetaxel and vinflunine.

KEY POINTS Enfortumab vedotin significantly prolonged overall survival vs chemotherapy in previously treated advanced urothelial carcinoma.

Significant improvements in progression-free survival and objective response rate were observed.

Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI = 5.3‚Äì5.8 months) in the enfortumab vedotin group and 3.7 months (95% CI = 3.5‚Äì3.9 months) in the chemotherapy group (HR = 0.6 95% CI = 0.5‚Äì0.8 P < .001). Among 288 vs 296 patients evaluable for response an objective response was observed in 40.6% vs 17.9% of patients (P < .001) with a complete response in 4.9% vs 2.7%. Median durations of response were 7.4 months (95% CI = 6.0‚Äì9.5 months) vs 8.1 months (95% CI = 5.7‚Äì9.6 months) with responses maintained for 6 months in 53.8% vs 56.0% and 12 months in 27.7% vs 19.8% of responders. Disease control rates were 71.9% vs 53.4% (P < .001).

Adverse Events

Treatment-related grade ‚â• 3 adverse events occurred in 51.4% of patients in the enfortumab vedotin group vs 49.8% in the chemotherapy group. The most common were maculopapular rash fatigue and decreased neutrophil count with enfortumab vedotin and decreased neutrophil count anemia decreased white cell count neutropenia and febrile neutropenia with chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 13.5% of patients vs 11.3% of patients the most common cause being peripheral neuropathy in both groups (2.4% vs 2.1%). Adverse events irrespective of causality attribution led to death in 11 patients (3.7%) and 11 patients (3.8%) in the two groups.

The most common treatment-related adverse events of special interest in the enfortumab vedotin group were rash (43.9% any grade 14.5% grade ‚â• 3; 9.6% any grade 0.3% grade 3 in the chemotherapy group) and peripheral neuropathy (46.3% any grade 3.7% grade 3; 30.6% any grade 2.4% grade 3 in the chemotherapy group). Treatment-related hyperglycemia occurred in 19 patients (6.4%) treated with enfortumab vedotin vs 1 patient (0.3%) treated with chemotherapy. Hyperglycemia was grade 3 in 11 patients in the enfortumab vedotin group and resulted in death in 1 patient.

The investigators concluded: ‚ÄúEnfortumab vedotin significantly prolonged survival as compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had previously received platinum-based treatment and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.‚Äù

The results of Cohort 1 of the phase II trial TROPHY-U-01 (IMMU-132-06; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03547973) published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology by Tagawa et al and reviewed in this issue of The ASCO Post led to the recent accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy for select patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer12 making it the second antibody-drug conjugate approved for metastatic urothelial cancer.3 Cohort 1 of this multicenter single-arm study demonstrated efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan in a heavily pretreated population of 113 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer with an objective response rate of 27% confirmed by central review a median progression-free survival of 5.4 months and a clinical benefit rate of 37%. Approval of sacituzumab govitecan for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer following prior platinum-containing chemotherapy and either a PD-1 or a PD-L1 inhibitor marks another key advancement in the management of metastatic urothelial cancer and builds upon a rapid and welcome influx of FDA-approved agents for this disease in recent years.

In TROPHY-U-01 sacituzumab govitecan was reasonably well tolerated with just 6% of patients (n = 7) discontinuing therapy due to treatment-related adverse events and a side-effect profile consistent with prior studies of sacituzumab govitecan in triple-negative breast cancer.4 Sacituzumab govitecan showed efficacy even among patients with visceral metastases including an objective response rate of 32% in patients with liver metastases a known marker of poor prognosis in patients treated with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies.5-8 Full FDA approval for sacituzumab govitecan in metastatic urothelial cancer will ultimately hinge on results of the ongoing confirmatory phase III TROPiCS-04 trial.9 Notably the FDA recently granted regular approval to sacituzumab govitecan for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on positive findings from the phase III ASCENT trial.410

Questions About Optimal Sequencing in Clinical Practice

The first antibody-drug conjugate to receive accelerated FDA approval in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer was enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in 2019 based on the results of the phase II EV-201 study.11 Given recent positive results of the confirmatory global phase III EV-301 trial12 full FDA approval for enfortumab vedotin is likely. With two antibody-drug conjugates and the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor erdafitinib now approved for previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer the optimal sequence of these agents remains a key question in clinical practice. Notably use of erdafitinib is restricted to patients with susceptible genetic alterations of FGFR2/3 present in only ~20% of metastatic urothelial cancer. Prior treatment with anti‚ÄìPD-L1 inhibitors is not mandated by the U.S. FDA label though in practice most patients receive immunotherapy prior to erdafitinib.1314

Indeed although sacituzumab govitecan enfortumab vedotin and erdafitinib all have demonstrated objective response rates of between 27% and 41% in clinical trials11215 whether these agents retain the same level of efficacy when administered in sequence remains largely unstudied. Fortunately substantial differences in mechanism between these agents suggest the potential for preserved efficacy independent of sequence: sacituzumab govitecan targets the transmembrane glycoprotein Trop-2 with a payload of the topoisomerase inhibitor SN-381 whereas enfortumab vedotin targets Nectin-4 with a payload of the microtubule disrupter monomethyl auristatin E12 and erdafitinib is a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Among 10 patients in -TROPHY-U-01 previously treated with enfortumab vedotin just 1 achieved a partial response to sacituzumab govitecan (objective response rate of 10%) and an additional 6 had stable disease. Ultimately firm conclusions cannot be drawn from such small subgroup analyses and additional studies on optimal sequencing are needed.

In the absence of comparative clinical trials to conclusively guide sequencing of these agents we prefer to treat with enfortumab vedotin prior to sacituzumab govitecan and erdafitinib given level 1 evidence supporting the use of enfortumab vedotin after platinum and anti‚ÄìPD-(L)1 treatment; however patient-specific factors such as preexisting peripheral neuropathy and hyperglycemia are important to consider.12 Currently enfortumab vedotin remains the only one of these agents with a proven overall survival benefit compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy in a randomized controlled trial. Regardless sacituzumab govitecan now offers a valuable option for patients.

Another potential consideration for sequencing of sacituzumab govitecan with enfortumab vedotin and erdafitinib is UGT1A1 genotype as UGT1A1 *28 allele homozygosity is associated with decreased SN-38 metabolism and increased sacituzumab govitecan toxicity.16 Notably routine prescreening for UGT1A1 status is not currently required.1 However for patients with clinical evidence of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia this should be taken into account when considering patient selection.

Combination Therapies: Searching for Synergy

Optimal sequencing of these agents may become further complicated by combinations of sacituzumab govitecan enfortumab vedotin or erdafitinib with other therapies. For example addition of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab to enfortumab vedotin for first-line treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients in the single-arm EV-103 study yielded an objective response rate of 73% and a median progression-free survival of 12.3 months.17 This combination remains under investigation in the EV-103 trial (NCT03288545) and in the phase III EV-302 study (NCT04223856).18

Building on this signal of potential synergy between immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates Cohort 3 of TROPHY-U-01 will explore the addition of pembrolizumab to sacituzumab govitecan in checkpoint inhibitor‚Äìnaive patients after platinum therapy whereas Cohort 5 will investigate sacituzumab govitecan for patients with platinum-naive metastatic urothelial cancer combined with cisplatin and avelumab.19 Cohort 4 will test sacituzumab govitecan in combination with cisplatin1 and a phase I study is also planned to investigate sacituzumab govitecan plus enfortumab vedotin (NCT04724018); this is a promising combination given the relatively tolerable nonoverlapping toxicity profiles of these agents and their distinct and potentially complementary mechanisms of action.

Biomarker-Driven Correlative Analyses Needed

A limitation of TROPHY-U-01 appropriately noted by the authors is a paucity of biomarker-driven correlative analyses.1 Although sacituzumab govitecan‚Äôs target Trop-2 is expressed in up to 83% of urothelial carcinomas its expression is not -ubiquitous and the relationship between Trop-2 expression in metastatic urothelial cancer and sensitivity to sacituzumab govitecan remains inadequately characterized.12021 Hence further investigation of Trop-2‚Äôs potential value as a predictive biomarker is warranted in future studies.

Conclusion

The findings of TROPHY-U-01 and the accelerated FDA approval of sacituzumab govitecan for previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer provide a significant new option for patients with refractory disease. Results of future and ongoing studies such as -TROPiCS-04 designed to confirm clinical benefit as well as the remaining cohorts of TROPHY-U-01 are eagerly awaited to further clarify the optimal use of this agent in metastatic urothelial cancer.

Tina Kotek didn‚Äôt have the authority to send a woman who completed her sentence one year ago back to prison and ordered the woman‚Äôs immediate release.

Terri Lee Brown was charged in 2016 with two counts of mail theft. On April 20 2017 she was sentenced to two and half years in prison followed by two years of post-prison supervision. On Dec. 23 2020 she was released from prison early after then-Gov. Kate Brown granted her a commutation. By February 2023 the state sent her a certificate saying she had fulfilled all the obligations of her sentence.

Despite that Kotek revoked that commutation in December 2023.

The state Supreme Court said in its ruling that Kotek had gone too far.

The justices wrote that Terri Lee Brown‚Äôs ‚Äúimprisonment is unlawful‚Äù after Kotek revoked her commutation late last year. Police in Josephine County arrested Brown on Feb. 17 and after five days in jail transferred her to the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility in Wilsonville.

‚ÄúTerri Lee Brown was released from Coffee Creek Correctional Facility at 3:25 pm today‚Äù Amber Campbell a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Corrections wrote in an email Wednesday.

Commutation refers to the governor‚Äôs power to change a convicted person‚Äôs sentence. During the COVID-19 pandemic Gov. Brown granted commutations to thousands of people in Oregon‚Äôs prisons in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

The case leaves some questions unanswered including how Brown 48 was sent back to prison even though her sentence had been completed for an entire year before she was again arrested. The factors that led to a warrant for her arrest are also unclear according to attorneys with the Oregon Justice Resource Center which helped Brown win the habeas corpus petition.

The state‚Äôs highest court moved quickly issuing its opinion less than one week after hearing oral arguments in the case.

The governor‚Äôs office was represented by attorneys with the Oregon Department of Justice.

‚ÄúThe governor‚Äôs plenary clemency power includes the power of the governor to revoke a conditional commutation after the time the original sentence has expired and order that person‚Äôs arrest and return to prison at any time‚Äù Assistant Attorney General Kirsten Naito argued to the justices.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Not even 30 seconds into her arguments Supreme Court Associate Justice Bronson James asked Naito to clarify what he called a ‚Äúpretty absolutist‚Äù position.

‚ÄúI think I just heard the answer but I really want to clarify it‚Äù James asked. ‚ÄúIs it the position of Gov. Kotek that she has the authority to revoke a commutation at any time in the future and subsequent governors would continue to have that authority to revoke a commutation at any time in the future for the entire life of Ms. Brown?‚Äù

Naito said yes. ‚ÄúThat is correct‚Äù she added.

The court disagreed.

‚ÄúThe Governor respects the court‚Äôs decision and will take this ruling under advisement in the future‚Äù Elisabeth Shepard the governor‚Äôs press secretary wrote in an email late Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe office is not aware of any other similar cases under review.‚Äù

During the past year Kotek has revoked numerous commutations ‚Äî part of former Gov. Brown‚Äôs legacy ‚Äî at the request of local district attorneys.

It‚Äôs not clear what prompted Kotek‚Äôs office to review and ultimately for the governor to revoke Terri Lee Brown‚Äôs commutation years later. One possibility is that in May 2021 Brown pleaded no contest to violating her post-prison supervision. She was sent to jail for 30 days. But since then she‚Äôs had no issue complying with her post-prison supervision her lawyers said.

Leading up to her arrest and imprisonment earlier this year Brown was doing well according to court documents filed by her attorneys.

‚ÄúFor over two years she had been providing in-home healthcare‚Äù Julia Yoshimoto Brown‚Äôs attorney wrote in court documents. ‚ÄúShe cared for approximately 12 individuals during that time including for over a year the former deputy chief of police for the Medford Police Department. In the evenings [Brown] worked as an auditor for Holiday Inn. [She] was also in her third semester at Rogue Community College working towards her associate degree in business science.‚Äù

In its decision the Oregon Supreme Court said that for the most part ‚Äúviolation proceedings must be initiated while the offender is under supervision (i.e. before the offender‚Äôs sentence has expired) and not after the term of supervision has ended and the offender is no longer subject to any sentence.‚Äù

Justices went on to explain that even though the commutation agreement with Brown stated the governor could revoke it ‚Äúthere is no indication that the authority to revoke would survive the expiration of plaintiff‚Äôs sentence.‚Äù

In other words Brown had completed her sentence by the time Kotek decided to order her back into custody.

‚ÄúFor the reasons explained in this opinion we conclude that because plaintiff had finished serving all of her sentences when the Governor revoked the conditional commutation the Governor lacked authority under the terms of the commutation to issue the revocation‚Äù the justices wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RvcC1uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvcG9ydGlvbi1vZi1zdHJlZXQtaW4td2lsbGlhbXNwb3J0LXRvLWJlLW5hbWVkLWFmdGVyLWZvb3RiYWxsLWdyZWF0LWdhcnktbGVyb3ktYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portion of street in Williamsport to be named after football great Gary Leroy Brown,"The late Gary Leroy Brown will have a street named after him.

Williamsport City Council is anticipating approving an ordinance naming a portion of Lycoming Street where he grew up in his honor.

The blocks between Walnut and Elmira streets will be identified as Gary Brown Way according to the proposed ordinance introduced at this week‚Äôs council finance committee.

Mayor Derek Slaughter brought the ordinance request forward. Slaughter said a formal ceremony is being planned for next month.

Brown arguably was the best running back to ever play for Williamsport Area High School which was attested to by Councilman Randy Allison who watched WASD high school games since the 1950s.

Brown‚Äôs family is expected to be at the street naming ceremony.

Councilwoman Liz Miele said she often was reminded by her mother as she grew up just two blocks from where Brown lived that it was where this great gridiron star resided.

Brown was a running back for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for three teams from 1991 to 1999 Slaughter observed.

Brown played college football at Penn State University and was drafted by the Houston Oilers in the eighth round of the 1991 NFL Draft. He was with the Oilers (1991-1995); San Diego Chargers (1997) and New York Giants (1998-1999) Slaughter said.

He was also the running backs coach for the Cleveland Browns and at Rutgers University and the University of Wisconsin Slaughter noted.

He had 4300 rushing yards with an average of 4.2 yards per game and 21 touchdowns in the NFL.

Brown was 52 when he succumbed to cancer. He was born July 1 1969.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3VzLW5ld3MvaGFydmFyZC1icm93bi1pdXAtdG9vay0xMG0tZnJvbS1zdGF0ZS1vZi1wYWxlc3RpbmUtZG9ub3JzLXJlcG9ydC_SAWtodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC91cy1uZXdzL2hhcnZhcmQtYnJvd24taXVwLXRvb2stMTBtLWZyb20tc3RhdGUtb2YtcGFsZXN0aW5lLWRvbm9ycy1yZXBvcnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harvard Brown IUP took $10M from foundations donors in the 'State of Palestine': report,"Several Ivy League schools including Harvard University have accepted millions of dollars in donations from foundations and donors located in the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù often to fund the education of Palestinian students at American colleges according to a new report.

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn‚Äôt exist at least by UN standards.

The ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US ‚Äî though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

3 Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college‚Äôs Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor‚Äôs name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors ‚Äî including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation ‚Äî came together to fund the ‚ÄúMahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies‚Äù according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù and another $900000 from a donor from ‚ÄúPalestinian Territory Occupied‚Äù according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as ‚Äúpayment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program‚Äù the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown‚Äôs inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas‚Äô deadly Oct. 7 attack stating ‚Äú2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.‚Äù

July 10 2021 Will Shillibier Managing Editor

If you're planning on heading to Las Vegas for the World Series of Poker later this year then one of the Strip's most iconic properties might look a little different.

That's because Caesars Palace is going to be undergoing a multimillion-dollar makeover that will see the main entrance to the property completely rebuilt.

The Project

The main entrance to Caesars Palace has been made famous by its appearance in films such as The Hangover Ocean's Eleven and many more. The redesign will feature a large high-dome ceiling and a 15-foot-tall state of Caesar as well as two redesigned gaming areas a renovated table games area and a new lobby bar.

Construction is scheduled to begin in early July with most of the project set to be complete by New Year's Eve.

""Caesars Palace brought a sense of grandeur to the Las Vegas Strip when it was built in 1966 and we're proud to continue that legacy with a full reimagining of our main entrance"" said Sean McBurney Caesars Entertainment Regional President. ""Completely rebuilding the front entrance of one of the world's most iconic destinations is no small task and we're excited to get started and create a stunning new visual welcome for our guests.""

History of Caesars Palace

Built in 1966 Caesars Palace is one of the oldest hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. It has a rich and storied history playing host over the years to the likes of Frank Sinatra Ella Fitzgerald Elton John and Mariah Carey.

This will be the largest renovation project at Caesars Palace since the hotel's original Tower underwent a $75 million renovation in 2016 where the tower was shut for a month and all 587 rooms were upgraded and modernized.

Poker at Caesars Palace

Poker and Caesars Palace have gone hand in hand for decades. It hosted Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker from 1987 to 1990 the 2005 WSOP Tournament of Champions and the NBC Heads-up Championship from 2006 to 2013.

Mike Matusow sits atop the Caesars Palace all-time money list after winning the 2005 WSOP Tournament of Champions and winning the NBC Heads-Up Championship in January 2013.

The top 10 list is full of huge names in the world of poker with no fewer than four WSOP Main Event champions: Johnny Chan Huck Seed Chris Ferguson and three-time Main Event winner Stu Ungar who won the Super Bowl of Poker in 1988 and 1989.

Although Mr. Sarno was the visionary he and Mr. Mallin were partners in the 1966 development of this iconic hotel and casino as well as Circus Circus.

Mr. Mallin and Mr. Sarno traveled together through Italy researching statues and marble to create this hotel. Stan is now 98 years old and the last of the gaming pioneers in our great city.

CHRIS Eubank's son's heartbreaking final words before he tragically drowned were about his baby son.

Sebastian Eubank was found dead in Dubai on Wednesday just days before his 30th birthday.

The promising boxer - son of British world champ Chris - became a dad for the first time a month ago and was making a life for himself in the UEA with wife Salma.

His close pal Anthony de Bruijn 27 went for dinner with Sebastian just one hour before he went for the fatal sunset dip.

The fellow fighter has now revealed Sebastian's final words - including his love for his newborn son.

Anthony told The Sun: ""The last things he talked about was just how positive he was feeling how excited he was to have a son and how he loved giving him baths.

‚ÄúHe was just so happy to be living in Dubai and focussing on his new chapter as a father and a husband.

‚ÄúWe had dinner just one hour before he went missing and I told him don‚Äôt worry about us not seeing each other as much I told him to focus on his family as we had a lifetime to spend together.‚Äù

6 Sebastian had spoken about his love for his baby son

Sebastian - the third oldest of Eubank's five children - was born in Brighton in East Sussex before moving to UAE around seven years ago.

He shared a dinner on Wednesday night with Anthony before visiting Cove Beach - a swanky poolside restaurant and bar that is part of the ¬£1.5billion Caesars Palace Dubai hotel complex.

The resort sits on the man-made peninsula Bluewaters Island and was a favourite swim spot for Sebastian since its opening in 2018.

Anthony said: ‚ÄúI left him around 5.30pm and he had a meeting around 7.30pm I know he loves to swim and for him a 40-minute session would have been a great workout for him.

‚ÄúHe was a free spirit - he filled up his days like this.

‚ÄúAfter we finished Seb was off to go talk at a men‚Äôs circle he loved to share his thoughts and feelings with others and listen to theirs.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt have any problems he was just very spiritual and wanted to talk about real things that mattered. He wanted to help.""

Anthony revealed how Sebastian who was an experienced swimmer was due to stay at his home that night in Dubai.

But when the boxer didn't pick up the phone Anthony immediately knew something was wrong.

He said: ""For two days I didn‚Äôt sleep in my gut I knew there was something wrong.

‚ÄúWhen I was given the news I just could not believe it.‚Äù

CCTV cameras are thought to have captured Sebastian putting his bag down on the beach and going for a swim at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.

'HUMBLE POSITIVE AND TALENTED'

The Sun understands the alarm was raised when a man‚Äôs body was spotted on the hotel beach at around 9am the following morning.

A post-mortem is yet to take place although initial examinations are thought to have ruled out foul play.

Paying tribute to his friend Anthony said: ""I just want people to know how good of a man Seb was.

""He was humble positive and talented beyond belief.‚Äù

Following in his dad's footsteps Sebastian made his MMA debut last year.

Chris Eubank Sr held the WBO middleweight and super-middleweight titles between 1990 and 1995.

He paid tribute to his ""loved"" son in a moving statement.

The former world champ said: ""Sebastian was also a deep thinker who liked to challenge accepted wisdom.

""He was loved and respected by all who knew him and will be forever in the thoughts of friends and family.""

Supermarkets brace for inflation,"This time last year consumer panic-buying decimated the baking aisle at my local supermarket.

By the time grocery shelves returned to a somewhat normal state I had developed a permanent chip on my shoulder toward the neighbors I saw scurrying about with 20 cans of chicken noodle soup in their carts. But now supermarkets themselves are doing the stockpiling loading up on certain products before the grocery biz experiences ‚Äúsome of the highest price increases in recent memory‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reports.

WSJ cited Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc. the nation‚Äôs largest grocery store wholesaler as an example. The company recently purchased up to 20% more inventory mainly of shelf-stable packaged foods in preparation for coming price increases from major companies such as General Mills Inc. Campbell Soup Co. and J.M. Smucker Co. ‚ÄúWhen you have a uniquely inflationary period like now it‚Äôs a feeding frenzy‚Äù said Tony Sarsam chief executive officer of Michigan-based food retailer and distributor SpartanNash Co.

WSJ explains that supermarket stockpiling is a burden on an already stretched U.S. food supply chain. The grocery industry is struggling with transportation costs ingredient shortages and a reduced workforce (at least at current grocery store wages) which you can read more about here. Interestingly consumers haven‚Äôt yet felt the effects of those major price increases largely because markets are still burning through their stockpiles. While you may notice a slight increase in the cost of some of your pantry staples retailers are reportedly working to keep prices low to compete against discount or low-price chains like Walmart and Aldi WSJ reports. But with a barely recovered food supply chain and perhaps permanently altered consumer buying habits you have to wonder: how much more can our brittle food economy take?",,,,,,,,,,,,

However a TPG reader noted that the pool is indeed ADA compliant and a front desk agent confirmed by phone that a lift is available.

It would have to be a very special occasion for me to consider forking over $1000 for nightly accommodations for two people. Yet I've spent plenty of nights at hotels that cost at least that much ‚Äî and sometimes considerably more.

Points and miles make it possible to experience these destinations on the cheap and that's exactly what led me to a peak-season stay at one of Hyatt's most aspirational properties: Alila Napa Valley in St. Helena California.

A pricey stay quickly goes from being a burden to being a treat when you can lock it in for an entirely reasonable number of points but I still had high expectations for this top-tier Hyatt hotel ‚Äî that weren't quite met.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

We previously reviewed this same property when it was part of Marriott's Luxury Collection a former Category 8 hotel known as Las Alcobas.

While the name and management have since changed the rooms themselves are largely the same though I was told that the hotel had made some improvements since our last visit (more on that later).

Booking

During peak season paid rates can often exceed $1000 for a base room and climb well above $2500 for a premium suite. Fortunately many room types are available for award bookings starting at 30000 World of Hyatt points per night worth $510 based on TPG's valuations.

At that rate you can book a room with one king bed or one with two queens. While I didn't need two beds that's the type that offered vineyard views that look quite spectacular on Hyatt's website so that's the room I booked.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

For 18000 more points per night worth an additional $306 based on TPG's valuations you can confirm one of two mid-tier suites including one with a vineyard view that commands a hefty premium with cash rates.

Finally for 60000 points per night worth $1020 based on TPG's valuations you can book a phenomenal one-bedroom suite ‚Äî one offers vineyard views and otherwise comes along with cash rates approaching $3000.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

For our second night my girlfriend and I ended up getting upgraded to an estate-view suite so I'll be detailing that along with the balcony room with two queen beds as part of this review.

My colleague Zach Griff had booked the stay using his account ‚Äî he has Globalist benefits which Hyatt allows guests to share with a friend or family member as part of its Guest of Honor program.

The reservation wasn't booked as intended however which resulted in constant confusion at the hotel ‚Äî if you're redeeming your points for someone else be sure to call Hyatt to request a Guest of Honor booking to avoid any hassle at check-in and during your guest's stay.

Finally it's important to note that you can transfer points instantly from Chase Ultimate Rewards to World of Hyatt making it possible to book a stay even if you don't already have enough points in your Hyatt account.

Location

Alila is located in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena a roughly 10-minute walk from the cute downtown area which has a number of restaurants and shops.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

You're just steps from Beringer Vineyards ‚Äî those are the vines you'll see from rooms and suites with a vineyard view.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The hotel even has a bridge that brings you directly to Beringer ‚Äî tastings are available starting at $35 per person but if you're traveling during a peak period or over any weekend I'd recommend booking directly with the vineyard far in advance.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Check-in and lobby

As I mentioned there was considerable confusion at check-in because of the way this stay was booked. Eventually the agent was able to complete the process after I called Zach Griff and provided the hotel with the address listed on his World of Hyatt account.

Still throughout the stay I was referred to as ""Mr. Griff"" and there was no opportunity for me to earn points or elite credit for my stay ‚Äî only Zach's World of Hyatt number could be attached to the reservation.

Ultimately having both of our names attached even led to the general manager becoming aware that TPG employees were staying at the hotel though I'm confident that the first half of the stay was entirely ""under the radar"" as you'll see below.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Check-in is completed in a small room just outside Acacia House the hotel's on-site restaurant. I mention the size because the area was often full with other guests checking in and making inquiries ‚Äî be prepared to wait outside until it's your turn.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

All guests are offered wine upon arrival ‚Äî white or red ‚Äî which was served in a plastic cup. We came back to change rooms on the second day and were offered a second cup so I suppose it wouldn't hurt to ask for a refill if you'd like.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

After clearing up the booking-related confusion we were issued keys for Room 311. At first I didn't mind that it was on the ground floor since it made for easier access ‚Äî the benefits stopped there however.

Room

All of the rooms are a short walk from the check-in area ‚Äî the pool fitness center and other amenities are all within walking range.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Our room is listed as 570 square feet on Hyatt's website and while I didn't pull out my tape measure I wouldn't question the size. It felt quite spacious even with the second bed.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

It quickly became clear that having a ground-floor room was less than ideal. For one the view didn't match what Alila displays on its website ‚Äî the vineyard view pictured there is captured from a higher floor and it's far more dramatic from there.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

It was still a lovely view and we would have been fine staying in Room 311 had it not been for all of the noise. Footsteps traveled through the ceiling ‚Äî when our upstairs neighbors got up for bathroom breaks they unintentionally woke us up in the middle of the night. While it's unavoidable at some properties it isn't something you'd expect at a $1000-plus hotel.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Still the room was visually stunning ‚Äî finishes were of exceptional quality throughout including in the oversized bathroom.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

There was a large soaking tub along with a separate shower area which included both a wall-mounted wand and a rainforest showerhead on the ceiling.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

All of the amenities were from a company called Votary which my girlfriend was thrilled about. I was a quick convert as well ‚Äî I really loved the shampoo and conditioner.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The body lotion was also a big hit as was the bar soap by the sink.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

There was no shortage of space ‚Äî especially helpful if multiple ""costume changes"" are also a component of your Napa stay.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The toilet was in its own room around the corner along with a second mirrored sink ‚Äî it's hard to believe this is the room you'll get with a base redemption.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The minibar was well equipped but expensive ‚Äî fortunately coffee tea and bottles of water were free.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I wouldn't be caught dead spending $5 on a pouch of M&Ms at the store but I suppose I could be persuaded to open the minibar in the event of a chocolate emergency.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

I appreciated the ""restaurant pricing"" for the beers rather than the $10-plus you might otherwise find at high-end hotels. Expect at least a 50% markup on everything else including the On The Rocks cocktails which we picked up for $12 en route to the hotel.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

As I mentioned the view wasn't quite what I expected. It was still beautiful but I feel like the hotel would be better served by overdelivering on this front and perhaps sharing the view from a ground-floor room.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Compare the website view above with what we actually saw from the porch:

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Normally I'd feel a bit guilty complaining about such an incredible room but I'm sure some travelers will arrive with high expectations ‚Äî a reasonable approach given the hotel's incredibly high cash rates.

Since I was there for a review and wanted to see how the hotel would handle the mismatch I stopped by the front desk. I showed the agent the picture from the website to which he responded ""Of course we're going to show the best view.""

The agent explained that the hotel was fully booked ‚Äî we'd have to learn to love Room 311. I left a bit disappointed until room service knocked on the door to present some bubbles ‚Äî a $20 bottle of Louis Pommery a brand notably absent from the hotel's 32-page wine list.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Admittedly we enjoyed the bottle quite thoroughly on our ground-floor patio.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Next time I'll definitely be calling the hotel as soon as I book my stay to ensure that we're assigned a vineyard-view room on the third floor. Notably the ""3"" in our room number 311 simply identifies the building assignment ‚Äî only vineyard-view rooms and suites that start with ""33"" are actually located on the third floor.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

As we learned after the first night there are benefits to scoring the top floor ‚Äî beyond the view.

Suite upgrade

As I mentioned footsteps from the floor above traveled far too well through the ceiling and into our room waking us up several times overnight. (Notably when I asked one front desk agent about the noise they said that the hotel had undergone extensive sound-dampening work while it was closed for a year during the pandemic ‚Äî to no avail it seems.)

Before we left for our winery adventures I decided to check the Hyatt app and noticed that an estate-view suite had opened up. Normally these suites require an extra 30000 points per night but since Zach Griff booked the stay with his Globalist status the hotel was able to move us. My mention of our nighttime awakening(s) likely didn't hurt.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

When we returned to the hotel our suite was ready and our luggage arrived a few minutes later. At 948 square feet the suite was as large as many apartments before factoring in the oversized terrace.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The outdoor space was by far the highlight for me ‚Äî there was even a soaking tub though curiously the shades were fixed in place and decorative blinds don't provide much relief when you're hoping for some privacy.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

This particular suite doesn't have views of the vineyard ‚Äî you'll need a vineyard-view suite for that. Still we appreciated being on the top floor and having so much extra space.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

If privacy is what you're after as you bathe you'll want to complete the ritual in the large interior tub the centerpiece of a bathroom at least twice the size of the one we previously had.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Votary amenities abounded here as well helping us build a robust ""to-go"" collection that's since found its way to our bathroom at home.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The robes stayed behind but they were especially plush and comfy ‚Äî the same as the ones available in our ""regular"" room.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

We really appreciated the double sinks ‚Äî again a helpful addition in the hot Napa Valley where you're more likely to bathe and get ready multiple times a day.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The suite also had a half-bathroom just behind the entrance door making it easy to tiptoe over to the toilet without waking anyone else up.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I was barely through taking pictures when the phone rang ‚Äî the general manager Ty was eager to say hello. At first I figured he had heard about the footsteps keeping us up the previous night but when he mentioned that a TPG colleague had once been his neighbor it became clear that someone on the team had fired up Google.

Fortunately we had already made it through 24 hours before being discovered and the experience reflected here was largely that of a guest-of-a-Globalist who wasn't happy with his vineyard view. If there's anything out of the ordinary it'll be clearly noted ‚Äî such as the Acacia House dinner that ended up being compliments of Ty.

Amenities

When I saw how well equipped the hotel was I was worried the Alila would be adding a resort fee. Fortunately that isn't the case ‚Äî everything's included in the room rate including Trek bikes which you're free to use to explore the nearby wineries for the entire day.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The gym was large and never crowded. Everything was spotless and while I appreciated that there were water bottles I would have preferred to have a water dispenser to avoid wasting more plastic.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

There were two Peloton bikes. They seemed almost brand-new but unfortunately they weren't activated so I was only able to take one of three demo classes. I pointed out the issue to multiple staff members including the general manager so hopefully they'll be fully up and running soon.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The pool is on the smaller side but there were always chairs available when I walked by.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

There's an accessible pool lift available near the entrance stairs as well.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The minimalist design meant that there was a lot of open space making most of the public areas feel anything but cramped.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Wi-Fi was included throughout the property and in the guest rooms and it was consistently fast ‚Äî in fact it was among the speediest I've experienced at any hotel.

(Screenshot courtesy of Ookla)

There are also several Tesla chargers available on-site ‚Äî valets can plug in your car during your stay if you'd like.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Food and beverage

One of the highlights of the stay was getting to enjoy breakfast by the fire on our balcony each morning ‚Äî completely free of charge thanks to Zach's Globalist status.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

When I asked after check-in I was informed that we could spend up to $88.20 (yes 20 cents) each morning either on breakfast at the restaurant or on room service which was a very pleasant surprise.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

Both mornings I placed my order with Bob the hotel operator. While it wasn't a speedy process ‚Äî he took extreme care to confirm each detail of ""Mr. Griff's"" order ‚Äî Bob's incredibly cheerful demeanor made these morning breakfast chats a clear highlight of the stay.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

We managed to stick close to that budget while still ordering plenty of food including two cold brew coffees and green juices egg dishes pastries and more.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

While the total was a bit over $88 both days especially after factoring in the delivery fee and gratuity the front desk agent ended up removing both charges in full at checkout.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Alternatively we could have enjoyed breakfast at Acacia House and avoided the delivery fee.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

While we opted for room service both mornings we did make a dinner reservation at the on-site restaurant. You can book Acacia House via OpenTable or just call up the front desk.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I booked via OpenTable but noted our reservation with the front desk asking for a table with a great view which they said wouldn't be a problem. I asked again when we arrived at the restaurant but the hostess said all of the tables with views were already taken and she showed us to the empty patio area. It ended up being OK but I was a bit surprised that the request didn't make its way to the restaurant.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

As we were seated we were informed that our dinner was on the house. While we always pay for every component of a review stay refusing the comped meal would have only attracted more attention and I did overhear a front desk agent telling another guest that their meal would be comped after they experienced some challenges during their stay too.

We started with a Mexico City margarita which came topped with something called ""salt air"" ‚Äî it was absolutely delicious.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Next we ordered the chips and dip burrata and tuna tartare which I was especially excited about.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

The chips ended up being a true favorite ‚Äî the dip was creamy but light and the salmon eggs added some saltiness and color. A fantastic dish!

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The burrata was incredibly fresh and the pickled strawberries were an excellent addition. I loved the tuna tartare as well which was served with a ""liquid olive"" ‚Äî it was very creative releasing olive oil after we punctured the shell.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I was eyeing the Iberico pork schnitzel but $56 was a bit too rich of a price tag ‚Äî even for a comped meal.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

Instead we ordered the salad from the appetizer menu which was light and delicious ‚Äî the crunch of toasted seeds made for an unexpectedly complex dish.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The diver scallops were a treat as well but at $36 I was expecting at least twice the number ‚Äî two scallops would barely be reasonable for an appetizer let alone a main course. (The LED table lamp was a nice post-sunset addition and made it easy to light each dish.)

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

The desserts all sounded delicious but we didn't want to indulge too much so we ordered the cheese plate.

(Screenshot courtesy of Alila Napa Valley)

It was a bit of a letdown ‚Äî there was just one tiny chunk of cheese and it was bland and very cold like it had just come out of the refrigerator. For $22 I was expecting more.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

It's Napa Valley so naturally some guests are going to want to bring their own bottles of wine. The hotel will allow it with a $35 corkage fee for the first two 750-milliliter bottles jumping to $50 per bottle after that. It's an odd distinction that reminds me a bit of an airline's checked bag structure but I suppose once you're a couple of bottles in you'll care less about the additional fee.

Service

We didn't get the warmest welcome but the booking process was largely to blame ‚Äî the hotel was expecting Zach Griff and got Zach Honig so it wouldn't be too unreasonable to assume that something fishy was going on.

We were on our way fairly quickly once that was cleared up but we didn't get any information about the property whatsoever ‚Äî nothing about breakfast or the fitness center or the bikes. We were handed our key and escorted by the bellman to our room who similarly didn't share anything about the property and instead focused on discussing his management aspirations.

Aside from the check-in experience the biggest point of frustration was the mandatory car valet. There wasn't an additional fee which was great but aside from our final departure the valets never ended up bringing the car around when requested in advance. I would have much preferred a self-park option given that all of the cars were kept just steps from the front desk or guest rooms.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

That said some of the staff was truly fantastic. Bob the operator was incredibly warm during each of my calls ‚Äî while we never met in person he added a lot of personality to the stay and promptly helped resolve an invoice issue (an incorrect $7 minibar charge) after checkout too.

Meanwhile during one gym visit there wasn't any water ‚Äî I asked a nearby housekeeper for some and she brought two bottles right away. Similarly when I called the front desk about the Peloton issues they sent an ""engineer"" almost immediately. He wasn't able to figure out how to get the bikes online but you can't fault the hotel for a speedy response.

Overall impression

Was it a flawless stay? No not at all ‚Äî I had very high expectations given the hotel's World of Hyatt category and base rate and they weren't met. Initially the biggest disappointment was that the view didn't match the marketing photos but the improper insulation between floors ended up being a more significant issue and far less of an overnight fix.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

That said I would absolutely return especially now that I know which rooms to request. At 30000 points per night the vineyard-view room seems like the way to go even though it has two double beds. Just be certain that you have a room on the third floor ‚Äî while the second floor likely has decent views there's a good chance you'll have to deal with noise overhead.

Meanwhile for an even more spectacular stay I'd redeem 60000 points or use a Globalist suite night certificate to confirm a vineyard-view suite. In my opinion it's worth the extra cost to guarantee a better view and far more space especially if a third-floor vineyard-view room isn't available to book.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9waG90b3MtYmVhbC10ZWFtLXVzYS1vcGVuLWV4aGliaXRpb24tc2NoZWR1bGUtbmlnZXJpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Beal Team USA open exhibition schedule vs. Nigeria,"Copyright ¬© 2024 NBA Media Ventures LLC.

Last night‚Äôs star-studded ESPYS Awards held at The Rooftop at Pier 17 at the Seaport in New York City on Saturday night was another glitzy celebration of our fave athletes hitting the red carpets in their best dressed and sharing classic sports moments from the past year on the biggest (and funniest) night in sports.

If Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson and Naomi Osaka ever questioned how much public support they‚Äôre getting any doubts most definitely have to be gone after the ESPYS Awards where host Anthony Mackie put a spotlight on them. Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson might have been one of the biggest and highly anticipated names of the night and it seems like everyone in attendance was exceptionally happy to see her there.

Babygirl won‚Äôt be able to showcase her colorful hair and long embellished nails at the Tokyo Olympics due to testing positive for marijuana at the Team USA Olympic track and field trials in June but she did show up to Saturday night‚Äôs event with fiery red hair and a bangin‚Äô sparkly black dress. During the event host Anthony Mackie showed his support for the 21-year-old sprinter and in his opening monologue took a shot at U.S.A. Track & Field over its suspension of Richardson for a positive marijuana test.

‚ÄúUSA Track & Field how you mess that up?‚Äù Mackie later said. ‚ÄúWeed is a de-enhancing drug. It doesn‚Äôt make you do anything besides watch another episode of Bob‚Äôs Burgers. I don‚Äôt get how you justify not letting her run.‚Äù

Well well he does have a point but we won‚Äôt get into all that right now. Mackie hasn‚Äôt been the only one speaking out and supporting Sha‚ÄôCarri. Following the news of Richardson‚Äôs positive test many celebrity fans and fellow athletes showed support of the track star using the hashtag ‚Äú#LetHerRun‚Äù and calling out the ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù rule against marijuana.

Sha‚ÄôCarri sat down with The Undefeated after the awards show to recap the night and talk about her inspirations.

Not only was this the first public appearance for Richardson since news of her suspension but it was also the first time tennis superstar Naomi Osaka was spotted out after she withdrew from the French Open.

Osaka took home an award for Best Female Athlete.

Host Mackie had some words for the World Tennis Association as well for not supporting her after she pulled out of the French Open and Wimbledon due to mental health.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm no tennis exec I don‚Äôt know but if my sport had one of the most popular and marketable athletes on the planet you know what I would do? I would probably make sure she felt comfortable and respected. But hey what do I know right? I‚Äôm just Captain America.‚Äù

Once again our guy has a point but we digress.

Others in attendance for last night‚Äôs festivities were Da Baby presenting Lamelo Ball with his ESPY Award for Best Breakthrough Athlete. Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who took home the award for Best Athlete Men‚Äôs Sports and Best Team. Russell Westbrook taking home the award for Best Record-Breaking Performance and also Stephen Curry taking home the award for Best NBA Player. Check out some of the winners from last night below.

Track sprinter Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson made a red carpet appearance at the ESPY Awards on Saturday. The appearance is the first for the 21-year-old after the controversy surrounding her positive marijuana test and suspension from the Olympics last month.

In spite of the suspension headlines Sha‚ÄôCarri was all smiles and in good spirits at last night‚Äôs awards. Rocking her signature fiery red hair and long white fingernails the athlete donned a floor-length black sparkly dress by Laquan Smith that showed off her toned arms and vibrant tattoos. She paired the look with black strappy sandals and minimal jewelry to let the dress speak for itself.

Although she‚Äôs won‚Äôt be an Olympic hopeful this year she‚Äôs still managed to garner the support of Black Americans around the country including last night‚Äôs host actor Anthony Mackie who made the sprinter the topic of one of his monologues. ‚ÄúUSA Track & Field how you mess that up?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWeed is a de-enhancing drug. It doesn‚Äôt make you do anything besides watch another episode of Bob‚Äôs Burgers. I don‚Äôt get how you justify not letting her run.‚Äù

After the event spectators captured Sha‚ÄôCarri meeting rapper Da Baby for the first time. The always confident track star suddenly appeared coy and shy as she blushed while greeting him. ‚ÄúYou are Da Baby‚Äù she told him to which she then asked him if he knew her name. They then smiled before exchanging a friendly hug.

We‚Äôre looking forward to seeing more of Sha‚ÄôCarri in the future!

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

From a Tupac Shakur poem about a flower growing in concrete grew an art exhibit by Black artists that celebrates strength and diversity in people as well as in nature.

‚ÄúResilience in Nature: We are the Roses that Grew from the Concrete‚Äù continuing through Nov. 28 in the Cardinal Health Gallery at Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens presents the work of 29 central Ohio artists ranging from a preteen to established art professionals.

The theme of the exhibit builds upon the poem:

‚ÄúDid you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete/Proving nature‚Äôs laws wrong it learned to walk without having feet/Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams/It learned to breath fresh air/Long live the rose that grew from concrete/When no one else even cared.‚Äù

The 31 works in the exhibit are in a variety of mediums including drawing fiber art painting photography and sculpture. In equally diverse imagery the works remark on the resilience of the natural world and the humans who exist in it.

Jamie Ceaser‚Äôs photograph ‚ÄúAlley Rose‚Äù captures a single painted red bloom standing impossibly tall behind a wire fence. Earl H. English used scanner photography for ‚ÄúAltered Reality #3‚Äù a striking close-up of rose petals.

Stefanie Rivers‚Äô textile ‚ÄúSteady Force‚Äù is a beautiful bold image of a tree in colors of gold green red and purple embellished with buttons shells and sequins.

In his large and elegant mural ‚ÄúParadise Regained #18‚Äù Benjamin Crumpler presents a field of pastel flowers and plants home to birds bugs and lizards.

And in the mixed-media assemblage ‚ÄúHoneycomb Collective‚Äù Kenya Davis makes use of real plants including dried lotus pods.

Many works place people in the natural settings including ‚ÄúThe Blackberry Pickers‚Äù Floristine Yancey-Jones‚Äô acrylic folk-style scene of workers in rural Virginia on a sunny day. In Stacy L. Spencer‚Äôs ‚ÄúHanging by a Limb‚Äù created with acrylic paint and papier-mache leaves hanging from a tree bear words including ‚Äúhope‚Äù ‚Äúfamily‚Äù ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù Also in the scene is a bench with the words ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù

And the youngest artist in the exhibit is 12-year-old Dionna Kendrick whose pencil drawing ‚ÄúResilience‚Äù features a girl whose arms spread in tree-like fashion to honor with their names on leaves female heroines including Beyonce and Maya Angelou.

The exhibit was created by the conservatory in partnership with four central Ohio organizations: All People Arts Creative Women of Color Maroon Arts Group and TRANSIT ARTS. Selecting the works were five jurors all artists or art experts: Queen Brooks Richard Duarte Brown Marshall Shorts Bettye Stull and April Sunami.

Bonnie DeRubertis the conservatory‚Äôs associate director of exhibitions said the exhibit is intended to be diverse and to represent emerging and underrepresented artistic voices.

‚ÄúIn nature diversity is a huge strength‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe can look to nature to help us grow as a community.‚Äù

The public health restrictions were put in place to help manage COVID-19 the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that has killed at least 570 people in the province.

Those restrictions including mandatory masking and limitations on gatherings lifted Sunday.

Now people can choose to return to shout-talking at friends in crowded pubs walking any direction down grocery store aisles and leaving home without a mask in hand.

Premier Scott Moe has said that the province will no longer look to control COVID-19 through government intervention or restrictions but instead will rely on vaccines.

As of Thursday the province had 415 active cases total with 62 people in hospital. The province reported 113 new cases of COVID-19 on that day the largest single-day increase in cases since the beginning of June.

The government said the rise in cases mostly stems from an outbreak at the Hatchet Lake Denesuline First Nation which is located about 850 kilometres north of Saskatoon near Wollaston Lake a remote area in the far northeastern region of the province.

Slightly more than 50 per cent of Saskatchewan residents aged 12 and up were fully vaccinated as of Thursday and just over 71 per cent of that age group had received their first dose.

'Excited but wary'

At first COVID-19 survivor Matthew Cardinal was hesitant about the move to no restrictions. He had a devastating brush with the virus spending days intubated in the ICU. Now he's doing much better in recovery even clocking in 22000 steps on Wednesday.

Aside from having had COVID he also works in the restaurant industry. His first vaccine shot brought tears to his eyes. He feels confident now that he's double-dosed and that so many others have taken steps to get vaccinated. He's hopeful ongoing outreach and education will see vaccine-hesitant people get their shots.

Cardinal now feels excitement about the reopening but he also fears for those who can't get vaccinated.

""The kids are going to be vulnerable the immunocompromised people are going to be vulnerable"" he said. ""I'm excited but wary at the same time.""

WATCH| Cardinal hopes people will be respectful to those who continue to wear masks:

Matthew Cardinal hopes that people will 'just be respectful' to those who continue to wear masks as Saskatchewan reopens Duration 1:40 After a scary brush with COVID-19 that left him in the ICU Matthew Cardinal reflects on Saskatchewan's lifting of restrictions.

Cardinal said he won't be taking his health ‚Äî or health-care workers ‚Äî for granted moving forward.

""I got a second lease on life. I'm forever grateful for this.""

Restriction-free block party

To mark the day a restriction-free block party will take over streets in Swift Current Sask.

""We are trying to provide a fun kind of fair-like atmosphere for kids and for families just to come and hang out have fun participate in a few games. We're going to have cotton candy. We're going to have a DJ"" said Nathan Wiebe executive director of the Swift Current Community Youth Initiative at the Center. It's a non-profit serving families and youth with counselling supervision mentoring and other programs.

Live your life but just be cautious. Remember that not everyone's going to be vaccinated. - Matthew Cardinal

The event is advertised as an opportunity to hang out without masks but Wiebe understands if people want to continue wearing masks and added there will be cleaning precautions in place. The government says that despite the restrictions being lifted ""unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people should still consider masking.""

Wiebe said people are excited to connect and mingle with others they haven't seen during the pandemic. He's also excited by how the community has come together to pull this event off.

""It takes a village to raise a child. And when you go through something as challenging as we're going through ‚Äî we have been going through ‚Äî it takes a community to get through this.""

Some businesses keeping restrictions in place

Some business owners ‚Äî who have to consider the health of their staff and customers ‚Äî don't plan to return to pre-pandemic ways just yet. For example some plan to continue with mandatory masking or monitoring the number of individuals in a space.

Tori Usher co-owner of Lotus & Oak Salon in Regina said the business plans to keep health protocols in place. She said it seemed like a quick transition from full PPE to back to normal.

""We're happy to see things ending of course and getting better. But it was very shocking just how quickly they just kind of ended every rule and regulation"" Usher said. ""We are in such close contact with our clients and staff members that we can't social distance.""

The salon will continue to require masks for clients and staff. They'll keep glass dividers up and have clients wait outside.

The government said it ""is the choice of an individual business or facility to implement their own masking policy. If you enter a facility that requires a mask patrons must respect the decision of the business and either comply or choose not to visit the establishment.""

One yoga studio in the city will require proof of vaccination from all in-studio participants.

Owners of Bodhi Tree Yoga want anyone attending in-person classes to show proof they are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 Duration 2:14 Students at a Regina yoga studio will soon need to grab one more item along with their yoga mat before attending class: their COVID-19 vaccination card.

Usher said her salon will assess its own additional protective measures day by day.

""To me it's just a total 'you do you' situation. Do what's best for your business or your clients customers to keep them safe and happy"" she said. ""We want to make sure everybody's happy and make sure our salon continues to stay busy and people don't feel uneasy coming here. ""

Having survived his bout with COVID-19 Cardinal called on people to respect others who continue to wear masks after the restrictions are lifted.

""The virus is still out there. It's going to be here forever ‚Äî I'm assuming now ‚Äî it's going to be endemic"" he said. ""Live your life but just be cautious. Remember that not everyone's going to be vaccinated.""",,,,,,,,,

The posters @alashubbak and @theroyalfive shared video of their car a black Volkswagen SUV and the contracts having been signed by CarMax with captions explaining what had happened up to that point. The initial video posted by @theroyalfive has received over 500000 views.

@theroyalfive wrote that the contract for the car‚Äôs sale was signed and dated months previous and the paperwork shows an offer was made in April. They allege that CarMax did not pay off the lease in the timeframe given by Volkswagen and failed to inform them. The owner‚Äôs name was still on the car which impacted their credit.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt notify us after ten days when they messed up they waited two whole months.‚Äù @theroyalfive said. ‚ÄúNow we have to deal with the mess when it was their fault. So disorganized and unprofessional.‚Äù

While the car was in the possession of CarMax the owner said additional mileage appeared on the odometer and the windshield was damaged.

‚ÄúWe just picked up the car they were driving it around racked up 1500 miles messed the brake chipped the window. CarMax is the worst to deal with!‚Äù

Multiple commenters shared that they had used CarMax in a similar manner without issue pointing out that this location and its staff may be the problem not the company as a whole. However the poster stated that they had taken the issue all the way to corporate and got a similar response.

In a follow up video the pair stated that they worked with Volkswagen to secure a loan to pay off the car while they figure out what to do with it.

Update 4:48pm CT July 11: In a statement to the Daily Dot a representative for CarMax denied the TikTokers‚Äô claims calling them inaccurate:

‚ÄúCustomer service is CarMax‚Äôs top priority and we were happy to look into this customer‚Äôs concern. This vehicle was leased and the lien holder initially provided an inaccurate pay-off amount. CarMax purchased the vehicle on 4/22/21 and sent payment to the lien holder the next day 4/23/21 but the check was never cashed. On 6/18/21 CarMax was notified by the lien holder that the accurate pay-off amount was $8000 more than initially stated. CarMax immediately notified the customer who was no longer interested in selling the vehicle.‚Äù

The eight-time Olympic gold medalist is not taking a break from the gym anytime soon after his friends told him that he would likely gain weight once he left the track for good.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always tried to stay fit because I have a bet with my friends‚Äù Bolt explained to Insider. ‚ÄúThey were like ‚ÄòAs soon as you retire you‚Äôre going to get fat.‚Äô And I was like I can‚Äôt let them win this. So I‚Äôve been trying to do my best to stay in shape.‚Äù

Bolt the fastest man in the world said that the bet came about after years of bragging to his buddies about his famous abs. Along with proving them wrong Bolt says he genuinely likes maintaining his physique.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying it. It‚Äôs good to stay fit. It‚Äôs good for your mental health also. It‚Äôs something that helps me to stay focused and just be happy.‚Äù

As an athlete ambassador for Peloton Bolt appreciates the brand‚Äôs cycling classes because he can do those right beside his bed. He has also been training hard for a CarMax challenge which entails racing a half-mile against a CarMax agent as they complete an appraisal for a client. The car company promises an appraisal within two minutes so the goal is for Bolt to finish the race within that time. The challenge will take place on July 13th on Facebook Live for all to see.

‚ÄúThey told me they‚Äôre one of the fastest appraisals for car companies online now. In two minutes you can be approved. So I was like ‚ÄòOkay cool.‚Äô And they‚Äôre like ‚Äòwe‚Äôd like you to hit 800 meters.‚Äô I was like ‚ÄòNow that‚Äôs interesting'‚Äù Bolt said.

Although Toyota and Honda are commonly regarded as two carmakers that provide the best value Hyundai has recently improved its reputation in providing affordable and reliable used cars. Learn more about used Hyundai vehicles whether Hyundai is becoming better than Toyota and what other used vehicles provide a great value under $15000.

Is Hyundai better than Toyota?

Hyundai hasn‚Äôt gotten nearly as much respect as Toyota in the world of automakers but that might be about to change. Hyundai has produced some excellent cars over the past few years and has consistently created more affordable cars than Toyota.

Price will always be a major consideration for anyone looking to buy a car used or new and Hyundai offers plenty of great features for less than most other carmakers. Another benefit that Hyundai offers is one of the best warranties in the industry. Toyota‚Äôs warranty isn‚Äôt awful by any means but Hyundai‚Äôs definitely takes the cake in a head-to-head competition between the two.

Hyundai offers a five-year/60000-mile warranty for its minor coverage whereas Toyota only offers a three-year/36000-mile warranty. When it comes to powertrain warranties Hyundai provides coverage for 10 years or 100000 miles. Toyota only gives five years or 60000 miles worth of coverage for its vehicles‚Äô powertrains.

Car buying doesn‚Äôt just come down to price and warranties however and both Toyota and Hyundai are working hard to provide value for their customers. It‚Äôs impossible to say whether one of these carmakers is better than the other as they both have their own set of strengths and weaknesses and each driver has a unique set of wants and needs.

Hyundai captures two spots on a prestigious Carmax list

2021 Hyundai Sonata | Hyundai Motor America

Carmax recently released its list of ‚ÄúBest Used Cars For 2021 Under $15000‚Äù and Hyundai was the only carmaker to show up on the list twice. The 2021 Hyundai Elantra finished in third place on the list and the Hyundai Sonata came in fifth. This may have surprised some as many regard Toyota as the carmaker with the most reliable and value-holding cars. Toyota only ended up taking one spot on the list as the Toyota Corolla came in second.

In the Toyota brand‚Äôs defense it did have two cars on the list of Best Used Cars for 2021 under $30000 but are people who can‚Äôt afford to spend more than $15000 on a used car better off going with Hyundai instead?

Other excellent used cars under 15K in 2021

According to Carmax‚Äôs list the Nissan Sentra is the used car under 15K to look at this year. This is an excellent car for those looking for an affordable and reliable used car as Nissan has really upped its Sentra game in the past few years. U.S. News reports that Sentras may not come with all the bells and whistles more expensive cars do such as powerful engines or extra infotainment features. Still the model provides better-than-decent reliability a notable standard safety feature list and competitive fuel efficiency. It‚Äôs certainly not the most stylish car on the market but it will get you from point A to B in a way that‚Äôs easy on your wallet.

Carmax also placed the Chevy Cruze on its list which is another fantastic choice for those looking to get a good bang for their buck. The Chevy Cruise offers more infotainment features better gas mileage and higher reliability ratings than the Nissan Sentra in some models. However it may also come with a slightly higher price tag.

When selecting an affordable used car the best choice for you comes down to personal preferences but it‚Äôs hard to go wrong with any of the vehicles Carmax outlined on its list.",,,,,,

Where do I want to make sure to eat? Should I have two Guy‚Äôs Burgers today seeing as once I‚Äôm back home it‚Äôll be a while before I have another?‚Äù

Once done at the gym I strolled around the ship for a little while. I considered ‚Äî for about 8 seconds ‚Äî taking a swim or hitting one of the water slides which was sort of a weird thought. I love being on the water but I‚Äôm not really big on pools or waterslides. I‚Äôve done them of course especially if it‚Äôs something new or I‚Äôm with people who want to.

But I‚Äôm the kind of cruiser who isn‚Äôt really about all the bells-and-whistles. I try things like the SkyRide ‚Äî and I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to taking BOLT the top-deck roller coaster on Mardi Gras ‚Äî for a spin at the end of the month. But just like I‚Äôm a meat-and-potatoes guy I‚Äôm also the type of person who just enjoys being on a ship and doesn‚Äôt need all the extras.

I sometimes wonder if that‚Äôs what separates the ‚Äúold-school‚Äù cruisers from the new breed ‚Äî the ropes courses and race tracks and roller coasters. But as cruise executives like to say it all combines to make cruising the kind of vacation where there‚Äôs something for everyone. You can do it all if you want‚Ä¶ or you can do absolutely nothing.

Anyway all that wandering and pondering got me hungry and it was time for one of my favorite things about sea days on a Carnival ship ‚Äî the Sea Day Brunch. While you can just show up and wait for a table we decided to use the HUB app in order to see how well it worked. We entered the number in our party said we were ready to eat now and a few minutes later the app told us our table was ready.

I mentioned earlier in the week that the HUB app makes it pretty easy to look at menus. Even before we‚Äôd gotten to our table I‚Äôd already been checking out what was available and found exactly what I wanted‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ the Voyage Burger. And because you never know when you‚Äôre going to find time to eat again (and it‚Äôs always better to be safe than sorry) I also ordered the fried chicken.

I‚Äôll admit that I miss the old-school Sea Day Brunch with its Flaming Tomato Soup and the cereal-crusted French toast. It felt weirdly more in keeping with the idea of brunch on board a Fun Ship. I mean you can‚Äôt get much more fun than a menu that says ‚Äúgo big or go home and since you can‚Äôt go home you might as well go big!‚Äù That said this was a solid brunch and the menu has a whole lot to offer.

Later in the afternoon I went to the Military Appreciation event. If you‚Äôve read my past trip reports you know that I try my best to never ever miss this and always recommend it to others. I know that it can be easy to forget what with all the things going on around the ship to keep you entertained especially on a sea day. But it‚Äôs impossible to describe how moving this event is and how much it means to every single member of the military ‚Äî past and present ‚Äî when we the people they‚Äôve fought to keep safe take a moment to listen to their stories and more important show our appreciation.

I also stuck my head in the Diamond/Platinum appreciation session. While it doesn‚Äôt have the gravitas of the Military Appreciation ceremony I know people appreciate the cruise line acknowledging their loyalty. I‚Äôm always kinda amused by the part where the captain and various crew members come out to say a quick hello. Obviously it‚Äôs a nice gesture it just always feels a little like a dog-and-pony show which I guess is kinda what it is.

And yes people were bitching about the luggage tag loyalty gift. My favorite moment was when one woman hearing her travel companion complaining about the luggage tag turned to her and snapped ‚ÄúEdith you didn‚Äôt pay for any of the last four cruises so I‚Äôm not sure you even deserve that luggage tag!‚Äù (The names as they say have been changed to protect the guilty.)

I knew I had a ton of work to do ‚Äî these trip reports don‚Äôt write themselves ya know! ‚Äî so I grabbed a drink spent a few minutes watching the wake (is there anything more hypnotic on the planet?) and then headed back to my stateroom to go through the hundreds of photos I‚Äôve taken this week. Oh and of course stopped for a quick Guy‚Äôs Burger fix.

See why I hit the gym first thing every morning? I mean it‚Äôs easy to see why people ‚Äújoke‚Äù about putting on 10 pounds every time they cruise. If I ate like this every day at home I‚Äôd be in big trouble‚Ä¶ emphasis on ‚Äúbig.‚Äù

Now it‚Äôs going to seem as though I went from Guy‚Äôs straight to the main dining room but you have to imagine that there was a good three or four hour period in between where I was working. Plus we had pre-dinner drinks in the atrium. But now without further ado we head to dinner‚Ä¶

First up was a delicious pumpkin soup. I can‚Äôt recall if I‚Äôd ever had pumpkin soup before but I‚Äôll definitely be having it again. This was a perfect starter followed up by a crab cake‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ and filet with veggies.

I thought about passing on dessert but realized that so far this trip I hadn‚Äôt had one of my favorites the Grand Marnier Souffle. Remember how I said at the beginning of this trip report that I‚Äôd reached the point at which you start thinking about what you hadn‚Äôt done yet? Well this brings things full circle.

After dinner I walked around the ship for a while just soaking in the sights and sounds and doing a little bit of people watching. Tomorrow is the first of two back-to-back days at Half Moon Cay Carnival‚Äôs private island and yet again my travel agent has something special lined up. But that‚Äôs for tomorrow‚Äôs report‚Ä¶

Terrifying footage shows the moment bystanders were forced to intervene to stop a carnival ride from toppling over with people on it.

The foundation of the Magic Carpet Ride at the 95th Annual National Cherry Festival in Traverse City in northern Michigan began to come loose from the ground seemingly about to fall on Thursday night.

About 10 passengers were on the ride when it became clear that it wasn‚Äôt safe.

As the ride started to sway dangerously more than a dozen bystanders rushed towards the foundation of the structure and climbed onto it to stabilise it until it could come to a halt.

The crowd cheered as the ride finally came to a stop and passengers could safely disembark.

UpNorthLive News reported that no one was injured and that the ride had been taken down by Friday morning.

Kat Paye the festival‚Äôs executive director told the New York Daily News in a statement that the ride had been sent to its manufacturer for inspection.

‚ÄúInspections of the rides happen daily and written reports are filled out and completed on each ride every morning prior to operation‚Äù she said. She added that she was in contact with the operator of the ride Arnold Amusements Inc.

‚ÄúI am grateful for the quick response of staff and community members and very thankful that there were no injuries‚Äù Ms Paye said.

A representative for Arnold Amusements Inc. told the outlet that the cause for the malfunction remained unclear.

According to local news outlet WPBN the fair attraction is called the Magic Carpet Ride and is supposed to spin in circles along a single axis as riders are seated.

At one point in this case however the ride began to sway back and forth on the opposite axis while in motion appearing to nearly tip over as seen in footage from various angles shared by multiple outlets including TMZ and WOFL.

That was when carnival-goers began noticing from the ground that the ride wasn't functioning properly. Following an initial hero's quick thinking many others flocked to the ride's base in attempts to steady it and secure it so the mechanics could be shut off and people could get to safety per the videos.

A spokesperson for the National Cherry Festival did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment though executive director Kat Paye did issue a statement Friday.

""The magic carpet ride that malfunctioned last night was removed and is in route to its manufacturer to be inspected. Inspections of the rides happen daily and written reports are filled out and completed on each ride every morning prior to operation"" Paye stated. ""I have spoken with representatives of Arnold's Amusements after the incident last night and again this morning. I am grateful for the quick response of staff and community members and very thankful that there were no injuries.""

Someone who was on the ride during the incident told WPBN ""The ride goes and I guess it's kind of hard to tell once you're in the air. I could tell it was a lot more violent and seemed a little more shaky.""

There were no injuries reported according to WPBN. The incident reportedly occurred at about 11 p.m. local time and that the ride was taken down and gone the following morning on Friday.

The annual National Cherry Festival is held in Traverse City Michigan ending this year on Saturday after kicking off on July 3. President Joe Biden stopped by the event for opening day last weekend.

According to the festival's official website the event which dates back to 1926 attracts more than 500000 attendees over its eight days each year.

Speaking with WPBN Joe Evans of Arnold Amusement praised the bystanders for stepping in and explained that there will be an investigation into what happened with the ride.

""Obviously there was a malfunction. We don't know as of yet what it was. The ride has been dismantled. It is gone and it is on its way back to the factory the company that makes it is in Ohio and it's on its way down there for them to figure out what happened"" he explained. ""Was it a malfunction?

The incident took place at Traverse City's National Cherry Festival witnesses say and several people posted videos that show the Magic Carpet carnival ride ‚Äî which features a row of seats attached to a large swinging pendulum ‚Äî as it suddenly began to rock forward and backward.

Arnold Amusements the company that runs the carnival rides says on its website that the Magic Carpet takes people 50 feet into the air.

Several people in the videos can be heard screaming as the posts that hold the ride's platform to the ground appear to suddenly become loose. The entire platform begins tilting back and forth as the passengers continue to swing and someone who had been sitting on the ride's platform jumps off.

That's when festival-goers rushed in to help. At least a dozen can be seen running towards the ride and jumping up on the platform to hold it down and prevent it from tipping backwards.

According to the video it took several minutes for the ride to come to a complete stop so passengers could safely get off. More than a dozen passengers could be seen on board including children.

Festival organizers told CBS News that there were no injuries. In a statement organizers said the ride had been removed and taken to its manufacturer for inspection.

GRAND TRAVERSE COUNTY Mich. -- It is a tradition in northern Michigan near the waters of Lake Michigan -- the region's national cherry festival.

But the fun of it Thursday night was interrupted when an amusement ride began to malfunction.

The scary moments were caught on video.

""I've been on that type of ride before and I could tell it's like a lot more violent. It seems a little more shaky"" said Trevor Drew and amusement ride patron.

WPBN's digital content producer Trevor Drew is used to working on news stories but around 11 p.m. Thursday he was right in the middle of one.

""I've never seen anything like shake like that"" Drew said.

He and a handful of other riders were strapped into an amusement ride at the National Cherry Festival when witnesses said something went noticeably wrong.

From Task Force 70 Public Affairs



PHILIPPINE SEA ‚Äì U.S. Navy carrier strike groups led by flagships USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) and USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) joined with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force‚Äôs (JMSDF) Hyuga-class helicopter destroyer JS Ise (DDH 182) and the United Kingdom‚Äôs carrier strike group (CSG 21) led by HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) to conduct multiple carrier strike group operations in the Philippine Sea Oct. 3.



The integrated at-sea operations brought together more than 15000 Sailors across six nations and demonstrates the U.S. Navy‚Äôs ability to work closely with its unmatched network of alliances and partnerships in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.



Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 5 from Ronald Reagan is operating with CSG 1 from Carl Vinson for the first time during its 2021 deployment and marks the second time operating with UK CSG 21 and JS Ise this year.



‚ÄúWe are picking up right where we left off in 5th Fleet with the Queen Elizabeth team and building on what we started with the JMSDF after first leaving Japan‚Äù said Rear Adm. Will Pennington commander Carrier Strike Group 5/Task Force 70. ‚ÄúAdding the fantastic Vinson team to this potent force dynamically displays our capabilities across all domains keeping us ready to respond to a range of maritime challenges.‚Äù



The strike groups conducted flight operations and air defense exercise scenarios as well as simulated strikes against maritime targets. The operations brought together F/A-18 Super Hornets from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 aboard Ronald Reagan along with F-35Bs from both Royal Air Force and U.S. Marines operating from Queen Elizabeth and F-35Cs from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 aboard Carl Vinson.



‚ÄúInteroperability across air platforms to include the addition of the Air Wing of the Future is just one way we have integrated operations for enhanced lethality readiness and maneuverability across our collective forces‚Äù said Rear Adm. Dan Martin commander Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG)/CSG 1. ‚ÄúThis is Carl Vinson strike group‚Äôs fourth exercise with allies and partners since entering 7th Fleet and we have continued to improve our ability to conduct prompt and sustained operations at sea with a more mobile agile and flexible force. Through alliances and partnerships we have developed the right operational concepts plans proficiencies and capabilities to bolster our maritime advantage.‚Äù



Vinson and UK CSG conducted joint interoperability flights together in 7th Fleet in August the first time CSG-21 engaged with the F-35 ‚ÄúC‚Äù model assigned to CVW-2. The two F-35B squadrons have been deployed together aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for her inaugural global deployment demonstrating the interoperability the F-35 provides.



‚ÄúThe UK Carrier Strike Group offers the largest 5th Generation air wing afloat today and working with our close allies to develop operating procedures and capabilities while concurrently showcasing the agility of land and carrier-based aviation in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates our commitment to the region‚Äù said Commodore Steve Moorhouse OBE Royal Navy Commander UK Carrier Strike Group.



The training and events provided commanders the chance to practice capabilities across the maritime domain as participating forces focused on anti-air anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare tactics and procedures.



‚ÄúIn addition to the two carrier strike groups of the U.S. Navy I feel very honored to be able to train with the Royal Navy's most advanced carrier strike group which is an extremely valuable experience‚Äù said Rear Adm. KONNO Yasushige Commander of JMSDF Escort Flotilla 2. ‚ÄúThrough this training we enhanced our tactical skills and interoperability with the participating navies. In order to realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific the JMSDF will work closely with the naval forces of the U.S. Britain the Netherlands and Canada which share the same objectives to respond to global challenges and defend maritime order based on the rule of law.‚Äù



Joining the JS Ise from the JMSDF were the destroyers JS Yamagiri (DD 152) and JS Kirishima (DDG 174). The frigates HMCS Winnipeg (FFH 338) from the Royal Canadian Navy and HMNZS Te Kaha (F 77) from the Royal New Zealand Navy represented their countries in the operations.



In addition to the carrier the Queen Elizabeth Strike Group is comprised of anti-submarine frigates HMS Richmond (F 239) and HMS Kent (F 78) guided-missile destroyers HMS Defender (D 36) and HMS Diamond (D 34) Royal Fleet Auxiliary‚Äôs RFA Fort Victoria and RFA Tidespring U.S. guided-missile destroyer USS The Sullivans (DDG 68) and Dutch frigate HNLMS Evertsen (F 805).



CSG 1 includes aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) the squadrons of Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 1 Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Chafee (DDG 90) USS Stockdale (DDG 106) and Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain (CG 57).



CSG 5 includes the U.S. Navy's only forward-deployed aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) the embarked staffs of Task Force 70 and Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 15 Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh (CG 67) and aircraft from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5.



The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group and CSG 1 are deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.



U.S. 7th Fleet conducts forward-deployed naval operations in support of U.S. national interests in the Indo-Pacific area of operations. As the U.S. Navy's largest forward-deployed fleet 7th Fleet interacts with 35 other maritime nations to build partnerships that foster maritime security promote stability and prevent conflict.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYmlnLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzLWFyZS10b28tZXhwZW5zaXZlJUUyJTgwJTk0LWl0LXRpbWUtYmFieS1jYXJyaWVycy0xODk0OTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Big Aircraft Carriers Are Too Expensive‚ÄîIs It Time for ""Baby"" Carriers?","But smaller and cheaper means reduced capabilities and could prevent the Navy from fighting in hostile waters or providing the air support for ground operations.

Here's What You Need to Know: Carriers that have less capabilities would affect how the U.S. wages war such as relying on carrier-based air support when operating far from U.S. airfields and land-based aircraft.

The bottom line of a new study on U.S. aircraft carriers: you can't get something for nothing.

The Navy can buy smaller cheaper carriers rather than the $13 billion Ford-class behemoths it is currently constructing according to a new study by RAND Corporation. But smaller and cheaper means reduced capabilities and could prevent the Navy from fighting in hostile waters or providing the air support for ground operations.

The RAND study is a public version of a classified study conducted in 2016 at the behest of the U.S. Navy which was ordered by Congress to examine cheaper options than the Ford-class carriers.

RAND looked at four options:

- The CVN-8X: A slightly stripped-down version of the 100000-ton Ford-class carriers. It would be powered by forty-year nuclear reactors that couldn't be replaced rather than the current twenty-five-year reactors on the Fords that can replaced to extend the life of the ship. It would also be equipped with three rather than four catapults.

- The CVN LX: A 70000-ton carrier closer to the old Forrestal-class ships of the 1950s the Navy's first ‚Äúsupercarriers.‚Äù They would be propelled by hybrid nuclear-conventional engines with one reactor instead of the two on the Nimitz- and Ford-class ships. It could still carry a large air wing and would still be more capable than the Nimitz carriers but it would slower and less survivable than the Fords nor could its air wing generate as many sorties.

- The CV LX: A 43000-ton conventionally-powered variant of the new America-class amphibious assault ships/helicopter carriers. Lacking catapults they could only carry twenty-five F-35B and only generate around fifty sorties a day. Without airborne early warning or electronic warfare aircraft it would ""require support from either a legacy carrier or land-based joint assets. It can operate in areas where air defense threats are not significant or in company with a battle force. The CV LX is not the capability of choice as a first on-scene responder because it lacks an integrated air wing and in particular lacks AEW and EA [airborne early warning and electronic attack].‚Äù

- The CV EX: A small 20000-ton baby carrier that would be conventionally powered and could only accommodate six to ten short take-off aircraft similar to the Italian carrier Cavour. The CV EX would be the cheapest option at $2.5 billion a vessel but RAND estimates that four CV LX carriers would be needed to generate the same capability as a single Ford-class ship. ‚ÄúThe CV EX has all the limitations of the CV LX with a much smaller flight deck fuel and magazine capacity and would therefore have to be used either as a responder to low-level contingencies or in conjunction with a legacy CVN‚Äù RAND concludes.

RAND was careful not to endorse a particular option. But the report makes clear that less capability is the price tag for lower shipbuilding costs. For example to launch conventional fixed-wing aircraft such as the F-35C a carrier must be large enough to have space for catapults and arresting gear. A smaller carrier could launch short take-off F-35Bs and helicopters but then it wouldn't be able to launch E-2 radar aircraft or EA-18 electronic warfare planes.

In turn carriers that have less capabilities would affect how the U.S. wages war such as relying on carrier-based air support when operating far from U.S. airfields and land-based aircraft. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that getting what‚Äôs in the Ford-class capability requires Ford-class investment‚Äù Brad Martin a retired Navy captain and one of the RAND researchers who wrote the study told TNI. ‚ÄúThe alternatives are offered as less costly but we are clear that there is diminishment in capability that Navy would need to evaluate. Some losses of capability might not be critical‚Äîa lower sortie generation rate for example‚Äîbut others might be much more so.‚Äù

Opting for either of the large nuclear carriers described by RAND probably wouldn't result in too drastic a change for the Navy. Not so for the two smaller conventionally-powered carriers. ‚ÄúThe conventionally-powered alternatives we looked at‚Äîthe two smallest variants‚Äîwould if selected as replacements for the Nimitz class as these ships reach service life significantly impact Navy operational concepts‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúThis is primarily because they lack the ability to support an integrated air wing. They could generate some portion of the strike and defensive counter air sorties required in campaign plans but they would have to rely on some off-ship alternative for other capabilities (airborne early warning and C2 in particular) now provided organically.‚Äù

So what's the best option? There isn't one. Either the Navy ends with large carriers that aren't that much different than a Ford or small carriers with radically less capabilities.

Our outdoors columnist explains what happened and why 'gypsy moth' term is out

I had hoped to move this week‚Äôs topic along from yet another tirade about invasive species but woe found some really interesting factoids about those fuzzy-wuzzy caterpillars the gypsy moths.

If the trees in your neighbourhood are as defoliated as mine I‚Äôm hoping this information will be worthy of your attention.

First up a discussion about the name change of these unwanted tree marauders as it has become politically and biologically incorrect to call them ‚Äúgypsy‚Äù moths; the new name is LDD. I know I know ‚Äúsay what?‚Äù

The label ‚Äògypsy‚Äô has historically been slapped upon a certain tribe of people for the past 1500 years. This group which seems to have originated in northern India are a sect that does not believe in land ownership.

While they have many rules within and have a hierarchy of order they feel that they are simply part of the larger natural world and therefore do not recognize political municipal or social boundaries.

They called themselves Romani or Roma (not to be confused with Romans) and led a very nomadic lifestyle as they roamed across Europe. As they travelled about in caravans they simply took what they needed from wherever they happened to be.

This attitude did not sit well with the locals who saw land and possession ownership in a different light so a nasty nick-name was devised: gypsy. As with most nasty nicknames it was wrongfully devised as the locals felt these wanderers were originally from Egypt and hence the slurred phonetics.

The Romani are now considered one of the largest minorities (nice oxymoron) and are found across the planet. They must have a good PR person for as the gypsy moth plague increased and became mainstream news suddenly a push was felt to re-name the insects away from this culturally offensive slur. And thus LDD is their new identifier.

LDD stands for Lymantria disper disper the scientific name for gypsy moth er I mean this particular insect species. I have to admit writing LDD in my field notes is much easier than the longer common name. However when I say it out loud I will be referring to them as ‚ÄúEl Dee-dee‚Äù and will perhaps use an exotic accent.

Okay on to science. If you have been combating these critters or even just taking close notes of their behaviours you will have seen in the past week or so that they all suddenly just up and died their corpses hanging on tree trunks like some gruesome warding off of evil spirits.

There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of dead caterpillars on each of the red oaks on our farm. What‚Äôs up with that?

A bit of research has revealed that a virus and a fungus have collectively come to our aid. If you can stomach it look closely at these dead caterpillars‚Ä¶ some will be hanging head down while others are bent in a downwards V-shape. Our trees sport both positions which is good news.

The V-shaped LDD carcasses have been killed by the nuclear polyhedrosis virus or NPV. The head-down LDDs have succumbed to Entomophaga maimaiga a type of fungus with no cute short form to its name.

NPV is a natural virus that stays dormant in the soil waiting for two things: rain and a mature moth caterpillar to come crawling by. As LDD rests in the grasses during the daylight hours it picks up the virus after a rainfall has released it from the soil.

The virus particles are carried upwards to the leaves where the caterpillars eventually eat it. This is when things get nasty for the caterpillar as the virus is released in the gut and then totally disrupts the digestive system.

Symptoms are discoloration (skin turns brown) stress (regurgitation of gut contents) lethargy (refusal to eat slow movement) and finally decomposition (liquefication).

As the caterpillar poops and later liquefies the virus is released into the air to infect other nearby LDD. Within a few days the entire population is killed as there is a 100% mortality rate.

Can we humans get NPV? Yes and no. Yes the airborne virus particles can be inhaled by other creatures like us but the virus only activates within an alkaline digestive system such as is found with moth caterpillars. Lucky for us our digestive system is acid-based and the virus simply passes through us.

The fungus with the fancy name is also a mortality factor. It was deliberately introduced to south-west United States from Japan in 1910 and 1911 as an insect control but did not spread. However in 1989 it suddenly appeared in the north-east States and has spread rapidly. Scientists are still scratching their heads as to how this happened.

LDD caterpillars go through five growth spurts called instars each stage allowing for the shedding of skin and new formation of armaments. This fungus only attacks the last instar stage so we did not see it until the caterpillars were just about mature enough to form their cocoons.

Caterpillars with E. maimaiga fungus die hanging head down with bodily fluids dripping forth. The fungus spreads via this liquid dispersal and also as the body falls to the ground for final decomposition.

Apparently the fungus can be carried to the cocoons the adult moths and the egg cases. So here‚Äôs hoping this LDD epizootic event will be less intense next year. (Epizootic is the equivalent term for an insect plague as to our mammalian pandemic.)

The rains came late this year and the caterpillars had to mature anyway so perhaps the saying ‚Äúbetter late than never‚Äù will apply here. It will be very interesting to see next June how great the impact has been on the local LDD population.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpjb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2xqYzA1NTE2ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Lane Martin Obituary - Journal and Courier,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

Robert Lane Martin

Olive Branch - Robert Lane Martin 70 of Olive Branch MS passed away Thursday July 8 2021. There will be a Celebration of Life service in Lafayette Indiana at a later date.

Looking more closely I saw it was a hummingbird ‚Äì and as I watched still longer and got a better view I realized I was not observing a hummingbird at all but rather a Nessus Sphinx moth a large daytime moth that looks and acts like a hummingbird. The moth has propellerlike wings and proportions similar to those of a hummingbird. It also has a short birdlike tail.

This moth most often observed in early summer has two distinct bands across its chocolate-and-cinnamon-colored abdomen. They are found as far north as Maine and southern Canada and as far south as Florida and in more southern regions there are two broods of caterpillars per season; in our region moths lay eggs only once per season from April to July. Sphinx moths are not endangered but they become less common the farther north you go.

Adults sip nectar from lilacs geraniums phlox and other flowers. The caterpillars prefer cayenne peppers and plants in the grape family.

Caterpillars

Sphinx moth caterpillars are called hornworms because they have a pointy ‚Äúhorn‚Äù on their rear end. When alarmed they raise up their head. This posture reminded early observers of a sphinx statue like the Great Sphinx of Giza in Egypt today. Although tomato hornworms are garden pests most hornworms such as the Nessus Sphinx hornworms do not cause much damage to plants.

History

In 1862 when Charles Darwin was studying orchids he received specimens of a type of orchid found in Madagascar with an extremely long tubelike nectar-containing flower. Darwin speculated that the orchid was pollinated by a sphinx moth with a mouthpart as long as the flower. It took until 1903 to prove Darwin right but eventually a sphinx moth with a footlong proboscis was observed pollinating this orchid.

Yes that‚Äôs right: Sphinx moths have an extremely long proboscis a tubelike extension that sucks up nectar or other liquids like a straw ‚Äì in fact adults do not eat ‚Äì and can extend as much as 3¬Ω times their body length. Some moths can reach nectar that even hummingbirds cannot. Moths curl their proboscis into a tight ball until needed; then they extend it quickly and accurately to drink.

Life cycle

Adult sphinx moths usually emerge in spring and deposit eggs on the undersides of leaves on their host plants. The larvae ‚Äì caterpillars ‚Äì munch on the host plants‚Äô green matter but damage to the plants is not usually extensive (except for damage caused by tomato and tobacco hornworms). The caterpillars develop for two to five weeks then move underground to pupate. There they form a hard brown cylinder from which adults emerge after two weeks.

(Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

Q Could you please tell me what weed this is? It has consumed all of my flower beds and even pops up in pots. Pulling it up only lasts until the next round can pop up and grow. Any suggestions for eradication short of a blowtorch? (Laughing out loud.)

A It appears to be mulberry weed ‚Äî a tenacious summer annual weed. It gets its common name because it resembles a seedling mulberry tree. The best way to differentiate the two is the hairiness of the stems and leaves. The weed is hairy while the mulberry tree is smooth. This plant starts to bloom at a young age with flowers in the joint where the branches are attached to the main stem. It is a prolific seed producer and new seeds can start germinating in as little as 30 days in warm conditions. Hoe pull or use a string trimmer to cut them down as soon as you see them. It could be controlled by contact herbicides but it is usually growing in close proximity to desirable plants which makes it difficult to spray. Don't ignore it because it will only set more seeds and then you will have even more weeds later in the season or next year.

Q What is this fungus growing all up and down our cypress tree trunk? Will it damage the health of the tree? The tree was planted in this island 13 years ago. This is the first year we have noticed this.

The lichen on this cypress does no harm to the tree. (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

A It is actually a type of lichen. Lichens are often thought to be harmful but they are not harming the tree in any way. You can find lichens growing on rocks and even building structures occasionally. Lichens look plant-like but are a different living organism comprised of an algae and a fungus growing together in a symbiotic way. The algae help with photosynthesis while the fungus aids in water and mineral absorption. When lichens find a good environment for growing with enough sunlight they do. You will find them growing on slow-growing trees or declining shrubs but they aren't causing the decline they are just taking advantage of the sunlight and the slower growth rate of the plant. Lichens come in many forms and colors. They are not harming your tree in any way so no control is necessary.

Q My bush in front of my house has been invaded by aliens! What is this creature? What should I do?

Colonized by the offspring of a parasitic wasp this hornworm caterpillar is not long for this world. For In the Garden. (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

A It would make for a great scary movie but what you have is a tomato hornworm that is dying because of a predator. The tomato hornworm is the green caterpillar while the white things are small cocoons from a parasitic wasp called a braconid wasp. Braconid wasps are small insects that look for tomato hornworms ‚Äî and hornworms are a plague on many a tomato grower. When the wasps find the hornworm the female wasps lay eggs under its skin. The eggs have hatched inside the hornworm and begun to feed on the caterpillar from the inside. They eat their way out of the caterpillar and spin the tiny white cocoons that you see on the caterpillar. As they mature tiny wasps will emerge from the cocoons and go in search of more hornworm caterpillars. The host caterpillar dies. Although it isn't a pretty picture don't destroy the caterpillar or the cocoons. You want more braconid wasps as they are beneficial insects.

Q My aucuba bushes which have always flourished in the shade on the east side of my house are suddenly developing black leaves and seem to be dying. Is there anything I can do to save them?

Direct sunlight can blacken the leaves of aucuba. (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

A Did the area that the aucuba is in recently get more sunlight? Aucuba shrubs thrive in shade but will turn black from direct sun exposure. If sunlight hasn't changed the trouble could be a root rot. Is the soil well drained? If you suspect a disease take a sample of the leaves plus some soil containing roots to your local county extension office for a disease diagnosis.

Q When a tree service was here yesterday to cut a dead limb off another tree one of the workers looked at my huge sycamore tree and told me it was dying and needed to be taken down. He flaked off a section of bark where ants began to swarm out and it also has a cavity where it branches into two large trunks. It leans toward my house and would be a disaster if it fell taking out probably most of my house because of its size. When I asked how long he thought I had (it still leafs out and has green leaves now) he said maybe a year or two and when it no longer leafed out in the upper branches it would have to come down. Do you agree? Is there anything that can be done to save it?

Elderly sycamore trees are prone to dropping branches but a healthy one won't die suddenly. (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

A Sycamore trees are large trees and can be prone to dropping branches. If it is fully leafed out with no die-back I can't see an imminent death. Typically old established trees don't die overnight unless they are struck by lightning or have major injuries. If the tree has a hollow that collects water then it will eventually decay and the decay will spread. You may want to contact the Urban Forestry representative in your area.

Stock market crashes often occur without warning. For that reason investors should remain prepared for the next one. One of the best ways to do that is have a list of stocks to buy when the market starts melting down.

We asked three of our Motley Fool contributors what stocks they think investors should load up on during a market crash. They chose NextEra Energy (NEE 1.29%) Brookfield Infrastructure (BIP 0.49%) (BIPC 1.05%) and Caterpillar (CAT 2.03%). Here's why these topped their market-crash shopping list.

Buying opportunities don't come often

Reuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): There's one big problem with giant U.S. utility NextEra Energy: Its stock is rarely cheap. There are good reasons for this but if the market gets irrational and the company's stock dives investors should prepare ahead of time to jump aboard this dividend-growth investor's dream stock. Why?

For starters the company owns Florida Power & Light which operates the largest electric utility in its namesake state. Florida has been benefiting for years from people moving to its warm climate and low taxes. This business isn't a growth machine but it is a very solid foundation on which NextEra has built one of the world's largest wind and solar power businesses. And it has plans to keep expanding these green businesses with as much as 30 gigawatts of clean-energy construction on the drawing board to add to its current 26 gigawatts of capacity.

But the dividend is the real proof of how great a company NextEra is. The utility has increased its dividend annually for over 25 years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The annualized rate of increase over the past decade was a huge 10% a rate that NextEra believes it can match until at least 2022 (if not longer). That's a massive figure for a utility and helps explain why the dividend yield is a miserly 2.1% since income investors are generally willing to pay up for consistent dividend growth. However if the stock should tank with the market even those with a focus on yield over growth could end up with a buying opportunity.

Built for turbulent times

Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Infrastructure): Brookfield Infrastructure has a knack for taking advantage of market-related opportunities. For example when stocks crashed during the early days of the pandemic last year Brookfield went on a buying binge. It invested $450 million into shares of a handful of publicly traded infrastructure companies in hopes that this would lead to a larger-scale investment. The company would exit several of those investments a few months later realizing $40 million in profits.

Meanwhile it held on to its position in Canadian pipeline company Inter Pipeline (IPL) in hopes of striking a deal. While it's currently engaged in a bidding war with another suitor that fight has boosted the value of Brookfield's holdings. If it ends up losing Brookfield can still cash in on another highly successful investment.

Brookfield's ability to go on the offensive when others are shifting to defense has enabled it to make several needle-moving acquisitions over the years. Those deals have helped fuel accelerated growth as market conditions rebounded allowing the company to generate market-crushing returns over the long term.

While Brookfield's business thrives during crashes its stock price tends to follow the market lower. Because of that market meltdowns are a great time to load up on shares of Brookfield. That positions investors to cash in on the subsequent recovery as Brookfield's business accelerates usually driven in part by deals it secured during the downturn.

An offbeat Dividend Aristocrat to buy on dips

Neha Chamaria (Caterpillar): When the stock market crashes cyclical stocks almost always take deep dives as they typically reflect the health of economy. Opportunistic investors though would be smart to scoop up shares when the time is ripe because cyclical stocks are also quick to bounce back when the markets recover. This is especially true if the underlying companies have a timely growth opportunity ahead. Consider Caterpillar for instance.

As the world's largest construction and mining-equipment manufacturer and an important player in the energy and transportation sectors Caterpillar is a top economic bellwether. That explains why Caterpillar shares have almost always been battered during stock market crashes but have also outperformed once things turned around. If the market crashes any time in the near future there are two big reasons why you'd want to buy shares of Caterpillar.

First Caterpillar operates in a sector that's red-hot right now in terms of potential opportunities ahead and that sector is infrastructure. Caterpillar could be a big beneficiary from President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill. The amount of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts significantly impacts demand for Caterpillar's equipment so any uptick in infrastructure spending bodes well for the company regardless of what the stock market does.

Second Caterpillar's resilience even in torrid times is evident from its dividend history: Caterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat that recently increased its dividend for the 27th consecutive year meaning it rewarded shareholders with a higher payout even during historical stock market crashes like the one in 2008. So next time the stock market and Caterpillar shares tumble you'd still receive dividend checks in your mail and enjoy a high dividend yield while you await a recovery. Here are some statistics for you to ponder: Caterpillar's dividend yield -- which is hovering around 2% currently -- shot up to nearly 4% last year and topped 5% in mid-2016 when the markets tanked."

Idling the shut 52000-bpd FCC would be part of converting the refinery on the Houston Ship Channel to a simpler hydroskimming configuration the sources said.

The FCC was shut on June 1 by a malfunction that knocked the unit out of operation.

‚ÄúThey are investigating if it makes sense to repair the FCC‚Äù one of the sources said.

A decision on the FCC's future is expected this month the sources said.

In March Mark Nelson the company‚Äôs executive vice president of downstream and chemicals said Chevron was looking for ways to expand processing of light-tight oil it produces from the Permian oil field in Texas to supply retail locations along the Gulf of Mexico.

‚ÄúWe continue to test alternatives for capital-efficient ways to expand our light-tight oil processing capability‚Äù Nelson said during an investor day presentation in answer to an analyst‚Äôs question about the company‚Äôs plans for the Pasadena refinery.

‚ÄúWe're leaning towards a hydroskimming focus in that regard‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúAgain a capital-efficient approach because we're in search of high returns.‚Äù

On Friday Chevron spokesman Tyler Kruzich said the company continues ‚Äúto test those alternatives.‚Äù

A hydroskimming refinery usually has an atmospheric crude distillation unit a reformer and a hydrotreater.

Idling the FCC could lead to closure of 40% of the units at the refinery the sources said.

But for all the recent restaurant freebies and loyalty rewards Chipotle which is arguably the world's most recognized burrito chain reportedly over-promised and under-delivered this week on a promotion that was meant to drive COVID-19 vaccinations. Under condition of anonymity some Chipotle employees have spilled the pinto beans on what went south behind the scenes as they cite tears two-hour lines and what one location's manager said left her feet in a state that ""will never be the same.""

The Saddest Restaurant Closures in Your State

On Tuesday July 6 Chipotle attempted to do society a solid by offering a buy-one-get-one burrito deal to customers who approached the cash register at participating locations and used the phrase ""Friends BOGO."" Join us for a special in-restaurant BOGO on July 6th in support of National Month of Action for Vaccinations the Chipotle site read. Bring a friend and say ""Friends BOGO"" at the cashier to share real food made fresh everyday together.

Come in customers did by the dozens creating what some Chipotle locations saw turn into around-the-corner lines that lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. Business Insider spoke to Chipotle staff and managers from a few locations that took part in the promo and under condition of anonymity these Chipotle employees state that the chain really didn't have quite the right setups in place. One Iowa employee said they'd only learned about the promotion a few hours before it went into effect.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Elsewhere some Chipotle locations ran out of a small handful of ingredients during the BOGO while Business Insider reports that another tapped out on ""lettuce sour cream brown rice steak vegetables corn and guacamole."" (Sounds like if you dropped in for a tortilla you might have still been in luck.)

Meanwhile an employee at a Chipotle in Iowa said their computer system went down and employees endured berating from angry customers. One customer @gaiabug777 tweeted that they'd witnessed two employees crying over the scene of ""pure chaos."" Thanks for the bogo read the tweet directed to @chipotletweets but ‚Ä¶ seems like maybe this was really unfair to them. I love Chipotle but I'm gonna give it up just to give those poor workers a break. Do better.

A Midwestern Chipotle manager said the pandemonium was affecting operations in the kitchen too. He revealed to Business Insider ""that he and his employees were forced to take shortcuts in food prep just to keep up with the lines skipping seasonings like lime juice and salt. 'I've never seen food served at a lower standard at my store' he said.""

Another Chipotle manager based in California said indeed the situation took its toll across the board. ""I've worked doubles before but not like this. My feet will never be the same."" She added ""Everyone on the shift [was] fighting and angry.""

In response to what went down Chief Corporate Affairs and Food Safety Officer Laurie Schalow reportedly stated to Business Insider: ""It was a very successful day and we were proud to participate in the National Month of Action to encourage vaccinations.""

Don‚Äôt be surprised to spend an extra $6K on food this year

Inflation is taking the food industry by storm. Since the pandemic began grocery bills have shot up 8%-9%. Recently meat corn soybeans and wheat have reached record highs. Casual and fast-food restaurants are raising menu prices at the fastest rate in history. Rising wages and higher transportation costs are adding further inflationary pressure. With these factors in mind consumers should be prepared to increase their food budgets.

Relative to 2019 the average consumer can expect to pay 10% or more for food this year. Assuming each meal costs $15/person for a family of four the total increase amounts to >$6570 a year. Let‚Äôs take a closer look.

Higher prices for staple foods and meats

With higher wheat/grain prices throughout this year and possibly next year costs for staple foods like bread pasta rice potatoes prices are rising at a faster rate than other foods. Meat prices are also higher than 2019 especially pork and chicken. This year seafood prices haven‚Äôt increased as fast as red meat or chicken. Relative to 2020 panic shopping frenzy canned-food prices are coming down toward pre-pandemic levels. Vegetable prices also have not changed much. Avocado prices are surprisingly down >9%.

Casual and fast-food restaurants are raising prices faster than full-service restaurants

Limited-service meals which include take-out and delivery were up 6.2% in 2020 a record. This year we can only expect menu prices to climb even higher. Most recently Chipotle Mexican Grill raised its prices by 4%. Several other popular chains also hiked prices by 3%-4%. McDonald‚Äôs has not made any announcements yet. We can only expect that rising costs will pressure many restaurants to follow suit.

To retain cost-conscious customers restaurants are exploring different tactics. MoneyTalksNews listed 24 restaurant chains that offer seniors discounts. Coupons are also coming back in a big way but with a paperless focus. Digital coupons have overtaken print circulars. Load-to-card coupon redemption increased 27% last year.

Maybe summer is not the time to worry about rising food costs. ‚ÄúWe are going to be paying higher prices in restaurants‚Äù David Henkes senior principal at industry researcher Technomic told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúPart of the calculus right now is there‚Äôs probably some appetite of consumers to pay whatever because they haven‚Äôt been out for a while.‚Äù

As bars and eateries struggle to staff up several large restaurant chains have announced higher pay to entice workers to apply and stick around. Eating and drinking places added more than half a million jobs from March through June according to the Department of Labor. But the unemployment rate for the industry remains elevated hitting 10% in June up from 9% the previous month. And warmer weather typically ushers in higher demand for restaurant meals anyway putting more pressure on employers to add to their workforce. Enrique Lopezlira the director of the low-wage work program at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center said that the lack of access to child care and safety concerns are keeping many workers out of the labor force particularly women. ""Raising wages is good and it will attract workers but we're also seeing in the data higher rates of quitting in these jobs"" Lopezlira said. ""Long term I think these employers need to improve the overall quality of these jobs."" Some retailers and restaurants have tried to take steps to do just that. Walmart and Target  for example are opting to keep their stores closed on Thanksgiving so employees can stay home for the holiday. Best Buy improved backup child-care benefits and expanded access to caregiver pay benefits. However most companies are sticking to just raising wages or offering bonuses for now. As of June average hourly earnings are up 0.3% across all industries compared with the month prior and 3.6% compared with the same time last year according to the Department of Labor. On the flip side rising labor costs in recent years have also motivated restaurants chains to invest in automation technology like self-order kiosks or artificial intelligence software that can take a drive-thru order. Here are the restaurant chains that have hiked hourly pay this year or started offering bonuses:

Papa John's

Papa John's announced on Thursday new hiring referral and retention bonuses for restaurant workers at its company-owned locations. Corporate workers will earn an extra $50 for every new worker they bring into the fold while the new hires will also earn $50. Existing employees are also eligible for up to $400 in appreciation bonuses paid in increments for the rest of the year.

The pizza chain plans to spend about $2.5 million on the initiative for the remainder of 2021. While it's a hefty price tag giving out bonuses allows the company to give its workers more money temporarily in place of permanently changing its wage structure just in case finding employees is easier next year. About 14000 Papa John's workers will be eligible for the new bonus program. Roughly 18% of the chain's North American restaurants are operated by the company rather than franchisees.

McDonald's said in May that workers at company-owned restaurants will see pay raises of an average of 10% over the next several months. Entry-level employees will make $11 to $17 per hour and shift managers will make $15 to $20 an hour based on location. By 2024 ‚Äî roughly a dozen years after the chain's workers started the Fight for $15 ‚Äî it plans to pay employees of company-owned restaurants $15 an hour. ""I think what's happening is that you're seeing that a great economy is very helpful to growing employee wages and I think many of the changes that are happening from a wage standpoint are happening because of companies like McDonald's needing to compete for the best talent"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said at CNBC's Evolve Conference in June. However only about 5% of the company's U.S. restaurants are company owned. That means for the remaining 95% of locations in its home market wages are determined by the franchisee that operates the restaurant.

Darden Restaurants

In late March the Olive Garden parent announced that every hourly worker across its portfolio of restaurants will earn at least $10 an hour including tip income. In January hourly wages will go up to $11 and the following January they'll rise to $12 an hour. But Darden Restaurants executives have said that their greater focus is keeping the tipped wage despite President Joe Biden's pledge to eliminate it. In 43 states employers can pay their workers as little as $2.13 an hour as long as that hourly wage and tips add up to the locality's pay floor. If Biden succeeds employers would have to pay every worker at least $15 an hour even if they receive tips.

Chipotle Mexican Grill

Chipotle Mexican Grill is paying its workers an average of $15 an hour after rolling out higher pay across its footprint in May and June. Starting wages for hourly crew members are between $11 and $18. The company also introduced referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers to help it meet its recruitment goal of 20000 new employees for the summer. Executives said that customers will be paying about 4% more for their burritos and tacos as a result of the wage hike.

Texas Roadhouse

Texas Roadhouse executives said on the company's latest earnings call in April that the biggest challenge they're facing is staffing. ""It's never been more difficult to attract and retain employees. As a result we are also seeing wage rate increases to stay competitive"" CEO Gerald Morgan told analysts then. To offset the costs of paying employees more the company raised menu prices by 1.75%.

BurgerFi

BurgerFi recently rolled out a referral program for managers and assistant managers. ""We definitely have to compete in the marketplace for talent"" CEO Julio Ramirez said in an interview. ""But I think we have some unique advantages as well because of our situation as a growth brand and our cool image.""

watch now

The burger chain went public in December through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Ramirez said that the company is offering restricted stock units to restaurant managers and assistant managers as well. ""If we grow and our stock price grows everyone wins"" he said.

The Asian-inspired restaurant chain is offering referral bonuses. Additionally P.F. Chang's is taking steps to improve the work-life balance for its workforce. CEO Damola Adamolekun told Bloomberg that the company gave its employees the Fourth of July off so they could spend the day relaxing and enjoying the holiday. Despite these efforts the privately held company still has about 2000 unfilled job openings across its footprint.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvY2hpcG90bGUtYWNjZXB0aW5nLXRpa3Rvay1yZXN1bWVzLXRvLWZpbGwtMTUwMDAtam9icy1uYXRpb253aWRlL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvY2hpcG90bGUtYWNjZXB0aW5nLXRpa3Rvay1yZXN1bWVzLXRvLWZpbGwtMTUwMDAtam9icy1uYXRpb253aWRlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chipotle accepting TikTok resumes to fill 15000 jobs nationwide,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wkbn.com/news/national-world/chipotle-accepting-tiktok-resumes-to-fill-15000-jobs-nationwide/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvY2hpcG90bGUtYWNjZXB0aW5nLXRpa3Rvay1yZXN1bWVzLXRvLWZpbGwtMTUwMDAtam9icy1uYXRpb253aWRlL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvY2hpcG90bGUtYWNjZXB0aW5nLXRpa3Rvay1yZXN1bWVzLXRvLWZpbGwtMTUwMDAtam9icy1uYXRpb253aWRlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Trump has been suspended from the platforms since January when his followers violently stormed the Capitol building trying to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential win.

The companies cited concerns that Trump would incite further violence and have kept him locked out.

All three declined comment on Wednesday.

'We're asking the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies' illegal shameful censorship of the American people' Trump said of the filings.

'We're going to hold big tech very accountable.'

Bill McDermott CEO of ServiceNow arrived on Tuesday for the annual conference as did Ray Snead and investment banker Dan Pozen.

An estimate based on the latest available figures puts the total wealth of those known to be in attendance and those rumored to be attending at $588 billion.

The estimated net worth of those already in attendance is about $340 billion.

Other influential names on the guest list are Bezos' successor Andy Jassy who is set to take over the reins at Amazon.

Reclaim The Net web site also reported that WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar is among the invitees from the world of media along with Diane Sawyer Cooper and Van Jones and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.

Former US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Council of Foreign Relations President Richard Haass are among the public officials on the invite list Reclaim The Net reported.

Those attending investment bank Allen & Co.'s annual conference will need to have been vaccinated and show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.

Over the holiday weekend private jets belonging to business leaders began arriving at the local airport and taking up space on the tarmac at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey as they parked up for the week.

From there guests were chauffeured through 15 miles of lush rolling hills to the lodge where the conference takes place.

Rival chief executives including Amazon's Jeff Bezos along with his successor Andy Jassy Comcast Corp.'s Brian Roberts are all said to be on the guest list.

Attendees in 2019 included Ron Meyer (left) then-Vice Chairman of NBCUniversal and David M. Zaslav (right) CEO of Discovery

PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman (left) and McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook (right) both attended in 2019

Apple CEO Tim Cook and the company's senior vice president of internet software Eddy Cue are seen at the event in 2018

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

'There's a lot of assets out there that have good IP that will probably get new homes' he said.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

Attendees at the last conference in 2019 included Facebook bosses Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg; Disney's Bob Iger; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki; Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch who is the CEO of Fox Corporation; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman; Instagram COO Marne Levine; McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook and billionaire media executive Shari Redstone.

The conference began in 1982 and in its early days founder Herbert Allen - who co-founded Allen & Company with brother Charles - had to beg invitees to come.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

‚ÄúMy primary orientation ‚Äî that is my focus passion and calling as a woman ‚Äî is toward motherhood‚Äù Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. ‚ÄúThat is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.‚Äù

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

‚ÄúI had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working‚Äù Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. ‚ÄúIt was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.‚Äù

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson‚Äôs top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church‚Äôs Instagram post quoting Johnson‚Äôs talk calling the Relief Society president a ‚Äúwonderful role model.‚Äù

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

‚ÄúApproaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children ‚Äî all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by‚Äù wrote @anniemangelson. ‚ÄúToo many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‚Äòfollowed the prophet.‚Äô We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.‚Äù

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson‚Äôs own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this message and example‚Äù said user @jsmileybug. ‚ÄúHowever I‚Äôm 25 and this is the very first time I‚Äôve EVER heard a church leader suggest it‚Äôs acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.‚Äù

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard ‚Äî and not heeded.

‚ÄúNo career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother ‚Äî cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one‚Äôs precious husband and children‚Äù Benson quoted Kimball as saying. ‚ÄúCome home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have ‚Äî decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

‚ÄúI used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I‚Äôd cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWhere were my accolades for having done what‚Äù Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

‚ÄúThe women‚Äù she said ‚Äúwho went against the prophet‚Äôs very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.‚Äù

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sobbing reading this‚Äù commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns ‚Äúfor younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn‚Äôt want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‚Äòright thing to do‚Äô

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

‚ÄúThis would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology‚Äù wrote @ariabethards ‚Äúto all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.‚Äù

Others meanwhile didn‚Äôt seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to feel so confused‚Äù wrote @jameeandelin. ‚ÄúOn the one hand I‚Äôm so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. ‚Ä¶But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It‚Äôs so unfair. I don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson‚Äôs example and carving one‚Äôs own path.

‚ÄúLet this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren‚Äù @edge_of_inside wrote ‚Äústand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.‚Äù

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson‚Äôs first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated ‚ÄúThere is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.‚Äù

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis‚Äô description.

Trinity Church Wall Street a church located in New York City has given Seattle‚Äôs St. Mark's $250000 in grants in the past year. It's to help St. Mark's turn St. Nicholas School right next to the church into affordable housing units.



""The cost of living and the cost of housing has skyrocketed in the last several decades the last several years"" said Thomason. ""We want to make sure that we are responding to those who have been priced out or who were never even allowed to be in this part of the city because of their race or their economic status"" said Thomason.



St. Mark's is looking into two options: tearing down the school and starting from scratch or converting and expanding part of the school into 119 housing units ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments.



""This is not one of our missional projects that is addressing the unhoused people in Seattle we have other ministries doing that"" said Thomason.



There's still a lot of work to be done before this project breaks ground. The church is hoping to select a developer this summer and start construction in 2027.



""There are so many resources bringing to the focus of addressing this crisis and we are just trying to be faithful in our one part of that"" said Thomason."

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year for long enough its investors will usually take their share of those losses.

In contrast to all that I prefer to spend time on companies like Cigna (NYSE:CI) which has not only revenues but also profits. Even if the shares are fully valued today most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. In comparison loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed.

View our latest analysis for Cigna

Cigna's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.

The market is a voting machine in the short term but a weighing machine in the long term so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Cigna has managed to grow EPS by 32% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Cigna's revenue this year is revenue from operations so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Cigna's EBIT margins were flat over the last year revenue grew by a solid 5.8% to US$163b. That's a real positive.

In the chart below you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue over time. To see the actual numbers click on the chart.

Are Cigna Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Like that fresh smell in the air when the rains are coming insider buying fills me with optimistic anticipation. Because oftentimes the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. Of course we can never be sure what insiders are thinking we can only judge their actions.

Cigna top brass are certainly in sync not having sold any shares over the last year. But the bigger deal is that the President & COO of Evernorth Eric Palmer paid US$169k to buy shares at an average price of US$169.

The good news alongside the insider buying for Cigna bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Notably they have an enormous stake in the company worth US$278m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging if I owned shares since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success or failure with the stock.

Is Cigna Worth Keeping An Eye On?

Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about Cigna's strong EPS growth. Better still insiders own a large chunk of the company and one has even been buying more shares. So it's fair to say I think this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for Cigna that you need to take into consideration.

As a growth investor I do like to see insider buying. But Cigna isn't the only one. You can see a a free list of them here.

Kisah cinta McGregor dengan Dee Devlin ramai lagi.

Kisah Conor McGregor dan Dee Devlin memang cukup lama jadi pembahasan. Sebab Dee Devlin dianggap sebagai sosok yang mendorong kerja keras McGregor.

Mereka menjalin cinta sejak 2008 saat awal Conor McGregor berkarier sebagai petarung MMA profesional. Keduanya sama-sama berasal dari Dublin Irlandia.

Conor McGregor dan Dee Devlin disebut berjumpa pertama kali dalam sebuah pesta. Dari pertemuan itu keduanya langsung jatuh cinta. Sekarang hampir satu dekade kemudian pasangan itu memiliki dua anak bersama - Conor Jr dan Croia.

""Dia sudah berlatih ketika saya bertemu dengannya jadi saya sangat mengagumi dedikasinya untuk itu"" kata Dee Devlin kepada VIP pada 2013.

Saat itu juga McGregor punya sebuah mimpi. Salah satunya adalah membangun keluarga dan masa depan cerah bersama Dee Devlin.

""Saya melakukan ini untuk mengamankan masa depan keluarga saya dan masa depan Dee. Suatu hari saya bersama Dee ingin bersantai di pantai dan tidak mengkhawatirkan masa depan. Itulah mengapa saya melakukan ini. Saya ingin aman secara finansial pada saat saya memiliki anak. Ketika itu terjadi saya ingin siap"" timpal McGregor.

Hampir setelah pertarungan McGregor juga mengucapkan syukur atas dukungan yang selalu didapatnya dari Dee Devlin. Contohnya ketika ia menang atas Chad Mendes pada 2015 yang membuatnya dinobatkan sebagai juara kelas bulu UFC.

""Pacar saya telah ada sejak awal. Dia telah membantu saya sepanjang karier ini. Jika bukan karena dia saya mungkin tidak akan berada di tempat saya hari ini"" katanya.

""Pacar saya bekerja sangat keras selama bertahun-tahun dan terjebak karena saya yang pada dasarnya tidak punya apa-apa. Saya hanya bermimpi seperti yang saya katakan padanya. Bagi saya untuk dapat membawanya keluar dari pekerjaan memberikan semua yang dia inginkan dan berkeliling dunia dengannya membuat saya bangga. Itu membuat saya terus maju. Kami sudah bersama sejak lama. Dia telah melalui semua itu dengan saya.""

Tak cuma saat ketika McGregor menang Dee Devlin juga disebutnya jadi orang pertama yang selalu datang kala dirinya mengalami kekalahan. Seperti saat kekalahan pertamanya lawan Nate Diaz pada 2016.

""Semuanya baik-baik saja semuanya baik-baik saja"" kata McGregor menirukan ucapan Dee Devlin.

Jika melihat sosok Conor McGregor di atas ring tentu saja banyak kontroversinya. Ia dikenal sebagai petarung yang angkuh. Tapi di Instagram Dee Devlin image McGregor sepertinya tak berubah ia adalah sosok yang begitu mencintai keluarganya. Bahkan tak jarang momong sang anak sambil telanjang dada.

The Siemering family wanted to guarantee future generations could have the kind of lake experience they have cherished. So instead of selling their 116 acres of lakeshore forest for development they turned to the Northern Waters Land Trust. The family sold it to the conservation nonprofit which in turn conveyed it to Cass County ensuring the forest will never be altered or built on and will be open to the public to use.

The forest is thick with undisturbed birch aspen basswood balsam and spruce.

""Probably the greatest thing now is this place that we have cherished and brought so many memories ‚Ä¶ this one slice is now being protected"" said Cheryl Siemering 64 of Plymouth. ""It just continues to live on then.""

The sale is one piece in the puzzle of efforts to save the state's special cold-water lakes by protecting the forest around them. The lakes and their critical fish habitat are at serious risk under relentless pressure from the spread of row-crop farming farther north commercial development landowners clearing lakefront property nutrient runoff from farm and lawn chemicals and climate change's rising temperatures.

Most Minnesotans probably don't realize how unique their cold-water lakes are said Kathy DonCarlos land conservation lead for the Northern Waters Land Trust. They only exist in the northern tier states she said. Illinois for example doesn't have them.

The Wabedo Lake purchase is particularly exciting the trust said because it's a large parcel. Plus while people are still selling land for conservation land donations have slowed with the tax code changes under the Trump administration that reduced deductibility for all charitable contributions.

Trust conservation specialist Annie Knight called such land sales a ""concrete and permanent"" way private landowners can take charge of preserving nature for future generations.

""Restoration costs way more money than simply protecting it in the first place"" Knight said.

The focus of the Walker-based Northern Waters Land Trust is preserving forestland around strategic lakes in Cass Crow Wing Hubbard and Aitkin counties. Since the 1990s it has bought or received 1481 acres. Working with the Minnesota Land Trust it has arranged conservation easements on an additional 3197 acres. With such easements landowners agree not to further develop the land.

Wabedo Lake in Cass County is one of 620 official tullibee lakes in Minnesota that provide habitat for the fish also known as cisco whose populations have been crashing in the Midwest. The trust is focusing on protecting land on tullibee lakes and lakes with broader outstanding biological significance.

Tullibee are small silvery fish that thrive in well-oxygenated cold water. A type of herring they're a critical forage fish for prized game fish such as walleye and muskie so densely nutritious that they're called nature's Snickers for fish.

Fish-to-forest tipping point

The DNR relies on a calculated fish-to-forest tipping point ‚Äî if at least 75% of a lake's watershed is protected with forest cover the lakes there can sustain themselves ‚Äî and their cold-water fish. Forests are a perfect water conditioner a sponge that slows rain soaks it up prevents erosion filters water and cools it.

The Siemerings did not know all this at first of course. Cheryl Siemering and her brother John 73 who lives outside Pittsburgh just knew it was time to let go of the treasured lake home.

The Wabedo Lake property had been in the extended family since the 1940s. Their mother's cousin ran Blakemen's Resort there. Then their parents Robert and Alice bought it in the 1970s and changed the name to the Loon's Nest Resort which they ran for 20 years. They retired there taking down all but one of the five small cabins. Robert died while fishing on the lake in 2003. Alice died in February at 98.

""It was everything to her"" Cheryl Siemering said of the lake. ""She loved it so.""

But the family had scattered and the property was becoming too much to manage.

John Siemering said Pat Moran of Moran Realty in nearby Longville first told them about the Northern Waters Land Trust's preservation effort in 2017 after seeing the property.

""There were no docks. It was exactly the way it was made by God or whoever"" Moran said. ""It was a big beautiful chunk on the lake.""

Moran said his father worked for years as a DNR forestry supervisor and coached him about seeing the highest and best use for land.

""That rules"" Moran said. ""I've seen these pieces that I just think: 'You know I don't need to develop that.' ""

They called Cass County Land Commissioner Kirk Titus who also drove out for a look. He said he saw more than 800 feet of undisturbed shoreline on land abutting 1800 acres of public forest land the county already maintains.

Titus said it fit perfectly with the county's goal of conserving land to protect wildlife habitat and public access for recreation: hunting fishing hiking berry picking and wildlife viewing. The conservation deal also had strong support from the Wabedo-Little Boy-Cooper-Rice Lakes Association which put money toward the purchase as did the Hugh C. Becker Foundation.

""I think I'm going to call it Siemering Woods"" Titus said.

Cheryl Siemering said that as they learned more about how conserving forest around a lake supports the lake's overall health ""we were [in] hook line and sinker.""

'Thrilled that we did it'

The Northern Waters Land Trust had the 116-acre parcel appraised and bought it for an undisclosed sum with grant money from the sales-tax-based Outdoor Heritage Fund. The fund is one created by the state's Clean Water Land and Legacy Amendment.

The Siemerings carved out a small parcel with their mother's house on it for a separate sale. A couple planning to retire there just bought that piece Cheryl said.

It is their first summer not being at the lake John said. But they know the conservation sale was the right move ‚Äî and they said they are grateful their mother lived to see it completed.

About 10 days before she passed John said she said out of the blue: "" 'You know John whatever happens I'm so happy we did what we did with the property.' ""

""She said the same thing to my sister"" he said. ""She was thrilled that we did it.""

A family that lived on Wabedo Lake in Cass County for decades decided to sell their more than 100 acres of undeveloped woods and shoreline to the Northern Waters Land Trust so it remains undeveloped.

""More people should know about this.""

Crow Island's new owner has big plans

Crow Island once described in the late 1800s as place where squatters built their lean-tos and shanties has a new owner who is working to convert the island into an Airbnb.

Al Santos bought the island about two years ago and while he isn‚Äôt making any drastic changes to the main house he has spruced up the landscaping and the nautical artistic pieces and sculptures that dot the grounds.

The island had been owned since 1979 by Carl Pimentel the New Bedford entrepreneur and restaurateur who owned the Smuggler‚Äôs Den nightclub in New Bedford‚Äôs South End. Pimentel turned the property into his own private paradise and kept it that way until his death in August 2018.

Ever notice that fork in the road?

There‚Äôs a larger-than-life carving of an actual fork placed at the River and Old Harbor Roads split .in Westport and it's the brainchild of Tom Schmitt who constructed the fork back in 2010 after the idea came to him when he was at a local sawmill to get wood for a different project.

The project kept him busy as he pieced the fork together using a real fork for scale.

The fork gets dressed up for the holidays. It dons a heart for Valentine‚Äôs Day a Santa had on Christmas and a hot dog on the Fourth of July.

He cited a major health issue as one reason for bowing out of the job he‚Äôd held for more than a decade during a period of unprecedented regional growth.

Now serving as senior vice president business development for First Security Bank in Jonesboro Perrin still has an eye on how the city develops particularly from his private sector position.

An Arkansas State University alumni Perrin has three additional banking-related degrees from Southern Methodist University Northwestern University and Louisiana State University. He previously worked for Citizens Bank Jonesboro First National Bank Batesville and served as president at both First State Bank Newport and Mercantile Bank Jonesboro. He also has consulted a broad range of firms on financial matters through a private management company.

Perrin visited with Talk Business & Politics Editor-in-Chief Roby Brock to discuss his transition out of the public limelight his developing role at the bank and what he sees happening in the region‚Äôs marketplace.

TB&P: For starters how is your health?

Harold Perrin: I just went to the doctor today and was scoped and got a negative bill from the local urologist here in town who coordinates with MD Anderson [Cancer Center]. So I‚Äôm very blessed very pleased that so far everything is going good.

TB&P: You‚Äôve been out of office for about six months now. What it‚Äôs like to not be the mayor of Jonesboro? How‚Äôs the transition back to the private sector going?

Perrin: I was only retired for about two weeks and I‚Äôd get some calls from various companies. Then good friends of mine Reynie Rutledge and Brad Edwards called me and we sat down and had two or three meetings. It‚Äôs just like coming back home really. When I had my own company First Security Bank was my client for 14 years. So I know a lot of people that are still here and I like the way Reynie operates his financial institutions.

I‚Äôm just really happy content and excited. My wife says that when I come home at night you don‚Äôt have to go to all those meetings like you used to. That‚Äôs the one thing I miss. I will tell you that I do miss being mayor a little bit. I still have the opportunity to visit with some of the department heads from time to time when I run into them at a restaurant or outside the bank.

But the key to both jobs require two things: relationships and partnerships. That‚Äôs really what we‚Äôre doing here at the bank. It is the same thing I did as mayor.

TB&P: What are you seeing in the marketplace right now as a loan officer as a person that‚Äôs involved in economic development. What‚Äôs hot right now?

Perrin: I would say two things are just absolutely going strong. Number one is housing. It seems like every council meeting they approve a complete subdivision. Right now you‚Äôve got several new subdivisions under construction.

The other thing very close to that is commercial as well as retail. When I say retail a lot of that is tied back to food. We‚Äôre getting a Chipotle‚Äôs Freddy‚Äôs has just opened up. We‚Äôre getting a lot of that here in town as well. So I would say housing restaurants and retail is your big thing.

But let me say this we just went through last year dedicating some of the largest projects for the hospitals. The tower at St. Bernards and the ICU rooms as well as NEA Baptist which is now under construction. They are building doctors‚Äô clinics away from the hospital because they need the space within the hospital.

TB&P: What do you think is missing? What are the ingredients that Jonesboro and Northeast Arkansas need more of?

Perrin: One I think the chamber [Jonesboro Chamber of Commerce] is now looking for additional land. We are pretty close to only a few hundred acres around 600. We‚Äôre going to need more than that.

We‚Äôve also got a master railroad expansion master plan. There‚Äôs work to get the funding for that. The other thing is that we‚Äôre working with the airport to look at the terminal. We‚Äôve got a good terminal now but I think the expansion of that we‚Äôre going to have to enlarge that.

In the area of employment I would like to see us concentrate on good high-tech jobs and industry in that area. That‚Äôs one of the goals of Jonesboro Unlimited when they raised the funds to do that. One of them was to look at high-tech companies. They go to trade shows et cetera and work in that area. They‚Äôre doing a good job. We hit our goals the first year which I think is great.

We‚Äôve been blessed as a city. I always said that when I cut a ribbon that it‚Äôs a great day in Jonesboro but it‚Äôs also a blessed day. I mean that sincerely and the fact that we always want to be pro-business. We‚Äôve got a lot of good things going. It just takes time to get it to completion. You‚Äôve just got to have a little patience and sometimes my patience is short.

We all work as a team and I think that‚Äôs the big key is that none of us is looking for credit. We‚Äôre looking to get whatever we need for Jonesboro for our people and it doesn‚Äôt make any difference whether you‚Äôre with the chamber the university the city or a financial institution. We‚Äôre going to get together work together and get it completed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHlzdGFyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2luczEyNDM3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norman Kay Connell Obituary - The Indianapolis Star,"Norman Kay Connell

It took a few years to get built but EastPoint at NE 23 and Rhode Island is complete and home to a dream list of tenants for any neglected neighborhood.

The project started with redevelopment of a boarded-up former truck stop and a decision by Centennial Health formerly known as Oklahoma City Clinic to anchor EastPoint with its headquarters and healthcare center. Next door area residents are enjoying a non-profit grocery operated by Homeland and featuring fresh produce from a nearby farm operated by Restore OKC.

The second phase of development tackled a worn-down retail strip across the street from the clinic and grocery. The transformed center is now home to a fitness center bar bookstore optometrist and offices with a pizzeria and coffee shop to open soon.

And in a unique twist aimed at preventing outside gentrification the Black-owned businesses opening in the retail strip are each offered an opportunity to include an equity stake in the building as part of their leases.

A national panel of judges with the Urban Land Institute toured the development in June. A documentary about EastPoint created by Stout Media and the project‚Äôs architects at Gardner Studio won the grand prize from the American Institute of Architects‚Äô annual national film challenge.

Seth Levine and Elizabeth MacBride also made the trek to NE 23 as they researched their book ‚ÄúThe New Builders: Face to Face with the TRUE Future of Business.‚Äù The authors say EastPoint was one of their first focuses as they sought to chronicle the diversity of minority entrepreneurs starting businesses at a rate that outpaces any other entrepreneurial group in the country.

‚ÄúEastPoint is quite innovative‚Äù Levine said. ‚ÄúIt solves problems of outside developers coming into neighborhoods who are well-intentioned but end up building projects that force residents out of their neighborhoods.‚Äù

MacBride said they were intrigued at the array of challenges overcome by the EastPoint team starting with the legacy of discriminatory investment and lending for both developers and business owners like Emmanuel Sosanya who now operates a fitness gym there.

‚ÄúThere is a ton of big money in the world to help communities like on the east side but not a lot of people who can figure out how to put that together‚Äù MacBride said. ‚ÄúHow do you fund a fitness gym in EastPoint? What he needs is a form of finance that helps him build wealth in his company. But what he needs is $5000 to $12000. There are banks that want to loan millions but not at the amount he needs.‚Äù

Faded community

Sandino Thompson grew up in northeast Oklahoma City. His parents Wayne and Melba Thompson were civic leaders on the east side with a long list of efforts to improve healthcare and improve prospects for Black youth. His grandmother Daisy Mitchell helped establish the Mary Mahoney Center.

‚ÄúMy grandmother‚Äôs house is around the corner‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúI grew up spending time here during the summers so I‚Äôm very familiar with 23rd Street.‚Äù

The area faded over time he said.

‚ÄúWhen we were growing up I‚Äôd be here in the summer and I‚Äôd walk on 23rd Street to go to the stores walk to the grocery and different businesses‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúBy the time I was in high school this wasn‚Äôt a place where you would walk anywhere on 23rd. It wasn‚Äôt that place anymore.‚Äù

But hope endured. Thompson grew up in a family of activists his parents always pushing for change and improvement. He was familiar with the starts and stops to rekindle the community and bring back economic development.

A lot of the discussions took place at the Ralph Ellison Library at NE 23 and Martin Luther King Avenue.

‚ÄúWhenever there were events like that how we could get things going and see revitalization in this part of town they would be held at the library‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people I knew who owned property that fell into disrepair. They didn‚Äôt know what to do with it and often they didn‚Äôt have the means to follow through with the ideas they had.‚Äù

Interstate 235 is the dividing line between east and west Oklahoma City. And while NE 23 was stagnating a different story was taking place along NW 23 where similarly neglected commercial buildings were coming back to life with restaurants bars and entertainment venues.

The Pivot Project a group started by David Wanzer Jonathan Dodson and Ben Sellers (who has since left the partnership) was building a track record of successfully redeveloping older properties including the iconic Tower Theatre and an adjoining strip of abandoned storefronts.

Thompson got to know Dodson a former banker as the pair served on the Bricktown Design Review Committee. The pair started talking about dreams of bringing similar development to NE 23. The Oklahoma City Clinic was looking to leave its long-time home at the Oklahoma Health Center and rebrand itself as Centennial Health Clinic.

Thompson joining with the Pivot Project did a deal with Centennial Health to move its headquarters and operate its clinic in the former Cleary‚Äôs Service Station at 1720 NE 23.

‚ÄúThe assumption was if we have the capital a development group that has an inclusive approach to development and we have local community partners and leaders involved this should be pretty easy‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúWe have an anchor tenant; we know what this looks like and we know what we‚Äôre facing.‚Äù

Overcoming history

The development team hoped they had all the ingredients to attract financing. They had the support of the mayor and council and were in communication with community leaders. Two dozen banks declined to finance EastPoint.

‚ÄúWe would tell them the location and they would say ‚ÄòOh well we really haven‚Äôt loaned money on that side of town‚Äô ‚ÄòWe haven‚Äôt really done things on that side of town‚Äô ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have comps‚Äô ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not sure about appraisals.'‚Äù

After decades of redlining and flight of capital how could the east side provide comps which help banks track property values and lending patterns? These bankers weren‚Äôt necessarily racist Thompson said but he believes it all comes back to the systemic racism that plagues Black communities throughout the country.

‚ÄúDespite having the guys who brought the Tower Theatre back the guys celebrated around town for pulling off some tricky developments challenging developments that they made work and have success to have them at the table and the full-on support of our council person and community leaders we couldn‚Äôt get financing‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt get a bank to spend a lot of time with us.‚Äù

White flight hit the east side in the 1950s and 1960s as the African American community battled for civil rights and an end to Jim Crow. The GI Bill and federal housing programs started after World War II were not equitably applied Thompson said.

‚ÄúSometimes the laws were explicitly meant to discourage Black homeownership and particularly in primarily white communities‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúAs some of that began to change you had white flight to the suburbs and this became a community and corridor for the African American community.‚Äù

The city quit investing in the east side; streets and sidewalks crumbled and neighborhoods were not protected from encroaching industrial properties. Black families invested in the community began to see diminishing returns Thompson said.

The community lost voices to advocate for its well-being.

‚ÄúA lot of Black families that could moved for better schools better opportunities and better ways to maintain their value primarily with home ownership‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúWe saw wealth flight.‚Äù

Ultimately it was a community banker Jill Castilla CEO of Citizens Bank of Edmond who first agreed to tackle the financing challenge.

Dodson arranged with Cathy O‚ÄôConnor president of The Alliance for Economic Development of Oklahoma City to help him obtain tax increment financing from the city to help fill the financing gap and also to structure leases to allow retail tenants in the second phase to have an ownership stake in the property.

‚ÄúThese are two properties built in the 1920s and 1930‚Äù Dodson said. ‚ÄúThe real estate itself is not something that is incredible. What we wanted to do was to treat it well and spend the right amount of money. Where it really came down to was what would the equity and the debt look like and how do you make those numbers work on this side of town?‚Äù

The city invested 26% of the overall project costs of both phases through tax increment financing. To close the deal the team sought help from Steve Mason an investor developer and philanthropist dedicated to doing community-oriented projects.

‚ÄúIt took someone like Steve Mason to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôll join you guys and be part of the project so banks will finance it‚Äô‚Äù Dodson said. ‚ÄúIt really highlights what someone like Steve Mason can do in changing the narrative of banks lending over here.‚Äù

The triumph of Black-owned businesses

Only one space remains available at EastPoint. Intentional Fitness opened by Emmanuel Sosanya is proving a gym can draw customers a largely African American clientele back to NE 23. Chaya Fletcher who previously operated a popular music venue and restaurant in Deep Deuce teamed up with Quinton Hughes and is enjoying good crowds at Kindred Spirits a bar at EastPoint with a lit-up covered courtyard.

The Market at EastPoint recently opened at Centennial Health. The market is owned by the non-profit RestoreOKC which employs neighborhood teens at a nearby urban farm. The non-profit market sells produce from the farm while Homeland stocks the store with the products found at its other stores but with some at discounted pricing provided by suppliers.

Synexus a medical research firm was the final addition to the former truck stop.

The retail center design by Gardner Studio turned one storefront into an open air bay so that offices could line a corridor linking the street side of the center to the rear parking lot.

In addition to Intentional Fitness and Kindred Spirits the retail center is home to Looksee Eyecare and offices for community agency Public Strategies; Alori Chanel an art gallery and event space; Belle Books Boutique; and Moanch Properties an African-American owned homebuilding company founded by two sisters Monique Short and Erica Emery.

All of businesses are owned by African-Americans as are the next two tenants Spiked a Coffee Concept being opened soon by Brittani Hunter and Eastside Pizza House being opened later this summer by rapper and civic activist Jabee Williams.

Hunter is a newcomer to the east side but her family‚Äôs legacy is in Tulsa‚Äôs Greenwood where her grandfather operated a dry-cleaning business for decades. Hunter was working with the Thunder and had started embarking on a career in sports management when the pandemic hit.

Sidelined at home she found an old journal in which she had detailed the idea for a coffee shop that would serve its drinks ‚Äúspiked.‚Äù Driving along NE 23 she saw EastPoint and turned her dream into reality.

‚ÄúWe have almost everything you can get at a coffee shop down the street but we spike it‚Äù Hunter says with a laugh. ‚ÄúSo if you like rum Kahlua whiskey or vodka we‚Äôll have it. And we have a kids‚Äô table too; they‚Äôre welcome to come get some whipped cream and a piece of cake.‚Äù

Her grandmother is making the pastries cupcakes cookies cheesecakes and pound cakes with her own recipes. The menu also will include charcuterie boards spinach artichoke dip and humus.

She credits the EastPoint team with helping her get the business financed and started.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anything about it anything about Pivot anything about the people here‚Äù Hunter said. ‚ÄúBut I was attracted to how much of a family it is. Sandino and Quinton brought me under their wing agreed we need a coffee shop and told me ‚ÄòDo what you need to do.‚Äô‚Äù

Early on her real estate agent presented the prospect of including building equity in her lease.

‚ÄúIt was one of those things where yes absolutely‚Äù Hunter said. ‚ÄúI would have put my coffee shop here either way. But absolutely I‚Äôd put my coffee shop here if I could be a part of this as more than just a business owner. As far as ownership goes that was just sugar on top. You can‚Äôt walk away from that. What other building would give me equity ownership with opening my business here?‚Äù

New builders and vanishing banks

Lavine and MacBride say they are hoping to amplify EastPoint and similar stories and get them heard in ‚Äúthe halls of power‚Äù to refocus on the new builders like Dodson and Sandino who are changing the odds for minority development and to also draw attention to the plight of small community banks like Castilla‚Äôs Citizens Bank of Edmond and Farmers Bank which financed the second phase of EastPoint.

‚ÄúOne of the most alarming trends is the massive consolidation of banks from 14000 just 20 years ago to 4800 now‚Äù Lavine said. ‚ÄúMany of those banks were community banks. We‚Äôve lost a lot of vibrancy in our banking system and that should alarm people. We can‚Äôt reverse that consolidation. But we can reverse some of the rules of the legislation that made this happen.‚Äù

Thompson who has traveled extensively said he has seen east side communities in middle market cities like Oklahoma City throughout the country.

‚ÄúBecause of this history of discrimination and systemic racism the history of overcoming these things is not unique to Oklahoma City‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to me that we did a development that has the potential to be a model elsewhere. I‚Äôve spent time in Tulsa on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana and there are communities that can benefit from the way we‚Äôre answering the challenges we‚Äôve run into.‚Äù

Through our namesake bleach we supported the war effort during World War II with a product that could disinfect wounds and neutralize enemy gases. And over the decades we‚Äôve helped communities recover from natural disasters by providing purified water when it‚Äôs contaminated and Glad¬Æ trash bags to help with clean-up.

Today in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic our company and brands have never been more relevant and our role in helping our communities never more important. The past year has crystallized our purpose to champion people to be well and thrive every single day.

With that purpose in mind we‚Äôve updated our corporate brand to better reflect the bigger role we play in society as we serve more people around the world.

First and foremost this rebrand reflects our people. Our shared values in how we work and treat one another. Our inclusive culture that puts people at the center of everything we do.

The modern and simple look of the rebrand depicts our forward-looking approach. The spectrum of colors is inspired by our house of brands and our diverse culture. The dynamic nature of the design embodies our innovative spirit and drive to grow our business the right way improving as we go and leaving the world better for the next generation.

While the familiar diamond is still at the core to honor our heritage the design scope has broadened to reflect the totality of what makes The Clorox Company what it is today. A company that‚Äôs built to continue to add value in a rapidly changing world. A company whose brands make a difference to people. And with a team committed to serving our consumers and communities.

However when you buy something through our links we may earn a commission.

There are a lot of different household cleaners out there and it seems like each one is made for a different sort of tidying job. One brand is for your toilet bowl while another one specializes in cleaning your shower this one for your sink‚Äî and let's not mention how many different cleaning supplies there are just for your kitchen. That is... until we get to Fabuloso. One brand that can clean anything.

I love Clorox but Fabuloso brings all the different types of household cleaning products into one trusty brand (and without bleach). Although they have a different line of products for different purposes having them all under one roof means you know you're getting quality supplies no matter what you need to clean. Here are five different things you can clean with Fabuloso.

Best Fabuloso Cleaners

1. Wipe Down Glass:

Windex works well but I don't love having to buy a new spray bottle every time I run out. With Fabuloso All-Purpose I can get the streaks out of glass just as well and I don't have to go to the store every time I need a refill. Instead I can use Fabuloso concentrate to make a batch of cleaning supplies that will scrub streaks out of all my windows (and beyond).

The fresh scents of Fabuloso are tough to beat. There is Lemon Lavender and even a Passion Fruit scent. The mirrors in my bathroom are going to smell so good. Fortunately this large bottle of Fabuloso concentrate has a child safety cap on it that limits accessibility for youngins'. We don't want anyone mistaking the awesome smells as some tasty juice or anything.

2. Sealed Wood Surfaces:

I love Original Pine-Sol like a lot. However it's tough to find better pricing on a hardwood floor cleaner than what this 64-gallon bottle of Fabuloso brings to the table. With this concentrated formula you can have a hardwood cleaner that lasts for months.

Here's one disclaimer: make sure you're only using it on sealed hardwood. If your flooring is naturally finished Fabuloso could damage it. Otherwise enjoy the fresh lavender scent coming up from your floors!

3. Remove Grime From Your Grout or Countertops and Bathroom:

If you're having trouble deep cleaning your grout try spraying the lemon fresh scent of Fabuloso's multi-surface formula. Clean up is going to become so easy for you. Fabuloso's special formula (including lactic acid) will eat away grime wherever it hides and leave your bathroom sparkling clean.

In addition to cleaning out mildew and grime you can also use Fabuloso Complete to remove limescale and as a disinfectant spray. And it kills 99% of germs. Your move Lysol.

4. Easy Disinfectant Cleaner:

Fabuloso's Disinfecting Wipes make fighting viruses (including our least favorite one) a breeze. Fabuloso states their disinfecting wipes have been proven to kill the COVID-19 virus on non-porous surfaces. Keep a pack of these wipes in your purse backpack car or office. You'll breathe a sigh of relief knowing your space is protected from any bad germs.

5. Kitchen Degreaser:

The fresh scent of lavender makes an awesome kitchen degreaser too. The Professional formula cuts through stovetop grease without any rinsing necessary. All you have to do is spray and wipe away your kitchen messes. The formula has a neutral pH so that you can use it on other supplies too but it's good to know your stovetop will be cleaner than ever.

The Italian Baker Sdn Bhd maker of Massimo breads and baked goods has announced a new bread named Massimo Seeded Multigrain with Barley for healthy eating at home during lockdown.

Jeremy Goon chairman of The Italian Baker said bread consumption has increased among Malaysians who are mostly staying home to protect themselves and their loved ones during the Covid-19 pandemic.

‚ÄúEmbracing a nutritious diet is essential for us to continue staying healthy especially given our current circumstances where we are eating at home more often.

‚ÄúHence our bakers food scientists nutritionists and research and development team worked closely together to develop our first-ever artisanal multigrain loaf by carefully balancing between nutrition and taste.‚Äù

The Italian Baker Sdn Bhd chairman Jeremy Goon.

Goon said the Massimo team collected and analyzed relevant consumer data and key learnings from the first Movement Control Order (MCO 1.0) as well as from various Malaysian health statistics including the National Health and Morbidity (NHMS) Survey 2019.

‚ÄúThe Massimo Seeded Multigrain with Barley loaf was then developed to cultivate healthier eating habits while continuing to satiate the cravings and palate of Malaysians‚Äù he added.

The artisanal Massimo Seeded Multigrain with Barley loaf 360g.



The Massimo Seeded Multigrain with Barley loaf features an artisanal multigrain loaf enriched with premium Canadian barley flaxseed chia seed sunflower seed and black sesame which are packed with vitamins and minerals.

The first artisanal sandwich loaf serves up a winning combination of the bread maker‚Äôs fine bread-making tradition and the unique taste and well-researched functional food benefits of barley.

The Massimo Seeded Multigrain with Barley loaf (360g) which is an ideal choice for sandwiches toast or simply on its own is available for a limited time only at most retailers at RM4.90.

In the past this has been a bullish indicator of gold prices. According to Holmes gold was still trading about 12% lower from its all-time high set last summer.

In the short to medium term it appears as if gold demand will continue to be driven by central bank policy which should remain accommodative even as inflation fears increase.

According to the CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch Tool there‚Äôs a 75% probability that interest rates will stay in the 0.00% to 0.25% range a year from now leaving plenty of time for gold to test $2000 per oz. or more.

‚ÄúI favour gold as a portfolio diversifier. Low bond yields have pushed investors into riskier assets including stocks. ‚ÄúThis has been a winning strategy as major indices have been hitting all-time highs but it‚Äôs important to maintain a position in gold to help manage risk. I recommend a 10% weighting with 5% in physical gold and 5% in gold stocks.‚Äù

Bulging interest cost on discoms‚Äô loans:

High depreciation cost more low paying users:

Other reasons:

Timely tariff hikes could have avoided more hikes:

JAIPUR: In Rajasthan  people pay one of the highest rates for power. The natural disadvantage of being located far away from coal resources resulting in power purchasing cost of Rs 4.81 per unit highest in the country along with UP is not the only reason. The interest burden of discoms‚Äô loans is another major reason. In fact at Rs 1.40 per unit of power the interest paid by discoms for its loans is the highest in the country.Recently the board of state energy department decided to exit from high power purchase agreements to bring down the cost of power.Also a proposal from the Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd for retiring two units of Kota Super Thermal Power Station having 220 megawatt pending with the government.In the past financial year discoms used cheaper electricity from power exchanges and brought down the purchasing costs by Rs 20 paisa per unit but the impact of legacy burden and natural disadvantages is too large to pass on the benefits to the consumers. But more such strategies are being discussed to reduce the power tariffs in state which are one of the highest in the country.TOI analyses the causes as to what led to the spike in power rates in the state and why it is proving difficult for the government to provide relief.This contributes nearly 80% to the total cost of supply of the discoms. The conventional thermal power plants have been using coal transported from outside the state and the high logistics cost is making power generation expensive. Power purchase cost of Rajasthan at Rs 4.81 kWh which is about Rs 0.08 kWh higher than national average of Rs 4.73 kWh. For other states‚Äô (excluding UP) power purchase costs are below all India average. In some states it is half in comparison to Rajasthan.From unbundling of discoms in 2000 till 2011 there were only two tariff revisions. While costs increased by 71% during this period revenue increased by 2% only. Discoms had to take short term loans to fund these increase in costs. After 2011 there have been some tariff revisions but by then the interest costs had gone up. Non-timely tariff revisions and no tariff hikes in 2016-17 2017-18 and 2018-19 forced discoms to fund losses through loans. As a result the interest cost has gone up and it is highest in the country.Rajasthan is the largest state in the country with very low population density. So the cost of infrastructure per consumer is the highest in the country. Infrastructure requires both higher capital expenditure and depreciation cost. Also Rajasthan has amongst the highest share of consumers in the country at low tension level (domestic and agriculture). This results in higher technical and transformer losses.Cheap hydro sources constitute less than 10% of the power portfolio in Rajasthan whereas other neighboring states have much higher cheap hydro power share. The state also faces huge variation between peak demand (14000mw) and average demand (9500mw) due to which discoms are liable to pay fixed charges even if no power is procured from generation companies. Thirdly even with availability of low cost renewable energy discoms will continue to pay fixed charges of long term agreements with conventional generators.From 2007-08 to 2013-14 the cost of supply had nearly doubled but the rates were nearly half of the cost which resulted in heavy losses to the discoms and loan liabilities. If the discoms were able to revise their tariffs regularly by 3-4% annually in line with inflation it would have avoided the need for large and sudden tariff hikes and the impact on consumers would have been minimized.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many companies and corporations across the country are abuzz about diversity and inclusion. Pamela Cook helps to make sure that Birmingham-based Coca-Cola UNITED ‚Äî the second-largest privately held Coca-Cola bottler in North America and the third-largest bottler of Coke products in the United States ‚Äî walks the walk. She serves as Director of Multicultural Marketing & Community Affairs for the company‚Äôs Central Region which includes Alabama the Panhandle of Florida the Tennessee Valley area and parts of southwest Georgia. As part of her job Pamela also cultivates Coca-Cola UNITED‚Äôs partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities or HBCUs. Even when she‚Äôs not at work Pamela keeps busy serving the Birmingham community by volunteering with several organizations. We‚Äôre honored to introduce our latest FACE of Birmingham Pamela Cook.

You‚Äôve served in your current role at Coca-Cola UNITED since 2018 and have been with the company since 2014. What do you enjoy most about your job?

I love that no two days are the same. Every day is its own adventure. I love how marketing continues to evolve. And I enjoy the people ‚Äî I like what the company stands for.

Is there anything you‚Äôve seen companies get wrong when it comes to diversity and inclusion or multi-cultural marketing? What are you doing to make sure Coca-Cola UNITED doesn‚Äôt make these mistakes?

Each company has to take that journey for themselves so I can‚Äôt speak to what they‚Äôre doing wrong. But inside our organization we took a very proactive approach and we started a diversity and inclusion council. In June during our Diversity & Inclusion Week we held a number of events across our company including ‚ÄúJoin the Conversation‚Äù where our CEO and vice presidents were having difficult talks about race and gender equality. We traveled with a film crew to capture stories from our associates about diversity and asked them to tell us about their families and how they grew up. We hosted Friendship Day and had cookouts at all of our locations. It was all about learning more about the people you go to work with every day.

Part of your job focuses on nurturing partnerships between Coca-Cola UNITED and HBCUs. What are some of the things your company does to serves these schools?

One of the partnerships is our Pay It Forward program. It‚Äôs an internship for students. They learn how the Coke gets from the warehouse to the stores and the marketing that goes into it. We line them up with professionals inside our organization whose jobs match their majors or their areas of interest or we introduce them to a new opportunity they hadn‚Äôt even thought about. They spend time with our executive leadership. How many college students get to sit down and have lunch with a CEO of a company and then take selfies for the rest of the day with them? We give them $1000 for their time with us because what student doesn‚Äôt need a little bit of money in their pocket when they go back to school?

Why do you feel these partnerships are important?

It‚Äôs just the right thing to do. We want to give back to the communities ‚Äî to the consumers ‚Äî who buy our products. We make a point to reinvest in the communities that we live work and serve in and HBCU communities are a part of that. Our schools are so much more than half-time homecoming and classics. HBCUs birth game changers thought leaders CEOs scientists doctors ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much talent inside of an HBCU. It‚Äôs my privilege to be their champion inside of our organization and to work with amazing students educators and presidents.

You‚Äôre a native of Huntsville Alabama but you‚Äôve been in Birmingham for more than 20 years. What do you love most about the Magic City?

I‚Äôve met some really amazing people on my journey here. I like that it‚Äôs a city that‚Äôs big enough to be active but small enough to still have a great sense of community. There‚Äôs so much potential here. I‚Äôve seen a lot of change in the city and I want to see it continue to grow and expand.

Tell us more about some of the community service that you do.

I participated for years with Project Homeless Connect. It‚Äôs such a great way to give back to the community. In just a few hours you can help somebody on their journey. I‚Äôm serving now on the board for Red Mountain Theatre Company. I love theater and I always want other people to experience theater. The arts mean so much to our daily lives. We don‚Äôt realize how much of a role it plays in our living thinking being and our sense of community. I also have the great pleasure of working on the upcoming World Games. I‚Äôm really excited about that and what it will mean for our city. It‚Äôs that once-in-a-lifetime activity. Our city is going to be spotlighted in ways that it never has been.

What do you like to do when you‚Äôre not working?

Amazon Prime and I have been in a toxic relationship. I‚Äôve been shopping a lot. During the pandemic I started getting more into self-care. So I‚Äôm making time to go get a facial or a massage. Or I will go for a walk and leave the technology at home and listen to nature. I also fell in love with exercise. I started working with a trainer at Train & Burn.

What was your last best meal at a BHM restaurant?

The chicken and waffles at Yo‚Äô Mama‚Äôs.

What is your favorite hidden gem in BHM?

Cayo Coco. It‚Äôs a rum bar and it‚Äôs like stepping into Cuba. They have fabulous food and marvelous drinks and they‚Äôre environmentally friendly.

Where did you go on your last vacation?

I went to Sandestin for a few days earlier this year. That‚Äôs one of my favorite places to drive away to. My last international trip before the shutdown was to Barbados. That‚Äôs a great country to go visit.

What‚Äôs on your bedside table?

The Alchemist ‚Äì I like to reread that from time to time.

What is your go-to birthday present to give?

I like to give something meaningful. I want to give them something they wouldn‚Äôt buy themselves. It‚Äôs never a gift card.

What‚Äôs the best advice you can give?

Surround yourself with people who are where you want to be and they will absolutely pull you up.

Name three things you can‚Äôt live without.

Peanut M&Ms my big comfy chair at home and people.

Thank you Pamela! All photography by J&M Photography and Design.

Consequently she joined the US Army in its war effort. The Second World War was raging in full swing at that time and Book along with another classmate of hers volunteered for overseas duty.

After six long weeks at sea she landed in Calcutta where she was expected to tend to the wounded and ill in the China-Burma-India theatre. ‚ÄúYou could smell Calcutta a hundred miles away. It was a huge city. People were dying in the streets and on the doorways‚Äù she says in a 2004 interview archived by the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress. ‚ÄúEverything smells like it‚Äôs decaying‚Äù she says about her first experience of Calcutta as she narrates how she saw British trucks loading up bodies to dispose off in the burning ghats and the occasional sight of arms and legs floating in the river that left her shocked.

India was in a strange position during the War. As historian Yasmin Khan puts it aptly in a 2012 article: India was ‚Äúnot quite a home front nor quite a war zone India was nevertheless critical to the war effort as a source of military power and industrial production.‚Äù

At a time when anti-colonial mood was running high in the country it found itself caught in the frontline of a war between two imperial powers in SouthEast Asia- the British and the Japanese. After the fall of Singapore to Japanese aggression in February 1942 Calcutta emerged as perhaps most vulnerable to further advancement of troops from Japan. Soon after the city turned into a major site of a global war with its rest houses hotels training camps teeming with British American Chinese and African troops.

American soldiers arrived in Calcutta at a time when apart from the war a devastating famine was causing havoc. The initial impression was one of shock at seeing an India far in contrast to the fantasy land shown in Hollywood movies.

Khan in her book ‚ÄòIndia at war: The subcontinent and the Second World War‚Äô quotes an American journalist on what the soldiers experienced: ‚ÄúThe Americans accustomed to see India through Hollywood‚Äôs cameras as a fabulous land peopled by Maharajas and elephants were appalled and sickened by the stink and poverty of the place.‚Äù

But in this war torn famine stricken and high strung political atmosphere of the 1940s the American soldiers also found themselves in an interesting and yet peculiar position. A large majority of them were white much like the British but devoid of the necessity to defend an empire. ‚ÄúThe American soldier of course had an oriental gaze but they are asked to not involve themselves politically. Consequently they were more friendly and frequently shared food and drinks with local people‚Äù says Reeti Basu who is currently doing her PhD in Jawaharlal Nehru University on the topic of American military in Calcutta. What emerged was a short but fascinating period of cultural exchange of food music cinema art and a lot more that would largely transform the socio-cultural landscape of Calcutta.

Doing their bit in a famine struck Calcutta in war

From 1942 some 150000 American troops came down to India. In order to help them settle in this alien land friendly pocket books were handed out with detailed instructions on how they must conduct themselves in the country. One of these ‚ÄòThe Calcutta Key‚Äô was a pocket-sized 96-page guide on the city with information on everything from which markets to frequent how to bargain where one can find alcohol women and a lot more. A striking piece of instruction on the ‚Äòto do‚Äô list of the Calcutta key is ‚Äòto avoid political discussions‚Äô.

(Amazon.com)

‚ÄúAmerican soldiers were frequently scathing about the Raj‚Äù writes Professor of International Relations and History Srinath Raghavan in his book ‚ÄòThe most dangerous place: A history of the United States in South Asia‚Äô. Criticism against the British was far from being unwarranted as the Americans were witness to the famine-induced poverty caused by the policies of an apathetic British government. The Calcutta Key in fact suggests in great detail the famine conditions they can expect to see during their time and how they must react. Raghavan in his book quotes a GI‚Äôs reaction to the poor huddled up on the street peering through glass windows at the shops ‚ÄúIf I were they I‚Äôd smash those glasses and help myself to all that‚Äôs there.‚Äù

Given the affable relations the American GIs were prone to strike up with the local population and the possibility of American support for the ongoing freedom struggle in the country both the British and US governments were keen on keeping the young soldiers as apolitical as possible.

Another guidebook explicitly spelt out to the GIs: ‚ÄúAmericans are in India to fight the Axis. You should stick to that and not try to settle the Indian political problem. What we want is to cooperate with both the British and Indians to beat the Japanese. Your place is to keep the eyes and ears open and mouth shut.‚Äù

But that did not stop Indian politicians from reaching out to the GIs for support. Raghavan refers to a piece of writing by the independence activist Jayaprakash Narayanan wherein he addressed the GIs ‚ÄúYou are soldiers of freedom‚Ä¶ It is therefore essential that you understand and appreciate our fight for freedom.‚Äù He urged them ‚Äúlet your countrymen your leaders and your government know the truth about India.‚Äù

Historian Manish Sinha in his article ‚ÄòThe Bengal famine of 1943 and the American insensitiveness to food aid‚Äô notes that in August 1943 then Calcutta Mayor Syed Baddruja cabled President Franklin Roosevelt urging him and British prime minister Winston Churchill to arrange immediately for the shipment of food grains to India. While Roosevelt passed along the cable to the State Department which was well aware of the difficult food situation in Bengal. ‚ÄúRoosevelt refused to take any action not intending to provoke British resentment against American interference‚Äù writes Sinha.

Interestingly despite the refusal of the US President to act the American army in Calcutta were swift to organise a voluntary food donation scheme by saving a part of their weekly rations of canned food for the hunger stricken in Calcutta. Tathagatha Neogi a Kolkata-based heritage expert says in December 1942 when the Japanese bombed Calcutta his grandfather was working in the dockyards as a railway engineer. ‚ÄúBecause he was working in the port he would receive donations from the American army which included canned food like sardines baked beans etc which helped my family tide through the acute food shortages of the famine‚Äù he says. He notes that the American soldiers were in fact responsible for popularising canned food in Calcutta during and after the war. ‚ÄúThe British soldiers also survived on canned food as rations but the Americans were more willing to share.‚Äù

Expectedly the British did not take well the American attempts to provide famine relief to Indians. ‚ÄúThe British were always suspicious of the Americans and thought that they were here to aid the freedom movement. They saw these efforts of famine relief as further proof of the same. Consequently the British had spies in the American army headquarters which was in the Hindustan Building‚Äù says Neogi who is also founder of the heritage walks company Immersive Trails and has been organising a walk ‚ÄòCalcutta in World War II‚Äô since 2018.

The American soldiers‚Äô inclination to informally engage with Indians over food drinks music and so much more made them appear more friendly to the latter. Basu says several references to this can be found in popular literature. ‚ÄúThere is a story I came across in which the protagonist a Bengali boy in the army who was posted in Burma says American troops are more friendly towards us since they offer us beer and food. The British soldiers in contrast would hardly speak to the Indians‚Äù she says. She also recollects her grandmother telling her about an incident of American soldiers throwing chocolates to her while parading down Chowringhee.

Neogi says the relationship between Indians and American soldiers also depended on where they were located. ‚ÄúIn the countryside for instance in the border between what is now Bangladesh and Burma there were a lot of horror stories of American atrocities. They were protecting the area from Japanese incursion and often would not differentiate between INA spies and local people‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúIn Calcutta since it was not right on the frontier there was more of a fellow feeling.‚Äù

Basu notes that there were also instances when the American GIs got into unpleasant rows with Indians. ‚ÄúFor instance they had a very strained relationship with the Taxi drivers. In fact the taxi drivers‚Äô association had taken out a procession against the American GIs after an incident in which a soldier knifed a driver‚Äù says Basu.

The black and white soldier in Calcutta

While on one hand the American soldier was getting a taste of the Indian political situation in the streets of Calcutta on the other hand they brought along with them racial politics of their own. Among the 150000 American servicemen 22000 were Black GIs. Their experience of Calcutta and with people of the city was in marked contrast to that of the whites.

Khan in her book notes that the segregation of the American South permeated the American Army and while stationed in India black and white GIs faced blatant and enforced separation. They had fewer canteens deplorable living conditions poorer means of entertainment and also were expected to take on more menial labour. ‚ÄúIn Calcutta there were segregated Red Cross canteens with Black Red Cross women shipped in especially to staff them‚Äù writes Khan. ‚ÄúThe one service swimming pool in Calcutta had white days and black days. Black troops were given second class medical treatment were more likely to catch malaria had less chance of leave received harsher treatment from officers and drew the ire of Military Police‚Äù she notes.

Consequently the black troops and Indians found a common cause contrary to what the imperial government had expected given the existing racist tendencies among South Asians. The Black GIs spent more time in the local markets and tea shops and were more likely to strike up conversations with Indians. ‚ÄúAs a consequence black soldiers made new friends received invitations to local parties and dances and were more likely to have an Indian or Anglo-Indian lover‚Äù writes Khan.

At the same time though inherent racist attitudes among Indians towards the black GIs were also frequent to come by. ‚ÄúPopular Bengali literature of the time would frequently refer to black soldiers as ‚Äònegro‚Äô or kaalo kuch kuche (pitch black)‚Äù says Basu. She explains there was a lot of fear among Indians towards the black soldiers. ‚ÄúThere were rumours about them feeding on human flesh‚Äù she adds.

Neogi says during the 1946 Calcutta killings there were 26 American casualties in the city and most of them were Black. ‚ÄúMost of them were just at the wrong place and at the wrong time. And they were killed in brutal ways. One of them was driving an ambulance. He was stopped by the mob and the entire ambulance was doused in fire‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat does give us some insight about racist tendencies towards the blacks among Indians.‚Äù

A period of popular cultural evolution

But war politics famine aside the arrival of the American soldiers was also a moment of immense transformation in the cultural life of Calcutta. The legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray who had returned from Shantiniketan to Calcutta after the Japanese air raids wrote in his autobiography about the new spate of American popular culture that erupted in the city‚Äôs streets at this time. ‚ÄúChowringhee was chock-a-blocks with GIs. The pavement book stalls displayed wafer thin editions of Life and Time and the jam-packed cinemas showed the very latest films from Hollywood‚Äù he wrote.

Ray‚Äôs biographer Andrew Robinson wrote about how ‚Äúbecause of the war Ray was able to see films that had not been released even in London‚Äù. ‚ÄúGIs used to seek out Satyajit at his home and tell him about a US movie playing in town or at their base- ‚ÄòWanna come‚Äô?‚Äù notes Robinson in his book ‚ÄòSatyajit Ray: The inner eye‚Äô.

Iconic theatres of the city like the Metro cinema at Esplanade Road Lighthouse Cinema and New Empire Cinema in New Market and Globe Cinema at Lindsay street had come up even before the war with the objective of showing Hollywood movies exclusively. But it was only during the war that they became more readily accessible to Indians. ‚ÄúThe Metro cinema was run by MGM and they had a deal with the US Army that every week three movie passes would be given away to the soldiers. Often the soldiers would hand over these passes to their orderlies who were Indians or their Indian friends and acquaintances and that‚Äôs how Hollywood became more popular among the locals‚Äù says Neogi.

Ice-creams and Coca-Cola were also products brought in by the US Army specifically with the aim of making their GIs feel at home. Neogi explains ‚ÄúCoca-Cola established two plants exclusively for the US troops in Calcutta one in Kidderpore and another in Central Calcutta. They also established an American ice-cream plant in what is now Chandni Chowk market.‚Äù

Like with the movies each soldier was given three passes for Coca-Cola and ice-creams every week. With the American GIs eager to share these passes with their Indian friends and acquaintances ice-creams and Coca-Cola soon found popularity among Indians. One other food product made hugely popular in Calcutta by the American GIs was the brownie.

In the area of music as well an impressive transformation was heralded with the coming in of the GIs. ‚ÄúJazz was made hugely popular by the American soldiers. The Statesman would frequently put out advertisements for Jazz nights in the Grand Hotel where the soldiers were staying and the famous Jazz musician Teddy Weatherford would play there‚Äù says Basu.

This was also the time when Park Street emerged as the centre of Kolkata‚Äôs live music industry. Basu refers to the historian Tapan Raychaudhury‚Äôs book ‚ÄòBangal Nama‚Äô where he has mentioned that despite an ongoing famine in the region Park Street does not appear to be afflicted by any calamity at all. Restaurants such as the Firpo‚Äôs (opened by an Italian during WWI) would come alive with American GIs every evening and live music being played by foreign troupes.

‚ÄúThe latter day music scene in Park Street was a product of this cultural connection that swept through the city during the war years‚Äù says Kolkata-based filmmaker and photographer Sanjeet Chowdhury. ‚ÄúIt was only in the post war years that Park Street turned into this busy lively street forever buzzing with parties and music‚Äù he says.

In terms of what the Americans absorbed in Calcutta Basu says ‚Äúthey were very fond of the works of the painter Jamini Roy.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn fact a grandson of Jamini Roy whom I had once interviewed had told me that the American GIs were responsible for increasing sales of his paintings which helped him resolve the financial problems he was going through‚Äù she says.

The five years of American influence on the city was marked by several far-reaching political and social events. Amidst this all the dynamic presence of the Americans is largely forgotten in historical textbooks and archives. ‚ÄúI know that many felt their presence was so insignificant they did not even realise when they came and left‚Äù says Basu. ‚ÄúAnd yet there are also those who feel that the impact that the American troops left behind was massive and long-lasting.‚Äù

The pandemic and our lifestyle changes have forced people to be waste-cognizant. Fashion and its consumption particular are on everyone‚Äôs radar. One of the reasons why Instagram is filled with thrift and pre-loved stores rental services are growing en masse and Indian designer brands such as Pero Doodlage and Doh Tak Keh are making upcycling au courant .

The latest venture in this space is Saritoria envisioned by fashion entrepreneur Pernia Qureshi (who previously ran the e-commerce website Pernia‚Äôs Pop Up Shop) and husband-wife duo Omar Soomro and Shehlina Soomro (a marketing and business development manager at a London hedge fund). A first-of-its-kind global marketplace to buy and sell pre-loved South Asian luxury designer pieces the website showcases pieces from designers such as Sabyasachi Anamika Khanna and Tarun Tahiliani among others with sellers logging in from Patiala to Tamil Nadu. The pieces are checked for authenticity and quality by a team of experts (based in Mumbai and London) before being listed for a percentage. There is also a concierge service that offers to take care of everything from cleaning photoshoots to listing an account.

Edited excerpts from an interview:

What is Saritoria‚Äôs USP beyond the sustainability tag?

Qureshi: No matter how well off the shopper is everyone enjoys a good deal. Saritoria‚Äôs USP is one-of-a-kind pieces. For instance designers Abu-Sandeep used a beautiful mint green colour in one of their previous collections which is not available in stores anymore. However we have a lehenga from that collection on the site. There are so many events in a year and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to invest heavily every single time. This way you can build a designer wardrobe in a cost conscious manner.

The price points are premium. One would assume your customers can buy new designer wear.

Shehlina: The products are offered at significantly discounted prices. We are encouraging our customers to spend the same amount [as they would for a new piece] to invest in luxury pieces that can be re-used and re-sold. Shopping pre-loved lets you access pieces from previous seasons even vintage items.

How has the response been so far?

Shehlina: The first sale happened within two minutes of the website going live ‚Äî [an Anamika Khanna outfit] to a customer in Tamil Nadu. We have had orders from countries such as Australia and requests to list from the US and Canada. [Though] we haven‚Äôt yet targeted the male customer we are receiving amazing items across multiple generations for men.

Currently there is only one XXL piece on the website. Are there plans to make it more size-inclusive?

Shehlina: We believe in size inclusivity and have quite a number of L and XL pieces. Ultimately however the platform is open to anyone in the South Asian community to sell the sizes they own.

What are the best practices to store couture?

Qureshi: The best way to store couture is to fold it delicately and wrap it in mulmul which is soft and breathable. That‚Äôs how my mum and I store all of our vintage pieces inherited from my grandmum. We keep them in trunks but it is important to take them out from time to time and air them.

Now It Needs a Strategy.,"During a Zoom meeting in April the heads of all the biggest divisions at NBCUniversal gathered to discuss the state of their business. It didn‚Äôt take long for the conversation to turn to Peacock the company‚Äôs flagship streaming service.

Peacock has gotten off to a slow start since its debut last April. It has about 14 million monthly users and about 3 million paying subscribers according to a report this week by Gerry Smith. Those numbers mean that Disney+ added more subscribers on its first day of operation than Peacock added in its first year. (Comcast has cautioned that Peacock isn‚Äôt trying to compete with Netflix or Disney+ but that‚Äôs partially because it doesn‚Äôt have the resources to try.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2NvbWNhc3QtcGVhY29jay1qdXN0LWRlYWx0LWJsb3ctaGJvLW1heC1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast's Peacock Just Dealt a Blow to HBO Max and Netflix,"Peacock is stealing away some of the top films from both services starting next year.

Peacock and Universal Studios recently signed a deal to license Universal films to the streaming service no more than four months after their theatrical release starting next year. The deal between the two Comcast (CMCSA -0.91%) companies steals away the films from AT&T's (T 0.15%) HBO Max and Netflix (NFLX 0.54%) and it provides at least eight months of exclusive access for Peacock.

The move further fragments film distribution as media companies look to capitalize on direct-to-consumer relationships and streaming. That could be bad news for HBO Max Netflix and the entire streaming industry.

Losing some of the best content

Since 2005 HBO has licensed Universal's output in the pay 1 window (the period in which rights are available to premium cable networks and subscription streamers). It also has a deal with Disney's (DIS 0.13%) 20th Century Studios that expires after next year. It's unclear if Disney plans to retain those films for its own streaming services or if it'll continue licensing films to rivals like HBO.

In December HBO Max started streaming Warner Bros. films the same day they were released in theaters. It's produced strong adoption rates for HBO Max among HBO subscribers since that move and it's also helped add millions of additional retail subscribers. However management says it doesn't plan to continue the day-and-date releases in 2022.

Warner Bros. puts out about one film a month. And while that's enough to keep HBO Max subscribers engaged when the films are brand-new releases it's unclear if it'll be enough to get them to stick around as subscribers when the buzz around new releases has cooled off. Losing Universal (and potentially 20th Century) means losing the bulk of the newer films on its service.

Meanwhile Netflix has seen its output deals with major studios evaporate over the last few years. For example Disney cut its output deal short just so it could have all of its films for the launch of Disney+ in 2019. The streaming leader signed a deal with Sony (SONY -1.29%) Pictures earlier this year which was likely its only chance to add some blockbuster films to its catalog.

But Netflix has been ramping up its original film output. It plans to release 70 original scripted films this year which is a massive output compared to the major studios. Granted not all of Netflix's films are on the same level as the big franchise blockbusters put out by Universal Disney and Warner Bros. but they add quite a bit of selection for subscribers.

More subscription hopping coming?

The Peacock-Universal deal could attract more subscribers to Comcast's streaming service. While management says it has over 42 million sign-ups just one-third of them use the service monthly and even fewer are paying a subscription fee. That engagement rate may increase with the addition of Universal's films and the upcoming Olympic Games.

Importantly though the deal further fragments home entertainment film distribution. That means streaming services may see subscriber churn increase while paying more in marketing to let streaming households know which service they need to sign up for in order to watch the latest blockbusters.

Some companies have an advantage. Netflix for example has been fairly immune to rising churn rates seen by other streaming services as new competitors enter the market. Additionally Disney has strong brand recognition and affiliation with its films so consumers know where to find all Disney's releases -- Disney+.

But HBO Max Peacock and other smaller competitors could struggle to keep subscribers coming back month after month without a hot pipeline of highly anticipated movies. That puts more pressure on their television series output and marketing teams to keep subscribers engaged. Those efforts could otherwise go toward attracting new subscribers and broadening the content library.

As distribution becomes more fragmented streaming services with the strongest brands will be able to attract and retain subscribers more efficiently giving them a significant competitive advantage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL25ld3NhZHZhbmNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NoZW50ZWwtY29tY2FzdC1ib29zdGluZy1pbnRlcm5ldC1vZmZlcmluZ3MtaW4tbHluY2hidXJnLWFyZWEvYXJ0aWNsZV82YzU5MmM2NC1lMDM2LTExZWItYjkyZS1mN2E4Y2E2MmRkNDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shentel Comcast boosting internet offerings in Lynchburg area,"Two telecommunication companies Shentel and Comcast have begun offering what they tout as faster and more reliable internet options to local customers this year.

Shenandoah Telecommunications Company aka Shentel now is offering a new fiber-optic network in Lynchburg to residential and business customers. The technology branded Glo Fiber reaches more than 42000 households in the city.

Launched in 2019 Glo Fiber delivers next-generation fiber-to-the-home gigabit broadband internet access livestreaming TV and digital home phone service to Harrisonburg Staunton Front Royal Winchester Salem and Roanoke according to Shentel. Chris Kyle vice president of industry and regulatory affairs at Shentel said the new technology is the gold standard in Lynchburg.

‚ÄúThis is choice this is competition and consumers are going to benefit from this‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo with our technology this is a big bet that we‚Äôre making but we‚Äôre confident in that because we‚Äôve got a great background and a solid history of doing this.‚Äù

The 120-year-old company based out of Edinburg has been building fiber in Lynchburg for a while but is new to offering services to residential markets.

‚ÄúWith this technology it‚Äôs all about internet and the pandemic if it did nothing else really put a bright spotlight on broadband‚Äù Kyle said. ‚ÄúThe fiber to the home is a fiber connection [in which] we‚Äôll deliver the highest speeds that are available and we can upgrade those speeds without tearing up the street again. It‚Äôs upgradable and is the best technology out there.‚Äù

He said COVID-19 proved how well networks perform when there are multiple learners or multiple people working from home.

‚ÄúAnd many of those networks in areas that we compete with didn‚Äôt perform well. They were overloaded by the bandwidth demands put on them in each home by a couple kids learning a couple adults trying to work from home‚Äù he said.

Glo Fiber launched earlier this year in Lynchburg and Shentel has construction activities that will go throughout this year and into the next in the city‚Äôs various neighborhoods.

He said the service wouldn‚Äôt have been made possible if it weren‚Äôt for the support from the city which Shentel went to in early 2019 about its plans for faster internet options.

‚ÄúThis is transformative from an economic development point of view‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor companies wanting to expand or relocate to Lynchburg they want this technology for their workers to work from home or just as a quality of life.‚Äù

Interim City Manager Reid Wodicka said the city was pleased to be a partner in the development of additional internet options for residents and businesses in the community.

‚ÄúThrough expedited permit and construction review plus our long-standing franchise agreements for use of city property we made every effort to streamline this development process so that our partners could deliver additional internet service opportunities for Lynchburg‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThrough collaborative partnerships like this the city works to build a more connected city and enhance the business environment so that everyone in our community can thrive.‚Äù

Meanwhile Comcast announced in June it would introduce gigabit internet service to residential and business customers in Lynchburg.

Sandy Arnette public relations manager for Comcast said bringing gig speeds to Lynchburg and other areas of Virginia and Maryland are part of the company‚Äôs ongoing investment to better serve customers.

She said Comcast will continue to expand and improve its network.

‚ÄúComcast is the nation‚Äôs largest gigabit internet provider and operates one of the world‚Äôs largest smartest fastest and most reliable fiber-based networks in the country‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe compete every day with providers that offer different technologies. But customers continue to choose Comcast because we offer an unparalleled internet experience that includes gigabit speeds across our footprint the best Wi-Fi coverage and controls in the home and a network of more than 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots.‚Äù

Comcast has invested billions of dollars in its network to make broadband widely available to more homes and business than anyone for decades including in Lynchburg Arnette said where the company launched gigabit speeds in June.

‚ÄúBeyond internet we offer an extensive array of products and services spanning mobile home security and video ‚Äî including our award-winning voice remote ‚Äî and we will continue to offer the best value to address a range of customer preferences needs and price points‚Äù she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwdW5jaC5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy8xMS90aGV5LWNhbGxlZC1oaW0tc3Rhci1jaGlsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They Called Him Star Child - CounterPunch.org,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcveWltYnktcHJlc2VudHMtbW9ja3VwLXRpbWUtbGFwc2Utb2YtdGhlLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1za3lsaW5lLWZyb20tMTkwMS0yMDIwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YIMBY Presents Mockup Time Lapse of the Philadelphia Skyline from 1901 to 2020,"YIMBY has presented extensive coverage on the development of the Philadelphia skyline over the decades. In its early years church steeples factory chimneys and shot towers dominated the skyline rising above numerous low-rise buildings. Office towers began to rise in the early twentieth century as businesses flocked to Center City and proliferated more rapidly in the following decades particularly in the past 40 years. Today we present an animated rendering of the skyline showing how the mass of skyscrapers had risen from 1901 to 2020. Each frame shows the towers under their current construction status for the year depicted.

In the first frame City Hall juts out prominently yet is still mostly hidden from view. A cluster of buildings was starting to form over the next 20 years with more buildings were rising within the area around City Hall such as One South Broad and the PSFS Building the latter being notable as one of the first Modernist skyscrapers in the world. The skyline expanded further over the next 50 years with buildings such as 1700 Market Street and the PECO Building constructed by the end of the 1960s.

In the 1970s noticeably larger office towers were on the rise giving the skyline more mass. High-rises such as One Meridian Plaza Centre Square 1 and 2 and 1818 Market Street were approaching the informal 548-foot limit set by City Hall. In the next decade the 945-foot-tall One Liberty Place and a number of other buildings passed the former height limit. By now still more skyscrapers have joined the skyline with the Comcast Technology Center standing as the city‚Äôs tallest skyscraper at 1121 feet in height.

And it‚Äôs poised to be not just the state‚Äôs biggest gathering since the COVID-19 pandemic hit but one of the first major festivals to return nationwide.

Faster Horses which traditionally has drawn 40000-plus daily will hit Michigan International Speedway next weekend for three days of camping country tunes and red-white-and-blue partying as the July tradition notches its eighth installment.

Headliners Luke Combs (Friday) Thomas Rhett (Saturday) and Jason Aldean (Sunday) lead a lineup that‚Äôs unchanged from the bill originally set for last year before Faster Horses and the rest of the concert industry got sidelined by the pandemic.

Faster Horses has typically loaded up on hot hitmakers of the moment with a few veteran acts sprinkled in and this edition is the same: Other main-stage acts include Kelsea Ballerini Chris Lane Jon Pardi and Tracey Lawrence while the Next From Nashville tent will introduce fans to budding acts.

In a nod to Aldean‚Äôs hit of the same name ‚ÄúWe Back‚Äù has been the running tagline for Faster Horses since Live Nation announced in June that the fest was a go just days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outlined the state‚Äôs reopening plans.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

For Brian O‚ÄôConnell ‚Äî the Live Nation president of country touring who's familiar to Faster Horses fans as ‚ÄúB.O.C.‚Äù ‚Äî there‚Äôs a sense of excitement amid the urgency as he and his team get ‚Äúback to work full-tilt boogie with a relatively short runway.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most important things we‚Äôre looking forward to are the obvious ones ‚Äî like the first fan that gets there the first artist that plays the first headliner the first magical festival moment‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut right now we‚Äôre building a city in a hurry. We know that the payoff is coming but we‚Äôre so busy right now we‚Äôre not thinking much in the abstract.‚Äù

Attendance won‚Äôt be announced until the festival concludes but officials say they expect crowd numbers to approach those of previous years. If so Faster Horses will be the biggest event in Michigan since Garth Brooks played for 70000 at Ford Field in late February 2020. (At Comerica Park which returned to full capacity in June the largest crowd for a Detroit Tigers game so far has been 34484 on July 5.)

One group that will be missing is the corps of Canadian fans who have trekked across the border for the annual party. Travel between the U.S. and Canada restricted since the early COVID-19 days won‚Äôt be loosened until July 21 three days after the festival wraps up.

O‚ÄôConnell said those ticketholders have been accommodated either with refunds or arrangements to honor their passes and camping packages in 2022.

Faster Horses is the first in Live Nation‚Äôs stable of country festivals to reboot and for more than a year O‚ÄôConnell has been literally counting the days. Speaking Thursday from a Luke Bryan date in Syracuse ‚Äî the executive‚Äôs first concert since the pandemic ‚Äî O‚ÄôConnell was quick to note it had been 487 days since his last show.

He‚Äôs not the only one who has been champing at the bit: For artists and crews Faster Horses is a welcome sign of the return to action as the touring industry gets set to kick back into high gear in coming weeks.

Keeping the fest lineup intact from 2020 turned out to be easier than it might have seemed.

‚ÄúThankfully it was not a stumbling block. We had artist buy-in across the board and that goes to the reputation I believe we‚Äôve built as a festival‚Äù O‚ÄôConnell said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just another festival. It‚Äôs Faster Horses. We‚Äôve worked really really hard on that and the artist buy-in is humbling and speaks to what the team has created in southeastern Michigan.‚Äù

O‚ÄôConnell said his phone lights up every day with texts from artists happy to be hitting the road again ‚Äî and just as happy to get their touring crews working. Those crucial behind-the-scenes folks were among the most financially embattled these past 16 months as live music suffered one of the longest most complete shutdowns of any industry during the pandemic.

Crew Nation a fund launched by Live Nation and supported by a host of top-name artists ultimately generated more than $18 million to sustain those workers during the downtime.

‚ÄúThe artists are grateful for the opportunity to perform their music in front of their fans and roll out their buses with the guys and girls on their crews‚Äù O‚ÄôConnell said. ‚ÄúThey can finally exhale. It‚Äôs obviously been stressful for everybody.‚Äù

Since Faster Horses' debut in 2013 O'Connell and company have talked about fostering a sense of community among fans and the audience has been game for it. Eight festivals in MIS has become the scene of annual traditions and rituals among campers and concertgoers with new friendships romances and even marriages forged.

O'Connell said the big aim for this year ‚Äî after the long months of silent stages ‚Äî was to present a Faster Horses that would be familiar and comfortable to returning fans. Though the staff has made a few operational tweaks behind the scenes there won't be a lot of new bells and whistles out on the grounds.

""This is about delivering the festival fans expect. That's our only goal"" he said. ""We‚Äôve always tried to create a new experience. Our mission this year is just to create the experience. There was so much uncertainty over the last 16 months it was important to make this look as close to what they‚Äôre used to as humanly possible. So that‚Äôs the real achievement.""

The $67 million deal will transfer approximately 446 billion cubic feet equivalent of proved developed and producing reserves in the Wind River Basin to Contango a Houston-based oil and gas company. It‚Äôs expected to be finalized in the next few months.

‚ÄúConocoPhillips has a strong position in the Wind River Basin but the assets are not competitive in attracting capital in our portfolio‚Äù a company spokesperson wrote in an email to the Star-Tribune.

The Wyoming wells purchased by Contango have a net production rate of about 78 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day and have a relatively low expected decline rate of 5% per year over the next five years ‚Äî factors Colyer said make the acquisition a lower-risk investment for the company.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buying wells that have been producing for in some cases 20 to 30 years but these things have typically well over 50-year lives‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre buying this certainly not at the peak of its productive capacity but at a stage where there‚Äôs still a substantial amount of cash flow that you‚Äôre generating off the assets.‚Äù

He emphasized that reclamation at the end of the wells‚Äô productive lives is also central to the Contango business model.

Contango‚Äôs existing reserves are concentrated in Texas New Mexico and Oklahoma. The company acquired several other Wyoming assets this year increasing its presence from virtually no in-state employees to close to 100 before the ConocoPhillips deal. Colyer said the state‚Äôs plentiful natural gas supply and friendliness to the industry make it an attractive place to do business.

Last month in a move Colyer said was unrelated to the natural gas acquisition Contango announced a merger with Independence Energy an oil and gas company managed by investment firm KKR & Co.

The estate formerly owned by Jane Fonda has four miles of river running through it. It‚Äôs muddy at the moment he says but on a good day a fly fisherman can easily pull out 20 or so rainbow trout. It is a dreamy-sounding place with pine-covered cliffs and roving elk. It is another world from the tumbleweed-strewn oilfields of West Texas where Mr Sheffield was once dubbed the ‚Äúmother-fracker‚Äù for his role in turning the Permian Basin into the mother lode of America‚Äôs shale boom.

The last time your columnist spoke to Mr Sheffield five years ago the co-founder and boss of Pioneer Natural Resources was the Permian‚Äôs greatest free-market evangelist. It was the heyday of the shale revolution. Pioneer was in the middle of a drilling bonanza that pushed its oil output up by an average of 15-20% a year for a decade. All the money it earned it reinvested into fracking even more shale wells. Mr Sheffield was fond of comparing the Permian with Ghawar Saudi Arabia‚Äôs biggest oilfield.",,,,,,,,,

A press conference announcing the milestone was held on Thursday June 24 at the southeastern corner of Putnam Place and East Gun Hill Road in Norwood where the new state-of-the-art curbside EV charging port is now located. Two customers at a time can charge their vehicles at Putnam Place while four vehicles can charge up at the newly installed charging station at 5935 Broadway in Riverdale.

DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman told invited guests ‚ÄúWelcome to a beautiful and historical day here in the Bronx. The survival of our city and indeed our entire planet depends upon our ability to reduce our carbon footprint and to do it now. This is why the [De Blasio] administration is so focused on promoting bikes buses mass transit and other alternatives to the use of a private vehicle.‚Äù

Gutman continued ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt take up excessive sidewalk it doesn‚Äôt interfere with any of the other uses that we make of the City streets and sidewalks well designed well executed and we‚Äôre looking forward to having the next I guess 99 installed and seeing how the public enjoys using [them].‚Äù

According to Gutman the pilot program will consist of 100 ‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù charging stations which will be located in 20 neighborhoods across the five boroughs by EV owners and an additional 20 charging stations that will be built for New York City‚Äôs own fleet of vehicles.

Ben Furnas director of the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Climate and Sustainability told those in attendance ‚ÄúIn the fight against climate change and for cities action on climate means transforming our streets to support walking and biking and transit and it also means making sure that every car on the road is an electric.‚Äù Furnas added ‚ÄúCon Ed and DOT are doing just that from bike lanes to bus lanes to open streets.‚Äù

Meanwhile Lenny Singh senior VP of Con Edison‚Äôs Customer Energy Solution unit said ‚ÄúCurbside charging makes adopting EVs more convenient for our customers. Not having to run a drop-cord three stories down certainly is convenient.‚Äù

He added ‚ÄúIt makes EV ownership even easier especially [for] those who live in apartment buildings like the ones we‚Äôre standing next to today and those without access to their own charging stations.‚Äù

According to Singh the long-term plan is to install 21000 Level 2 charging stations and 525 ‚Äúfast chargers‚Äù across the city. Singh added that Con Edison was investing $1.5 billion in three transmission projects that will deliver renewable energy that will eventually charge the EV charging stations from offshore wind turbines.

Singh concluded ‚ÄúThe future of the energy supply in New York is renewables things like offshore wind and solar. EVs will increasingly be charged by those renewable sources and we‚Äôre ensuring that our grid and the grid of New York City is equipped for that transition.‚Äù According to City officials the goal is for New York to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2040.

Charles Miller an Allerton resident and the proud owner of a 2012 Nissan Leaf EV was delighted with the new charging station as it means he no longer has to pay for a parking space outside his apartment building and run several extension cords out his third floor window in order to charge his car.

As he charged his car at the new station Miller described the advantages of the new charging stations saying if his battery was low he could stop in the neighborhood park charge the car and maybe visit the Oval Park or do some shopping and then come back in an hour and have 25 miles of additional mileage on the clock.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in this area it‚Äôs going to give you about an hour to chill.‚Äù He added that the new chargers were going to be convenient in the sense that no EV owner would be left stranded due to not being able to charge up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best part about it‚Äù he said.

A one-hour charge will cost $2.50 for more than 6 kilowatt hours and an EV will cover about 25 miles from that charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa29mdGhlc291bmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTEvZ2V0dGluZy1hcm91bmQtbmV3LXJvY2hlbGxlLWFscmVhZHktYmFkLWlzLWFib3V0LXRvLWdldC13b3JzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Getting Around New Rochelle ‚Äî Already Bad ‚Äî is About to Get Worse,"NEW ROCHELLE NY ‚Äî The griping has been going on for months now. Anyone who has attempted to navigate downtown New Rochelle lately knows that getting to Point A from Point B can require stops at Point C D E. Trips that once took 10 minutes can take 30 minutes. For those feeling like mice in a maze the City has just announced there is no cheese.

The main culprit has been infrastructure improvements by utility companies and City contractors upgrading New Rochelle‚Äôs water gas electric and sanitary sewer lines.

The work was necessitated by poor planning attributed to the Development Department which downplayed the impact of downtown apartment projects. The result was a roughly $40 million bond to upgrade the capacity of the sanitary sewer system.

Once the City began ‚Äúdaylighting‚Äù ‚Äî opening up the asphalt cover on streets throughout the City ‚Äî everyone else jumped in.

In ripping up the streets to get access to sanitary sewer pipes the City decided to multi-task and replace stormwater drains.

Suez the water utility seized the opportunity to upgrade their distribution system and enlarging their supply line. The trunk lines being replaced especially around Webster and Main.

Con Edison is converting gas lines in neighborhoods throughout New Rochelle from low to high-pressure service.

While some projects are short-term others will be longer.

If there is an impact on service delivery ConEd and Suez are supposed to contact customers directly. For larger projects the utilities may ask the City for assistance with additional outreach primarily the reverse-911 system. Contacting those whose service is directly effected does nothing to help neighbors effective by noise or motorists who may unexpectedly find a road closed.

For those frustrated by the inconveniences the mother of all disruptions is still to come ‚Äî the closure of the North Avenue Bridge connecting downtown New Rochelle to everything north of downtown. As part of a statewide upgrade of roadways and bridges the New York State Thruway Authority has plans to replace the North Avenue bridge over I-95.

The first phase is the North Avenue Bridge Utility Relocation Project. The necessary utility relocation will require traffic to be reduced to one lane in either direction between Huguenot Street and Lockwood Avenue beginning this summer. Burling Lane will be closed to through traffic at North Avenue and access to I-95 from North Avenue southbound will be detoured through Memorial Highway. No details have been provided as to when this work will begin ‚Äî or end.

The Department of Public Works is finalizing a paving list for 2021. Messaging will be sent to affected neighborhoods. The 2020 contractor has begun the preparation (i.e. pedestrian ramp installations casting adjustment) on the streets that were not completed last year. The City website will list the latest paving plans.

A small but disruptive project for East End residents will be a new curb cut at the Intersection of Palmer Avenue and Stephenson Boulevard.

The New York State Department of Transportation has gotten into the act with its decision to re-number exits on the Hutchinson Rivet Parkway from the Bronx to the Connecticut border. As new signs replace old signs exit numbers are being changed from sequential to mile-based exits.

The exit numbers were recently converted to a mileage-based system:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2xpb25lbC1tZXNzaS1hbnRvbmVsbGEtcm9jdXp6by1zZS1hYnJhemFuLWJlc2FuLXBpc3RhLWF0ZXJyaXphamUtZXN0YXItbWVzLWFsZWphZG9zLWNvcGEtYW1lcmljYS0yMDIxLXZpZGVvLTczMzU40gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vZWxwb3B1bGFyLnBlL2FtcC9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2xpb25lbC1tZXNzaS1hbnRvbmVsbGEtcm9jdXp6by1zZS1hYnJhemFuLWJlc2FuLXBpc3RhLWF0ZXJyaXphamUtZXN0YXItbWVzLWFsZWphZG9zLWNvcGEtYW1lcmljYS0yMDIxLXZpZGVvLTczMzU4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¬°Destilando amor!

Emerging from the trench that hosts the second time zone we come to the center of the dial its surface outlined by a curved analog date ring. At its innermost level is the collection‚Äôs signature ‚ÄúStarry Varius‚Äù display with hand-polished leaf style hands counting the local time‚Äôs hours and minutes alongside a smaller pointer for the aforementioned date.

Ranging from how to know whether items will be restocked to where to find the best bargains we round up little-known ways to save money.

The warehouse chain typically requires shoppers to be a member to get access to its stock.

Its everyday value gold star membership costs $60 per year and it includes two cards to use in store and gives access to online shopping too.

In other words it's important to consider whether it's worth it before you sign up.

Costco has almost 560 stores across the US. You can find your nearest one by checking its store locator tool.

1. Secret Costco price codes

The pricing codes at Costco will tell you whether an item is specially priced discounted and whether it'll be restocked.

Prices that end in $0.97 have been slashed down from their original rates which usually end in $0.99 according to money website Lifehacker.

Other odd pricing like $0.49 $0.79 or $0.89 typically means the product is regular-priced merchandise.

Prices ending in $0.88 or $0.00 usually mean that the manager has discounted regular goods in order to clear stock quickly.

Meanwhile an asterisk in the upper right corner of the price tag means the item won't be restocked.

In other words it's best to stock up or you may miss out.

2. Bargains are at the back

The best bargains at Costco are typically located at the back of the store Lifehacker added.

The best shopping route is to start at the back of the warehouse and the ends of aisles. Then work your way up to the front.

If you want to save cash it's best to steer clear of the center of the store.

3. Get credit if prices drop

If you buy something on Costco's website and the price drops within 30 days you'll receive credit of the difference.

This is thanks to its price protection policy.

You need to keep an eye on prices yourself though and then contact customer service with the necessary information to get the cash.

The credit will typically land in your account within three to five business days.

Sadly Costco doesn't price match with other retailers.

4. Costco suppliers offer rebates

Some products in both Costco warehouses and online come with manufacturer rebates allowing you to save even more money.

To get your check you'll need to submit your documents within three days.

Costco members can complete the rebate process online but non-members must do so by mail.

Submissions must be entered within 30 days of expiration and you then have to wait four to six weeks for you to receive your cash.

5. Skip membership fee with cash card

If you don't shop at Costco enough for the membership to pay for itself you can ask a family member or a friend to buy you a Costco Cash card.

You can get them in amounts ranging from $25 to $2000 and if you want to go again the member can reload it for you.

There's no extra fee to shop in store with a cash card as a non-member but keep in mind you'll be hit with a 5% surcharge for online purchases.

This is because Costco's low prices on brand-name items is due in large part to its membership program according to the chain.

6. Non-members can buy certain things at Costco

Another way to shop at Costco without paying the membership fee is if you're after certain products.

It depends on states though so make sure to double-check this in advance.

For example in California and Connecticut you're allowed to shop the warehouse chain's alcohol section.

This is because some state-issued liquor licenses say that all items must be available to the public.

Residents in any of the 50 states can also head to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions.

7. Lifetime return policy

If you ever want to return something you'll be pleased to know that Costco offers lifetime returns on most things.

The few exceptions include items such as electronics and fine jewelry which must be returned within 90 days or 48 hours respectively.

Costco also doesn't accept returns of cigarettes and alcohol.

8. Shop earlier at a Costco Business Center

Early birds can get access to Costco stores earlier than usual by popping by Costco Business Centers.

These are aimed at business owners and open at 7am Monday to Saturday unlike wholesale stores which usually open at 10am.

Despite the name the Costco Businesss Centers are open to everyone.

There are more than 15 of these locations in the US.

You can find your nearest one by using its store locator tool and clicking the business center option.

Last month Costco made a number of changes for its customers which included the return of its free food samples.

It comes as the warehouse chain dropped the face mask requirement for vaccinated customers in May.

We've also rounded up its opening hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlcmFuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDctMTAvZnJlZS1zYW1wbGVzLWFyZS1iYWNrLWJ1dC13aXRoLXNhZmV0eS1pbi1taW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Samples Are Back But With Safety In Mind,"When Pat Curry spotted bite-sized wood-fire rotisserie chicken with portabella mushroom at her local Costco in early June she felt ‚Äúgiddy.‚Äù After a 14-month hiatus free samples were back.

‚ÄúIt was one of the markers that told me that we turned a corner‚Äù said the 60-year-old who lives in Augusta Georgia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the little things that you do that were taken away and now they‚Äôre back.‚Äù

When the pandemic was declared in March 2020 retailers worried about the potential spread of the coronavirus so they cut off free sampling of everything from food to makeup to toys. But now with vaccinations rolling out and the threat of COVID-19 easing in the U.S. stores like Costco are feeling confident enough to revive the longstanding tradition.

For customers sampling makes it fun to shop and discover new items ‚Äî not to mention getting all the freebies. For retailers they‚Äôre critical tools to keep shoppers coming back and battle against online retailers like Amazon.

Food sampling converts browsers into buyers at a 20% higher rate than if customers weren‚Äôt allowed to test says NPD Group Inc. a market research firm. The conversion rate is 30% higher when beauty products are sampled.

‚ÄúSampling is critical‚Äù said Marshal Cohen NPD‚Äôs chief industry analyst. ‚ÄúImpulse alone drives 25% of the retail business.‚Äù

Jake Tavello a senior vice president at Stew Leonard‚Äôs said promoting new items had been challenging without sampling a tradition started by his grandfather who founded the regional grocery chain in 1969. Sales of a new item pink glow pineapple were OK this past spring for example but have tripled since demonstrations were reintroduced.

‚ÄúWhen people taste it that‚Äôs what can makes people want to buy it and decide what they want to eat for dinner‚Äù Tavello said.

But while sampling is back it‚Äôs not clear if everyone is ready to bite. With that in mind some retailers are putting various safety protocols in place to ease any safety concerns.

At Costco masked workers prepare the hot and cold samples behind plexiglass counters and distribute to its members one at a time. Stew Leonard‚Äôs also brought back hot samples with similar safety measures.

Meanwhile Walmart and its wholesale club division Sam‚Äôs Club are only serving pre-sealed food samples. And Sam‚Äôs Club is limiting to sampling on the weekend. Target said that staffed food and beverage sampling has remained on pause since March 2020 but it has been allowing self-service sampling of individually wrapped items.

With beauty testing retailers appear to be even more cautious. Beauty chain Ulta Beauty said it‚Äôs still figuring out how to bring back makeup testers. Target said in May it will resume beauty product sampling in stores this year where customers can take home individually wrapped items. Kohl‚Äôs would only say that it hadn‚Äôt brought back makeup or fragrance sampling.

Lawrence Gostin a public health expert at Georgetown University said handling and eating food has not been a major route for the spread of COVID-19. But food sampling can lead to people congregating together and that increases the risk of transmission. He also pointed to concerns about food sampling that go beyond the coronavirus: ‚ÄúMultiple hands grabbing samples can lead to the spread of germs while contaminated gloves can also disperse unwanted bacteria.‚Äù

As for makeup testing Gostin said it‚Äôs ‚Äúmuch safer and wiser‚Äù to use samples that are fully packaged. And with letting kids play with toys frequent sanitizing of objects is recommended to contain viruses like influenza which unlike COVID-19 can be easily spread through touching contaminated surfaces.

Toy retailer Camp which centered its shopping experience around children playing with toys now has individually wrapped craft kits in the store instead of letting kids dig around for art supplies says Tiffany Markofsky the company‚Äôs marketing director. For testing out toys it‚Äôs sticking to items that can be easily cleaned like remote control toy cars instead of dolls with faux hair.

Marianne Szymanski president of Toy Tips Inc. a toy guide believes toy testing overall will be ‚Äúlimited‚Äù because of the lingering fears about germs due to the pandemic.

Some retailers are doing away with sampling altogether. For instance West Hollywood California-based beauty company Blushington isn‚Äôt reopening its six stores and is instead moving more toward virtual makeup sessions and offering services at shoppers‚Äô home says CEO Natasha Cornstein. She thinks shoppers believe they have better control of their environment and hygiene in their own home.

‚ÄúThe consumer is coming out of COVID with very different habits‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only about COVID now.‚Äù

Please check the time stamp on the story to see when it was updated last.

When stores like Costco removed free samples in Covid there was a big uproar. Everybody loves to nosh while grocery shopping and the removal of free food stations felt like *yet another* thing that the pandemic had taken from us. But health experts warn that food samples come with a slew of health risks from being high in nitrates potential food allergy and bacteria growth. The bottom line is that you often can‚Äôt read the ingredients list or nutrition label for these pre-cut pre-prepared foods that are displayed in the public space‚Äìand that is a problem. Before you grab that toothpick see what leading food experts told us about the risks:

You Can‚Äôt ‚ÄòCheck The Label‚Äô

Anyone with a food allergy or intolerance should be aware of the health risks associated with grabbing a food sample off the tray.

‚ÄúThe individuals offering the samples may not be fully aware of what ingredients and possible allergens the food contains‚Äù nutritionist Lisa Richards CNC of The Candida Diet warns.

Without knowing exactly what is in the food especially for food samples that are recipes using many ingredients it is ‚Äúbest to bypass them to avoid any reactions‚Äù Lisa suggests.

‚ÄúYou do not know exactly what they contain‚Äù registered dietitian Trista Best of Balance One Supplements agrees.

But that‚Äôs not all. Issues with how these samples are prepared and stores exist as well.

‚ÄúThere may have also been cross contamination in the preparation process which could cause illness as well‚Äù Trista explains.

‚ÄúFood samples might not be the safest bet when it comes to food preparation bacteria growth and the spread of germs‚Äù registered dietitian Harland Adkins of Fast Food Menu Prices agrees.

Prolonged air exposure can also promote the growth of bacteria on foods that are meant to be stored at room temperature he warns.

Lastly the sample often contain high contents of nitrates fat (which can increase LDL cholesterol) sugar and salt (which can increase blood pressure and cause bloating.)

Sorry to ruin your freebie experience but it‚Äôs probably best to pass up on these next time you‚Äôre shopping at the market or warehouse club!"

An infamous Birmingham tax fraudster who built a 'palace' in Pakistan has been freed from jail - despite still owing ¬£3 million in crime proceeds and interest.

And Mohammed Suleman Khan nicknamed 'The General' is understood to be still living in the same ¬£700000 gated house in Moseley he lived in when he was jailed.

He was originally sentenced to four years in 2014 after defrauding the taxman of ¬£450000.

The scam was exposed after police raided his Moseley home and found plans for his own ‚ÄòBuckingham Palace‚Äô in Pakistan complete with library cinema and servant quarters.

In 2016 Khan's sentence was increased by ten years when he failed to pay a ¬£2209090 confiscation order.

Five years later he is now a free man again having been released after serving half his default sentence. He still has not paid a penny of the ¬£2.2 million order - nor the additional ¬£1 m interest - owed to the State.

It is believed Khan is still living in the Moseley house which belongs to relatives. The property is subject to a financial restraint order which was obtained by the CPS according to Land Registry records.

In non payment cases eight per cent interest is added annually to the original sum meaning Khan now owes another ¬£1m on top taking the total outstanding to ¬£3221034.

West Midlands Police said in a statement: ""POCA (Proceeds of Crime Act) Asset Recovery is often extremely complex and time consuming. Our progress to date has been slower than we would like in this case.

""It is the obligation of Mr Khan to pay the confiscation order and remains so despite having served the default sentence.

""There are a number of significant complications surrounding the recovery of the Birmingham assets.

""We have however acted on intelligence from the community and we conducted a warrant at the house in Moseley on 30 May. No weapons were found.""

The statement added the Crown Prosecution Service and the force ""fought strongly to get this confiscation order we continue to work together as we remain fully committed to enforcing it and getting back what we can as soon as possible.

""Our work continues however much of it has to remain in the background for now.

""We appreciate this is frustrating for people who want to understand more but it doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt doing anything.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ""I can confirm that on 10 April 2015 Birmingham Crown Court made a confiscation order for ¬£2209090 against Mohammed Suleman Khan. The court gave him six months to pay the order and fixed a period of imprisonment of 10 years in default of payment of the confiscation order.

""On 4 February 2016 Birmingham Magistrates‚Äô Court activated the default sentence of 10 years to run consecutive to the period of four years imprisonment for the offence of Cheating the Revenue.""

The CPS confirmed the outstanding unpaid balance and interest but would not release any information about any steps taken to try to recover the outstanding monies.

Confiscation orders are imposed by the Crown Court on those who have been convicted of a criminal offence and have benefited financially from the proceeds of their crime. They're enforced by a range of government agencies and in Khan's case the CPS is the agency attempting to recover the money.

Crown Courts will set a period in prison which the defendant is liable to serve if they do not pay as ordered.

If they do not pay the magistrates' court can commit them to prison for terms in default. A defendant can pay at any time to facilitate their release from prison.

But Khan sat tight in jail and failed to cough up.

HMCTS (Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service) is ultimately responsible for collecting the debt owed by an offender on a confiscation order.

The lead enforcement agency can be the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) or HMCTS. The current lead agency on Khan's case is the CPS.

A confiscation order will be enforced regardless of the age of the debt the Ministry of Justice says.

A spokeswoman said: ""HMCTS and magistrates‚Äô courts use all available means of enforcing the order. These include the issuing of a warrant of control attachment of earning orders and applying for deductions from benefits.""

The original tax fraud court case heard Khan had lived in a gated ¬£500000 house in Moseley and drove a BMW but had no obvious job.

His family home belonged to relatives and only small amounts of money went through his bank accounts.

Yet while he was careful to avoid showing trappings of wealth in the UK detectives from West Midlands Police discovered he had secretly paid for the ¬£2.3 million mansion to be built in Pakistan.

In court his defence portrayed him as a legitimate businessman who had earned around ¬£400000 over the nine-year period from debt collecting and other business interests in the UK and abroad.

But police found no evidence of a legitimate debt collecting company and their investigation proved he had netted over ¬£1 million during that period without paying the required tax and National Insurance.

A search of Khan‚Äôs Birmingham home after his arrest uncovered plans for the ‚Äòpalace‚Äô in the Attock region of Pakistan.

The outer shell and roof of the building had been completed by Khan at a cost of ¬£893000.

Once finished the property would have been valued at ¬£2.3 million.

Khan did not utter a word during his police interview or court appearances aside from ‚Äòguilty‚Äô when he admitted cheating the public revenue during an appearance at Birmingham Crown Court in November 2013.

His honour Judge Menary QC had presided over the original case and agreed Khan was living beyond legitimate means the most obvious evidence of that being his Pakistan property.

He said: ‚ÄúIt is enormous with dozens of rooms a library servant quarter cinema underground parking and guard rooms.

""It is the size of Buckingham Palace.‚Äô‚Äô

Police had said at the time of the fraud case: ‚ÄúThe sentence handed out sends a clear message to all members of the community that evasion of tax and National Insurance are serious criminal offences.

‚ÄúNo matter your standing within the community police and other agencies such as Her Majesty‚Äôs Revenue and Customs will seek to investigate and where appropriate prosecute individuals who are perceived or seen to be living a lifestyle or own property inconsistent with legitimately earned income.‚Äù

Khan‚Äôs jailing for tax fraud sent shockwaves around Birmingham‚Äôs criminal fraternity who had held him up to a near ‚Äúmythical‚Äù status.

One community source said: ‚ÄúNot many people had even ever set eyes on him and he had this kind of mythical status where people only said his name in hushed tones.

‚ÄúMost people referred to him simply as ‚ÄòThe General‚Äô which gave an indication of the kind of status he had in the community.‚Äù

But over in Kansas where the grass is green and people get bored on farms somebody is making a Ford Mustang that rolls as much coal as possible. It all evens out!

The custom car scene has a couple of goofy interesting muscle cars powered by diesel engines. Hoonigan has just put the finishing touches on their Coalmaro  which includes some carbon fiber body panels and fancy polished wheels. Westen Champlin doesn't make that kind of money but his Cummins Mustang is equally entertaining.First of all this is a normal Mustang but it's been converted to look like a Shelby GT500. After that comes the mother of all engine transplants which is a 12-valve 6BT 5.9-liter Cummins. It's about as angering to the environmentalists as that Hellcat Prius SRT8  if not more.But the large six-cylinder only made about 230 horsepower and Westen obviously couldn't leave it at that. More recently the engine has been fitted with not one but two Aggressor 80 turbochargers. They're big they're super-heavy and they make the Smokestang look like a professional dragster. also there's no way the hood is ever going back on now.At the end of June we saw how these monsters were attached to the Mustang. The pipes that come with the turbos don't fit well and Champlin attaches a big V-band clamp but there's still some leak. This insane boost was also making the radiator overheating.Now it's back ready to test its metal at the drag strip. But in the time-honored tradition of YouTubers stretching out their content for the algorithm the action starts with the Smokestang at the McDonalds Drive-Thru. We don't mind. Actually this has to be some of the best filler content ever made and it also includes power-washing the engine.As for the drag strip action itself the title pretty much sums it up. The Cummins is making too much boost for its own good. After a spectacular burnout the intercooler ""goes boom."" What's interesting is how many people love this oddball dragster and how they want to help the owner fix it to get it back on track.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXNodmlsbGVwb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlL3JldGlyZW1lbnQtdGVjaC1jb21wYW55LWVzdGFibGlzaGluZy11LXMtaGVhZHF1YXJ0ZXJzLWluLW5hc2h2aWxsZS9hcnRpY2xlX2I5MTA3ZTc0LWRmM2EtMTFlYi1iMjE0LTk3ZTZhZDg4N2Y4My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retirement tech company establishing U.S. headquarters in Nashville,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Step One Clothing Australia sued in the Federal Court claiming Sojo Pty Ltd the business that makes TRADIE jocks misled customers by claiming its products are 'true blue' Australian when laundry tags say they are made in China.

The rival underwear company alleged Sojo breached Australian Consumer Law by using images of Australian stars for advertising purposes including Cummins freestyle aerial skier Danielle Scott and rugby sevens player Charlotte Caslick.

Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting Cummins Scott and Caslick have done anything wrong and they are not involved in the court case.

Step One Clothing Australia accused Sojo of marketing promoting advertising and selling the intimates by using false statements such as 'The Aussiest Brand Ever' and 'we're a whole of true blue' according to the Herald Sun.

It also claimed the underwear company used deceptive hashtags such as #Aussieundies and #australianunderwear.

'The conduct of Sojo in trade or commerce represented to members of the public in Australia that TRADIE underwear is made in Australia and is the most Australian underwear' the court documents filed by Step One Clothing Australia claimed.

Rival company claims TRADIE underwear is not the 'Aussies Brand Ever' because products are made in China

'TRADIE underwear is not made in Australia and is not the most Australian underwear brand.

'The laundry tag attached to TRADIE underwear states that TRADIE underwear is ""Made in China"".'

A photo of the tag was also filed in court documents showing 'Made in China' was written on the label.

Directly above the manufacturing information it says the product is 'Australian family owned'.

Step One Clothing Australia listed underwear labels that are 'more Australian' than TRADIE because they are made in Australia including Tuffys & Tuffetts Merino Country Farm to Hanger and Wonderpants.

The company also claimed Sojo falsely stated the bags TRADIE underwear is sold in are 100 per cent biodegradable and is seeking an injunction to stop Sojo from continuing to claim products are the most Australian underwear.

It will ask the court to enforce a correction banner on the Sojo website for 60 days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LTEyL3FsZC1ib3dkZW4tbXVyZGVyLWNvdXJ0LWVpZ2h0LWNhc2VzLW1lbnRpb25lZC1sYXd5ZXItc3BlYWtzLzEwMDI4NzA5ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAyODcwOTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eight men 'bewildered' by murder charges over shooting of Finks member Shane Bowden lawyer says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-12/qld-bowden-murder-court-eight-cases-mentioned-lawyer-speaks/100287098 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LTEyL3FsZC1ib3dkZW4tbXVyZGVyLWNvdXJ0LWVpZ2h0LWNhc2VzLW1lbnRpb25lZC1sYXd5ZXItc3BlYWtzLzEwMDI4NzA5ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAyODcwOTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Last week the Supreme Court agreed to take up a class action suit filed by HIV patients who claim that CVS Caremark‚Äôs policy requiring them to obtain medications via mail or drop shipment is discriminatory under the Affordable Care Act

LOS ANGELES (July 10 2021) In response to the growing consolidation and increasingly monopolistic behavior in the pharmacy and health care industries AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is launching a new advocacy campaign to take on health and pharmacy giant CVS the sixth-largest corporation in the world over its anti-competitive business model which squeezes many independent and mom-and-pop pharmacies some to the point of forcing their closure.

The campaign ‚ÄòCVS: Corporate Vampires Suck (https://ahf.org/stop-cvs)‚Äô targets CVS over its fierce anti-competitive behavior specifically regarding its refusal to allow patients any choice in their pharmacy services. CVS‚Äôs currently forces most of its health plan patients from providers like Aetna‚Äîwhich CVS purchased for $69 billion in cash and stock in 2018‚Äîto obtain their lifesaving medications by mail order or drop shipment.

However given the nature of their disease HIV/AIDS patients often rely on the specialty services years-long relationships and expertise of their pharmacists often viewing them as reliable partners in their care. With 36 years of experience in the health care field AHF currently provides clinical care and other services to HIV/AIDS patients at 72 health care centers across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also operates a chain of 62 AHF Pharmacy outlets in 14 states Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.

‚ÄúCVS is a major threat to public health. While it began as ‚ÄòConsumer Value Stores‚Äô back in the 1960s those days are gone: CVS metastasized into a sharp-elbowed corporate behemoth buying up health plans for billions and forcing clients‚Äîincluding HIV/AIDS patients‚Äîto use their mail order services harming patients and fragmenting their care in the process‚Äù said Michael Weinstein president of AHF. ‚ÄúPatients are suffering AND small pharmacies are being squeezed and put out of business. That‚Äôs why we put some real teeth into this new advocacy campaign targeting CVS‚Äîwe need the public‚Äôs help to fight back against these ‚Äòcorporate vampires.‚Äô‚Äù

The ‚ÄòCVS: Corporate Vampires Suck‚Äô campaign kicks off in full force this week with a full-page full-color ad running in as many as five daily and weekly newspapers across the country with most landing Sunday July 11. The ad also ran in the weekly Houston Defender Thursday July 8. The Sunday papers include the Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel Houston Chronicle and the Chicago Defender (online next week) and will also appear sometime next week in Rhode Island‚Äôs Providence Journal. CVS is headquartered in nearby Woonsocket RI. The ads will be complemented by a radio campaign social media and a legislative call-to-action urging viewers and readers to contact their legislators asking them to help fight back against CVS‚Äôs monopolistic and anti-competitive behavior.

‚ÄúLarge health care insurance companies and national pharmacy chains distort the market by locking out competing independent retail and specialty pharmacies like AHF‚Äôs. This disrupts patient care and interferes with patient choice‚Äù added Scott Carruthers chief of pharmacy and senior manager for AHF. ‚ÄúOur new campaign shines a light on these abuses by one particularly egregious offender‚ÄîCVS‚Äîand calls for reform.‚Äù

Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Related Lawsuit by HIV Patients Over Pharmacy Choice

In a related but uncoordinated action last week the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to take up a class action suit filed by HIV patients who claim that CVS Caremark‚Äôs policy requiring them to obtain medications via mail or drop shipment is discriminatory under the Affordable Care Act. According to Politico Pro (Susannah Luthi July 22021) the court will consider antidiscrimination protections when it ‚Äú‚Ä¶ consider(s) whether the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and by extension the Affordable Care Act allows a ‚Äòdisparate impact‚Äô claim from plaintiffs alleging disability discrimination. In a class action suit HIV patients claimed CVS Caremark‚Äôs policy requiring them to obtain medications by mail order or drop shipment is discriminatory.‚Äù Politico Pro also noted the Supreme Court is likely to hold oral arguments in the fall.

In December 2020 AHF welcomed a lower court ruling in the CVS case that now goes before the Supreme Court. AHF publicly applauded a ruling issued December 9 2020 from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that people living with HIV can state a discrimination claim under the U.S. Affordable Care Act against CVS for requiring them to have only designated specialty pharmacies as part of in-network pharmacy services for private insurance plans. See Doe vs. CVS Pharmacy Inc.

As bars and eateries struggle to staff up several large restaurant chains have announced higher pay to entice workers to apply and stick around. Eating and drinking places added more than half a million jobs from March through June according to the Department of Labor. But the unemployment rate for the industry remains elevated hitting 10% in June up from 9% the previous month. And warmer weather typically ushers in higher demand for restaurant meals anyway putting more pressure on employers to add to their workforce. Enrique Lopezlira the director of the low-wage work program at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center said that the lack of access to child care and safety concerns are keeping many workers out of the labor force particularly women. ""Raising wages is good and it will attract workers but we're also seeing in the data higher rates of quitting in these jobs"" Lopezlira said. ""Long term I think these employers need to improve the overall quality of these jobs."" Some retailers and restaurants have tried to take steps to do just that. Walmart and Target  for example are opting to keep their stores closed on Thanksgiving so employees can stay home for the holiday. Best Buy improved backup child-care benefits and expanded access to caregiver pay benefits. However most companies are sticking to just raising wages or offering bonuses for now. As of June average hourly earnings are up 0.3% across all industries compared with the month prior and 3.6% compared with the same time last year according to the Department of Labor. On the flip side rising labor costs in recent years have also motivated restaurants chains to invest in automation technology like self-order kiosks or artificial intelligence software that can take a drive-thru order. Here are the restaurant chains that have hiked hourly pay this year or started offering bonuses:

Papa John's

Papa John's announced on Thursday new hiring referral and retention bonuses for restaurant workers at its company-owned locations. Corporate workers will earn an extra $50 for every new worker they bring into the fold while the new hires will also earn $50. Existing employees are also eligible for up to $400 in appreciation bonuses paid in increments for the rest of the year.

The pizza chain plans to spend about $2.5 million on the initiative for the remainder of 2021. While it's a hefty price tag giving out bonuses allows the company to give its workers more money temporarily in place of permanently changing its wage structure just in case finding employees is easier next year. About 14000 Papa John's workers will be eligible for the new bonus program. Roughly 18% of the chain's North American restaurants are operated by the company rather than franchisees.

McDonald's said in May that workers at company-owned restaurants will see pay raises of an average of 10% over the next several months. Entry-level employees will make $11 to $17 per hour and shift managers will make $15 to $20 an hour based on location. By 2024 ‚Äî roughly a dozen years after the chain's workers started the Fight for $15 ‚Äî it plans to pay employees of company-owned restaurants $15 an hour. ""I think what's happening is that you're seeing that a great economy is very helpful to growing employee wages and I think many of the changes that are happening from a wage standpoint are happening because of companies like McDonald's needing to compete for the best talent"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said at CNBC's Evolve Conference in June. However only about 5% of the company's U.S. restaurants are company owned. That means for the remaining 95% of locations in its home market wages are determined by the franchisee that operates the restaurant.

Darden Restaurants

In late March the Olive Garden parent announced that every hourly worker across its portfolio of restaurants will earn at least $10 an hour including tip income. In January hourly wages will go up to $11 and the following January they'll rise to $12 an hour. But Darden Restaurants executives have said that their greater focus is keeping the tipped wage despite President Joe Biden's pledge to eliminate it. In 43 states employers can pay their workers as little as $2.13 an hour as long as that hourly wage and tips add up to the locality's pay floor. If Biden succeeds employers would have to pay every worker at least $15 an hour even if they receive tips.

Chipotle Mexican Grill

Chipotle Mexican Grill is paying its workers an average of $15 an hour after rolling out higher pay across its footprint in May and June. Starting wages for hourly crew members are between $11 and $18. The company also introduced referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers to help it meet its recruitment goal of 20000 new employees for the summer. Executives said that customers will be paying about 4% more for their burritos and tacos as a result of the wage hike.

Texas Roadhouse

Texas Roadhouse executives said on the company's latest earnings call in April that the biggest challenge they're facing is staffing. ""It's never been more difficult to attract and retain employees. As a result we are also seeing wage rate increases to stay competitive"" CEO Gerald Morgan told analysts then. To offset the costs of paying employees more the company raised menu prices by 1.75%.

BurgerFi

BurgerFi recently rolled out a referral program for managers and assistant managers. ""We definitely have to compete in the marketplace for talent"" CEO Julio Ramirez said in an interview. ""But I think we have some unique advantages as well because of our situation as a growth brand and our cool image.""

watch now

The burger chain went public in December through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Ramirez said that the company is offering restricted stock units to restaurant managers and assistant managers as well. ""If we grow and our stock price grows everyone wins"" he said.

The Asian-inspired restaurant chain is offering referral bonuses. Additionally P.F. Chang's is taking steps to improve the work-life balance for its workforce. CEO Damola Adamolekun told Bloomberg that the company gave its employees the Fourth of July off so they could spend the day relaxing and enjoying the holiday. Despite these efforts the privately held company still has about 2000 unfilled job openings across its footprint.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hunt 70 of Moline has attended the Quad-Cities professional golf tournament since roughly its inception back when it was the Quad Cities Open at Crow Valley Country Club.

An avid golfer who has been playing at Oakwood Country Club for more than three decades Hunt eagerly awaits every year the opportunity to walk the course at TPC at Deere and follow his favorite golfers from afar.

This year Hunt was particularly eager to watch the clinch birdie putts the stunning green-side bunker shots and crushing drives after a year of no tournament because of COVID. He longed for the fond memories of bonding with friend and golfing partner Dave Stern 63 of Bettendorf over their love of the game and appreciation and awe of the talent and skill displayed by world-renowned golfers and looked forward to warmly celebrating the PGA Tour event's milestone 50th anniversary.

But 2020 proved unusually cruel.

Hunt president of Mid-States Specialty Sales which provides nuts bolts and fasteners to area manufacturers was diagnosed with a severe form of pancreatic cancer one for which he has undergone treatment for the last 18 months.

He feared he would never again step foot on the dew-soaked grass at TPC at Deere Run. Nevertheless he was determined.

""He's been a real fighter"" said Paul Rumler president and CEO of the Quad Cities Chamber who is friends with Hunt. ""He has this quiet resolve. No one would have known he was battling cancer. He's been golfing and working"" while undergoing treatment.

""He's been a great friend and dad to everyone"" Rumler said. ""Those are the stories that keep you going.""

On Friday after a year and a half of strength and fortitude Hunt defied his own initial exceptions ‚Äî and then some.

Hunt and Stern served as honorary observers an exclusive opportunity to watch the tournament up-close. The pair walked inside the ropes following directly behind a threesome of Howell Adam Long and Greg Chalmers.

""It means a lot. This is very special today to be so up close and personal (with the players and PGA Tour play)"" Hunt said. ""As avid golfers it's fun to see it up close and see the talent. ... It's just amazing the talent they have. It was kind of a tough year for everybody and it's good to have (the JDC) back and rolling again for sure. And it's been an amazing run ‚Äî 50 years. It's really quite a long tradition here.""

One he fully intends and expects to continue for years to come.

""Things are progressing and hoping for the best"" Hunt said. ""The treatment's been good and they're keeping me going.""

Returning the favor

Linda Little's purse is part badge of honor part time capsule. Her purse is covered with pins proudly representing her 46 years of volunteer service at the John Deere Classic.

The 80-year-old began began volunteering at the tournament back in 1975 back when it was the Ed McMahon-Jaycees Quad Cities Open played at Oakwood Country Club in Coal Valley Ill.

Little quit her job to take care of her sick mother who required full-time care forcing her to rely on public assistance programs ""to help keep us going.""

""I almost lost my house"" Little said.

Wanting to give back to a community that supported her and seeing the importance and impact of money raised by the tournament for local charities Little decided to volunteer.

""Because of the Birdies for Charity I thought this was a beautiful way to give back"" she said. ""And once I started I just kept going. I just come every year.""

While she and her family did not directly benefit from money raised from Birdies for Charity at the time ""but they now ... fund the things that I had to rely on back then"" including help from Project Now.

Little started out carrying the scoring sign with the scores of the group with which she was paired. That job however did not last long.

""I almost got pneumonia"" she said. ""They put us in these little tennis outfits. We barely had anything on. It was raining and a golfer put a jacket on me and put me in a cart.""

While she's had various jobs over the more than four decades working the tournament she's most recently driven shuttles ferrying members of the media to and from the course.

""It's my favorite thing to do"" said Little who sported tractor earrings and a green gold shirt of her joy of meeting new people. ""I've done it so long people from all over the country know me by name.""

As for her collection Little noted pins were first given out during the Miller High Life Quad Cities Open in 1982.

""They didn't have pins before that"" Little said. ""However gets this when I'm gone it won't be special to them but it's all real special to me.""

Asked of her favorite memory of the JDC Little recalled walking Tiger Woods off the golf course.

""That was special to me because I was really rooting for him"" she said. ""And he hadn't done really well golfing. So he wasn't in a very good mood. So we didn't get to talk. He kind of walked real quick and I was right beside him. That was the extend of that but that was still a highlight for me.""

A perfect introduction

Jude Shriver was a bit over-enthused for his first outing at the John Deere Classic. To the mild but slightly amused embarrassment of his father.

The 3-year-old over anxious for a memento to commemorate his first-ever experience at a PGA Tour event briefly ducked under the ropes in a dash to pick up Aaron Baddeley's tee shot on No. 9 that landed in front him a split second earlier. His father Mitchell Shriver of Montgomery Ill. quickly lunged after him and him pulled back behind the ropes.

Jude though would eventually get his souvenir on the 18th green being thrown balls tossed by Scott Brown and David Lingmerth.

""I just wanted to bring him to this tournament to introduce him to golf and just the experience"" Mitchell said. ""I just wanted to introduce him to the game and seems like a good tournament to come to. ... Perfect place to introduce him to it.""

The conditions weren't ideal for the field Sunday at TPC Deere Run but Lucas Glover still managed to carve out a 64. Getty Images

The strategy needed to win the John Deere Classic has for years meant one simple thing: make a ton of birdies. The numbers back it up too: no tournament has witnessed more birdies over the years than the JDC.

So when Lucas Glover mounted a comeback Sunday to win his first PGA Tour event in more than a decade there was only going to be one way to get it done ‚Äî with a bunch of circles on his scorecard.

Glover made five birdies on his final seven holes Sunday at TPC Deere Run including four straight on holes 12 through 15 to vault himself to the top of a packed leaderboard and win by two. When asked later what his mindset was it was unsurprisingly simple: ‚ÄúMake as many birdies as possible ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs kind of what happened.‚Äù

Glover distanced himself on the closing stretch from a group that at one point saw nine players within one shot of the lead on the back nine. And at this course at this tournament it‚Äôs almost always best to have more holes to play. Glover had signed for a final round 64 but many birdie opportunities remained for those still out on the course. Being the clubhouse leader is always good but it probably means the least at this tournament.

But every other player just ‚Ä¶ stalled out. Kevin Na Ryan Moore Adam Schenk etc. Each player had to see Glover‚Äôs 19 under tally as a very reasonable destination but none of them could get within two shots of that. Suddenly they had run out of holes and a 41-year-old was holding up the trophy.

Glover famously won the 2009 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black rising as high as 15th in the World Golf Ranking during the best stretch of golf of his life. He won the 2011 Wells Fargo Championship on Mother‚Äôs Day in 2011 and what followed after that was as he put it ‚Äúa long 10 years.‚Äù

Glover dropped outside the top 600 in the world in 2015 after missing 19 cuts during the 2014 Tour season. But after doubling down on changing his fitness regiment Glover‚Äôs results began to tick back up. Every year was just a little better than the previous one.

‚ÄúIt was just getting back refocused‚Äù he said Sunday. ‚ÄúI always thought I could do this again and I just needed to figure out the best way to go about it again.‚Äù

Those 19 missed cuts in 2014 were followed by just 11 in 2015. And then eight in 2016 five in 2017 and down to just three in 2018. Slow steady and sure progress culminating Sunday with another final round in contention and the first win he‚Äôd ever notched in front of his family.

‚ÄúI remember that was my biggest takeaway when Tiger won his last Masters is that his kids got to see him as a champ‚Äù Glover said. ‚ÄúThat was a goal of mine too.‚Äù

Now he‚Äôll get another Masters moment of his own earning his way back into the 2022 Masters field with his win this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYXRvdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sYXRlc3QvMjAyMS8wNy8xMC9jYW1lcm9uLWNoYW1wLXNlZWtpbmctYmlyZGllcy1hbmQtYmFsYW5jZS1hdC1qb2huLWRlZXJlLWNsYXNzaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cameron Champ seeking birdies and balance at John Deere Classic - PGA TOUR,‚ÄúObviously I'm going to put a hundred percent effort into this game.

How I can manage both of those to have my ultimate success.‚Äù,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2dvbGYvbmV3cy8yMDIxLWpvaG4tZGVlcmUtY2xhc3NpYy1sZWFkZXJib2FyZC1ncmFkZXMtbHVjYXMtZ2xvdmVyLWJyZWFrcy1kcm91Z2h0LWVhcm5zLWZpcnN0LXdpbi1pbi0xMC15ZWFycy_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9nb2xmL25ld3MvMjAyMS1qb2huLWRlZXJlLWNsYXNzaWMtbGVhZGVyYm9hcmQtZ3JhZGVzLWx1Y2FzLWdsb3Zlci1icmVha3MtZHJvdWdodC1lYXJucy1maXJzdC13aW4taW4tMTAteWVhcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 John Deere Classic leaderboard grades: Lucas Glover breaks drought earns first win in 10 years,"You are not supposed to win PGA Tour events in three different decades ‚Äì especially when 10 years have passed since you last won one ‚Äì but that's what Lucas Glover accomplished on Sunday at the John Deere Classic at TPC Deere Run with a two-stroke win over Kevin Na and Ryan Moore.

Glover shot a closing 64 with birdies at five of the last seven holes to race out in front get in the house at 19 under and watch everyone behind him stumble home. It was a rarity for the PGA Tour. Normally at a point-and-shoot finale like this one on a soft track like TPC Deere Run you don't post early and hold on but normally you don't see a lot of 64s from golfers in contention.

The 2009 U.S. Open champion has always been an elite ball-striker. That's what propelled him to a really impressive early part of his career and that's what carried him again throughout the week. He finished fourth in the field in that category and rolled in four putts from 12 feet or more Sunday. When Glover is banging in putts from that distance it's going to be a problem for the rest of any field he's going up against.

Glover struggled mightily in the middle of his career. After winning that U.S. Open and the 2011 Wells Fargo Championship his short game fell apart. From 2012 to 2015 it was a borderline disaster. Unsurprisingly all of his wins came either before or now after that time period. In recent years the short-game ship has been steadied and his top-10 percentage on the PGA Tour has skyrocketed. There were several tournaments where Glover contended but he still came into this week on a 10-year drought.

The list of players who have now won in the 2000s 2010s and 2020s is as intriguing as it is impressive and while nobody would ever compare Glover to Phil Mickelson or Dustin Johnson he shares an underrated and impressive longevity with them.

There are myriad underrated characteristics for golfers to possess. One of them is longevity. The ability to play at a world-class level for an extended period of time. When that happens (and you hit it like Glover does) normally wins just get in the way at some point. Glover possesses that characteristic and he's now had several victories ‚Äì including one Sunday at the John Deere ‚Äì get in his way over the course of a long and successful professional career.

With a final-round 68 and tie for second with Kevin Na he snagged the final spot in next week's Open Championship (coincidentally Na recently withdrew from the final major of the year). For Moore it's his first major since the 2019 PGA Championship (MC) and his first Open since 2018 when he finished T12 at Carnoustie. Moore is plenty accomplished over the course of his career but at this stage ‚Äì with just one major played since 2018 ‚Äì getting an Open invite (especially considering his record at Opens historically) is a big deal. However with a family trip planned next week it sounds like Moore is probably going to turn down the spot at Royal St. George's.

""I need to go talk to my wife about that but she's going to tell me to go"" Moore said. ""We've had a family trip planned for next week basically for the last few months and at this point in time in my career I've played a lot of golf tournaments. I don't want to bail on a trip like that. It was good to see my body feel good and feel good throughout the entire week but flying on a plane for 10 hours a lot cooler weather it's unpredictable how I might feel. So I might have to weigh those things and figure it out with her but I would say at this point I'm going to commit to going with my family."" Grade: A

Daniel Berger (T34): Berger was the favorite this week but he did not quite have his best stuff especially off the tee. On a week when several of the heaviest hitters in the game were scattered all over the leaderboard Berger lost strokes off the tee on the week. It wasn't a terrible performance and he'll take some nice form into next week's Open Championship with four top 20s in his last six starts but Berger surely expected more as the best player in a weaker field. Grade: B-

Steve Stricker (T41): The 27-time champion of this event (approximately) really got it going as he was 11 under through nine holes on Saturday in Round 3. Unfortunately he played the next 27 in 2 over to finish just outside the top 40 on the week. Still as one of the unofficial hosts here it's always a good week for Stricker even more so when he gets to sniff contention on the weekend. Grade: B+

""I had it really going yesterday and then the rain came and I just stalled big time"" Stricker said. ""Came out today hit it fine just never really scored very well in those tougher conditions this morning when it was raining. Got behind the 8-ball but I hit it nicely all week. At times just trouble getting it into the hole. ‚Ä¶ An enjoyable week. Always fun to come here and play and to be here at TPC Deere Run and the John Deere Classic is pretty special for me every year.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tdW5vei10YWtlcy0xLXNob3QtbGVhZC1pbi13aWRlLW9wZW4tam9obi1kZWVyZS1jbGFzc2ljL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tdW5vei10YWtlcy0xLXNob3QtbGVhZC1pbi13aWRlLW9wZW4tam9obi1kZWVyZS1jbGFzc2ljL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Munoz takes 1-shot lead in wide-open John Deere Classic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.ksnt.com/sports/munoz-takes-1-shot-lead-in-wide-open-john-deere-classic/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tdW5vei10YWtlcy0xLXNob3QtbGVhZC1pbi13aWRlLW9wZW4tam9obi1kZWVyZS1jbGFzc2ljL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tdW5vei10YWtlcy0xLXNob3QtbGVhZC1pbi13aWRlLW9wZW4tam9obi1kZWVyZS1jbGFzc2ljL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A decade ago Delta Air Lines (DAL 0.98%) became known as a savvy acquirer of used aircraft. However as its fleet aged and its cash flow surged toward the middle of the past decade Delta began ordering brand-new jets in increasing numbers. By late 2019 management was talking about a new fleet strategy focused on fleet simplification and a shift to new-technology aircraft.

However the COVID-19 pandemic caused Delta to rethink its fleet strategy once again. The airline has regained interest in used jets and has reportedly finalized at least two deals for used aircraft recently.

Why Delta used to love used aircraft

Delta exited the Great Recession with a weak balance sheet and plenty of aircraft in need of replacement: most notably 71 DC-9s that were 35 years old on average. It also needed to expand its fleet over the following years to take advantage of the recovery in air-travel demand.

The airline solved this conundrum by scouring the globe for out-of-favor jets that it could buy or lease cheaply. These included a slew of MD-90s acquired from various foreign airlines and 88 Boeing 717s subleased from Southwest Airlines. Delta's experienced maintenance organization gave it a competitive advantage in managing the resulting operational complexity.

By leaning on cheap used aircraft for most of its growth and replacement needs in the five years after the Great Recession Delta was able to generate solid free cash flow despite the slow economic recovery. That allowed it to steadily pay down debt bolstering its balance sheet.

More recently Delta changed strategies. First cash flow soared beginning around 2014 giving Delta the flexibility to ramp up capital spending. Second it became difficult to find parts for MD-90s a few years ago exposing a drawback of buying ""orphan"" aircraft that were produced in small numbers. As a result Delta has been spending billions of dollars a year on new jets recently and buying few (if any) used aircraft.

The calculus has changed

The pandemic changed management's perspective in three key ways. First the full-service airline accelerated the retirement of hundreds of jets last year in order to simplify its fleet and reduce costs. Second the pandemic caused Delta to burn billions of dollars of cash making balance sheet restoration a key priority for the next few years. Third used aircraft values have tumbled due to the sharp drop in air travel demand -- particularly outside the U.S. and China.

Once again used aircraft represent an elegant solution allowing Delta to replace the jets it plans to retire in a cost-effective manner. It has agreed to lease seven Airbus A350s from AerCap according to The Air Current (subscription required). These jets were previously operated by LATAM which decided earlier this year to permanently eliminate the A350 from its fleet even though its oldest A350s were delivered in 2016.

The Air Current also reports that Delta has reached a deal to buy 29 Boeing 737-900ERs that Asian budget carrier Lion Air previously operated. And the airline could potentially expand its used aircraft plans further depending on market conditions.

A new take on an old strategy

While Delta appears poised to scoop up dozens of used jets it hasn't actually reverted to its fleet strategy of a decade ago. The used jets it is pursuing this year are quite young: particularly the A350s. Moreover they fit with the airline's fleet simplification plans. Delta has 130 737-900ERs in its fleet today averaging less than five years of age. It also has 15 A350s plus orders for 20 more.

Despite pursuing relatively modern aircraft this time around Delta is likely to secure big discounts relative to pre-pandemic prices as the supply of used jets continues to outstrip demand by a wide margin. Thus it will be able to continue modernizing and simplifying its fleet -- and reaping the associated cost savings -- while keeping capex in check.

Investors got a glimpse at the alternative last month as United Airlines ordered 270 new jets to update and expand its fleet. This boosted United's capex commitments by more than $12 billion to a staggering $35.9 billion. Delta's move to capitalize on the availability of cheap modern used jets looks far more shareholder-friendly and will enable the company to fix its balance sheet much faster than rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lYXJuaW5ncy13YXRjaC1uZXh0LXdlZWstbW9zdC0wNTI2MjE0NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings to Watch Next Week: Most Big U.S. Banks PepsiCo Delta Air Lines and UnitedHealth in Focus,"Earnings Calendar For The Week Of July 12

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: JPMORGAN PEPSICO GOLDMAN SACHS

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr. (vs.$2.3B/qtr. cons.) for the remainder of this year‚Äù noted Daniel T. Fannon equity analyst at Jefferies.

Hold times are ridiculous‚Ä¶and seem to be getting worse. Wasn‚Äôt this what bailouts were supposed to prevent against? Instead the longer hold times demonstrate how airlines took taxpayer money pocketed it and still are operating with limited staff.

Absurd Airline Hold Times Prove How Dumb Bailouts Were

At Award Expert we‚Äôve been on the phone a lot this week with airlines including:

American Airlines

Delta Air Lines

United Airlines

The result has been a lot of frustration waiting for an agent. Like over four hours with Delta and two hours with United. Even getting up in the middle of the night to call Delta still resulted in a three-hour hold.

Granted if I put in SkyMiles Diamond credentials or United 1K credentials I can cut the time on hold dramatically‚Ä¶but we don‚Äôt abuse elite privileges by using special numbers for guests that do not hold that status.

And that means long holds‚Ä¶extremely long holds just like most passengers have to face if they want to book change or cancel a flight.

That all got me thinking. Remember how the airline bailouts were sold last year?

Which is why we need everyone taking action to extend the aviation jobs program of the CARES Act. These jobs can be saved ‚Äì keeping people employed connected to healthcare and able to support economic recovery rather than depression. https://t.co/1PHWfD5Ttw ‚Äî Sara Nelson (@FlyingWithSara) July 9 2020

But as View From The Wing correctly notes airlines took the money still reduced staff through separation programs voluntary furloughs and retirements and now are not able to keep up with travel demand returning. Exhibit A: Look at all the flights Delta and American and Southwest have cancelled. Exhibit B: the long hold times.

Think about it wasn‚Äôt CARES funding meant to keep everyone gainfully employed so the airline industry could boomerang back once a vaccine was developed and widely administered? How much collective American productivity has been lost when passengers must wait in excess of four hours on a hold to speak to an agent?

Remember to thank Congress for its regressive bailout of airlines next time you face a multi-hour hold time to change your flight.

Finally thank you American Airlines for the call-back option. It‚Äôs beyond absurd that Delta and United do not offer a similar option. A four-hour hold is much more manageable when a callback is scheduled at a specific time and then comes on time. It always beats hold music!

CONCLUSION

I will say that all the phone calls themselves one we got through were generally pleasant. I had a particularly nice chat with a Delta agent who helped me change the date on a ticket‚Ä¶something that should have easily been doable online but Delta‚Äôs website also leaves much to be desired.

But this is all so ridiculous. Talk about an inefficient system and this is hardly a problem that sprung up this week. Airline hold times have been bad for the last 2+ months and yet the airlines even American still have not found a way to get a full staff back up and running and reduce those waiting periods.

The streaming service opted to share the new episode on YouTube where anyone can watch it free of charge. The episode does a lot of good for its subject (William Holmes a 26-year-old Lead Supply Attendant for Delta Air Lines) and gives off the feel-good vibes fans love from the reality series. However one aspect is rubbing fans the wrong way.

The central narrative of the episode ‚Äî which Delta Air Lines sponsored ‚Äî revolves around William putting all his financial efforts towards paying down his student on debt. He keeps tight budgets and doesn't spend money on anything the Fab 5 would consider part of ""self-care."" It's a fact reiterated over and over again throughout the 48-minute installment and the Queer Eye team (Antoni Porowski Bobby Berk Jonathan Van Ness Karamo Brown and Tan France) teaches him to splurge a bit on himself to increase his quality of life.

This whole setup leads viewers to think Delta and/or Netflix might cap the experience off by paying off his student debt (or at least part of it). At the end of the episode no such thing happens. Viewers note that the student loan debt is clearly the main stressor in William's everyday life and while the help Queer Eye gave him is amazing assisting him financially would be even more life-changing. Delta and Netflix are huge corporations and this would not be too much of a reach for them. (It's also worth noting GMC Lyft Google Anthropologie and Uniqlo are listed in the promotional consideration section of the episode.) Scroll through to see some fans' thoughts on the matter."

Crypto art is opening up a whole new world of creativity and promotion for digital artists and entertainers as physical reality and virtual worlds look poised to become increasingly integrated.

Non-fungible tokens are attracting a wave of celebrities ‚Äî from pop star Katy Perry to rapper Jay-Z to billonaire investor Mark Cuban ‚Äî who recognize the opportunity creating NFTs gives them to reach a new market.

Comparing physical art with digital art is like judging vinyl records against streamed music said Les Borsai an NFT expert who has worked with the likes of Lady Gaga and Jason Derulo. One isn't better than the other.

""They both have benefits I enjoy ‚Äî streaming gives me ease of access while my records might give me more of a richness when listening to them"" he told Insider.

NFTs are revolutionizing how artists and content creators showcase and sell their work. They are digital tokens that represent assets such as music and video as well as virtual paintings and land. Encoded onto a blockchain ‚Äî the same technology that underpins cryptocurrencies ‚Äî they carry a digital watermark to demonstrate unique rights to the crypto asset.

They are expected to become an integral part of the tech-investment megatrend of the next decade. The volume of sales for NFTs soared to $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021 data from analytics company DappRadar showed.

There is more to digital art than just collectibles Borsai suggests. While critics see the crypto art boom as a craze he views it as a way for top artists to connect with something cutting-edge.

""As someone that came from entertainment and loved music that connected to the fringe I think cryptocurrency and NFTs offer that same connection"" said Borsai chief strategy officer and cofounder at Wave Financial a digital asset management firm.

The crypto expert spent a decade in managing recording artists after which he helped launch startups involved in digital music and cryptocurrency and began advising blockchain-based digital-payment network Ripple. He was also an early investor in ethereum's ether.

""The cryptocurrency and NFT communities are a community I can understand"" Borsai said.

""While I never have the skill set to be a coder I do have the ability to read 'Snowcrash' or 'Neuromancer' and see the potential of the future in the metaverse"" he added referring to cyberpunk novels that envisage a shared virtual universe.

As daily lives become more tech-centric trading digital collectibles has helped enhance and create a more interesting global marketplace. Musicians now understand the range of avenues available to share their work and make money from their careers.

Borsai predicted this trend would usher in a new version of social media in a collective virtual space. ""There will be a completely new type of social-media platform built ‚Äî NFTs will exist in the metaverse"" he said.

Some critics suggest the NFT boom may turn out to be a fad noting it's a very new market that many investors don't understand or know much about. But Borsai argues the innovations at the core of crypto art are creating better experiences for people and that makes NFTs less likely to be a speculative bubble. He pointed to the sales of digital real estate for instance. A digital house recently sold for $500000.

""It's an interesting thought experiment ‚Äî who thought digital land would be worth anything three years ago? This is just the beginning"" he said.

Meet the man who has the largest collection of Spice Girls dolls in the world - more than 300 mini versions of the bandmates worth nearly ¬£20000.

Adam Weatherly 36 got his hands on a his first doll - an 'On Tour Posh Doll' - as a kid in the late 1990s and has spent the past two decades adding to his impressive collection.

He has every single type of doll on the market but is still on the hunt for prototypes of Sporty Scary Ginger Baby and Posh Spice.

Adam has a dedicated 'Spice Room' in his home in Virginia USA to display the miniature versions of the iconic group.

Despite never having met any of his idols Adam hopes the 25th anniversary of Wannabe this week will spark a reunion.

The first dolls received widespread media attention when they were launched in October 1997 and were famously sold out within minutes.

He used to spend his pocket money on dolls from the supermarket but it was the invention of the internet and eBay that saw Adam's collection grow.

His biggest bargain has been unofficial bootleg dolls of the five in Dollar Tree and he says his most expensive purchase has been a collection for $150 (¬£109) online.

With half of his dolls in original packaging and out in display holders Adam's collection is estimated at ¬£18000 ($24850) -- with rare individual dolls worth up to ¬£70 ($97) each.

Adam's mammoth collection has garnered attention from Brit designer Kenny Ho who designed the Spice Girls' World Tour outfits.

Now as the Spice Girls' debut hit Wannabe turns a quarter of a century old this week Adam has applied to get the dolls into the Toy Hall of Fame.

Adam said: ""As a kid my whole life changed when those five women appeared telling me they would be giving me everything all that joy could bring.

""I've always loved and supported them and I always will.

""The moment I heard they were making dolls I promised myself no matter how many there were I was going to collect them all.

""I'm still currently at it 20 years on.

""I personally count bootlegs and variants so although technically I have them all by my standards I still have more to collect!

""They are the best-selling celebrity dolls of all time and I've been really happy over the years collecting them.

""I collect all different types of dolls and have 1000 altogether so it's difficult to put an exact number on the Spice Girls but I'd say it's over 300.

""I‚Äôve never paid insane prices for anything. The most I've spent is $150 on a set.

""My favourite set is the Concert Collection dolls. They're just visually stunning.

""The box insert shimmers and all their shoes have glitters.

""They are wearing replicas of the Spice World tour fashions.

""As for a favourite doll itself the On Tour Posh doll will always be the number one as it was the first one I ever bought.

""They are iconic and are little replicas of the Spice Girls themselves.

""They taught me as a kid you could do anything if you put your mind to it.""

Adam first started his impressive collection in the late 1990s and begged his dad to drive him to the nearest superstore to buy one but they were all sold out.

After starting his collection aged 12 Adam has spent the next 23 years on the hunt for more.

He said: ""There was an advertisement in a Sunday paper and I drove my parents nuts to drive me to the nearest K-mart to pick up one.

""My dad says get in the car and we'll go and get you one.

""We get there and there was none on the shelves.

""It was only when we went to a random gas station that I saw one on the bottom shelf.

""It was the On-Tour Posh doll.

""For sentimental reasons she'll always be my favourite. Plus it's a reminder of how much my parents loved me to be driving around to find one.

""I studied everything about the box and every tiny detail of her dress.

""The way her sticker and necklace glistened in the light. As if it were some kind of magic dust inside of that box. I personally believe the universe guides us at times.

""There are signs and callings we just have to listen to. I've wanted to give up so many times collecting them.

""You wouldn‚Äôt believe the time I‚Äôve spent trying to find them.

""I have a binder that weighs 23lbs that‚Äôs full of all the newspaper articles trade ads and other bits and pieces about the dolls.""

He said: ""I love each Spice Girl equally I know a lot of fans have a favourite but I‚Äôm very much all or nothing about everything in life.

""I'm such a big fan that when Ginger left my parents let me stay home from school because I was so upset.

""Unfortunately I‚Äôve never seen them live or met any of them. My dreams are always larger than life.

""Meeting or seeing them has always seemed like too big of a dream to come true even for me.

""I carry that little bit of hope it will happen but I try not entertain the idea of it.

""The best I can do is be a true fan to them.

""I'm currently in the process of sending all my Scary Spice dolls to Leeds Museum as it's her birthplace.""

Refraction AI's 4.5-foot tall 150-pound Rev-1 three-wheeled robot vehicle has been delivering pizzas in Austin Texas. The company believes the future of autonomous driving is 'zero occupant.' Source: Refraction AI

As companies like Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk come to Austin Texas the booming city and new tech hub has grown so much it has struggled to make good on its ""keep it weird"" motto. But since early June when residents of the South Congress Downtown or Travis Heights neighborhoods order pizza from Southside Flying Pizza their pies might arrive inside a three-wheeled robot ‚Äî the REV-1. But it is no full self-driving Tesla. About two dozen REV-1 vehicles now trundle down the roads of Austin and Ann Arbor Michigan where the company behind the robots ‚Äî Refraction AI ‚Äî first launched in 2019 in a bid to harness driverless technology in a new way. Autonomous vehicles and their potential to disrupt the way people get around have hovered on the horizon for years. But the technology hasn't matured as dramatically as early investors had hoped. Tesla says it is full speed ahead with autonomous and is launching its latest beta test on July 10 but the company has missed many self-imposed deadlines and Musk recently conceded that full self-driving is harder than he had forecast. Meanwhile both Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving research divisions in recent months. For start-ups like Refraction AI though the aim is to speed the arrival of a driverless future by starting small with more modest systems focused on moving packages rather than people. ""We think this is the future of autonomy"" Refraction AI CEO Luke Schneider said.

A 150-pound challenge to Alphabet Waymo

While one might technically call the electric REV-1 a driverless vehicle it's a completely different beast from the LiDAR-equipped multi-ton vans in development from Alphabet -backed Waymo General Motors -backed Cruise and other multibillion-dollar ventures. Musk has bashed LiDAR in the past calling it a ""crutch"" though recent reports indicate the company has recently used the technology for reasons that remain unclear. The REV-1 ""trikes"" stand 4.5 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds making their profile more like bicycle couriers than delivery vans. And they act like cyclists too. After a restaurant worker places the ""payload"" in a REV-1's storage compartment (which fits about six grocery bags) the robot uses an array of sensors to navigate to the edge of the road or if available a bike lane. It then drives away at no more than 15 miles per hour toward its destination where the customer greets it at the curb and unlocks their meal or package with a unique code. If the vehicle runs into trouble along the way which could include unusual obstacles like a curbed couch or common but tricky-to-automate moves like turning left across traffic or navigating crosswalks a dozen ""pilots"" are standing by to remotely and temporarily take control of the REV-1.

This is going to take a lot more money and a lot more time than we thought it was. It's not going to be a flip switch overnight. Luke Schneider Refraction AI CEO

In Schneider's eyes these distinctions give the REV-1 a crucial edge in the delivery business. The small slow carts can't do much damage in the event of a malfunction. They don't hog the road. And the outsourcing of the trickiest driving to the pilots means the company is ready to deliver food today. Spending years and billions of dollars to develop a fully autonomous 4000-pound vehicle and then using it to deliver pizzas to Schneider is overkill. ""I call it bringing a ballistic missile to a knife fight"" he says. So far the company appears to be making progress in solving this facet of the overall challenge of autonomous driving. They recently reconfigured the REV-1's sensors to give it night vision allowing it to work during the most popular time for meal delivery. Schneider says the REV-1 fleet carried seven times more meals early this year than it did late last and has continued to make more deliveries every month since March. The 50-employee company recently raised 4.2 million dollars in seed money for a total funding of $8 million.

Domino's FedEx and 'zero occupant' Nuro

Refraction AI isn't the only self-driving start-up thinking small. Nuro a California company that has raised about $1.5 billion in funding according to Crunchbase has developed a golf-cart sized delivery vehicle called the R2 capable of driving at 25 miles per hour. In April the R2 began delivering pizzas for Domino's Pizza in Houston Texas. Last week the company announced that its next-generation vehicle will deliver packages in a partnership with FedEx .

Nuro was founded by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu two former Alphabet engineers whose self-driving enterprise became Waymo. They were motivated by an assumption similar to that driving Refraction AI: Getting people entirely out of the equation would allow for a lower stakes first application of driverless vehicles. ""We set out to build a new class of vehicle designed purely for transporting things"" wrote Ferguson in a 2020 Medium post. ""A zero-occupant vehicle."" A Chinese startup Unity Drive Innovation has taken a similar approach to distributing vegetables and meal boxes during the pandemic.

Full self-driving dream economic reality

Even as mini-delivery carts start to venture out into residential streets and bike lanes self-driving behemoths continue to doggedly pursue the technology's full potential: vehicles that can carry anyone or anything anywhere without a driver. Alphabet's Waymo initially rolled out a partially autonomous beta test of its ride hailing service Waymo One in Phoenix Arizona in 2018. Last October it opened the service to the public simultaneously making it fully autonomous with no drivers and no remote pilots ‚Äî although it does use a ""fleet response team"" specialists who feed the cars information when the machines can't interpret an ambiguous situation such as construction or road closures. Waymo has also worked with UPS in Phoenix to shuttle packages between UPS stores and a local shipping hub. And two weeks ago it announced a partnership with trucking company J.B. Hunt to autonomously haul cargo across a route in Texas initially under human supervision. The company's leadership remains confident in what Julianne McGoldrick a Waymo spokeswoman describes as a flywheel effect. Once you develop a vehicle that can navigate the roads about as well as a human can you can use it for any number of applications that will mutually reinforce one other. ""We have seen that all the progress we're making on ride hailing and on passenger cars directly feed into the trucking and local delivery areas and then the progress we make there also goes back into ride hailing"" McGoldrick says.

By Jenny Moritz

Ave Maria Florida - In Ave Maria Florida controversies flow like water and wine. With problems at the local university condoms banned from local stores and shorts less common than Jesus a billionaire is in the spotlight.

Tom Monaghan the founder of Domino's built Ave Maria in 2005. ¬© 123rf/jetcityimage With tropical temperatures and palm trees at every turn the picturesque town of Ave Maria has the potential to attract millions of tourists every year. Packed to the brim with controversy it sadly seems unlikely that its motto ""A big kind of small town"" will ever truly come true. Just like its 10000 residents visitors also have to abide by a strict set of rules according to reports. These rules and requirements have made Ave Maria Florida highly controversial.

What rules and regulations have sparked the Ave Maria Florida controversy?

In the remote devout Catholic town the sale of condoms and other contraceptives is prohibited. As a result the typical family in Ave Maria have more children than you would usually overwise expect. There are no hotels or motels either with only the option if you want to rent an apartment or house being through the use of Airbnb. The town has two main draws. The first is the private Catholic Ave Maria University which has a fairly conservative dress code: tops without straps spaghetti straps shorts and ultra-tight clothing are all forbidden - unsurprisingly most of these restrictions are directed towards (you guessed it!) women. The second is a large cathedral that sits right in the center of town. Bizarrely this is where the town's founder - Tom Monaghan founder of Domino's Pizza decided to leave his mark: A giant Domino's logo crested into the sidewalk right in front of the church's entrance.

What is the history of Ave Maria Florida?

Ave Maria was built and financed by Domino's co-founder Tom Monaghan in 2005 less than 20 years ago. Religious families relocated to the Florida town which is a 40-minute drive from Naples and about two hours across the state from Miami because of its great weather and the opportunity to live with like-minded church followers. The university quickly gained popularity from college students around the country. Though it is relatively new it offers many scholarships something that is enticing for families who would normally struggle with the cost of a University education. Its population now includes 1000 students and nearly 10000 people. Pretty impressive for a highly Christian town built by the founder of a fast food pizza chain!

Ave Maria Florida's controversies don't necessarily trouble the residents",,,

Many were forced to close with no notice leaving many workers suddenly unemployed. Although some businesses were able to pivot to take-out and slowly recover some of what was lost or apply for Paycheck Protection Program loans to keep their workforc the government in 2021 established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund a $28.6 billion fund administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration to help those eligible businesses that were still standing to rebound.

The program which is no longer taking applications according to the SBA website has provided restaurants with funding equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss up to $10 million per business and no more than $5 million per physical location. Recipients are not required to repay the funding as long as funds are used for eligible uses no later than March 11 2023. Funds were approved in June.

As of Jun 30 there were 101004 U.S. businesses approved for $28574979472 in Revitalization funds. Of those there were 418 NH restaurants approved for $90697690.

For its part Mark Langenhof Business Development & Application Engineer within the Morssinkhof-Rymoplast group one of the biggest Plastics Recyclers in Europe points out that to date a lot of progress remains to be made in terms of plastic circularity. ‚Äú14% of plastic packaging is collected these days and only 2% is recycled back into its original application‚Äù he said.

Parts used in cosmetics are often small in size and can pass through screens at municipal recycling centres. This is why Morssinkhof-Rymoplast recommends the implementation of a deposit return schemes for multi-material packaging.

A recyclable and recycled material

‚ÄúSURLYN‚Ñ¢ is a material that has brought freedom to designers of the beauty world for many years‚Äù confirmed Shouhaib Mohamed EMEA Marketing Manager for Cosmetic at Dow. ‚ÄúIn contrast few people know that this material is compatible with HDPE recycling streams‚Äù he added. That‚Äôs why Dow worked with COTREP [1] to confirm this key issue.

Recycling solutions exist and SURLYN‚Ñ¢ packaging parts whether transparent or tinted are already parly recycled. At Luxe Pack 2019 for instance Dow had demonstrated in partnership with the Italian company Premi the possibility of creating elegant perfume caps using 40% of SURLYN‚Ñ¢ recycled resin. ‚ÄúSeveral retailers have already set up collection systems for cosmetic packaging‚Äù said Natacha Bitinis EMEA Application Technology Leader for Cosmetic and Rigid Packaging at Dow. Thanks to this mechanical recycling programmes dedicated to the SURLYN‚Ñ¢ are studied for which ‚Äúthe cooperation of all stakeholders will be necessary‚Äù. Of course volumes will be reduced at the beginning and there will also be quality limitations that are inherent to the use of post-consumer recycled materials.

That‚Äôs why Dow is already thinking about the next step.

Advanced recycling

‚ÄúIn the short term if we want to achieve scalable volumes and the same quality as virgin resin then we also need to work on another solution called advanced recycling‚Äù explained Shouhaib Mohamed. This technology complementary to mechanical recycling allows to break down mixed waste plastics into their original form to manufacture new virgin like quality polymers. With this in mind Dow has signed a partnership agreement with the company Fuenix Ecogy in the Netherlands. ‚ÄúThese technologies are well developed but requires a certain level of investment‚Äù he added.

As advanced recycling allows to achieve identical performance to virgin materials we are evaluating this option for many of our materials including SURLYN‚Ñ¢.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvb3RoYmF5cmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ2VvZmYtYW5kLWxpbmRhLWRvdy1jYXRjaC1maXJzdC1wbGFjZS8xNDkzMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Geoff and Linda Dow catch first place,"Anyone driving walking skateboarding or living on Kenney Field Drive knew it the moment they saw Geoff and Linda Dow‚Äôs Windjammer Days Porch Parade entry. This was going to win in the residential category. As neighbor Cathy Blake said ‚ÄúHands down it‚Äôs the one.‚Äù And it did.

Their island fishing village scene includes a dock a lobsterman carrying a trap with mermaid catch a painted backdrop of the ocean and island behind a 3D shack on the front of the house; and a mermaid and baby on a rock near a treasure chest near the driveway ‚Ä¶ pure magic.

July 8 Boothbay Harbor Region Chamber of Commerce presented the couple with the first place prize of $1000. Chamber Executive Director Lisa Walby with board members Julie Roberts and Alyssa Allen presented the check.

The Dows‚Äô longtime artist friend Mari McGuire of Gardiner and Ocean Point encouraged them to enter the competition. The three met several times to talk about what their interpretation of the theme Land Ho! would be.

‚ÄúWe knew we wanted it to be a fishing village and it had to include mermaids‚Äù Linda said. She loves them almost as much as she loves the moon.

Geoff wasn‚Äôt so sure he wanted to do the display but McGuire recalled that he said ‚Äúgo big or go home!‚Äù by the end of the first meeting.

‚ÄúI drew quite a few sketches with pretty rough dimensions to show them what I had for an idea‚Äù Geoff said. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted to bump out the door for a 3D effect.‚Äù

The mermaid tail in the front garden a gift McGuire made for Linda was going to play a larger role in some of the original sketches. Then McGuire found an image of a Norman Rockwell painting for a Saturday Evening Post cover in August 1955. The painting ‚ÄúMermaid (A Fair Catch)‚Äù is of a lobsterman carrying a trap with a mermaid inside on his shoulder.

While Geoff made the final sketches Linda and McGuire started gathering props with help from Roxanne Andrews and Mary Labbe.

Linda already had that mermaid tail. The lobster trap holding the mermaid is from McGuire‚Äôs lobstering days off Ocean Point in the 70s; the doll heads for the mermaids were borrowed from McGuire‚Äôs granddaughter; the lantern from the family‚Äôs camp was Geoff‚Äôs mom‚Äôs; the treasure chest and its baubles were items the Dows picked up over the years.

Three weeks before the June 26 deadline Geoff started building and painting the backdrop a Maine island scene. The fisherman‚Äôs skeleton is hinged 2 by 3‚Äôs tendons from 3/8-inch plywood muscle out of old swim noodles and the chest is old 2-inch blue scrap foam rags and shrinkwrap. McGuire used a pair of husband Vinny‚Äôs boots cut in half and then glued back together for the fisherman. Once he was built McGuire painted the head.

Repurposed plywood and leftover shingles from a shed project became the door; the waves were constructed from the covering that comes on pallets of plywood that get tossed away. Everything is made of repurposed and recycled materials.

‚ÄúI want to thank Senecal Construction Services for letting me work in the shop after hours to construct most of this‚Äù Geoff said. ‚ÄúEverything but the dock was done there.‚Äù

The 4-foot panels transformed into ‚Äúa typical Maine island scene and shack and doors were transported by truck to the house. The family ‚Äì Geoff Linda daughter Emily and grandson Dominic ‚Äì put it up on the front of the house.

What about that other mermaid the one on the rock near the treasure chest? ‚ÄúI had three days to get her from Gardiner to here‚Äù McGuire said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs made of anything and everything from the recycle bin ‚Äì torso is paper mache then she was sheet-rocked and painted ‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs uh she‚Äôs better from a distance. She‚Äôs so ugly the tide won‚Äôt take her out!‚Äù

The mom mermaid and the mermaid in the trap may not be as glamorous as Rockwell‚Äôs but clearly it all works.

Many cars have driven by slowly to check out the display. A family with a little girl stopped last week. The child was quite taken with the mommy mermaid and baby and all of the stuffed animal sea creatures including Nemo. Linda gave her it.

All told Geoff spent 40-50 hours over three to four weeks constructing the scene. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so impressed by the enthusiasm and creativity Geoff and Linda put into their porch parade entry. It‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù Walby said.

The porch parade also had commercial winners: First place St. Andrews‚Äô Village second The Ice Cream Hut and third The Smiling Cow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTEvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wNy8xMS9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow jumps 120 points to close just shy of 35000 on earnings optimism,"The Dow rose 126.02 points or 0.4% to 34996.18 a new record close. The S&P 500 added 0.4% to 4384.63 also a record close. The Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.2% to a new closing high of 14733.24. The S&P 500's gain for the year so far now totals more than 16%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just shy of 35000 as investors grew more optimistic ahead of second-quarter earnings reporting season set to kick off this week.

Investors appeared cautiously optimistic ahead of the start of second-quarter earnings reports. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs will be among the first big companies to report Tuesday before the bell. Both stocks were higher on Monday and financials led among S&P 500 sectors

""Most investors are expecting blockbuster earnings results and these will likely be peak earnings results"" said Jack Ablin chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""The most important element of these reports this week will be the outlook discussion from management and not necessarily the numbers of the last three months.""

Second-quarter earnings are expected to surge more than 64% from levels depleted by the pandemic a year ago according to estimates collected by FactSet. If companies deliver on those estimates it will be the largest growth rate since the last quarter of 2009 as the market was coming out of the Great Financial Crisis.

Names linked to the economic comeback from the pandemic were slightly weaker with Carnival Corp. and United Airlines lower. Meanwhile technology stocks showed pockets of strength with Tesla and Nvidia higher.

Shares of Walt Disney gained after ""Black Widow"" earned $80 million at the domestic box office from its debut the most of any film released in the Covid era. The company also said it garnered an additional $60 million from the movie in Disney+ sales.

Earnings season will largely be the driver of the markets in coming weeks and early signs are looking good. So far 66 S&P 500 companies issued positive earnings guidance into the second-quarter reports the highest number of companies since FactSet began tracking the number. All 11 sectors of the market are set to post growth with energy industrials consumer discretionary financials and materials seeing the biggest gains as the economy reopened.

""Continued earnings momentum should refuel investors' confidence in the recovery amid slowdown concerns and drive a rotation back into Value"" Bank of America's Savita Subramanian said in a note Sunday.

Along with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Pepsico will also report on Tuesday before the bell. Bank of America Citigroup  Wells Fargo  Delta Air Lines and BlackRock report on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley  Truist and UnitedHealth post results on Thursday.

Investors also anticipate important data to be released this week including key readings on inflation on Tuesday and Wednesday and June retail sales on Friday.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday and investors will be looking for any signals of fiscal policy updates.

""While earnings of course are going to be important most of the earnings really don't come out until next week and the week after"" Peter Boockvar CNBC contributor and chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group said. ""So while we'll focus on what the banks have to say...right now it's all about CPI tomorrow it's all about what Powell says and if he hints to the taper sooner rather than later.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hYnFqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvZG9yb3RoeS1kb3ctb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTI0MTIxMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dorothy Dow Obituary (1951 - 2021) - Rio Rancho NM - Albuquerque Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/abqjournal/name/dorothy-dow-obituary?id=12412121 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hYnFqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvZG9yb3RoeS1kb3ctb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTI0MTIxMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFrZWNvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy82OTY1Mi1sYWR5LW9mLXRoZS1sYWtlLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1hYm91dC1jeWFub2JhY3RlcmlhLWluLXNvZGEtYmF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lady of the Lake: Concerned about cyanobacteria in Soda Bay,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lakeconews.com/news/69652-lady-of-the-lake-concerned-about-cyanobacteria-in-soda-bay on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFrZWNvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy82OTY1Mi1sYWR5LW9mLXRoZS1sYWtlLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1hYm91dC1jeWFub2JhY3RlcmlhLWluLXNvZGEtYmF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

When disaster strikes homeowners often focus on repairing external damages that can be seen by the naked eye such as structural blemishes a leaky roof or fallen trees. But lurking within the walls ceilings and air vents is an invisible complication one that can cause severe illness and further damage to your home.

Mold.

‚ÄúIt is something that you can smell‚Äù JD Restorations Office Manager Yessica Mendez said. ‚ÄúYou may not always see it but you can smell it.‚Äù

Due to its sheer size and malleable nature as soon as a single mold particle interacts with water and moisture it can take up to 48 hours on average for mold to spread quickly throughout every nook and cranny such as under your carpets behind your kitchen cabinets and in your crawlspaces.

‚ÄúYou may repair the roof for example and that solves the problem from the outside‚Äù Mendez said. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt solve the problem from the inside. People will go straight to the roofing company without thinking about the internal damage behind their walls.‚Äù

Mendez left her life practicing criminal law in Venezuela and came to America in search of better opportunities. After taking a wide variety of jobs she found her place in restoration work.

‚ÄúStarting over it‚Äôs crazy‚Äù Mendez said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a change but I fell in love with restorations. I started as a pack-out tech where we take everything out of the house and into storage. We clean every item and rid it of mold before it can be brought back in.‚Äù

As the 2021 hurricane season gets in full swing JD Restorations located at 3357 Copter Road Ste 8 in Pensacola is ready to mediate and mitigate those damages caused by rising tide and storm surges.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here since Hurricane Sally but we‚Äôre still very new here‚Äù Mendez said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help them. People in Pensacola might think that we‚Äôre one of those companies that come and go and we‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Dr Nicola Brink said that ahead of 1 July ‚Äì when fully vaccinated people from the Common Travel Area were allowed to travel in without isolation ‚Äì more people had come forward.

‚ÄòWe did see a surge of interest and I think that‚Äôs important‚Äô she said.

‚ÄòAs we‚Äôve always said if someone initially declined a vaccination and has changed their mind we‚Äôre very happy to accommodate that request. I think if we get up to 93% double vaccinated adult population we will have done really well. Anything extra would be a bonus. But I would be very happy with 93% double vaccinated.

‚ÄòThat exceeded what I was expecting.‚Äô

A number of islanders have had their Covid-19 vaccination appointments changed because the centre at Beau Sejour is closing on certain days. A Health & Social Care spokesman said the changes have been made due to the lower number of islanders requiring their jabs. The current phase of the vaccination programme is coming to an end and rather than running two small clinics it was decided it would be better to run one large one they said.

There has been updated guidance given for young people going to organised activities.

Under-18s are not yet able to be vaccinated but children ‚Äì and in particularly teenagers ‚Äì can catch and transmit Covid-19.

There are already rules in place that state that a child who has been outside the island in the last 14 days will need to be tested before going back into a school setting. Yesterday that was widened to include holiday and sports clubs run during the summer holidays. Tests are free and must be done up to 48 hours before the first session. This testing regime is likely to remain in place into the autumn term.

Dr Brink said the move was a recommendation for children attending organised activities.

‚ÄòWe were specifically approached by some people running holiday facilities holiday camps and so on who asked what we could do to help them‚Äô she said.

Bassist Chris Campbell an original member of Seger‚Äôs Silver Bullet Band filed a 5-count complaint in April claiming the company he owns with his wife Courtney Campbell ‚Äî Crisco Inc. ‚Äî is owed an unspecified amount of money for tours in 2018 2017 and 2014.

Listed as defendants are Rock Storm Ltd. a Birmingham-based partnership between Seger and manager Edward ‚ÄúPunch‚Äù Andrews that handles Seger‚Äôs touring business Hideout Records & Distributors Inc. Gear Publishing Company both also Birmingham-based and 10 as-yet unnamed ‚ÄúDoes.‚Äù

A jury trial is requested.

The suit also alleges that Crisco along with Rock Storm and Hideout was embezzled by former financial manager Frank Copeland. The theft was discovered during late 2018 according to the lawsuit and Crisco charges that ‚ÄúAndrews and Seger‚Ä¶withheld and purported to recoup funds from Crisco to compensate themselves and their entities for the money that Copeland had taken from them‚Äù to the tune of more than $800000 ‚Äúdespite having no contractual right to do so.‚Äù

Further allegations are that Crisco and the Campbells in an attempt to avoid litigation repeatedly asked for accounting records and other information but only one financial summary was provided ‚Äî a claim the Seger camp denies. Rather a response filed in June to Crisco‚Äôs complaint says opportunities were provided for Crisco‚Äôs certified public account to audit Rock Storm‚Äôs books.

Attorneys for Rock Storm and the others being sued also deny claims that:

‚Ä¢ Crisco‚Äôs contract requires Rock Storm to pay a certain fixed percentage of net income from performances.

‚Ä¢ Rock Storm engaged in unlawful acts or is legally responsible to Crisco.

‚Ä¢ The contract doesn‚Äôt allow for recoupment or withholding funds owed to Crisco.

‚Ä¢ Crisco was part of The Silver Bullet Band‚Äôs formation as claimed but rather was hired to tour with the group.

Per allegations that Crisco wasn‚Äôt paid royalties as promised the Seger camp denied Crisco ever having a contract with Hideout. Rather what he received were ‚Äúvoluntary payments from Seger‚Äù that were halted due to the lawsuit.

Seger‚Äôs camp is seeking a dismissal of the case as well as reimbursement for attorney fees and other costs.

Oakland County Circuit Judge Martha Anderson who‚Äôs overseeing the litigation has ordered the parties involved to submit a joint case management plan at least one week prior to the case management conference scheduled for Aug. 10. Among other requirements the management plan is to include a ‚Äúgood faith estimate of damages sought for all claims and counterclaims‚Äù the court record shows.

Campbell began working with Seger in the early 70s and was with The Silver Bullet Band from its formation in 1974 through the Nov. 1 2019 conclusion of Seger‚Äôs farewell tour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0YWxpbmplY3Rpb24ubmV0L2F2L3BsZWFzZS1lbmpveS10aGlzLWdsb3JpYS1nYXlub3Itc2xpcGtub3QtbWFzaHVw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Please Enjoy This GLORIA GAYNOR & SLIPKNOT Mashup,"Mashup artist DYNAMIKE is here to give you the disco version of Slipknot's ""The Devil In I"" that you never knew you wanted!

(AP) ‚Äî Colonial Pipeline faces a fine of $200000 a day if it fails to improve the way it detects leaks in its U.S. pipeline system following a massive gasoline leak in North Carolina according to an agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Colonial is under an order to find and use a better leak detection system across its entire network citing several newly disclosed leaks over the years The Charlotte Observer reported.

Meanwhile State Sen. Natasha Marcus D-Huntersville said Colonial faces separate potential action by the state Department of Environmental Quality for the August 2020 leak in Mecklenburg County‚Äôs Oehler Nature Preserve.

The spill was among the worst in the state Michael Regan then-NCDEQ secretary said in September. Regan now heads the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The company eventually reported that almost 18 times more gasoline leaked from its pipe than its original estimate according to the June 15 settlement with the U.S. Department of Transportation‚Äôs Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Colonial said in a statement that it began to ‚Äúimplement learnings from the Huntersville incident almost immediately after it occurred.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe consent agreement outlines a number of steps that Colonial has agreed to undertake and we appreciate the opportunity to settle this matter following consultation with PHMSA‚Äù Colonial said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYW5hYmFwdGlzdHdvcmxkLm9yZy9ndXl0b24tamVzdXMtaXMtZW5vdWdoLWdldC1yZWFkeS1mb3ItdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyton: ‚ÄòJesus is enough‚Äô; get ready for transformation,"For the second convention in a row Mennonite Church USA executive director Glen Guyton sang his own unique version of a classic rock song to bring his message home at the final worship service.

This year it was ‚ÄúFree Bird‚Äù by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Guyton turned it into ‚ÄúFree Dove‚Äù with lyrics about the denomination‚Äôs emphasis for the next two years: transformation.

‚ÄúWhen we leave here today church will you still remember me?‚Äù Guyton sang backed by the worship band. ‚ÄúBut if I stay here with you church things just couldn‚Äôt be the same. ‚ÄôCause I‚Äôm free as a dove now. And this dove it must change.‚Äù

As the song ended Guyton donned a white cape decorated with strings of lights and ran across the stage.

Guyton‚Äôs message concluded the MC USA convention held July 6-10 at Duke Energy Center in Cincinnati with the theme ‚ÄúBring the Peace!‚Äù

‚ÄúTo bring the peace to survive to answer the call of God we have to change‚Äù Guyton said. ‚ÄúWe must reject our fear our sinful nature worldly disputes false purity. We must give control to God.‚Äù

Guyton offered a response to those who lament change in the church: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be upset that the church has changed. Be happy that the church has endured even though it may look different because we are connected to the Source.‚Äù

He said he hears many different voices across the denomination. Some liked the good old days and wonder if their voices matter anymore. Another is crying ‚Äúwell I guess I have to be white and Swiss German in order to matter; why did you invite us here if you didn‚Äôt really want us?‚Äù Another says ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we all get along?‚Äù

His message for all of them he said is in the words of a song he sang at the beginning of his message: ‚ÄúJesus is enough.‚Äù

Guyton offered explanations for MC USA‚Äôs membership decline in its nearly 20-year history after the merger of the Mennonite Church and General Conference Mennonite Church.

‚ÄúI believe our denomination is contracting for two reasons‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFirst is poor leadership. We have designed leadership systems that don‚Äôt fit who we are theologically. Bureaucracy is a deadly thing. We have too many managers and seat-fillers where we need leaders with vision compassion and roof-ripping faith.‚Äù

He was referring to a story in Mark 2 where friends brought a disabled man to Jesus by lowering him through a hole in a roof.

‚ÄúWe all need friends who are willing to tear some stuff up in order to get closer to God‚Äù he said.

The second reason for contraction he said is that we want to control transformation when actually God is in control.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some struggles since we came together as a denomination in 2001‚Äù Guyton said. ‚ÄúWe have numerous polarizations. We have various traditions . . . not to mention all the geographic and racial diversity.

‚ÄúBut the early Mennonites were so passionate and so devoted to their faith that they shared this great Anabaptist theology with us BIPOC [Black Indigenous and people of color] folks and many others.

‚ÄúWho would have thought that if you took this rich Anabaptist tradition from the rural parts of our country to the urban centers to the barrios that it wouldn‚Äôt begin to change? It would transform in ways that imitated the gifts and communities that adopted this new message.‚Äù

Guyton said the church‚Äôs true power is to be the symbol of hope restoration and community.

‚ÄúWe spend way too much time worrying about what we are losing rather than focusing on how we can grow and what we have to offer as the body of Christ‚Äù he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3RoZWFwb3BrYXZvaWNlLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2Fwb3BrYS13YW50cy1kb2ctcGFya3MtbXVsdGktcHVycG9zZS1maWVsZHMtYW5kLW1vcmUtcmVzdHJvb21zLWF0LW5vcnRod2VzdC1yZWNyZWF0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXR5LDEwODQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apopka wants dog parks multi-purpose fields and more restrooms at Northwest Recreation Facility,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://theapopkavoice.com/stories/apopka-wants-dog-parks-multi-purpose-fields-and-more-restrooms-at-northwest-recreation-facility,10843 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3RoZWFwb3BrYXZvaWNlLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2Fwb3BrYS13YW50cy1kb2ctcGFya3MtbXVsdGktcHVycG9zZS1maWVsZHMtYW5kLW1vcmUtcmVzdHJvb21zLWF0LW5vcnRod2VzdC1yZWNyZWF0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXR5LDEwODQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMC80LWJsYWNrLW9pbC1vd25lcnMteW91LXNob3VsZC1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Black oil owners you should know,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rollingout.com/2021/07/10/4-black-oil-owners-you-should-know/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMC80LWJsYWNrLW9pbC1vd25lcnMteW91LXNob3VsZC1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Since March the company has made more than $55 million in investments to revitalize the plant which has been vacant for almost four years.

In 2017 DuPont closed its Kevlar operation near Goose Creek less than six years after opening the factory citing declining demand for the product used in protective gear such as helmets and bulletproof vests.

DuPont announced a $40 million investment in March in the Berkeley County plant to expand production of Molykote its trademarked silicone oil that is used for damping sealing and lubricating outdoor equipment pressure systems and electrical gear.

The company is making an additional $16 million investment ‚Äì $13 million in property upgrades and $3 million in equipment ‚Äì to make unspecified medical supplies that will add 15 full-time jobs at the plant.

‚ÄúDuPont sees the value in the Cooper River site‚Äù said Bill Alexander plant manager. ‚ÄúWe are open for business and we‚Äôve got a hunger to grow our business at this site. We think there‚Äôs a huge amount of value and potential here at the site and we want to bring more investment here.‚Äù

When DuPont decided to consolidate its Molykote production the thought was to put its workers at several different sites in Michigan and Kentucky Alexander said. The company eventually made the decision to place the more than two dozen employees in South Carolina.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first investment in the plant since it was closed and it‚Äôs bringing life back to the building‚Äù Alexander said.

He declined to specify the type of medical equipment the former Kevlar factory will produce.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ready to make that public just yet‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat should come in the coming months.‚Äù

In effort to help DuPont revitalize the property along the Cooper River Berkeley County Council approved a tax break last month. The Delaware-based chemical company will receive a reduced tax rate ‚Äì from 10¬Ω percent to 6 percent ‚Äì for the next 20 years on its $16 million investment of equipment and property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdmlzdGEudG9kYXkvMjAyMS8wNy9zYWxlLWR1LXBvbnQtZXN0YXRlLWRld2V5LWJlYWNoLWRlbGF3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,82-Year-Old du Pont Estate in Dewey Beach Sets Delaware Record for Most Money Ever Fetched in a Residential Sale,"The 82-year-old du Pont estate in Dewey Beach Del. has sold for a record $9.1 million. The trio of purchasers plan to raze the property and build anew writes Kennedy Rose for the Philadelphia Business Journal.

The transaction represents the most expensive residential sale in neighboring Delaware.

The property known as Sandaway was originally listed for $11.5 million in March 2019. The sellers eventually reduced the price tag to $10.99 million later that year.

Alexis Felix du Pont Sr. built the estate in 1939. He was vice president and director of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. The property covers 0.79 acres and is split into the main home and a guest house.

The sale came after the town of Dewey Beach approved the division of the property into three lots. The approval to trisect the plot helped its sale resulting in the ‚Äúhighest and best value‚Äù said Kim Hamer an agent with Ocean Atlantic Sotheby‚Äôs International Realty.

Eaton of Deckham Terrace Deckham Gateshead was taken to Forth Banks police station in central Newcastle where he failed a breath test.

Prosecutor Ben Woodward said Eaton‚Äôs sample showed 59mcgs of alcohol in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs.

Mr Woodward added: ‚ÄúPolice were on mobile patrol when they witnessed the defendant struggling to negotiate a roundabout.‚Äù

Eaton who is in employment and defended himself in court said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just sorry. I thought that I was alright.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd had no food that day I decided to drive home.‚Äù

Magistrates in South Tyneside disqualified Eaton who pleaded guilty to drink-driving from the roads for 15 months.

They also fined him ¬£364 with ¬£85 court costs and a ¬£36 victim surcharge.

Police found guns at the home of a man who had been firing an air rifle at cars outside his home.

Christopher Townsend of Barley Close Little Eaton was arrested after police forced entry into his home following reports of him shooting at nearby cars from a window.

Police found two Italian-made imitation revolvers imported from Spain 50 live blank cartridges cannabis and a laptop which had 58 extreme pornographic images on it all of which were of adults when they entered Townsend's house.

But analysis later discovered that the weapons would only have been classed as lethal if a different form of ammunition was used which was not found by police.

Derby Crown Court heard how Townsend 24 lived with a mental health condition akin to schizophrenia and endured a difficult family upbringing.

Defending Townsend Stephen Cobley said that the defendant had complied with a Community Treatment Order imposed at the time of the offence on 31 December 2018 which requires him to take medication every month and a report from a doctor claimed that ""custody would have a very negative impact on the defendant"".

Sentencing Townsend to a three-year community order Recorder Adrian Reynolds said the circumstances of the case were ""obviously exceptional"".

He said: ""I have been very concerned about how best to protect the public from any future risk that this defendant may present.

""What the defendant had in his possession were straightforward blank cartridges.

""It seems obvious to me that I can avoid a custodial sentence in this case.

""All the circumstances in this case it seems to me amount to circumstances so exceptional that there is no public interest in sending this man to prison at all.""

Townsend had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of an imitation firearm one count of importing imitation firearms and another of possessing extreme pornographic images.

Townsend was also sentenced to 55 rehabilitation days for what the judge described as an ""obvious fascination"" with extreme material and 50 rehabilitation activity requirement days.

The imitation weapons cartridges and the laptop which contained the images are all to be destroyed with the charge for importing the firearms to lie on file.

And now this could mean the departure of a legendary player from FIFA 22 because of some trademark issue.

EA may have to remove legendary Diego Maradona from the game due to a ruling by the Argentina court. Notably Maradona is available in most of the FIDA franchise games including the recent one FIFA 2022. So this development can directly affect Electronic Arts and ultimately they might have to remove the iconic player.

Will the legend of football leave FIFA 22?

Diego Armando Maradona was one of the legends of football mainly known for his skills and achievements with the Argentina national team. The phenom from the 1986 WC winning team died from a heart attack in November 2020. Without any doubt he is one of the most popular players in the world. But unfortunately he might have to exit the game due to the legal dispute regarding the right to use his image in the game.

WATCH THIS STORY: The Best Metroid Games of All Time

According to some reports the legal authorities of Argentina have claimed the image right and highlighted the point that there is no legal agreement of Sattvica (Mat√≠as Morla‚Äôs company) with Electronic Arts.

Apparently Electronic Arts had a legal agreement with Stefano Ceri (close friend of Maradona and former manager). But unfortunately. Ceci failed to prove that he has any kind of legal right to make such an agreement with anyone.

Did they reach any conclusion?

The Argentina court ruled that the ownership of the image rights of the legendary footballer will stay with Sattvica only. As a direct consequence Electronic Arts may have to obliterate Maradona‚Äôs images from the game. Definitely this will be an enormous loss for FIFA 22.

In October 2021 FIFA 2022 released on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X Xbox Series S Xbox One PC Steam and Nintendo Switch. So this is an early blow to say the least.

We all (ok some) remember hearing those immortal words from Josef Fares during The Game Awards in 2017. Predictably the internet responded with celebratory meme-ing and pleasantly a broader discourse about the underestimation of video games as a thoughtful medium. One need only look at the viewership numbers for the latest TGAs (83 million) versus the Oscars (23 million) to see that the world took Fares at his word.

But Fares wasn‚Äôt there to kill the Oscars. In fact most of the interview focused on his newest release. It was a game unlike any in recent memory a bold innovation that flew in the face of conventional commercial wisdom. He called it ‚Äî somewhat ironically ‚Äî A Way Out.

In an era too often dominated by boardroom homogeneity and shareholder interests Fares launched a game that could not have survived any path outside of independent development. It is in short a co-op game in the truest sense of the word.

A Way Out was released in 2017 developed by Fares‚Äô Hazelight Studio and published by Electronic Arts. The development team built its reputation with another co-op classic Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons. This time Hazelight doubled down and did something truly unique: A Way Out is co-op ONLY.

Co-op is not a mode or a feature because having two players is literally the only way to play the game.

This is a very dramatic prison break. EA

Fares has explained A Way Out is best played as couch co-op a feature that has become anathema to most modern publishers. Why enable couch co-op when you can charge two people to buy the game? Even more shocking A Way Out came with a free copy for players to gift to someone so they could play together online. Guess what? It sold 3.5 million copies anyway.

A Way Out isn‚Äôt some gimmicky arcade game either. It follows the story of Leo and Vincent two inmates who make a daring prison break and must go on the run in order to get revenge on the man who set them up.

From the outset the game digs deep into co-op mechanics including some memorable sequences of the two of you shimmying back-to-back through ductwork and passing tools back and forth between your cells with one player always on the lookout for guards.

The rest of A Way Out is choc-a-bloc with honest co-op moments (including a game of Connect Four) alongside a bevy of classic crime story fare like shootouts and car chases. So while the story could‚Äôve fit into a single-player action title with ease the mechanics and gameplay are unlike anything you‚Äôll play elsewhere.

The co-op dynamic also plays into the story with players having to make split-second decisions that they may disagree on. Playing the game alongside someone is an absolute blast and the banter between Leo and Vincent mirrors some of this friendly tension.

A Way Out is available now on Xbox Game Pass making it the perfect choice for players who want to game but also want to experience this whole socializing thing people are raving about.",,,,,,

The unpiloted spacecraft made a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico south of Tallahassee Florida at 11:29 p.m. EDT Friday (0329 GMT Saturday).

SpaceX confirmed the capsule‚Äôs splashdown in a tweet as recovery teams converged on the Dragon spacecraft in the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX‚Äôs ‚ÄúGo Navigator‚Äù recovery ship was on station near the splashdown zone to pull the capsule out of the sea.

Once the Dragon capsule is on the deck of the recovery ship teams will open the hatch and retrieve time-sensitive research specimens for delivery by helicopter to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where scientists will begin analyzing the experiments.

The recovery ship will bring the capsule back to Cape Canaveral for refurbishment and reuse on a future cargo mission.

The Cargo Dragon spacecraft undocked from the space station at 10:45 a.m. EDT (1445 GMT) Thursday two days later than originally planned. Managers ordered the delay to wait for Tropical Storm Elsa to move away from Florida.

The unpiloted supply ship spent 33 days at the space station since docking there June 5 two days after launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mission was SpaceX‚Äôs 22nd round-trip cargo delivery flight to the space station since 2012. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Northrop Grumman to fly commercial resupply missions to the station.

On the trip up to the space station the Dragon capsule delivered more than 7300 pounds (3300 kilograms) of cargo including experiments and upgraded solar arrays. Astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet installed and unfurled the roll-out solar arrays on three spacewalks last month.

After unpacking the ship‚Äôs pressurized cargo cabin the station astronauts loaded some 5300 pounds (2400 kilograms) of research specimens experiments and other equipment for return to Earth according to a NASA spokesperson.

Experiments returned to Earth included a pharmaceutical investigation from Eli Lilly and Company looking at how gravity affects freeze-dried materials. On Earth freeze-drying medications for long-term storage results in layers with structural differences and scientists want to know whether specimens freeze-dried in microgravity on the space station have a different structure.

The Dragon capsule also returned an experiment evaluating how gravity affects the structure composition and activity of oral bacteria. The data could help design treatments to combat oral diseases on long-term space missions to the moon and Mars according to NASA.

Leah Cheshier a NASA spokesperson said the Dragon capsule was also loaded wih with spacewalk equipment including a pistol grip tool torque wrench cooling garments water sampling kits and spacesuit components such as gloves.

‚ÄúI want to say thanks to all the SpaceX and NASA teams and all the scientists engineers and researchers who have equipment on this vehicle‚Äù Kimbrough said after the Dragon spacecraft departed the station Thursday. ‚ÄúIt was a great vehicle. It kept us busy for this past month doing a bunch of great science.‚Äù

The Dragon spacecraft jettisoned its disposable trunk section at 10:41 p.m. EDT Friday (0241 GMT Saturday). The unpressurized trunk hosts the ship‚Äôs power-generating solar arrays.

The capsule next fired its Draco thrusters at 10:45 p.m. EDT (0245 GMT) for a nine-minute deorbit burn to slow the craft‚Äôs velocity enough to drop back into the atmosphere.

After plunging through the atmosphere with a heat shield to protect against scorching temperatures the Dragon capsule deployed its parachutes a few minutes before splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.

This mission was SpaceX‚Äôs second resupply flight to use the company‚Äôs upgraded Cargo Dragon spacecraft which is based on the design of the human-rated crew Dragon spaceship. The new version of the Dragon spacecraft is designed to be flown at least five times up from three missions on the earlier configuration.

It can also carry more cargo than the first-generation Dragon spacecraft.

After landing in sixth place following round one of the 2021 American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament at Edgewood resort in Lake Tahoe Steph Curry was back on the golf course on Saturday.

The Golden State Warriors point guard tallied 21 points in the tournament‚Äôs modified Stableford system in the opening round while playing in a pairing with his father and brother. Then on day two Curry laced his spikes with NFL veterans Larry Fitzgerald and Brian Urlacher.

During the second round of the tournament Curry went into his bag for a classic celebration. While his signature shimmy celebration is usually reserved for a long-distance 3-pointer the 33-year-old guard brought it to the golf course. After smashing an iron shot out of the tee box the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player broke out his shimmy dance.

Curry finished round two with a trio of birdies in the front nine. However Curry registered three bogeys and one double-bogey on the day. The seven-time All-Star guard finished the day with a 74 (+2). Curry notched 18 points in round two for the tournament‚Äôs scoring system.

On Sunday Curry will head into the tournament‚Äôs final round in a tie for sixth place. The 2021 NBA scoring champ trails the tournament leader John Smoltz by 12 points with 18 holes to play.

As of 2:40 p.m. the Evergy Outage Map reports that there are 437 active outages. It shows that a total of 7465 customers are still without power. The map shows the majority of outages over 50 are in the Topeka area.

I am a big fan of any new stateroom added during a refurbishment because these new staterooms are new construction and they generally get more storage space and a fresher look than rooms that have been part of the ship since the vessel launched.

During Royal Caribbean's recent upgrades as part of the Royal Amplification new staterooms have been added to ships in places that did not have cabins. Sure it adds a little more revenue for the cruise line but it also offers new cabin choices for guests.

On my Freedom of the Seas cruise in 2021 I booked one of the new staterooms on deck 11 to the left of the Vitality Spa in the forward area of the ship. The nice thing about this location is it is directly adjacent to the Solarium which makes it very convenient to get to your room from the pool deck.

I stayed in stateroom 1152 which is a Category J3 Junior Suite which can accommodate up to 4 guests.

Despite the name ""suite"" in the room category a Junior Suite is more like an extra large balcony than a true suite but it does offer a lot more living space than you will get in a standard balcony room.

The stateroom measures 299 square feet of living space.

Walking into the room you can quickly get a sense of the space and notice the fresh look the room has since it is new construction.

The first thing I noticed is just how much storage space there is in this cabin.

Like all Junior Suite rooms there is a large closet where you can store clothes hang up garments and probably stash anything bulky.

In addition to the closet there is another full-size closet in the middle of the room with drawers dressers and enough storage space for probably two weeks onboard.

I've noticed with Royal Caribbean's newer cruise ships much more storage space and that trend has carried forward with its new construction cabins as well.

Another welcome trend is many more outlets including USB outlets. The desk area has both.

The bed is a Royal King which could be converted into two twin beds if need be along with a large sofa.

According to Royal Caribbean the sofa can convert into a double bed although I did not try it out.

Pro tip there is a USB charger on the side of the phone next to the bed.

The bathroom looks similar to a balcony bathroom although it has a full tub instead of a stand up shower.

Being a Junior Suite your balcony is also extra large and it has a nice enclosed space to enjoy. I prefer this set up because it means there is shade on the balcony during certain times of the day.

The balcony is indeed quite large with enough space for two lounge chairs a table and two chairs. It measures 65 square feet.

You might notice the window washing equipment that was blocking part of the window. This is a trade off of these new rooms being in a new location. The washer unit is not always there but it seemed to be stationed there when not in use.

Personally I did not mind it since the balcony is wide enough to have most of it unobstructed although I do not spend that much time on my balcony (especially on a short 3-night sailing).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9leHBsYWluZWQtdmlydHVhbC1yYW0tZXhwYW5zaW9uLW9uLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virtual RAM: What is it how does it work and should you care?,"Virtual RAM dynamic RAM expansion extended RAM ‰∏Ä if you have followed smartphone launches over the last few months in India there is a good chance you‚Äôve heard at least one of these terms. RAM is something that every smartphone comes with and most people are aware of. However terms like Virtual RAM or extended RAM are relatively new and here we will try and explain what it is how it works and if you should really care.

All the aforementioned terms are the same on Android but things might vary based on how you trigger the feature and how much the brand limits it.

INTERACTION (Image credit: Realme) This article contains inputs from Sreehari Product Manager Realme Global

For context the Realme Narzo 30 5G which was announced a few weeks ago in India comes with 6GB of RAM but with Dynamic RAM Expansion feature the phone can get up to 5GB additional RAM which takes the total count of RAM to 11GB. Dynamic RAM Expansion is Realme‚Äôs marketing term for Virtual RAM. Similarly iQoo uses ‚Äúextended RAM‚Äù and Vivo just calls it Virtual RAM. In this article we will try to understand exactly what Virtual RAM is and everything you need to know about Virtual RAM on your smartphone.

While the feature is present only on a handful of devices now moving forward this feature might be an essential part of most smartphones in India. So before it goes mainstream here is what you need to know about Virtual RAM.

What is Virtual RAM?

To understand the Virtual RAM concept we need to first understand what RAM is. RAM on your smartphone is a volatile memory that is faster than any other type of storage. When you open an application on the phone it will be called a process and these processes(multiple apps) will be stored on the physical RAM in the background. RAM allows you to load apps quicker without much lag or delay.

On the same lines the Virtual RAM actually uses the phone‚Äôs internal storage as makeshift RAM ‰∏Ä which is popularly known as Virtual RAM.

(Image credit: Aakash Jhaveri)

In simple terms Virtual RAM is a feature where a portion of your phone‚Äôs internal storage will be used as additional RAM which effectively increases the total amount of RAM on your smartphone. As the name suggests this is a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù RAM which means the amount of extended RAM isn‚Äôt physically present as RAM on your smartphone.

For instance if a phone has 6GB RAM and 128GB storage and you extend RAM by 5GB technically you will now have 11GB of RAM and about 123 GB of internal storage.

How does it work?

For those who are familiar with Linux this feature is pretty commonly used and it's actually borrowed from the PC world to smartphones. While we had to get root access a few years back to extend and get additional Virtual RAM it's now much more simple ‰∏Ä just a toggle and you‚Äôre getting more RAM. The amount of RAM you can extend depends on the device and for now we‚Äôve seen from 1GB to up to 7GB of extended RAM.

When you toggle the virtual memory feature on your smartphone the phone actually allocates the amount of memory you‚Äôve selected as virtual but to allocate the space in the internal storage you will have to restart the phone. For instance the 6GB configuration of the Realme Narzo 30 5G supports an extension of 5GB taking the total up to 11GB.

Now let‚Äôs see how this feature actually works in real life. First things first if you extend RAM you won‚Äôt see a bump in the amount of RAM used by the system ‰∏Ä while the storage is allocated to Virtual RAM your physical RAM will be of the same capacity.

#UnleashPeakPerformance by giving yourself extra space and allowing yourself to run numerous apps at the same time while maintaining smooth overall performance. pic.twitter.com/kwynZxHOsVJuly 5 2021

To understand the concept of how Virtual RAM works let‚Äôs take an example here. Consider you have 10 apps open on your Android smartphone and there is no more space in the actual RAM of the phone so what actually happens in Android closes the apps which are not running in the background or performing any dynamic tasks in the background ‰∏Ä or the system just kills the app that has the lowest priority and whichever is the oldest app among the ten apps.

This is where the Virtual RAM comes in handy. Virtual RAM handles all the apps which do not have any dynamic functions in the background and will keep those kinds of apps in the memory for a longer period of time. The Android system will take care and prioritize which apps need to be stored in the virtual memory and which shouldn't be.

To activate the extended RAM you need to restart the phone.

Apps such as calculator which do not have many dynamic tasks running in the background will be moved to the Virtual RAM if and when needed. This is because the internal storage is much slower than the RAM and it won't be able to handle dynamic apps such as games or heavy apps such as payments apps or games. Only the less important apps will be moved to the virtual memory in Android while heavier tasks will always be kept on the actual memory.

The Virtual RAM will be used only when the physical RAM is running out of its limit to handle the processes. By using the virtual memory feature more apps can stay in the background for a longer period of time ‰∏Ä especially the lighter apps which will make way for heavy apps and games to stay in the memory as well. It is also worth mentioning that having Virtual RAM won‚Äôt actually boost the gaming performance.

Why is it coming to smartphones only now?

As said earlier this technology isn‚Äôt very new as we‚Äôve seen the same on PCs and smartphones with root access earlier. It‚Äôs fairly old technology and now users want more RAM on smartphones as they are using heavy apps and playing games on their smartphones.

A couple of years back 4GB was sufficient but apps have gotten far bigger and resource-intensive now. Since adding more RAM via the hardware route is difficult and expensive Virtual RAM is an easier way out for brands to offer more memory to users without incurring additional costs.

Just like 5G on smartphones this will also help in future-proofing the device. With apps like Chrome and games like Genshin Impact and BGMI taking up a lot of memory every bit of RAM will come in handy. Also it‚Äôd help when it comes with 4K video recording and AR apps which are all expected to go mainstream in the coming years. This is more like giving headspace into whatever possible users might do over the next few years.

Is it more useful on budget or premium devices?

While there is no difference in the implementation it will be the phones which have lesser memory that will make the most use of Virtual RAM ‚Äî which will usually be budget devices.

Yes smartphone OEMs can add RAM extension functionality via a software update. Though it‚Äôs not as easy as flipping a switch and calls for a lot of testing and optimization.

Will the type of internal storage used on phones affect the Virtual RAM performance?

While the on-paper difference between something like UFS 2.1 and UFS 3.1 storage might be big neither of them come close to how fast actual RAM is. And since only low-priority compressed processes are pushed to the Virtual RAM the perceivable performance differences are likely to be minor.

What to expect going forward?

Realme tells us that it wants to monitor how consumers use this feature if it helps their habits and if it is even useful. Based on the response it will consider adding or mending it for other devices.

The fact that memory expansion is still a relatively new concept on smartphones means that brands would also like to use it as a marketing point before it becomes too mainstream.

On that date JetBlue is planning to begin flying nonstop between New York-JFK and London Heathrow (LHR) with an ultra-premium plane offering a grand total of just 138 seats. Service to London's Gatwick Airport (LGW) will follow launching on Sept. 29.

Compared with many of the other planes flying on this route ‚Äî American Airlines often runs a Boeing 777-300ER with 300-plus seats ‚Äî JetBlue's Airbus A321LR almost feels quaint.

Still with JetBlue's latest products throughout the airline is able to offer a top-notch experience made even more luxurious by boosted service ranging from custom bedding in business class to upgraded economy meals.

While you're likely to have a great experience throughout the plane as always some seats offer a more comfortable ride than others. Whether you're booked in Mint business class or snagging a spot in coach I'll show you which seats to pick.

Mint business class

JetBlue's A321LR sports 12 rows of business class with all suites arranged in a 1-1 configuration. That means you'll be guaranteed a direct window view plus easy access to the aisle regardless of where you choose to sit.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

All suites also include a sliding door ‚Äî while it isn't quite as high as you'll find with some products such as Qatar's Qsuite business class when the door is closed you'll have a bit more privacy and separation from the aisle.

Which seats to pick

As I mentioned there are 12 rows of suites in business class starting with 1A on the port side and 1F across the aisle.

Just like on the A321neo suites in the first row are branded as JetBlue Studios with considerably more space to stretch out a large 22-inch screen and a buddy seat for a friend to join you for a chat or chew.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Studios require an additional payment of $299 each way though in some cases it could be worth the extra expense. If you don't mind the fee the studios at 1A and 1F would definitely be my first pick. Just note that since they're located at the front of the cabin light and noise from the galley and lavatories may be an issue.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

From there I'd move from the front of the cabin to the back. With 12 rows of suites I'd expect it to take a bit more time for flight attendants to reach the back rows and passengers seated closer to the front are more likely to get their first pick of meals.

Ultimately window placement is the most significant differentiator. Aside from the studios in Row 1 which include two well-placed windows I prefer the positioning in rows 2 3 5 6 8 9 11 and 12.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

If you're seated in rows 4 7 or 10 you'll still have partial views through two windows ‚Äî you may just need to tilt your head slightly to have a look outside.

Which seats to avoid

In general the farther back you sit the less likely you are to get your first choice of dishes. In many cases passengers are also served their meals from the front of the cabin to the back ‚Äî with flyers hoping to catch some shut-eye on short redeye flights to London every minute counts.

For those reasons I'd avoid sitting too far back since you could end up disappointed or waiting quite a while for your meal. While there's likely to be more aisle traffic closer to the front of the plane as flight attendants pass by your seat to serve flyers seated behind you can close your door to minimize the impact.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Meanwhile if you see 12A appear as available for any reason you'll definitely want to avoid selecting it ‚Äî this particular suite has been designated as a pilot crew rest and if you're able to snag a spot there you'll almost certainly end up getting moved.

Even More Space

JetBlue's A321LR offers just four rows of extra-legroom JetBlue-branded 'Even More Space' seats located between rows 14 and 17.

(Editor's note: The blankets and amenity kits that appear in the economy photos below do not represent the products that JetBlue intends to offer on its upcoming London flights.)

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

'Even More Space' passengers can expect to find up to six inches of additional legroom. These seats also come with Group A boarding and expedited security where available.

Which seats to pick

'Even More Space' seats in Row 14 offer well even more space. Positioned at the second exit row you won't have to worry about passengers seated in front reclining into your lap.

On flights between New York and London expect to pay an additional $139 for window or aisle seats in Row 14 and $129 for the middle ‚Äî there's a caveat to note at the window though as I'll explain below.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

After that I'd select any of the window or aisle seats in rows 15 16 or 17 which all come along with a $129 price tag on flights between New York and London.

Which seats to avoid

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Middle seats ‚Äî obviously unless you're traveling with friends or family or okay with being squished between two strangers.

If you tend to use the armrest I might also avoid the window seats in Row 14 ‚Äî because they're next to the exit you won't have a proper armrest which could end up being a bit uncomfortable on longer flights.

Core (economy)

Just 24 of JetBlue's economy seats fall into the 'Even More Space' category ‚Äî the remaining 90 are branded as 'Core' the carrier's standard coach product.

In addition to free high-speed WiFi available throughout the plane each seat includes in-seat power USB-A ports and high-output USB-C ports letting you charge the latest devices a bit more quickly.

There's also a 10.1-inch HD touchscreen at each seat loaded with on-demand entertainment and live TV.

Which seats to pick

JetBlue's A321LR cabin is remarkably consistent with at least one window at every row.

With the exception of rows 22 and 23 which I'll detail in the section below I'd choose aisle or window economy seats in any row with a slight preference for seats closer to the front of the cabin since you're likely to end up getting served earlier in the flight. You'll also encounter less traffic in the aisles since the snack bar and lavatories are located at the rear of the cabin.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

I'm also very curious to see if passengers like flying in Row 13 at the very front of the economy cabin. Bags need to go in the overhead bin for takeoff and landing but these seats offer a bit more personal space since they're at the bulkhead.

It's a mixed bag though ‚Äî the armrests are fixed and you can't recline given that the second exit row is just behind.

Which seats to avoid

Rows 22 and 23 have missing or misaligned windows so you might want to avoid sitting there especially if you're next to the window. I'd also avoid middle seats in any row ‚Äî labeled as ""B"" and ""E"" on this plane.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Finally I'd avoid sitting in the last rows since passengers may gather there to access the lavatories and snack bar which are all located just behind Row 31. Note that the A B and C seats in Row 31 are reserved as a flight attendant crew rest so it may not even be possible to select that row.

Bottom line

Wide-body aircraft are a more common sight on flights across the Atlantic and with two aisles higher ceilings and a more spacious feel there are some clear advantages to flying on a larger plane.

That said with flight times of between six and seven hours ‚Äî or even shorter on JetBlue's upcoming flights from Boston (BOS) ‚Äî these transatlantic hops are barely longer than a trip across the country which most flyers wouldn't hesitate to book on a narrow-body jet.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

It's also important to note that this is not your typical narrow-body plane. It's the first single-aisle Airbus to feature the company's special 'Airspace cabin' offering fancy lighting and modern design elements.

Pair that fresh cabin with speedy WiFi bigger seats and seat-back entertainment throughout and you'll barely notice that you aren't crossing the Atlantic on a wide-body jet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtY2FuLWdldC1tb3N0LW9sZWQtc3dpdGNoLWZlYXR1cmVzLWZvci1qdXN0LWRvbGxhcjUwLWhlcmVzLWhvd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You can get most Nintendo Switch OLED features for just $50 ‚Äî here's how,"The Nintendo Switch OLED is almost here. This refreshed version of the Nintendo Switch console brings a slew of welcome upgrades to the wildly popular home console/handheld hybrid.

While it‚Äôs not quite the Nintendo Switch Pro we were hoping for it still brings a range of useful upgrades including a larger OLED display a wide adjustable stand a new dock with an ethernet port extra internal storage and enhanced speakers. It‚Äôs not a revolutionary refresh but it‚Äôs a solid evolution of the already very nifty original Nintendo Switch.

If you don‚Äôt currently own a Nintendo Switch and are in the market for one picking up an OLED model is practically a no-brainer. However plenty of OG Nintendo Switch owners will likely to debating whether or not to upgrade from their launch units.

Don‚Äôt trade in your original Nintendo Switch model just yet as with just a $50 investment you can actually get many of the flagship features of the OLED Switch. Here‚Äôs how.

A wide adjustable stand

(Image credit: Nintendo)

The Nintendo Switch OLED announcement trailer made a big deal about the new stand that comes built into the latest model of the console. For good reason; the tiny kickstand on the original Switch is pretty lackluster and is functionally useless in a lot of situations like a turbulent flight.

The Switch OLED‚Äôs stand not only wider but also adjustable so you can opt for the perfect viewing angle when playing in tabletop mode. However a cheap accessory for the OG Nintendo Switch gives you the exact same features.

The Lamicall Adjustable Stand can be used for a range of products from tablets smartphones and of course the Nintendo Switch. This third-party accessory gives your OG machine all the features of the Switch OLED‚Äôs new stand and it‚Äôs just $15 to boot.

Lamicall Adjustable Stand: $14 @ Amazon

This adjustable stand gives you the ability to play your Nintendo Switch from whatever viewing angle is most convenient. It can also be used with tablets and smartphones as well.

A dock with a wired LAN port

(Image credit: Nintendo)

Anyone who takes competitive multiplayer seriously ideally should be playing with a wired internet connection in order to reduce latency. The new dock that comes with the Nintendo Switch OLED includes an ethernet port to facilitate this.

However you can easily do the same on the original Nintendo Switch with a standard USB ethernet adapter. Just plug this accessory into the USB-A port on the original dock and you‚Äôve got yourself the ability to play online via a wired connection. You get can an official adapter for around $30 but a third-party option will do the job and will only set you back $13.

This solution does create the slight annoyance of having a dong sticking out of your Switch dock but that‚Äôs likely preferable to having to fork over hundreds of dollars for a whole new Switch. Plus Nintendo has confirmed it will sell the new Switch OLED dock separately and it‚Äôs compatible with original consoles so that‚Äôs another solution.

UGREEN USB Ethernet Adapter: $13 @ Amazon

This third-party USB ethernet adapter plugs into the standard Nintendo Switch dock and allows you game with a wired internet connection for lower latency and smoother gameplay.

Increased internal storage

(Image credit: Nintendo)

The original Nintendo Switch comes with a messy 32GB of internal storage whereas the Nintendo Switch OLED comes with double that 64GB to be precise. It‚Äôs a handy upgrade especially when you consider that there are plenty of Switch games that require 20GB+ of install space.

However this upgrade is rendered almost moot by the microSD card slot that can be found underneath the original Switch‚Äôs kickstand. You can pick up an officially licensed 128GB card for around $20 which gives you plenty of extra space to play with.

If that‚Äôs not enough you can also get 256GB or even 512GB cards but these are more expensive and unless you have a gigantic library of digital Switch games are probably slightly overkill.

SanDisk 128GB microSD card: $23 @ Amazon

Increase your Nintendo Switch storage with this officially licensed SanDisk microSD card. It'll take you a good long while to fill 128GB but if you loathe deleting games there are bigger sizes available as well.

The upgrades you can‚Äôt get

(Image credit: Nintendo)

Of course it goes without saying that the biggest upgrade of the Nintendo Switch OLED is in the name. The 7-inch OLED screen is the headline new feature of the latest Switch model.

Unfortunately unless you‚Äôre very good at performing extensive console modifications yourself this is an upgrade you can only get by stumping up $350 and buying a Nintendo Switch OLED.

While the larger screen is nice the Nintendo Switch OLED doesn‚Äôt come with a resolution bump so there is an argument to be made that 720p games could actually look worse blown up compared to the standard Switch‚Äôs 6.2-inch LCD screen."

The arguments were made at a meeting at the Umana Yana which is part of a series intended to craft the terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the massive US$900 million project to pipe associated gas from Guyana‚Äôs offshore oil wells to be transformed into energy at a plant at Wales West Bank Demerara.

Yesterday‚Äôs session came after a virtual meeting on Thursday where ExxonMobil‚Äôs affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) faced a barrage of questions from Guyanese professionals on who would be owner of the gas piped ashore and why there were plans to sell portions of it to an unknown third party.

EEPGL submitted an application to the EPA in June this year for an environmental authorisation. The Company notes in the summary that it entails the construction and operation of a 12-inch pipeline approximately 220 kilometers long from the Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2 Float-ing Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels in the offshore Stabroek Block to an onshore natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas processing plant (NGL Plant) located at Wales. The pipeline is expected to transport up to approximately 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of dry gas to the Natural Gas Liquid Plant but has a maximum flow of approximately 120 MMSCFD.

During the meeting yesterday several persons questioned the need for such a project especially since there are others in the works that would cater for a similar amount of energy and would be less costly. It was pointed out there are projects such as the 165-MW Amaila Falls Hydro-power Project along with the Hope Wind Farm project which boast almost the same services as the gas-to-energy project and which are more environmentally-friendly. It was also stated that the government has been leaning towards providing solar energy where those projects may fall short which is notably also less costly.

According to several attendees the fact that so many energy-related projects are expected to be undertaken but there is still need for a gas-to-shore energy project does not make any sense.

Commenting on this issue one of the attendees stated that it seems as though no one has done a proper study even as energy seems to be their primary concern. ‚ÄúThis project doesn‚Äôt make an ounce of sense. There are power plants in Kingston Garden of Eden Berbice and here we are talking about fire in the sea wherever the pipeline goes‚Äú he said while noting that if this project goes ahead the proper systems have to be in place to address such issues.

However he noted that the existing power plants are using heavy fuels and this gas project will allow Guyana to use fuel that is less damaging to the environment so the real question would be ‚ÄúHow soon will we be able to replace gas with total renewables?‚Äù

Proprietor of the Kaieteur News Glenn Lall subsequently questioned EEPGL representative and Production Manager Mike Ryan as to why the Company is imposing such a costly and potentially disastrous project on the Guyanese people if other renewable options are available.

He went on to state that such a project need not exist even as a transitional

venture as one can move straight from fossil fuels to renewable energy albeit slowly. He noted that the hydropower project would not cost Guyana as much money as the gas-to-shore project.

Several persons went on to ask for confirmation that there are indeed several energy-related projects ongoing in Guyana and the EPA in response stated that there are some in operation while others are in the works. ‚ÄúOh so then we don‚Äôt need fossil fuels anymore the world is moving away from that?‚Äù an attendee subsequently asked.

Guidelines

Apart from that the question as to whether the recently withdrawn new Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) guidelines would be included in the terms of scope for the EIA was once again brought to the forefront. However the EPA said that the guidelines were withdrawn so that further consultations can be done and noted that even those guidelines specifically catered for offshore oil and gas operations but that the gas-to-shore component of it was not factored into those guidelines.

Despite that response many were of the opinion that those guidelines were still critical as they would have contained key regulations on the oil and gas industry.

It was also asked whether ExxonMobil and its partners would be providing insurance coverage should there be a blowout or if a pipeline is damaged as they are yet to disclose whether they have signed the document mandating parent companies to provide full insurance coverage should there be an oil spill.

Several persons made their dissatisfaction regarding insurance coverage known as they protested outside the Umana Yana.

The EPA said that if authorization is given liability and legal fees and other aspects relevant to the permit will be included while Ryan stated that they will operate in line with international best practices and come under the guidelines of the Ministry of Natural Resources and the EPA.

Meanwhile Ryan disclosed that the projected US$900 million cost of the project is only an estimate and this figure can rise.

With the impact assessment for the Wales gas-to-shore project imminent the EPA has invited public submissions on the scope of the study for the project which is expected to begin operations in 2024. In a public notice the EPA noted that the project with attendant onshore and offshore components could have possible effects on the environment including impacts to marine water quality air quality marine and terrestrial flora and fauna and socio-economic resources among others

As a result it has determined that an EIA must be undertaken before the project is approved. Members of the public are invited to make written submissions to the agency within 28 days of the EPA notice setting out those questions and matters which they require to be answered or considered in the EIA.

The planned government-owned power plant is not included in the scope of the project‚Äôs application except for its consideration when addressing cumulative impacts for the Project.

Persons have until July 25 to send questions or submissions to the EPA so that their concerns may be considered in the EIA.

EEPGL will pay for the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) and other studies. It will also be selecting the consultant for the project since according to this country‚Äôs current EPA Act the contractor has to select the consultant from an EPA-approved list of persons.

The next scheduled public scoping meeting will be held on Monday at the Diamond Primary School at 5:30 pm.

On Thursday at the virtual hearing Simone Mangal asked ‚ÄúWho owns the gas? Is it a joint venture? Who owns the pipeline? Who is the selling the gas? How much dry gas does the country demand?‚Äù She also demanded to know the purpose of transporting gas through a pipeline to Guyana only for it be sold to third parties.

Maya Trotz asked if local demand is enough for such a project to be undertaken and if climate change was taken into consideration before a decision was made to undertake the project. ‚ÄúIt would be helpful to have access to all the documents [relating] to the project‚Äù she contended.

Director of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Guianas Dr David Singh stated that he recognises that this is the largest project in Guyana‚Äôs history and stated that the WWF will be making detailed submissions to the EPA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS5tdC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA3LTExL25ld3NwYXBlci1vcGluaW9ucy9UYWtpbmctZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWxzLXRvLWNvdXJ0LTY3MzYyMzUwNjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taking fossil fuels to court,"ExxonMobil is one of the richest and most powerful companies in the world. Just last week Greenpeace released recordings of ExxonMobil lobbyists boasting about the devastating impact their multinational oil and gas corporation has had on the ability of the world to fight climate change. Fossil fuel companies have known about the climate crisis for decades but they have spent billions to prevent anything from being done about it. This is why it is time to legislate against them.

This year court cases have been won delivering amazing and unprecedented victories for the environment. In Germany the supreme constitutional court recently ruled that the government‚Äôs climate protection measures are insufficient. This ruling was on the enshrined need to protect future generations. The German government has until the end of 2022 to improve its Climate Protection Act. Court action is leading to more meaningful action and judges have taken the hard decisions where politicians fail. This follows a similar case by Friends of the Earth against the Irish government in 2020.

Another incredible court victory took place in a district court of the Hague in May of this year. This time instead of against a government it was against one of the most powerful corporations in the world. The Hague ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The company's obligations to future generations according to both law and science were confirmed by law.

Such drastic victories are particularly meaningful because they set a precedent. Other courts around the world hearing similar cases will have an example to follow. After decades of fossil fuel companies intentionally muddying the science lobbying politicians and preventing effective action it is time for laws to be created which prevent such active measures against environmental action. Activists around the world are pushing for an ecocide law.

France is on course to have ecocide illegal but Malta can push for this law to be adopted on a European level. Malta can punch above its weight in the European Parliament European Council and can petition the European Commission to enshrine ecocide into European legislation so fossil fuel companies will be obliged to change their ways. Actions like those admitted to by the ExxonMobil lobbyists would then become illegal. As it stands they boasted how they may derail Biden's climate plan. The consequences have never been more severe and such actions have never been more vile. Let us empower citizens so that they will be able to hold government and companies alike to account in courts of law if need be.

In the last seven years various courts have awarded the sum of N836.318bn (N98.318 billion and over $1.8billion) to oil-producing communities in Niger Delta as compensations for oil spills and land encroachment an independent data seen by Daily Trust on Sunday indicated.

Some of the court‚Äôs decisions are however being challenged at appellate level.

Since the discovery of crude oil in commercial quantity in Oloibiri community in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State in 1956 and its subsequent extraction in 1958 complaints and struggle of host communities in the region have largely hinged on environmental pollution occasioned by oil spills and gas flaring.

These host communities have battled multinational oil companies operating in their areas for compensation and cleanup a situation that led to many legal battles. Some of these legal tussles end up with award of billions of naira as compensations to the communities.

In 2014 a High Court awarded N205.60 million to Okia community in Delta State while Obotobo Sokebolo Ofogbene and Ekeromor Zion communities were awarded N30.2 million on August 14 2015 by the Supreme Court of Nigeria.

In 2018 other communities numbering 350 were also awarded $1.8 billion by a High Court.

In Rivers State Mr Ken Ojiri was awarded N82.7 million for land encroachment on October 4 2018.

Also Ejama Ebubu communities in Tai Elema Local Government Area of Rivers State were awarded N17 billion on November 1 2019 by the Supreme Court.

The latest was Ibeno community in Akwa-Ibom State which was awarded N81.9 billion on June 21 2021.

However despite the many court judgements awarding billions of naira as compensations Daily Trust on Sunday observed that the condition of the people of Niger Delta communities ravaged by oil spills have not improved.

In Bayelsa State some of the communities affected by oil spills and environmental degradation include Egbebiri in Biseni clan Yenagoa Local Government Area; Ikarama community Agbura/Otuokpoti communities both in Yenagoa and Ogbia local government areas; Oruma in Ogbia and Koluama in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area.

The oil companies that mostly operate in these communities include Shell Agip and Conoil.

Checks by our correspondent revealed that most of the communities hosting oil platforms are still languishing in poverty hardship and lack of social amenities while oil exploration is going on.

In most of the oil-bearing communities their sources of potable water farmlands and rivers they used for fishing have all been polluted by the activities oil companies without any effort for remediation.

This year alone there were over six incidents of oil spills in different communities in the state with its attendant effects of pollution forcing several communities to institute legal actions against the oil companies.

It was gathered that some communities that have secured judgement against oil companies are finding it difficult to get payment.

Last February a Dutch Court of Appeal ruled in favour of four farmers in Oruma community Ogbia Local Government Area ordering the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) to pay compensation to the farmers over the oil spills that impacted negatively on their crops.

The court also ordered the SPDC to carry out a cleanup of the area over a 2008 oil spill that adversely impacted their farms.

Some indigenes of Oruma community told Daily Trust on Sunday that Shell was yet to effect the cleanup of the community as directed by the court. But it was not also ascertained if the four farmers were compensated as directed by the court.

In his reaction to the court verdict on Oruma community last February Mr Bamidele Odugbesan the media relations manager of the SPDC said the company was disappointed by the verdict insisting that the incident in question was caused by sabotage.

He noted in a statement that most leaks from its operations were caused by vandals.

He stated ‚ÄúWe continue to believe that the spills in Oruma and Goi were the result of sabotage. We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that the SPDC is liable.‚Äù

He however told Daily Trust on Sunday that on the issue of Goi and Oruma a potential settlement option was being explored.

How oil spills devastate lives

Ibeno is one of the oil-rich communities in Akwa Ibom that has placed the state as one of the highest earners for the Federation Account.

A Federal High Court in Abuja had on June 21 2021 awarded a cost of N81.9b to be paid as compensation by the ExxonMobil Oil Company.

Daily Trust on Sunday reports that the money-spinning drilling of oil has left many communities in the area in a pitiable state.

Our correspondent gathered that oil spills are regular occurrences in the environment as no year passes by without one.

The secretary of the Village Council of Okoroutip community in Ibeno Mr Enyina Wilson attributed the spills to corrosive oil pipelines. He added that the spills had destroyed both their water and soil saying they can no longer plant crops.

He said the community had been forced to resort to drinking refined water as they cannot drink from natural sources due to pollution.

He said gas flaring activities by ExxonMobil had destroyed the roof of houses in the area such that whenever it rained particles from flared gas and oil could be found floating on top of the water.

Wilson said that even the atmosphere had been contaminated by oil drilling activities and spills adding that sometimes during the daytime the atmosphere would emit smoke that is injurious to the eyes and harsh to the body.

‚ÄúDuring the dry season buildings vibrate at night. Our roofing sheets except long-span don‚Äôt last more than six months. It has affected the lifespan of people in the community. People don‚Äôt live up to 80 years; highest would be 76. So if we don‚Äôt maintain ourselves we grow old quickly‚Äù he stated.

He also revealed that oil spills had impacted negatively on the economic fortunes of the people adding that its frequency had destroyed aquatic life in the area.

He lamented that the community which used to be rich in seafood like periwinkle and fishes (which were readily available in the swamps streams and rivers) now travel towards Cameroon to catch fish.

He lamented that despite the situation in the community ExxonMobil was not treating them well.

Recently the president of Ibeno youth/woman leader Ms Maureen Effiong who led a protest on the plight of the community insisted that ExxonMobil must pay the community the sum of N81.9b awarded them by a court in June 2021.

Already Ibeno stakeholders had in a town hall meeting in the palace of their paramount ruler His Royal Majesty Owong Effiong Archianga started strategising on how to spend the compensation fund.

They set up a 15-man management committee to ensure the payment of the compensation to Ibeno communities within a reasonable timeframe.

But their hope of receiving the compensation may still be a pipe dream as ExxonMobil has disagreed with the position of the court on the matter Daily Trust on Sunday learnt.

In an official mail on the position of the company to our correspondent in Uyo Mr Oge Udeagha the manager media and communication of ExxonMobil said the company had appealed the decision of the court.

He said ‚ÄúMobil Producing Nigeria operator of the joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation disagrees with the decision of the court and has appealed the decision.

‚ÄúWe will continue to prioritise the health and safety of our people communities and environment where we operate.‚Äù

In Rivers State a number of communities were awarded compensations by various courts. Findings indicate that while some of these communities were paid others have not received theirs.

The Hague Court of Appeal had in the judgement held Shell‚Äôs Nigerian subsidiary liable for two leaks that spewed oil over an area of a total of 60 football pitches (soccer fields) in two villages saying it could not be established ‚Äúbeyond reasonable doubt‚Äù that saboteurs were to blame. Under the Nigerian law which was applied in the Dutch civil case the company is not liable if the leaks were the result of sabotage.

One of the farmers involved in the case and a traditional ruler in Goi Chief Eric Dooh commended the verdict saying it was a victory ‚Äúfor the entire Niger Delta region.

The case will however be continued as the court wants clarification about the extent of the pollution and whether it still has to be cleaned up.

In 2013 The Hague District Court ordered Shell Nigeria to compensate one of the four farmers involved in the case for making it too easy for saboteurs to open a well head that leaked onto his land. However the court cleared Shell of blame in the pollution of the other three farmers‚Äô lands and ruled that Shell‚Äôs Dutch parent company could not be held liable.

Both sides appealed and judges ruled in 2015 that Shell could be held to account in Dutch courts for its actions in Nigeria. The judges also ordered Shell to give the plaintiffs access to documents that could shed more light on the cause of the leaks and how much Shell management knew about them.

But the traditional ruler of Goi Chief Dooh told Daily Trust on Sunday that his community and some of the farmers who were affected by the oil spill were yet to be compensated.

He called on Shell to expedite action towards the payment of the compensation and cleaning of the polluted environment.

Speaking an environmental activist Fnyface Dunamene told our correspondent that Shell was yet to compensate many of the Ogoni communities impacted by oil spills.

‚ÄúIn terms of payment of compensation in Ogoniland it is in a few cases that it has happened. I think the issue of compensation should be taken seriously especially when the incident that caused a spill is attributed or traceable to equipment failure by oil companies through a joint investigation visit.

Shell/Ogoni communities exploring settlement options

The SPDC said it was exploring potential settlement plan with its Ogoni host communities concerning all the issues of compensation arising from court judgements.

Harris made the remarks in an interview with BET News on Friday as part of an argument against voter ID laws including those in some states that require a photocopy of ID to vote by mail.

'I don't think that we should underestimate what that [compromise on voter ID laws] could mean' Harris said.

'Because in some people's mind that means you're going to have to Xerox or photocopy your ID to send it in to prove who you are. Well there are a whole lot of people especially people who live in rural communities who don't - there's no Kinkos there's no OfficeMax near them' she added.

'Of course people have to prove who they are' Harris said but 'not in a way that makes it almost impossible for them to prove who they are.'

The remarks drew mockery from some on Twitter who said that they were able to make photocopies despite living in rural areas.

'I live on top of a mountain on the WV/VA border and I can photocopy my ID. I mean I do it while moonshining White Lightning while dueling banjos play in the background but I can still do it' one person tweeted.

'I grew up in a rural community without an OfficeMax or a Kinkos and I managed to successfully make photocopies of things on many occasions' another wrote.

Another critic called the claim 'insulting and untrue' and added 'Bottom line: Kamala you need to start forgetting all about 2024 before the Democrats do it for you.'

Others pointed out that the Kinkos brand has not existed for 17 years since the chain merged with FedEx.

Harris' remarks come as Congress fiercely debates a proposal to pass a sweeping Democratic bill on elections which would create universal mail-in voting and same-day registration in every state among many other changes.

Congressional Democrats are facing renewed pressure to pass their bill after a Supreme Court ruling Thursday made it harder to challenge Republican states that pass election security laws that make it harder to vote.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ruling an 'unprecedented assault' that 'greenlights the brutal accelerating campaign of voter suppression.'

Speaking in Florida President Joe Biden said he would have 'much more to say' soon but largely sidestepped comment.

For their part Republicans show no sign of willingness to engage with Democrats on the issue.

After a tough battle between the two clubs in the first half hour SKC II scored the game‚Äôs lone goal in the 38th minute. Enoch Mushagalusa received the ball outside the 18-yard box from a corner kick on the left side. The forward then turned and dribbled inside the box before firing a shot that took a deflection on its way into goal.





ATL UTD 2 began the second half by dominating possession. After a long spout of possession in the 78th minute the ball found its way to Aiden McFadden in the right flank where he served a lobbed ball into the six-yard box. Danial Sebhatu rose up and headed the ball on frame but Kendall McIntosh denied him to keep it a one-goal game.





Atlanta continued to push on in search of an equalizer. In stoppage time Connor Stanley drove across the top of the box and found Darwin Matheus near the right corner of the box. The forward fired a low bending ball to the left corner of the goal but the keeper made the save.





ATL UTD 2 (3-5-5 14 points) will return to action against Louisville City FC on July 17 at Lynn Family Stadium (ESPN+ 7:30 p.m. ET).

ABOUT ATL UTD 2



ATL UTD 2 is owned and operated by AMB Sports & Entertainment and is the United Soccer League (USL) affiliate of Major League Soccer‚Äôs Atlanta United. ATL UTD 2 joined USL for its expansion 2018 season and plays its home matches at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Georgia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5na2MuY29tL25ld3MvcmVjYXAtc3BvcnRpbmcta2MtZWFybnMtZ3JpdHR5LTEtMC1yb2FkLXdpbi1vdmVyLWF0bGFudGEtdW5pdGVkLTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recap: Sporting KC II earns gritty 1-0 road win over Atlanta United 2,"Sporting Kansas City II (3-7-4 13 points) secured their second straight road win on Saturday night as Enoch Mushagalusa bagged a sensational solo goal to spark a 1-0 victory over Atlanta United 2 (3-5-5 14 points) at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Georgia. Goalkeeper Kendall McIntosh made two impressive late saves to collect the clean sheet and extend Atlanta‚Äôs winless run to six matches.

Head coach Paulo Nagamura deployed a Sporting KC II lineup that notably featured two sets of brothers: midfielders Cam Duke and Christian Duke started together in a professional match for the first time ever while twins Jahon Rad and Kaveh Rad were also selected to a lineup that boasted six Sporting KC Academy products and six MLS players on loan from Sporting Kansas City.

A pair of Academy graduates combined for Sporting KC II‚Äôs first chance in the seventh minute. Right back Kayden Pierre blistered his way down the right flank and delivered a low cross into the box for forward Wilson Harris who forced Atlanta goalkeeper Ben Lundgaard into a strong save.

The visitors drew first blood in the 38th minute thanks to a sublime individual effort from Mushagalusa. The 21-year-old winger received a short corner kick from Jahon Rad did brilliantly to slither past Alexander Garuba and Bradley Kamdem Fewo and toe-poked a shot that deflected into the top corner beyond the outstretched Lundgaard. Mushagalusa now leads SKC II with five goals this season three of which have come against Atlanta at Fifth Third Bank Stadium after he bagged a brace in a 2-2 draw between the teams on June 9.

Mushagalusa nearly went from scorer to provider in the 52nd minute galloping free of the Atlanta defense and squaring the ball from the right side of the box but Harris‚Äô close-range strike lifted over the crossbar with the gaping net at his mercy.

Newly signed Sporting KC II forward Jamil Roberts who on Saturday night was also nominated for Best Play at the 2021 ESPYS for his NCAA championship-winning goal with Marshall University in May earned his professional debut as a second-half substitute. The Englishman almost marked his maiden appearance with a world-class goal however his 28-yard thunderbolt rattled the woodwork and skipped out of play.

SKC II held Atlanta without a shot on target until the 78th minute when substitute Danial Sebhatu planted a powerful header on frame prompting Mcintosh into a phenomenal reflex save. The hosts had another last-gasp attempt go begging four minutes into second-half stoppage time as McIntosh dove right to cast aside Darwin Matheus‚Äô speculative strike through traffic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hc2lhbi1sYW50ZXJuLWZlc3RpdmFsLWRheXMtYXdheS1mcm9tLWxpZ2h0aW5nLXVwL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hc2lhbi1sYW50ZXJuLWZlc3RpdmFsLWRheXMtYXdheS1mcm9tLWxpZ2h0aW5nLXVwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asian Lantern Festival days away from lighting up the night,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox8.com/news/asian-lantern-festival-days-away-from-lighting-up/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hc2lhbi1sYW50ZXJuLWZlc3RpdmFsLWRheXMtYXdheS1mcm9tLWxpZ2h0aW5nLXVwL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hc2lhbi1sYW50ZXJuLWZlc3RpdmFsLWRheXMtYXdheS1mcm9tLWxpZ2h0aW5nLXVwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

AUSTIN Texas ‚Äî The nation's most sustainable community in the southeast neighborhood of Easton Park near William Cannon Drive and McKinney Falls Parkway ‚Äì that's what Tesla Energy Brookfield Asset Management and real estate developer Dacra want to do with SunHouse at Easton Park.

The developers said the project will have sustainable features installed in phases to allow for ongoing learning and innovation.

Brad Chelton is the Texas President for Brookfield Residential.

""It's pretty ambitious"" Chelton said.

Besides the Tesla solar tiles he said it's Teslas' Powerwall 2 battery storage that makes this technology feasible.

""Typically historically solar you make power during the daytime when you may not need it because people are at work or school things like that. But then when you need it the sun's not shining in the evening. What the battery does kind of solves for that"" Chelton said.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said ""neighborhood solar installations across all housing types will reshape how people live.""

Dacra CEO Craig Robins said ""our goal is to establish that fully sustainable neighborhoods are not only viable but the best practical and economical choice.""

All of which makes Easton Park resident Lateef Johnson just a little bit excited.

""I own a fitness business. I'm a personal trainer. A lot of my clients own Teslas. And I asked them 'Hey is it really you know what it's cracked up to be?' And every single one of them has had such great things to say about you know owning a Tesla. So putting that aside to now know that brand is attached to the neighborhood that I live in. And it wasn't like 'I chose Eastern Park because of that. It's just I'm living here.' And that's a part of what the next phases are. As you mentioned the future of Easton Park is so freaking cool"" Johnson said.

Chelton said the prices of homes range from mid- to upper $300000 for 1400- to 1500-square-foot-size homes and $500000 to $600000 for 2700- to 2800-square-foot homes.

The first phase which is around a dozen or so homes go on sale next month. He said those should be complete by the end of the year.

The neighborhood will be developed on land in Brookfield Residential‚Äôs Easton Park master-planned residential community in southeast Austin but will be designed and marketed separately according to the release.

Sustainable features include Tesla V3 solar roof tiles and Powerwall 2 battery storage installed at homes in the community. The community will also incorporate EV charging stations in each home.

Developers anticipate residents of these homes will produce sufficient energy to supply daily needs and reduce the daily demand on the electric grid. Residents will be provided with backup storage in the event of a power outage and potentially could be compensated for returning power to the energy grid.

The first phase of installation began in June with a sampling of homes under construction. The initial installations will provide insight and information on product integration which will guide the installation at the next phase of significantly more homes the developers said.

‚ÄúThe City of Austin is excited for the arrival of these affordable options to housing powered by renewable energy‚Äù said Austin Mayor Steve Adler. ‚ÄúI am excited for the Tesla Brookfield and Dacra partnership‚Äôs approach to sustainable energy and housing as an example of the out-of-box thinking that continues to make our community a beacon of innovation for the rest of the country and world.‚Äù

Homebuyers are invited to register their interest with the Easton Park team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGFsbS1zcHJpbmdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMTEvaG93LXBhbG0tc3ByaW5ncy1jY2EtZGVzZXJ0LWNvbW11bml0eS1lbmVyZ3lzLWZpcnN0LXllYXItYnVkZ2V0LXdlbnQvNzM5MDQxNDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Palm Springs CCA Desert Community Energy's first year budget went,"With expenditures exceeding revenues Desert Community Energy cut costs in its first year of operation by making its signature Carbon Free plan less green and eliminating a subsidy that provided cleaner energy to low-income customers.

Desert Community Energy launched in Palm Springs in April 2020 with the goal of providing greener power and more control over electricity sources ‚Äî at an additional cost of about 10% ‚Äî for former Southern California Edison customers.

But cash flow issues and the new program's need to build a reserve have prompted Desert Community Energy to reduce the renewable energy content of its Carbon Free product which is possible because hydropower is considered ""carbon-free"" but not renewable.

Desert Community Energy's move to scale back renewable energy content combined with its already higher rates than Southern California Edison has former Desert Community Energy board member and Cathedral City Mayor Raymond Gregory questioning how the cooperative is benefitting customers.

""There really is very little to do [to further cut costs] except maybe make the green carbon-free mix even less green; if that happens at what point are people going to keep paying a premium for energy that is less green? The other option is to raise rates but then you get to the point of why even have DCE when the people getting green energy are paying much much more than they could under Edison's green rate"" Gregory said.

DCE faced cash flow issues in first year

Desert Community Energy is a locally controlled nonprofit community choice aggregator or CCA. CCAs are local entities that have the authority to purchase electricity and sell it to their customers. The CCA still uses Edison‚Äôs wires to transmit electricity but Desert Community Energy chooses the plans that it offers and says it focuses on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.

Facing cash flow issues DCE missed a payment due to Southern California Edison in February and took out a $2 million line of credit to help pay the bill which must be repaid by the end of this year.

DCE representatives say a combination of factors has led to cash flow issues including higher energy costs delinquent customer payments the COVID-19 pandemic and the typical challenges of building up a fund reserve for a new program.

The actual budget for July 2020 through May 2021 shows that DCE spent $32251519 on power while bringing in $31772122 in revenue. DCE's total power and operating costs were $34013682 creating a gap of about $2.2 million between expenditures and revenue.

After implementing cost-cutting measures and as DCE's long-term power agreements come online DCE's finances are looking up for the 2021-22 fiscal year. In the recently passed 2021-22 budget DCE anticipates bringing in $46356669 in revenue and spending $43637474 on power procurement and operating costs with a net surplus of $2719195.

Other CCAs haven't fared as well during the pandemic. Western Community Energy which covers the cities of Eastvale Hemet Jurupa Valley Norco Perris and Wildomar declared a fiscal emergency and filed for bankruptcy in May. In June Western Community Energy deregistered and transferred its customer accounts back to Southern California Edison.

Western Community Energy said it decided to deregister as it became apparent that it would not have sufficient financial resources to continue to purchase power for its customers going into July.

Emissions reductions equal 20000 cars off the road

When Desert Community Energy launched all customers were automatically placed in the greener and more expensive Carbon Free plan with the ability to opt down into the less-expensive less-green Desert Saver rate or to opt out of Desert Community Energy entirely and stick with Southern California Edison.

As of May 2021 about 88% of DCE's Palm Springs customers have chosen to stay with Desert Community Energy with about 80% of those customers staying on the Carbon Free plan. Out of 42407 eligible customers 3198 have opted down to Desert Saver and 5148 or about 12% have opted out of Desert Community Energy entirely.

Desert Community Energy board members and staff say emissions reductions show that the program was a success in its first year.

Desert Community Energy estimates that in the past year customers on the premium Carbon Free plan have reduced greenhouse gas emissions at the equivalent of taking 20000 cars off the road.

And a recent assessment of the city's greenhouse gas emissions found that Palm Springs' 2020 greenhouse gas emissions are projected to be about 16% below 2010 levels. This exceeds California's target of reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 which would be the equivalent of Palm Springs reducing its emissions by 15% from 2005-10 levels by 2020 according to the assessment by environmental consulting firm PlaceWorks.

Without Desert Community Energy the city would have had a nearly 5% increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the same time period.

""The program is actually having more of an impact on greenhouse gas emissions than I thought we'd get so I'm really thrilled about the impact we've had"" said Geoff Kors a Palm Springs city councilmember and Desert Community Energy board chair.

Will other cities enroll accounts in DCE?

The idea to form Desert Community Energy started with a vote by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments' Executive Committee. CVAG then partnered with the Western Riverside Council of Governments which includes 18 cities and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians to research its options.

Because those jurisdictions were on a different timeline than CVAG Desert Community Energy became a collaboration between Palm Springs Cathedral City and Palm Desert. But in March 2020 Cathedral City voted to withdraw from the program which became effective July 1.

In April 2020 the Palm Desert City Council considered a motion to leave Desert Community Energy but decided to stay in the electricity program without enrolling residents or municipal accounts into the program. This means that Palm Desert residents currently don't have the choice of opting into Desert Community Energy.

Gregory said DCE's current financial situation shows that Cathedral City was ""very wise"" to withdraw from the program.

""The main reason we left is we just felt really simply that the return did not justify the risk. Of course others felt that getting the green energy was worth it and there wasn't much risk"" the mayor said. ""But Cathedral City was correct there is substantial risk and of course what's happened with DCE is playing that out.""

But Palm Desert councilmember and DCE board member Sabby Jonathan disagrees.

""I think DCE overall has been an outstanding success for Palm Springs. There are certainly challenges and factors beyond our control having to do with Southern California Edison and the grid and the regulators and so forth. But you cannot ignore the impact on our environment that DCE has had in Palm Springs and that in my mind makes it a tremendous success"" he said.

Jonathan said he hopes that the Palm Desert City Council will reconsider enrolling municipal or residential accounts or both in DCE during the city's next budget cycle.

""The good news is that unlike Cathedral City Palm Desert elected to remain a part of DCE and continue to have a seat on the board. ... I still have very strong hopes that our city at some point will register our municipal accounts with DCE and be in with DCE and allow our residents to have a choice that they currently do not between Southern California Edison and DCE"" Jonathan said.

""I think the example and the leadership set forth by Palm Springs is in favor of our city doing the same because the results are clear the impact that they have had on the environment just in this one year alone is impressive"" he continued.

Expenditures exceeded revenue in first year

Desert Community Energy started off with a $4 million surplus after selling electricity it bought in anticipation of its August 2018 launch which was pushed back due to a sudden spike in natural gas prices. But since its launch DCE has dealt with an increase in electricity costs and lower-than-expected revenue creating a gap between expenditures and revenue.

DCE sets its rates based on Southern California Edison‚Äôs rates so when Southern California Edison lowers its rates DCE does the same. According to a quarterly financial update from the March 15 Desert Community Energy Board meeting changes to Southern California Edison rates reduced DCE‚Äôs expected 2021 revenue by about $2.5 million with a forecasted impact of $5.7 million in 2022.

At the same time energy prices have gone up causing DCE to spend more on the energy it purchases for customers while receiving less in revenue from those customers.

The increased energy power prices will increase DCE‚Äôs expected costs by about $2.8 million for 2021 and $3.5 million in 2022.

Customer delinquencies also have played a role. In April 2020 DCE‚Äôs original delinquency rate was estimated to be about 0.3% but during COVID-19 that rose to 3%.

‚ÄúToday we are still holding funds in reserve and anticipate being able to continue to build those reserves that‚Äôs essentially the first step for a startup organization. And this is something that CCAs across the state are experiencing with challenges with energy costs and delinquency rates and we‚Äôre all dealing with the same circumstances‚Äù said Katie Barrows director of environmental resources at the Coachella Valley Association of Governments.

In February Desert Community Energy missed a payment due to Southern California Edison. According to a letter sent from Southern California Edison to DCE‚Äôs Board DCE failed to pay an amount due to SCE on Feb. 15 instead making a partial payment on Feb. 17. The bill was for $4 million.

‚ÄúSCE assumes this Board expects DCE to be able to adequately finance its operations and perform its contract obligations. To that end SCE asks the Board to ensure that DCE pays SCE for the remaining amount now overdue without further delay‚Äù the letter stated.

Desert Community Energy took out a $2 million line of credit in March to pay the Edison bill amid the organization‚Äôs cash flow issues.

According to CVAG spokesperson Erica Felci by February DCE had paid Edison about half of the $4 million bill. The remainder of the bill was paid off after DCE took out the $2 million line of credit and DCE has now paid Edison in full.

The $2 million line of credit must be paid off by the end of the year.

Summer 2020 heatwave drove up power costs

Kors said DCE's initial surplus allowed the agency to keep rates ""artificially low"" as power costs rose for DCE especially during last summer's heatwave and the power grid failure in Texas in February.

""That was challenging but it shows the benefit of this being all about people and not about profits. No money is going to any corporation or the shareholders every dollar will go back into the community and benefit the ratepayers"" he said.

Kors attributes these ""artificially low"" rates as the main reason for the gap between DCE's revenues and expenditures.

Western Community Energy also struggled with power prices in summer 2020 ‚Äî that agency incurred an additional $12 million in energy costs that summer due to the ""unprecedented heatwave which depleted supplies and drove up costs.""

""We are in a very different situation than Western Community Energy"" Kors said. ""We had the benefit of having $4 million in reserves before we started and we are checking our budget regularly and looking at delinquencies and taking them into account and making sure we're in good financial shape.""

With summer power prices up two to three times from last year DCE's board approved a rate increase of up to 4% for customers on the Carbon Free plan on July 7 in anticipation of increased summer power prices and potential significant heat events.

‚ÄúWithout a doubt CCAs across the state are facing an extremely challenging set of circumstances ‚Äî market volatility significant increases in energy prices and uncertainty about the potential for another summer heatwave. The DCE board has always taken a conservative approach when it comes to managing its finances. At the same time one of the big benefits to having a locally controlled utility is that we can quickly respond if needed to the changing circumstances which our board demonstrated just this week (with the rate increase)‚Äù Felci said in an email to The Desert Sun.

Felci noted that DCE‚Äôs practice of procuring fixed-price energy on a forward basis or in advance insulates DCE from some of the volatility of procuring energy on the short-term market.

The majority of DCE‚Äôs power for summer 2021 is expected to cost less than the prevailing market price according to Felci.

How SoCal Edison rates compare to DCE which is now cutting costs

DCE is now cutting costs to build up its reserves.

Since DCE's launch the premium Carbon Free plan has provided electricity from sources that are 100% carbon-free and 50% renewable from in-state renewable sources such as wind and solar. The Carbon Free plan costs about 10% more than Southern California Edison's base rate. The key difference between renewable and carbon-free energy is that hydropower is considered ""carbon-free"" but not renewable.

Desert Saver costs customers less than Southern California Edison and offers 35% renewable electricity.

In April DCE's board voted to reduce the renewable content of the Carbon Free plan to at least 35.75% renewable with 75% from in-state sources while maintaining 100% ""carbon-free"" content.

For comparison Edison's average energy mix came from 35.1% renewable sources in 2019 and would cost less than DCE's Carbon Free plan.

The change to the content of the Carbon Free product is expected to save DCE approximately $738608 in 2021. Desert Community Energy staff say these cost savings will allow the agency to meet its financial goals including procuring more local energy resources and developing community energy programs.

But Gregory said he's ""very concerned"" that even with DCE's recent steps to cut costs it won't be enough to get out of the hole.

""Even with the estimates given by experts the change in the Carbon Free product will generate $738000 in savings in a year but they're already at least $2 million in the hole and the line of credit needs to be paid off by the end of the year"" he said.

And with a renewable energy content that now mirrors Southern California Edison Gregory questioned what the incentive is for customers to stick with DCE.

Southern California Edison offers a green rate with 50% renewable and an average monthly bill of about $120 or a 100% renewable plan with an average monthly bill of about $122 according to Southern California Edison.

But unlike Southern California Edison's green rate Desert Community Energy's premium plan is still 100% carbon-free.

""We're keeping the 100% carbon-free because that's what we committed to and what the city wants to see for their community. But we've made some adjustments to reduce the cost and provide some significant savings as a result"" said Barrows.

In addition to changing the renewable content of the Carbon Free product the board also voted to suspend a program that allowed lower-income customers to enroll in DCE's Carbon Free plan while only paying the Desert Saver rate.

Under the program about 6500 DCE customers who participate in rate payment assistance programs were enrolled in the more environmentally friendly Carbon Free plan but were only asked to pay the Desert Saver rate with DCE subsidizing the difference. Eliminating this subsidy will reduce DCE's costs by about $120000 a year.

""Of course hindsight is always 20/20 but you look at it and think maybe they shouldn't have been so ambitious with getting everybody on the green rate and getting the most green energy you could possibly get while still paying only 10% more than Edison. ... Maybe it was too ambitious because they quickly went in the hole and didn't allow enough slack to build up any kind of reserve"" Gregory said.

Power purchase agreements will save money in the long term

Even with some financial challenges DCE has achieved environmental goals in its first year such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy projects.

In February Desert Community Energy signed three multimillion-dollar 15-year agreements with Terra-Gen LLC to purchase power from three wind farms located in Palm Springs. The power purchase agreements will allow DCE to save an estimated $7 million to $10 million over the course of the contracts.

""Given our launch in the early stages of the pandemic and all the challenges that that's meant to all of us especially customers I think we're doing great. The focus of Desert Community Energy is to provide clean energy and provide local benefits. And we've been able to do that with Palm Springs"" Barrows said.

Desert Community Energy recently signed a 20-year agreement for a solar energy and battery storage project in Kern County which will begin serving DCE customers in 2023. These long-term agreements which have fixed rates will provide rate stability for DCE and its customers. For example the solar energy and battery storage agreement will cost between $13 million and $50 million less over the 20-year period than purchasing the equivalent products on the short-term market.

""I think if you looked at CCAs across the state to do [those agreements] in your first year is really great progress for us. And we're happy about that"" Barrows said.

As DCE adds more long-term renewable energy agreements to its portfolio its finances are expected to turn around. By 2023 Desert Community Energy expects net revenue of about $4.5 million.

""Ultimately as we look out over the next couple of years and we think about the environmental impacts and long-term cost savings that will result I think DCE is a great program"" Kors said.

""There are often challenges to doing what we can to save the planet. ... For Palm Springs health and wellness and the environment are top priorities. We're really proud of our city and even when it's hard sometimes we want to do the right thing for our residents and the well-being of the future.""

This solar EV prototype promises range above 700 km,"Solar electric vehicle maker Lightyear recently tested its Lightyear One prototype car which drove a distance of 710 km on a single battery charge of 60 kWh for almost nine hours. The EV maker says that Lightyear One is the world‚Äôs first long-range solar electric vehicle.

Solar EV maker Lightyear tests its prototype car that drove up to 710 km on a single battery charge.Lightyear will start production in the first half

The prototype car by Lightyear was taken to Aldenhoven Testing Center in Germany where it completed a drive cycle at a speed of 85 kmph. The testing was done on a single battery charge of 60 kWh. Lightyear adds that in the market today even the most efficient electric cars consume around 50% more energy at this relatively low speed. The testing ranged from validating the yield of the solar panels the energy consumption of the cooling system the battery performance the software operating the solar car and the functioning of the in-wheel motors. The EV maker stresses that the concept of a long-range solar car is a huge opportunity to change mobility as one can drive for months without charging.

The co-founder and CEO of Lightyear Lex Hoefsloot notes that this is the company's important engineering and technological milestone as the performance of the electric car validates the former's patented technology. ‚ÄúThis prototype has over 440 miles of range with an energy consumption of only 137 Wh/Mile at 53 miles an hour. This milestone is a great confirmation of the scalability of our business model. We are confident that in the coming months we will be able to reach a similar level of energy consumption at highway speed. Lowering the energy consumption per mile of an EV means that you can provide a lot of range on a small battery"" he adds. Hoefsloot also explains that adding solar cells to low-energy consuming cars can be an advantage as it can gain about 45 miles of charge on a sunny day.

What You Need To Know The maple wood used for the hardwood floor in Fiserv Forum came from the Menominee Tribe



The tribe has more than 230000 acres of sustainable forest for lumber



They replant every tree they use for lumber

The Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin though does.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real big deal for the tribe‚Äù said Nels Huse Millwork Specialist with Menominee Tribal Enterprises.

Wood from their maple trees were used to make the floor of Fiserv Forum.

‚ÄúAbout 90% of the product that comes off the forest floor the sawmill will process for various uses including the wooden floors that are used on the basketball courts by Prostar and other floor makers‚Äù said Pershing Frechette Plant Manager at Menominee Tribal Enterprises.

The tribe‚Äôs wood gets used for a lot of different things. Their forest has produced wood for the floors for Fiserv Forum the Bucks‚Äô practice facility and the court for the Wisconsin Herd.

‚ÄúWe have cut our 230000 acres over five different times with increasing the volume by two by not reducing anything at all‚Äù said John Awonohopay with Menominee Tribal Enterprises.

They work diligently to make sure only the trees ready to become lumber are the ones that get cut down.

They‚Äôre also meticulous about replanting everything they use.

‚ÄúWhen we cut the Bucks‚Äô trees here just in 2018 for these floors we cut those trees and when they came out of the woods we were planting the next group of trees that would be ready in 80 or 90 years‚Äù Huse said. ""That‚Äôs pretty impressive to me.‚Äù

The tribe also did a prayer ritual when the Bucks got the wood for their floor - a prayer to Mother Earth.

Hal Koller the President of ProStar Surfaces who used the wood to make the floor said that might bring some ‚Äúmagic‚Äù to the NBA Finals.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping. We‚Äôre hoping there‚Äôs magic in the fact that now they‚Äôre on native timber and now that luck carries through and some of the maybe the spirits of the Menominee who were part of this history of Wisconsin forever come to play here‚Äù Koller said. ""We‚Äôre out of the desert back in the Northwoods I hope it makes sense!""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndwci5vcmcvc3BvcnRzL2J1Y2tzLWRvbWluYXRlLWZpcnN0LW5iYS1maW5hbHMtZ2FtZS1maXNlcnYtZm9ydW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucks Dominate First NBA Finals Game At Fiserv Forum,"Already in these playoffs the Milwaukee Bucks have come back from 0-2 to win a series. They‚Äôre a step closer to accomplishing the feat again after beating the Phoenix Suns in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday 120-100.

The Bucks have lost just once at Fiserv Forum these playoffs while the Suns had dropped just two road games before Sunday.

The teams were evenly matched in the first quarter. Deandre Ayton opened the scoring for Phoenix finishing the quarter with 12 points including a couple of jumpers for the 6-foot-11 big man. Meanwhile Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded five rebounds and four assists for Milwaukee. Head coach Mike Budenholzer said Antetokounmpo did a little bit of everything on Sunday.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just doing whatever it takes to help his team to help us. He‚Äôs in an aggressive mindset. He always plays that way‚Äù he said.

The Bucks moved the ball well in Game 3 finishing the contest with 28 team assists. But after 12 minutes the Suns had a tight 3-point lead.

It was the second quarter when the Bucks got into trouble in Game 2 with the Suns eventually winning 118-108 after pulling away before halftime.

Phoenix aimed to replicate that success in Game 3 ‚Äî going on an 8-0 run to put the Suns up by 6 points before Milwaukee took a timeout. Brook Lopez ended their streak with a dunk and then his team went on a run of its own.

The Bucks dominated in the paint and just a few minutes later they had their own 6-point lead fueled by a 20-6 run. The Bucks finished the first half up 60-45 thanks to a couple of corner 3-pointers from fan favorites Bobby Portis and P.J. Tucker.

Khris Middleton capped off the half with a couple of made free throws after drawing a foul on Ayton ‚Äî his third of the game. Middleton went into halftime with a quiet 15 points ‚Äî a big improvement from the 11 he scored in Game 2.

Ayton had another foul against Antetokounmpo early in the second half and he came out of the game. Meanwhile Antetokounmpo shot relatively well from behind the line finishing the game making 13 of 17 free throws.

The Suns pulled within 4 points in the third quarter with the help of Jae Crowder who made six 3-pointers and finished the game with 18 points for Phoenix. The veteran player was on the Miami Heat team that bounced the Bucks from last year‚Äôs NBA bubble. Crowder has a history in Milwaukee having played at Marquette.

But the Bucks never let them get too close and Milwaukee finished the third quarter with a 98-67 lead thanks to 16 consecutive points. Bucks fans enjoyed the final quarter without much stress.

The Suns didn‚Äôt get enough help Sunday from star Devin Booker who finished the game with just 10 points after making seven 3-pointers in Game 2. He only played 29 minutes after struggling in Game 3. But Budenholzer said he doesn‚Äôt think Booker will stay down for long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great challenge: keeping him off the free-throw line keeping him off the 3-point line. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be ready to go and we‚Äôve got to match that going into next game‚Äù he said.

Antetokounmpo led scoring for Milwaukee with 41 points. It was his second consecutive 40-point game and only his third game back from a knee injury suffered in the Eastern Conference finals.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great play maker he‚Äôs a great passer he‚Äôs a great screener. He just does so many things and I think when he‚Äôs conscious of doing a little bit of everything he‚Äôs very capable and that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs at his best‚Äù Budenholzer said.

Jrue Holiday made big shots at key moments for the Bucks. He finished with 21 points.

Sunday marked the first time Milwaukee has hosted an NBA Finals game in almost 50 years. About 18000 fans watched from inside Fiserv forum with thousands more gathered outside. Fireworks exploded in the Deer District after the game.

Game 4 is set for Wednesday in Milwaukee. Tickets are available starting at $395.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy9uYmEvYnVja3MvMjAyMS8wNy8xMi9uYmEtZmluYWxzLXBob3Rvcy1mYW5zLWJ1Y2tzLXN1bnMtZmlzZXJ2LWZvcnVtLW1pbHdhdWtlZS83OTE5NzEwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See photos of Milwaukee Bucks fans turning out for NBA Finals Game 3 at Fiserv Forum,"See photos of Milwaukee Bucks fans turning out for NBA Finals Game 3 at Fiserv Forum

CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Northeast Ohio‚Äôs transition away from an economy of heavy industries continues as the first tenant is revealed for the former Ford Motor Co. engine and casting plants in the Cleveland suburb of Brook Park. That tenant according to two sources familiar with the redevelopment is e-commerce giant Amazon.

The 210-acre Ford Motor Brook Park Target Industrial-Advanced Manufacturing Campus as the city calls it will involve a multi-phase redevelopment of the 1.7-million-square-foot Ford Engine Plant No. 2 and its neighboring Cleveland Casting Plant site.

In their place will be millions of square feet of warehousing logistics/shipping and light-industrial facilities representing a half-billion-dollar investment to serve what so far has been an insatiable market.

Once Ford‚Äôs remaining buildings on the site (not including the still-active Engine Plant No. 2) are cleared away new road sewer and utility infrastructure will be built. Then multiple new buildings will be constructed to serve big-name tenants offering thousands of jobs. Amazon represents only the first phase the sources said.

The 210-acre Ford Motor Brook Park Target Industrial-Advanced Manufacturing Campus is anticipated to add millions of square feet of new industrial and distribution facilities employing thousands of workers (Google/KJP).

Developing the site is a partnership of Weston Inc. of Warrensville Heights the DiGeronimo Cos. of Independence and Scannell Properties of Indianapolis IN. They created a joint venture called DROF BP I LLC (spells ‚ÄúFord‚Äù backwards and ‚ÄúBP‚Äù referring to Brook Park) which purchased the 210 acres of land in April for $31.5 million according to county records.

All three partners have experience in developing Amazon delivery stations and other distribution centers for other clients. In Northeast Ohio Weston built a 168750-square-foot speculative building in 2019 at 10801 Madison Ave. in Cleveland. NEOtrans was first to report Amazon would retrofit and lease the building from Weston. DiGeronimo Companies‚Äô Independence Construction was the building contractor.

In 2015 Scannell and DiGeronimo joined forces in redeveloping the Twinsburg Chrysler Stamping Plant that closed in 2010 into the Cornerstone Business Park. Among the buildings constructed was a 248000-square-foot Amazon distribution center representing an investment of $17 million.

When Brook Park‚Äôs two Ford plants closed in 2007 and 2012 nearly 3000 well-paid union workers and others lost their jobs. The casting plant was demolished in 2013. Its neighbor at 18300 Snow Rd. will soon follow said Brook Park Mayor Michael D. Gammella in his Summer 2021 newsletter to Brook Park residents.

Interior of an Amazon distribution center which is highly automated. But most centers employ hundreds if not thousands of workers inside the facility and in trucks and vans outside each Amazon distribution facility (Clay Corp.).

‚ÄúShortly you will see demolition crews leveling the old engine plant and aluminum foundry‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn its place will be a new building for a major corporation. Other new buildings will follow with even more new companies. This mega project will bring thousands of new jobs into our city. It is the beginning of a new era and there is more to come.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe project will absolutely be transformational to the region‚Äù said TJ Asher president of Weston‚Äôs Acquisitions and Development in a written statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking forward to tapping into the potential this property offers and developing a unique commercial area with the potential for significant job creation and economic impact for Northeast Ohio.‚Äù

Asher called it a once-in-a-generation redevelopment project due to its scale and location. It is next to Cleveland Hopkins Airport Interstates 71 and 480 busy mainline railroads of Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation and is within a 20-minute walk of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority‚Äôs Red Line rail transit station on Brookpark Road.

The project will respond to strong market demand. Real estate firm Newmark recently reported that Greater Cleveland‚Äôs industrial market achieved a new low 4.5 percent vacancy rate in first-quarter 2021 with 2.9 million square feet under construction. In the region‚Äôs southwest submarket that vacancy rate was even lower ‚Äì a mere 3 percent.

Reducing weight in vehicle structures and components has taken on a new level of importance with the shift to electric powertrains and a growing focus on sustainability in manufacturing. Addressing this challenge designers and manufacturing engineers have a range of proven and emerging materials to work with that offer the required combination of strength and low weight for body structures and exteriors whilst there are an increasing array of options for sustainable light-weight materials and technology for interiors. Optimising the material mix design and application in a vehicle‚Äôs architecture is a key factor both in the performance of electric cars and in maintaining efficient low-carbon production.

These opportunities in materials combined with compressed development time for new vehicles are also requiring much closer collaboration across vehicle design engineering and production than ever before. Design teams are more closely integrated with production engineers across an OEM and key suppliers and are using tools such as rapid prototyping digital simulation and virtual reality to test and validate structures and changes for production.

This livestream Hour brought to you by Car Design News and Automotive Manufacturing Solutions features leading designers engineers and materials specialists at Ford Gestamp SSAB and ArcelorMittal presenting case studies on recent vehicle launches and innovation on light-weighting and materials and in a panel discussion.

Two leading designers from Ford Elvir Mesalic and Scott Anderson provide exclusive insight into light-weighting considerations and innovations in two of the carmaker‚Äôs most important new vehicle models the electric pickup Ford F-150 Lightning and the new Ford Maverick hybrid compact truck. In both cases lead Ford designers worked closely with engineering teams to bring material and light-weighting innovations to the exterior and interior and make sure they were optimal for production as well.

Paul Belanger director of Gestamp‚Äôs North America R&D Center provides insights on the automotive supplier‚Äôs advances in body and materials engineering.

(MMC).‚Äù

While it‚Äôs true that the Ford Motor Co. is six years older MMC‚Äôs history is nothing to trivialize. Founded in 1909 MMC is well known for expertly combining traditional craftsmanship and just-enough modern technology to build wonderful sports cars

High-volume production is not a priority at Malvern UK-based MMC as the company only builds about 800 cars per year. What is most important is handcrafting unique and iconic automobiles out of the finest materials.

One such material is ash wood which the company uses for the frame of each vehicle. Other important core materials are leather and aluminum.

In 2000 MMC introduced its Aero 8 vehicle the first to feature an aluminum frame. Nearly 20 years later the manufacturer developed an aluminum platform for its Plus Six vehicle. This platform offers a 100 percent increase in torsional stiffness when compared to the traditional steel chassis in the company‚Äôs Plus 8 vehicle which preceded the Plus Six.

Assembling the Plus Six platform did initially present a joining challenge. But MMC solved the problem by using RIVSET self-pierce-riveting technology from the B√∂llhoff Group.

The RIVSET joining method is a two-step process. First the individual aluminum parts to be joined are bonded with a special adhesive. As the adhesive hardens the semitubular RIVSET rivet is punched through the top material layer and adhesive and into the bottom material layer where it forms an undercut and a slight button-shaped protrusion. Because the bottom material layer is not punched through a gas- and liquid-tight spot joint is created.

MMC engineers like that the procedure does not require predrilled holes and that it can join similar and dissimilar materials of more than two layers. In this case for example the adhesive is the intermediate layer. Most importantly the technology creates long-lasting high-strength mechanical joints.

Some 440 RIVSET rivets are used to assemble the platform and hundreds more for the Plus Six body. B√∂llhoff‚Äôs RIVQUICK blind rivets and RIVKLE blind rivet nuts are also used for the body due to its high-strength-design requirements. Overall a total of 1610 B√∂llhoff fasteners are used in each Plus Six car.

Two variations of the standard RIVSET technology have been introduced in recent years. One is the Automation E (electric hybrid) rivet installation head which improves joining functionality flexibility and availability with minimum maintenance. Typical process time is less than 1.5 seconds per rivet.

Designed for applications ranging from prototyping to large-scale production Automation E can install rivets in high-strength steel having a tensile strength of up to 1600 megapascals.

The head can be attached to a six-axis robot and runs entirely on electricity. Compressed air or hose couplings are not required. Its open-software interface enables robot communication and data acquisition via an OPC UA server.

Also available is a cordless electro-hydraulic Portable C tool that digitally sets and controls installation pressure. The tool automatically informs the user when the target pressure is reached and the process cycle is completed. If target pressure is exceeded the tool issues a visual and audible alarm. Base units provide force levels of 10 to 50 kilonewtons or 40 to 80 kilonewtons.

Tucker Carlson is furious with Fox News executives for not vigorously defending him amid his evidence-free claims that the National Security Agency spied on him in a conspiracy to destroy his TV show according to people familiar with the matter.

One of the sources described Carlson as ‚Äúfurious‚Äù with network executives especially the public relations team ‚Äúfor not backing him up.‚Äù

‚ÄúTensions are sky high‚Äù the person said.

Another source pointed out that Carlson has ‚Äúalways had tension with‚Äù management but said right now he‚Äôs ‚Äúextra pissed.‚Äù

Carlson has complained to colleagues and associates about what he perceives as a lack of support.

Two Fox News spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.

In a text to a CNN reporter Sunday night Carlson called the allegation that he is angry with Fox executives ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad at anyone at Fox‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I was I‚Äôd say so. I‚Äôm mad at you for lying relentlessly. What a loathsome person you are. Please print that.‚Äù

For the better part of two weeks Carlson ‚Äî the highest-rated host on Fox ‚Äî has repeatedly claimed that the Biden administration was spying on him.

Fox pointedly has not covered his claims on its newscasts even though such an intrusion would normally be a significant news story. Fox has not shown any outward signs of investigating Carlson‚Äôs claims either.

Carlson originally attributed his information to a ‚Äúwhistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn us.‚Äù He said ‚Äúthe NSA the National Security Agency is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them to take this show off the air.‚Äù

However Carlson who has a history of pushing conspiracy theories has offered no proof of his allegations.

The NSA in a rare move even issued a statement saying Carlson is not the target of any investigation and that the agency had no intention of forcing him off the air.

One week later Carlson claimed that Biden‚Äôs NSA has leaked the contents of his emails to other members of the media. One of the banners on his show said ‚ÄúNSA LEAKED TUCKER‚ÄôS EMAILS TO JOURNALISTS.‚Äù

Ordinarily a TV network would be quick to denounce such a thing if it actually happened. But Fox News executives have been noticeably silent during the back and forth.

Suzanne Scott the network‚Äôs chief executive and Jay Wallace the network‚Äôs president have not issued any statements of public support for Carlson nor have they condemned the NSA for the massive abuse of power Carlson alleges.

Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch who control Fox Corporation have also been silent on the matter.

When Axios reported that Carlson‚Äôs spying claims came after he sought an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äî raising the prospect that his emails were intercepted in the course of US intelligence efforts ‚Äî Fox issued a vague and terse statement.

‚ÄúWe support any of our hosts pursuing interviews and stories free of government interference‚Äù an unnamed network spokesperson told Axios.

One of the sources said Carlson viewed that statement as wholly insufficient.

On the other hand Carlson‚Äôs show operates almost like its own planet removed from the vetting and oversight that applies to normal cable news shows.

That may be why other Fox programs have largely avoided covering Carlson‚Äôs allegations on air ‚Äî a sign that management doesn‚Äôt know if the claims are legitimate.

Fox‚Äôs Maria Bartiromo also known for promoting conspiracy thinking is one of the exceptions ‚Äî she has brought up Carlson‚Äôs claims repeatedly.

Saturday night host Jesse Watters also framed an entire segment around Carlson over the weekend ‚Äî but he did it in the form of a question asking ‚ÄúIs Tucker Carlson being spied on by the Biden administration?‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2p1bC8xMC9mb3gtbmV3cy13ZWF0aGVyLWNoYW5uZWwtY2xpbWF0ZS1jcmlzaXPSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbWVkaWEvMjAyMS9qdWwvMTAvZm94LW5ld3Mtd2VhdGhlci1jaGFubmVsLWNsaW1hdGUtY3Jpc2lz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News‚Äô planned 24-hour weather channel has climate experts worried,"Fox News Media the company that owns the reactionary climate crisis-skeptical Fox News is launching a weather channel this year ‚Äì a development that has climate crisis experts worried.

Fox Weather a 24-hour channel devoted to all things meteorological promises ‚Äúcutting-edge display technology‚Äù according to a press release with ‚Äúforecasting experts surrounding every major weather event‚Äù.

But it is Fox News‚Äô output and the potential for Fox Weather to adopt a similar tone to its sister channel that has onlookers concerned. Hosts on Fox News have spent years rubbishing or undermining the idea of manmade climate breakdown and the fact that two Fox News-linked executives are behind the weather channel launch doesn‚Äôt bode well.

‚ÄúFox News has access to and is highly trusted by a wide range of conservative Americans ‚Äì which is precisely the audience that least well understands the serious threats that climate change poses to the safety security and health of all Americans‚Äù said Edward Maibach director of George Mason University‚Äôs Center for Climate Change Communication.

‚ÄúIf Fox chooses to use its access and credibility to inform viewers about the realities of climate change and its impacts on the weather it could be a game changer. Conversely if it opts to perpetuate misinformation to advance political goals it will be a huge disservice to all Americans ‚Äì conservative liberal and moderate‚Äù Maibach said.

Last year Tucker Carlson rubbished the idea that forest fires on the west coast were a result of climate crisis ‚Äì serious climate scientists however agree that the fires are very much linked to the breakdown ‚Äì and suggested environmental hazards were a liberal conspiracy.

Carlson‚Äôs colleague Laura Ingraham has insisted contrary to experts‚Äô findings that the planet is in a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù cycle of warming and suggested that environmental activists like Greta Thunberg had been ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù while Sean Hannity said the left‚Äôs ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with the climate was a ‚Äúpolitical tool‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe danger of [Fox News Media] running a weather channel is that if they pervert news about the weather anything like how they‚Äôve perverted news about climate change and energy politics millions of Americans will be further misled about this crisis‚Äù said Geoffrey Supran research fellow at Harvard University‚Äôs department of the history of science.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been shown that the most important predictors of public support for climate action are understanding that this crisis is real human-caused serious and solvable‚Äù Supran said.

‚ÄúIf as I and I‚Äôm sure others fear [Fox News Media‚Äôs] weather channel downplays the links between global warming and extreme weather it will only solidify their viewers‚Äô existing biases against climate action.‚Äù

The tenor of Fox News hosts‚Äô commentary matches with data from Public Citizen a non-profit thinktank. In 2019 Public Citizen found that in the first half of the year Fox News devoted 247 segments to climate crisis. Of those ‚Äú212 (86%) were dismissive of the climate crisis cast warming and its consequences in doubt or employed fearmongering when discussing climate solutions‚Äù Public Citizen reported.

‚ÄúFox News has been a powerful engine of climate misinformation for years ‚Äì so powerful in fact that its influence has been named the ‚ÄòFox News Effect‚Äô‚Äù Maibach said.

‚ÄúOne of our studies for example showed that before Fox News began its attack on the Green New Deal most conservatives supported its core policy proposals. Six months later ‚Äì after Fox had relentlessly attacked it and its sponsors ‚Äì support for those proposals dropped to near zero among frequent Fox viewers.‚Äù

Fox Weather has already poached meteorologists from around the country according to the New York Times including the Weather Channel‚Äôs ‚Äúsenior weather product architect‚Äù Shane Brown. The channel based in New York City will be advertiser-funded and stream 24 hours a day.

Sharri Berg formerly the executive vice-president of news operations for the Fox News channel will oversee Fox Weather along with Suzanne Scott CEO of Fox News Media. In announcing the channel last year Berg said ‚Äúweather is a vital component to news‚Äù.

‚ÄúCombining our trusted reporters and expert meteorologists from Fox News and [Fox Television stations] nationwide the Fox Weather products will be built to serve our audiences in a customized fashion‚Äù Berg said.

A Fox Weather spokesperson pointed the Guardian to a statement given to the New York Times:

‚ÄúWith a dedicated team of leading meteorologists and experts stationed across the country Fox Weather will provide in-depth reporting surrounding all weather conditions and we are excited to showcase to viewers what a full-service comprehensive weather platform can deliver beginning this fall.‚Äù

If Fox Weather does not interfere with the weather information its new staff is putting out then Maibach said there is hope ‚Äì for the weather channel at least.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect that Fox News will change its ways or its views about climate change anytime soon but Fox Weather has the opportunity to get the facts right. Let‚Äôs hope it chooses to‚Äù Maibach said.

Viewers will have to wait and see what approach Fox Weather takes but in the meantime there is serious concern given the damage the American right has already done to efforts to mitigate the climate crisis.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen the ways in which 40 years of disinformation in the United States has stifled both climate action and the narrative around climate‚Äù said Lily Gardner a community organizer with the Sunrise Movement a youth-led organization which aims to stop climate crisis.

‚ÄúNancy Pelosi [the Democratic House speaker] and Newt Gingrich [a Republican former House speaker] went from releasing an ad together in 2007 that indicated that they were interested in working on climate policy to climate becoming a deeply partisan issue in which the facts are debated as opposed to the solutions.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtZGVzY2VuZC1vbi1zdW4tdmFsbGV5LWluLXByaXZhdGUtamV0cy10by10YWxrLWFib3V0LWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdl0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlcy1kZXNjZW5kLW9uLXN1bi12YWxsZXktaW4tcHJpdmF0ZS1qZXRzLXRvLXRhbGstYWJvdXQtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaires descend on Sun Valley in private jets to talk about climate change,"A cabal of some of the most high-profile people in media finance and technology descended on Idaho‚Äôs resort town of Sun Valley in private jets this week to tackle among other things climate change.

On Tuesday the day the conference kicked off traffic from private jets got to be so busy that the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned planes on the West Coast from taking off.

The FAA told Fox News it briefly held planes on the ground at their departure airports to avoid congestion in the airspace around Sun Valley.

The manager of the Friedman Memorial Airport in the neighboring town of Hailey Idaho told NPR ahead of the conference that he expected more than 90 private planes.

A session preaching the perils of climate change to people who flew to the event on their own carbon-emitting Gulfstream jets rankled some business leaders that FOX Business contacted earlier in the week.

""Talking climate change on his private jet?"" one CEO remarked with a laugh referring to Gates.

One Twitter used pointed out the ""Climate Hypocrisy.""

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Over the holiday weekend private jets belonging to business leaders began arriving at the local airport and taking up space on the tarmac at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey as they parked up for the week.

From there guests were chauffeured through 15 miles of lush rolling hills to the lodge where the conference takes place.

Rival chief executives including Amazon's Jeff Bezos along with his successor Andy Jassy Comcast Corp.'s Brian Roberts are all said to be on the guest list.

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

'There's a lot of assets out there that have good IP that will probably get new homes' he said.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

Attendees at the last conference in 2019 included Facebook bosses Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg; Disney's Bob Iger; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki; Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch who is the CEO of Fox Corporation; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman; Instagram COO Marne Levine; McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook and billionaire media executive Shari Redstone.

The conference began in 1982 and in its early days founder Herbert Allen - who co-founded Allen & Company with brother Charles - had to beg invitees to come.

Tucker Carlson is furious with Fox News executives for not vigorously defending him amid his evidence-free claims that the National Security Agency spied on him in a conspiracy to destroy his TV show according to people familiar with the matter.

One of the sources described Carlson as ‚Äúfurious‚Äù with network executives especially the public relations team ‚Äúfor not backing him up.‚Äù

‚ÄúTensions are sky high‚Äù the person said.

Another source pointed out that Carlson has ‚Äúalways had tension with‚Äù management but said right now he‚Äôs ‚Äúextra pissed.‚Äù

Carlson has complained to colleagues and associates about what he perceives as a lack of support.

Two Fox News spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.

In a text to a CNN reporter Sunday night Carlson called the allegation that he is angry with Fox executives ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad at anyone at Fox‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I was I‚Äôd say so. I‚Äôm mad at you for lying relentlessly. What a loathsome person you are. Please print that.‚Äù

For the better part of two weeks Carlson ‚Äî the highest-rated host on Fox ‚Äî has repeatedly claimed that the Biden administration was spying on him.

Fox pointedly has not covered his claims on its newscasts even though such an intrusion would normally be a significant news story. Fox has not shown any outward signs of investigating Carlson‚Äôs claims either.

Carlson originally attributed his information to a ‚Äúwhistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn us.‚Äù He said ‚Äúthe NSA the National Security Agency is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them to take this show off the air.‚Äù

However Carlson who has a history of pushing conspiracy theories has offered no proof of his allegations.

The NSA in a rare move even issued a statement saying Carlson is not the target of any investigation and that the agency had no intention of forcing him off the air.

One week later Carlson claimed that Biden‚Äôs NSA has leaked the contents of his emails to other members of the media. One of the banners on his show said ‚ÄúNSA LEAKED TUCKER‚ÄôS EMAILS TO JOURNALISTS.‚Äù

Ordinarily a TV network would be quick to denounce such a thing if it actually happened. But Fox News executives have been noticeably silent during the back and forth.

Suzanne Scott the network‚Äôs chief executive and Jay Wallace the network‚Äôs president have not issued any statements of public support for Carlson nor have they condemned the NSA for the massive abuse of power Carlson alleges.

Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch who control Fox Corporation have also been silent on the matter.

When Axios reported that Carlson‚Äôs spying claims came after he sought an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äî raising the prospect that his emails were intercepted in the course of US intelligence efforts ‚Äî Fox issued a vague and terse statement.

‚ÄúWe support any of our hosts pursuing interviews and stories free of government interference‚Äù an unnamed network spokesperson told Axios.

One of the sources said Carlson viewed that statement as wholly insufficient.

On the other hand Carlson‚Äôs show operates almost like its own planet removed from the vetting and oversight that applies to normal cable news shows.

That may be why other Fox programs have largely avoided covering Carlson‚Äôs allegations on air ‚Äî a sign that management doesn‚Äôt know if the claims are legitimate.

Fox‚Äôs Maria Bartiromo also known for promoting conspiracy thinking is one of the exceptions ‚Äî she has brought up Carlson‚Äôs claims repeatedly.

Saturday night host Jesse Watters also framed an entire segment around Carlson over the weekend ‚Äî but he did it in the form of a question asking ‚ÄúIs Tucker Carlson being spied on by the Biden administration?‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2p1bC8xMC9mb3gtbmV3cy13ZWF0aGVyLWNoYW5uZWwtY2xpbWF0ZS1jcmlzaXPSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbWVkaWEvMjAyMS9qdWwvMTAvZm94LW5ld3Mtd2VhdGhlci1jaGFubmVsLWNsaW1hdGUtY3Jpc2lz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News‚Äô planned 24-hour weather channel has climate experts worried,"Fox News Media the company that owns the reactionary climate crisis-skeptical Fox News is launching a weather channel this year ‚Äì a development that has climate crisis experts worried.

Fox Weather a 24-hour channel devoted to all things meteorological promises ‚Äúcutting-edge display technology‚Äù according to a press release with ‚Äúforecasting experts surrounding every major weather event‚Äù.

But it is Fox News‚Äô output and the potential for Fox Weather to adopt a similar tone to its sister channel that has onlookers concerned. Hosts on Fox News have spent years rubbishing or undermining the idea of manmade climate breakdown and the fact that two Fox News-linked executives are behind the weather channel launch doesn‚Äôt bode well.

‚ÄúFox News has access to and is highly trusted by a wide range of conservative Americans ‚Äì which is precisely the audience that least well understands the serious threats that climate change poses to the safety security and health of all Americans‚Äù said Edward Maibach director of George Mason University‚Äôs Center for Climate Change Communication.

‚ÄúIf Fox chooses to use its access and credibility to inform viewers about the realities of climate change and its impacts on the weather it could be a game changer. Conversely if it opts to perpetuate misinformation to advance political goals it will be a huge disservice to all Americans ‚Äì conservative liberal and moderate‚Äù Maibach said.

Last year Tucker Carlson rubbished the idea that forest fires on the west coast were a result of climate crisis ‚Äì serious climate scientists however agree that the fires are very much linked to the breakdown ‚Äì and suggested environmental hazards were a liberal conspiracy.

Carlson‚Äôs colleague Laura Ingraham has insisted contrary to experts‚Äô findings that the planet is in a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù cycle of warming and suggested that environmental activists like Greta Thunberg had been ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù while Sean Hannity said the left‚Äôs ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with the climate was a ‚Äúpolitical tool‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe danger of [Fox News Media] running a weather channel is that if they pervert news about the weather anything like how they‚Äôve perverted news about climate change and energy politics millions of Americans will be further misled about this crisis‚Äù said Geoffrey Supran research fellow at Harvard University‚Äôs department of the history of science.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been shown that the most important predictors of public support for climate action are understanding that this crisis is real human-caused serious and solvable‚Äù Supran said.

‚ÄúIf as I and I‚Äôm sure others fear [Fox News Media‚Äôs] weather channel downplays the links between global warming and extreme weather it will only solidify their viewers‚Äô existing biases against climate action.‚Äù

The tenor of Fox News hosts‚Äô commentary matches with data from Public Citizen a non-profit thinktank. In 2019 Public Citizen found that in the first half of the year Fox News devoted 247 segments to climate crisis. Of those ‚Äú212 (86%) were dismissive of the climate crisis cast warming and its consequences in doubt or employed fearmongering when discussing climate solutions‚Äù Public Citizen reported.

‚ÄúFox News has been a powerful engine of climate misinformation for years ‚Äì so powerful in fact that its influence has been named the ‚ÄòFox News Effect‚Äô‚Äù Maibach said.

‚ÄúOne of our studies for example showed that before Fox News began its attack on the Green New Deal most conservatives supported its core policy proposals. Six months later ‚Äì after Fox had relentlessly attacked it and its sponsors ‚Äì support for those proposals dropped to near zero among frequent Fox viewers.‚Äù

Fox Weather has already poached meteorologists from around the country according to the New York Times including the Weather Channel‚Äôs ‚Äúsenior weather product architect‚Äù Shane Brown. The channel based in New York City will be advertiser-funded and stream 24 hours a day.

Sharri Berg formerly the executive vice-president of news operations for the Fox News channel will oversee Fox Weather along with Suzanne Scott CEO of Fox News Media. In announcing the channel last year Berg said ‚Äúweather is a vital component to news‚Äù.

‚ÄúCombining our trusted reporters and expert meteorologists from Fox News and [Fox Television stations] nationwide the Fox Weather products will be built to serve our audiences in a customized fashion‚Äù Berg said.

A Fox Weather spokesperson pointed the Guardian to a statement given to the New York Times:

‚ÄúWith a dedicated team of leading meteorologists and experts stationed across the country Fox Weather will provide in-depth reporting surrounding all weather conditions and we are excited to showcase to viewers what a full-service comprehensive weather platform can deliver beginning this fall.‚Äù

If Fox Weather does not interfere with the weather information its new staff is putting out then Maibach said there is hope ‚Äì for the weather channel at least.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect that Fox News will change its ways or its views about climate change anytime soon but Fox Weather has the opportunity to get the facts right. Let‚Äôs hope it chooses to‚Äù Maibach said.

Viewers will have to wait and see what approach Fox Weather takes but in the meantime there is serious concern given the damage the American right has already done to efforts to mitigate the climate crisis.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen the ways in which 40 years of disinformation in the United States has stifled both climate action and the narrative around climate‚Äù said Lily Gardner a community organizer with the Sunrise Movement a youth-led organization which aims to stop climate crisis.

‚ÄúNancy Pelosi [the Democratic House speaker] and Newt Gingrich [a Republican former House speaker] went from releasing an ad together in 2007 that indicated that they were interested in working on climate policy to climate becoming a deeply partisan issue in which the facts are debated as opposed to the solutions.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaG91c2V3aXZlcy1ueWMtZWJvbmktd2lsbGlhbXMtcGFzdC1mb3gtbmV3cy1ob3N0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RHONY: Eboni K.

On Tuesday the day the conference kicked off traffic from private jets got to be so busy that the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned planes on the West Coast from taking off.

The FAA told Fox News it briefly held planes on the ground at their departure airports to avoid congestion in the airspace around Sun Valley.

The manager of the Friedman Memorial Airport in the neighboring town of Hailey Idaho told NPR ahead of the conference that he expected more than 90 private planes.

A session preaching the perils of climate change to people who flew to the event on their own carbon-emitting Gulfstream jets rankled some business leaders that FOX Business contacted earlier in the week.

""Talking climate change on his private jet?"" one CEO remarked with a laugh referring to Gates.

One Twitter used pointed out the ""Climate Hypocrisy.""

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Trump has been suspended from the platforms since January when his followers violently stormed the Capitol building trying to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential win.

The companies cited concerns that Trump would incite further violence and have kept him locked out.

All three declined comment on Wednesday.

An estimate based on the latest available figures puts the total wealth of those known to be in attendance and those rumored to be attending at $588 billion.

The estimated net worth of those already in attendance is about $340 billion.

Other influential names on the guest list are Bezos' successor Andy Jassy who is set to take over the reins at Amazon.

Reclaim The Net web site also reported that WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar is among the invitees from the world of media along with Diane Sawyer Cooper and Van Jones and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.

Former US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Council of Foreign Relations President Richard Haass are among the public officials on the invite list Reclaim The Net reported.

Those attending investment bank Allen & Co.'s annual conference will need to have been vaccinated and show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.

Over the holiday weekend private jets belonging to business leaders began arriving at the local airport and taking up space on the tarmac at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey as they parked up for the week.

From there guests were chauffeured through 15 miles of lush rolling hills to the lodge where the conference takes place.

Rival chief executives including Amazon's Jeff Bezos along with his successor Andy Jassy Comcast Corp.'s Brian Roberts are all said to be on the guest list.

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

'There's a lot of assets out there that have good IP that will probably get new homes' he said.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

Attendees at the last conference in 2019 included Facebook bosses Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg; Disney's Bob Iger; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki; Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch who is the CEO of Fox Corporation; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman; Instagram COO Marne Levine; McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook and billionaire media executive Shari Redstone.

The conference began in 1982 and in its early days founder Herbert Allen - who co-founded Allen & Company with brother Charles - had to beg invitees to come.

In case the unitholders' bank account is not eligible for an electronic payment a cheque or demand draft will be issued and sent to their registered address by SBI MF.

With this the total disbursement will reach ‚Çπ21080 crore amounting to 84 per cent of assets under management (AUM) as on April 23 2020 a Franklin Templeton MF spokesperson said on Sunday.

Under the first disbursement in February investors received ‚Çπ9122 crore while ‚Çπ2962 crore were paid to investors during the week of April 12 ‚Çπ2489 crore during the week of May 3 and in the latest disbursement during the week of June 7 investors were paid ‚Çπ3205 crore.

""SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd (SBI MF) would be distributing the next tranche of ‚Çπ3302.75 crore to unitholders across all six schemes. The payment to all investors whose accounts are KYC compliant with all details available will be made during the week of July 12 2021"" the spokesperson said.

The amount to be distributed to unitholders will be paid by extinguishing proportionate units at the net asset value dated July 9 this year he added.

The payment will be made electronically to all eligible unitholders by SBI MF which has been appointed as the liquidator for the schemes under winding up by the Supreme Court.

In case the unitholders' bank account is not eligible for an electronic payment a cheque or demand draft will be issued and sent to their registered address by SBI MF.

In March the Supreme Court accepted the standard operating procedure (SOP) finalised by SBI MF to monetise assets and distribute the proceeds to unitholders of the six debt schemes of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund.

Franklin Templeton MF shut its six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23 2020 citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market.

The schemes -- Franklin India Low Duration Fund Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund Franklin India Credit Risk Fund Franklin India Short Term Income Plan Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund -- together had an estimated ‚Çπ25000 crore as AUM.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMS9mbGlwa2FydC12YWx1ZWQtYXQtMzctNi1iaWxsaW9uLWluLW5ldy0zLTYtYmlsbGlvbi1mdW5kcmFpc2Uv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2ZsaXBrYXJ0LXZhbHVlZC1hdC0zNy02LWJpbGxpb24taW4tbmV3LTMtNi1iaWxsaW9uLWZ1bmRyYWlzZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flipkart valued at $37.6 billion in new $3.6 billion fundraise,"Flipkart said on Monday it has raised $3.6 billion at a post-money valuation of $37.6 billion in what is widely believed to be the pre-IPO round for the Indian e-commerce conglomerate as it works to list in the public markets as soon as early next year.

The new round of funding ‚Äî by far the largest for any Indian startup ‚Äî was led by GIC Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart along with investments from sovereign funds DisruptAD Qatar Investment Authority Khazanah Nasional Berhad Tencent Willoughby Capital Antara Capital Franklin Templeton and Tiger Global.

The Monday investment marks the return of SoftBank as a shareholder of Flipkart. SoftBank which had taken the exit from the startup when the Bangalore-based firm sold majority stakes to Walmart in 2018 at a valuation of $22 billion has reinvested about $500 million in the new round.

‚ÄúAt Flipkart we are committed to transforming the consumer internet ecosystem in India and providing consumers access and value. This investment by leading global investors reflects the promise of digital commerce in India and their belief in Flipkart‚Äôs capabilities to maximise this potential for all stakeholders‚Äù said Kalyan Krishnamurthy Chief Executive Officer at Flipkart Group in a statement.

‚ÄúAs we serve our consumers we will focus on accelerating growth for millions of small and medium Indian businesses including kiranas. We will continue to invest in new categories and leverage made-in-India technology to transform consumer experiences and develop a world-class supply chain.‚Äù

As part of the new fundraise Flipkart is also giving its employees the option to sell their stock options worth $80.5 million Krishnamurthy told them on Monday.

Flipkart had originally hit the market to raise money early this year and was initially looking to raise just about $1 billion TechCrunch first reported.

The Bangalore-headquartered firm competes neck to neck with Amazon in India. The American e-commerce group has invested over $6.5 billion in the South Asian market.

Both the firms are struggling to aggressively expand their footprint in India where physical stores continue to drive the vast majority of retail sales. They are also expected to be severely hit by India‚Äôs new e-commerce rules.

E-commerce platform JioMart a joint venture between Reliance Retail (India‚Äôs largest retail chain) and Google and Facebook-backed Jio Platforms (India‚Äôs largest telecom operator) launched last year in over 200 cities and towns across the nation.

At stake is one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing e-commerce markets that is poised to grow even further as more first-time internet users begin to shop online. India‚Äôs e-commerce market is estimated to reach more than 300 million shoppers by 2025 according to estimates by Bain & Company. These shoppers would have bought items worth more than $100 billion from online platforms the firm projected.

In recent years Flipkart and Amazon have made a number of bets to expand their reach in India. Both of them have rolled out support for Hindi language (Flipkart has added several additional Indian languages as well) and partnered with neighborhood stores.

‚ÄúFlipkart is a great business whose growth and potential mirrors that of India as a whole ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we invested in 2018 and why we continue to invest today‚Äù said Judith McKenna President and CEO of Walmart International in a statement.

Flipkart says it has amassed over 350 million registered users across its services ‚Äî including fashion e-commerce Myntra ‚Äî in the country. ‚ÄúFlipkart‚Äôs logistics and supply chain arm Ekart employs more than 100000 people and makes deliveries to more than 90% of the addressable pin-codes in India which coupled with strategic warehouse infrastructure investments is one of the group‚Äôs core strengths. Venturing into the social commerce space Flipkart recently announced the launch of Shopsy which will encourage local entrepreneurship‚Äù the firm said.",,,,,,,,,

Prices vary hugely and many are packed with features and tools that you simply won't need if you're just starting out. That's where the Garmin Forerunner 55 comes in. It's not the most advanced watch out there (it won't help you navigate off-road like the Garmin Fenix 6 or tell you when to use energy gels like the Polar Grit X) but it's ideally suited to the needs of runners who are just starting out.

Watches in the Forerunner series have always ranked well in our guide to the best running watches and we were particularly impressed by the entry-level Forerunner 55 when we reviewed it earlier this year. It doesn't just track time and distance ‚Äì it helps give your training structure in the early days and adapts to help you reach your first goal however modest or ambitious it may be. If you're new to running we think it's the best watch you can choose.

Price

The Garmin Forerunner 55 cost $199.99 / ¬£179.99 / AU$329 when it launched in early June. It's only seen a very slight drop in price since then if you buy it from a third-party retailer like Amazon. That's still a very reasonable price; while there are cheaper running watches available none can match the GPS accuracy and training tools offered by the Forerunner 55.

You'll also get access to everything in the Garmin Connect app free of charge. While Fitbit hides some of its app features away behind a monthly subscription fee all your historic data and trends are available to view without paying a penny more with extra stats including fitness age sleep score hydration tracking and more all at your fingertips. There are even free workouts and training plans to follow.

If you decide to upgrade to a higher-end Garmin watch later the app will transfer all your data across automatically. You can even switch between two Garmin watches whenever you feel like it. Provided one is marked as your 'main' device the app will have no trouble syncing data from either one.

Design

The Garmin Forerunner 55 looks almost identical to its predecessor the Forerunner 45 and it's a design that's well suited to beginners. It foregoes the usual touchscreen for a series of buttons around the circumference of the case which helps keep costs down but not at the expense of usability. Each control is clearly labelled to avoid confusion (which can easily arise with multi-function buttons) and the top right control for starting and stopping an activity is highlighted in a contrasting color to avoid mistakes mid-run.

The Garmin Forerunner 55 has a fairly small case and a band suitable for a particularly wide range of wrist sizes (Image credit: Future)

The use of buttons rather than a touchscreen also means that the Forerunner 55 is easy to use while wearing gloves in wet weather or while swimming (the watch has a water resistance rating of 5ATM making it suitable for depths up to 50 meters).

The Forerunner 55 is a relatively small running watch with a face measuring 42mm in diameter making it suitable for a wide range of wrist sizes. Like all models in the Forerunner series it comes with a single silicone band with a buckle fastening and perforations along the entire length which can fit wrist sizes from 126-203mm

For comparison the standard band on the Garmin Venu 2 fits wrists measuring 110-175mm in circumference and the 45mm Vivoactive 4 is suitable for wrists measuring 135-200mm.

Garmin started out as a company specializing in GPS navigation systems and it's still one of its strongest suits. The Foreunner 55 is one of the cheapest GPS running watches available and in our real-world tests it proved accurate to within a few meters on our pre-measured course (a margin of error small enough to be explained by the width of pavements).

This allows you to track exactly how far and fast you're running (data clearly displayed on the watch's screen during a workout then synced to the Garmin Connect app immediately afterwards) but the Forerunner 55 has a lot more to offer new runners than just time and distance.

Set a goal and Garmin Coach will create a custom plan to help you achieve it (Image credit: Garmin)

One new feature introduced with the Forerunner 55 is suggested workouts which can help give your training some structure even if you're not following a specific plan. As a new runner it can be easy to get into the habit of running the same route at the same pace but the Forerunner 55 can help you mix things up with suggestions for interval sessions and tempo runs. These are personalized to suit you based on factors including your fitness level past activity and recovery times.

If you have a specific goal in mind (running your first 10k for example) the Garmin Coach tool can help you get there with a more focused plan. In the Garmin Connect app set a date to achieve your target and how many days a week you want to run and Garmin Coach will generate a custom plan that will adapt to suit you and will sync with your watch so it's only a couple of button presses away.

For example once you've finished a run the Forerunner 55 uses your workout and heart rate data to calculate how long you should rest before your next effort to help you avoid under- or over-training.

Biometrics

Even if two people run the same distance in the same time their relative levels of fitness might mean that one is working significantly harder than the other. That's where heart rate can come in handy making sure you're not pushing yourself too hard on longer runs or holding back in intense interval sessions.

The Forerunner 55 makes it easy to train by heart rate and can suggest training sessions based on this rather than distance or speed.

The Forerunner 55 also measures your heart rate continuously throughout the day and uses this data to give you practical advice. The World Health Organization recommends that adults carry out a certain amount of physical activity each week. The Forerunner 55 translates this into 'intensity minutes' and advises how long you should aim to spend performing moderate or vigorous activity.

The Garmin Connect app can use heart rate data to estimate your VO2 max which is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise. It's a good measure of fitness but the number itself might not be very useful to new runners. To put it into context the app will tell you how your score compares to other people of the same age and gender and use it together with your resting heart rate and BMI to calculate your 'fitness age'. It will then give you practical tips on how to improve you fitness and lower your 'age'.

It's not just about workouts either; the watch also uses heart rate variability to track your stress levels throughout the day too which can help you understand the daily circumstances that make you feel anxious. The Forerunner 55 can also lead you through a guided breathing exercise designed to lower your heart rate when it detects that you're feeling the pressure.

That's before you factor in tools that help you recover after your workout including sleep tracking and Body Battery energy monitoring. If you're just starting out it's all extremely useful advice presented in a way that's easy to understand and genuinely useful.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXRobGV0ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vZXF1aW5veC1hcHAtaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLWFuZC1vdGhlci1yZWxhdGVkLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Equinox+ App Introduction and Other Related News,"This week Equinox the luxury gym operator launched the Equinox+ app. The launch brings two existing apps together to provide a streamlined experience.

The newly integrated Equinox+ offers seamless access to physical and digital programming with unlimited on-demand and in-club access live classes personalized scheduling activity tracking and more. According to the Equinox website the decision to integrate the two apps was an evolution of their continued vision for the brand.

The new app aims to focus more on building community features connecting experiences and further integrating member recommendations. Most importantly it gives members the ability to ‚Äúpower their pursuit in the club at home or wherever they are whenever they‚Äôre ready.‚Äù You do not need to be an Equinox club member to access the Equinox+ app (you can purchase a subscription separately for $39.99/month) however all Equinox club members still receive complimentary access to the app. One thing not yet available in the Equinox+ App is the integration capability with Strava an app that lets users track running riding and other physical activity leveraging GPS. Peloton Whoop Garmin as well as other fitness apps provide this integration. Strava grew exponentially during 2020 and is currently valued at $1.5 billion.

Equinox also made headlines this week for two other developments. After rumours about the company going public according to Bloomberg News negotiations between Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. VI and Equinoxunravelled as the two could not come to terms on the company‚Äôs valuation. Bloomberg News had previously reported that the two parties had the company valued at more than $7.5 billion.

In other Equinox news the fitness chain is being sued by their landlord for defaulting on more than $3.3 million in rent and other charges at its Soho location Crain‚Äôs New York reported Wednesday. According to The Real Deal rent for the luxury gym at 568 Broadway runs at $172000 per month excluding taxes and utilities. A group of investors led by Allied Partners say they haven‚Äôt received a payment since April 2020. This is not the first time Equinox has been accused of falling behind on its payments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2Rhc2gtY2Ftcy84ODE2MC9nYXJtaW4tZGFzaC1jYW0tNjZ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Dash Cam 66W - Review 2021,"The $250 Garmin 66W is more than just a dash cam‚Äîit includes driver assist alerts that can help you avoid an accident. Its small footprint means it doesn‚Äôt hamper your line of vision and it pairs with an intuitive smartphone app that lets you view download and save pictures video and data from the device and makes controlling it very easy. While the Garmin 66W sits on the pricier end of the dash cam spectrum it's a strong value for all that it offers and earns our Editors' Choice award for dash cams.

Garmin 66W Interface and Setup

The Garmin 66W includes everything you need to get up and running except for a microSD card. We appreciate that Garmin includes two USB cables and magnet mounts for the windshield mount in case you misplace one or want to move the camera between vehicles. The dual-port USB 12-volt adapter is another nice touch so that you can also plug in a phone.

Once we secured the magnet mount to the windshield of a 2018 Honda CR-V by attaching the opposite sticky side it was just a matter of attaching the dash cam mount to the magnet plugging the USB cable into the device and plugging the other end into the car‚Äôs 12-volt outlet. After supplying info on country region and vehicle size we were ready to roll although we also took time to tweak the camera resolution and driver assistance settings through the device rather than the app.

Garmin 66W Features and Video Quality

The Garmin 66W measures approximately 1.6 by 2.2 by 1.4 inches (HWD) so it easily stays out of your line of view. It has a 2-inch display on the side that faces you and four buttons along the right side. The USB plug on the left makes it easy to dock the power cable (something we would've liked on the Papago GoSafe 535) while the bottom houses the micro USB port and three small cooling vents. We noticed that the Garmin 66W was constantly warm to the touch after about 15 minutes of use and not just on hot sunny days although this didn‚Äôt impact performance.

The camera offers an extremely wide 180-degree field of view and can capture 1440p video at 30 frames per second; it also offers 1080p at 60fps or 30fps and 720p at 30fps. In our tests video quality was impressive during the day on the 1080p setting at 60fps easily capturing essential visuals such as car make and license plate details.

That said image quality was only average at night and marred by headlight flare. On the plus side with a $35 accessory cable the camera can be used in a parking-surveillance mode.

The 66W records continuously when turned on while manually pressing the bottom switch on the left side takes a photo and holding it captures video. Since it has voice control you can also ask it to take a picture or video though it doesn't offer Alexa voice integration like the Garmin Speak or the Nextbase 552GW.

The camera time stamps images and includes GPS coordinates (which can be turned off) to pinpoint exactly where an incident occurred. It also has a Travelapse feature that can capture time-lapse video if you want to share a virtual drive with others.

Garmin‚Äôs phone app (for Android and iOS) is a handy companion that allows not only viewing saving and downloading images and data but also connects to the device via built-in Wi-Fi to stream real-time footage which could work as a video sentry for security-minded car owners‚Äîas long the device is in range. The app can also be used to adjust settings which is easier than doing it via the small buttons on the camera itself and provides a direct link to tech support.

While the 66W is a good dash cam a big reason you're paying $250 is for the driver assistance features including forward collision lane departure warning and a ‚Äúgo‚Äù alert that sounds when the vehicle ahead pulls away but yours remains stationary (which is very helpful for avoiding being honked at).

While not as sophisticated and dependable as similar driver assistance features in the Honda CR-V we used for testing the camera did an impressive job of detecting trouble ahead. That makes it an excellent addition to any vehicle that doesn't come with these safety features built-in.

Plenty of Dash Cam for the Price

At $250 the Garmin 66W costs a good deal more than the $90 Papago GoSafe 535 but it's also one of the most feature-filled models for the price compared with the relatively simple BlackVue DR750X-1CH Plus. It checks all the boxes for what you expect a dash cam to do and its driver-assistance features work well and can save you from an accident making it worth considering alone. It also doesn't require a monthly plan like the even pricier Owl Car Cam so it's a more cost-effective option over the long run as well as our Editors' Choice winner for high-end dash cams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnQzLmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3RhY3gtYm9vc3QtcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tacx Boost review: a cheap turbo trainer that cuts too many corners,"Here's the Tacx Boost Bundle review in a sentence if you're in a real hurry: this budget turbo trainer is about as affordable as turbos from big-name brands get but still quite hard to recommend.

Tacx which is part of Garmin make a wide range of indoor trainers ranging from tech-free rollers to the whistles and bells Tacx NEO Bike Smart Trainer which is one of the best turbo trainers you can buy. The Boost is a budget offering from the range ‚Äì the very cheapest that Tacx does in fact. It's an analogue trainer with magnetic resistance that‚Äôs simple fairly compact. It does most of what most beginners and less demanding users will need it to do and you don't even need to plug it in which makes deciding where to place it pretty damn simple.

If you‚Äôre someone who prefers low tech options or is looking for a training setup on a budget it‚Äôs worth having a closer look. With the Tacx Boost you essentially bolt your road bike in place and get pedalling.

While the Tacx Boost doesn‚Äôt offer features that smart trainers offer like integrated power speed and cadence sensors the option looked at here is a bundle that comes supplied with a Garmin Cadence Sensor that does offer some of the functionality of smart trainers and allows you to use apps such as Zwift Sufferfest or Trainer Road. That's a good thing since a turbo trainer without any visual feedback on what you're doing is more of a tedious torture device than a fun way to get fit.

Tacx Boost bundle: Price and availability

Widely available from bike fitness and general retailers as well as Garmin's own online store the Tacx Boost has a recommended price of ¬£249.99 in the UK $329.99 in the USA and AU$349.99 in Australia.

Please note that what we are reviewing here is what Garmin describes as the Tacx Boost Bundle. That means it comes with a speed sensor thrown in. Since this is fairly essential the Bundle should really be the default package.

Tacx Boost: setup

(Image credit: Tacx)

Open the box and you‚Äôll find that you have a little bit of assembly to do but it‚Äôs pretty simple ‚Äì think Ikea rather than full-on carpentry. There‚Äôs the main frame the resistance unit and a few bolts plus an allen key to tighten it up. You can adjust the position of the unit to adapt to different wheel sizes; for example a 700c road wheel or a 29er mountain bike wheel. Once you‚Äôve got the main trainer put together you‚Äôre nearly there.

Also in the box is a quick release (QR) axle which you need to swap on to your bike to use with the trainer. And here we reach the first negative point; there‚Äôs no thru-axle option included. Thru axles are increasingly common particular with bikes that use disc brakes and while you can purchase an adapter to use with the trainer it seems a shme given how common they are not to have this included.

The Tacx Neo is a resistance trainer with the resistance generated against the rear wheel/tyre by a magnetic unit; other common resistance units include fluid resistance trainers which use you guessed it fluid and flywheels which use air resistance. The benefit to the approach employed by the Tacx Boost is that you don‚Äôt need to remove your rear wheel to fit it in the trainer the downside is that if you use it a lot it can cause wear and tear on your rear tyre.

Once you‚Äôve popped your bike on the trainer and rested the front wheel in the stop included in the box you‚Äôll need to pop on the control unit. This is a cable that stretches from the trainer unit to the handlebars where it can be attached with a little lever that allows you to control the resistance levels while you ride. There are 10 levels with 0 indicating no resistance and 10 the highest level of resistance.

The setup is pretty quick and easy and the unit itself is low profile and even folds down to a compact shape for storage.

Tacx Boost: Connectivity and compatibility

(Image credit: Tacx)

Since the trainer is analogue it doesn‚Äôt have any inbuilt sensors and therefore won‚Äôt provide any information on your riding in of itself.

If you want any such data and particularly if you want to use a training app like Zwift you‚Äôll need to add a sensor separately. However if you‚Äôve opted for the Boost bundle option like we recommended earlier you‚Äôll find a Garmin Cadence Sensor unit in the box; this just needs to be fitted to the rear wheel and paired with a device such a bike computer or smart watch.

If you use something like Zwift just start pedalling and the app will recognise that there is input coming from a sensor unit. Then you're good to go.

Tacx Boost: Performance

After use the Boost folds away to quite a small size (Image credit: Tacx)

For a basic trainer the Boost does what it needs too. Resistance is fairly smooth around the whole pedal stroke and at low and moderate efforts is effective. However when you start to push the power or move about more a few issues start to arise.

Firstly this isn‚Äôt a particular quiet unit despite Tacx's claims to the contrary. Think vacuum cleaner levels of noise which means if you‚Äôve got think walls and sensitive neighbours early morning and late-night training sessions are a bit limited.

Secondly although the unit feels fairly sturdy and there are support legs for stability it isn‚Äôt in fact all that stable particularly if you are a taller or heavier rider. This is an issue even when simply mounting and dismounting the trainer.

That said the 10 levels of resistance offer plenty to play with whether you want to simulate climbs or train for strength or are looking for a lower resistance but faster cadence session. Tacx claims a maximum wattage of 1050watts although if you like to stand up and sprint out the power the lack of stability means you may well need to reign it in a little to avoid tipping over.

Tacx Boost: verdict

Considered on its own the Tacx Boost is an okay budget no frills trainer with a few faults that nevertheless does a reasonable job. It‚Äôs simple to set up doesn‚Äôt require power and is relatively low priced. On the flip side it‚Äôs pretty loud a bit unstable and doesn‚Äôt offer much in the way of metrics.

However where it really falls down is that there are other trainers on the market at a similar price ‚Äì or only slightly more ‚Äì that offer considerably more in terms of design stability and features. So really unless you want the absolute entry level it's overall quite hard to recommend the Tacx Boost.

Tacx Boost: also consider

(Image credit: Tacx)

The Tacx Flow Smart is generally available for just a few more dollars or pounds than the Boost but it includes integral speed and distance sensors which will connect more easily with apps like Zwift. It's a full blown smart trainer but because it's been around longer it's now even better value for money than the Boost.

Another slightly more expensive option is Wahoo Kickr Snap. That's Wahoo's entry-level turbo trainer and a considerably better one in our opinion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnLzYtZml0bmVzcy1iYW5kcy14aWFvbWktZml0Yml0LWFwcGxld2F0Y2gtZ2FybWktbW9uaXRvci1maXRuZXNzLWFjdGl2aXRpZXMtd2luLXByaXplcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Fitness Bands (Xiaomi FitBit Applewatch and Garmi) To Monitor Your Fitness Activities And Win Prizes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://dollarsandsense.sg/6-fitness-bands-xiaomi-fitbit-applewatch-garmi-monitor-fitness-activities-win-prizes/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnLzYtZml0bmVzcy1iYW5kcy14aWFvbWktZml0Yml0LWFwcGxld2F0Y2gtZ2FybWktbW9uaXRvci1maXRuZXNzLWFjdGl2aXRpZXMtd2luLXByaXplcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Even with people buying modern Macs with energy-sipping Arm chips and even with some students and corporate workers picking up Chromebooks during the pandemic Windows still holds on 83% market share for personal computers according to technology industry research company Gartner. It's been in the pole position uninterrupted since Gartner kept keeping track in 2000 and probably for at least a decade before that as well.

Today Windows represents 14% of Microsoft's total revenue and historically Windows has been more profitable than other parts of the $2 trillion company. When Windows grows Microsoft benefits.

So the company is once again refreshing Windows with the announcement of Windows 11 on June 24.

Alas Zillmer's Sniper Speed chassis was hoisted onto a rollback and the Cleveland North Dakota driver was given a ride to victory lane in a side-by-side driven by Jamestown Speedway's Travis Edinger.

The worst wreck on opening night of the 32nd annual Dakota Classic Modified Tour happened after the supporting-class IMCA Stock Cars and Zillmer had taken the checkered flag.

Zillmer's throttle stuck open as he passed under the flag stand to complete the 25-lap race and before the local driver could disable his engine he was launched off the south end of the speedway and rolled multiple times in a scary wreck that ended with Zillmer's No. 34 being stopped by the pit fence.

""I went to hit the throttle and then went to let off the throttle and nothing happened"" Zillmer said. ""I was reaching for the kill switch and couldn't get it. Next thing I know we were in the fence.""

Up to crossing the finish line Zillmer survived a wild seven-caution streets feature after starting fourth and taking over the lead on Lap 3. The winner first held off 2014 Dakota Classic streets points champion Dalton Flory who mistimed sliding up in front of Zillmer on the exit of Turn 4 while attempting to complete Lap 5.

Zillmer slowed having thought his left-front tire had been cut and the caution was displayed. Flory who started third was sent to the rear of the 24-car field and would ultimately score a DNF in 18th after turning around Mike Swallers in Turns 1 and 2 while battling for fourth with two laps remaining.

""He hit me and it stopped my tire so I thought it was cut"" Zillmer said of the early incident. ""I pulled up out of the way and then they threw the yellow right away.""

Zillmer eventually led 23 of the 25 circuits holding off Zachary Madrid of Phoenix Arizona and Minot's Bob Fuegmann over a green-white-checkered finish. The win paid Zillmer $1000.

""It's pretty cool"" Zillmer said. ""This is my home track. We're 30 miles from home.

""I wish it would've ended a little differently. But oh well there's always tomorrow.""

Zillmer's car appeared to be heavily damaged from the freak rollover. The six-night tour continues Sunday in Minot.

Opening night brought in 35 street stocks and 54 modifieds.

""We'll look at it I guess"" Zillmer said. ""It didn't look good.""

The incident happened at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor around 2:30 p.m. shortly after refueling a 30-foot vessel. The boat pushed away from the launch area and then exploded.

Officials say three Nevada game wardens and two trainees responded to the scene with the first warden using his vessel to push the damaged boat away from the injured boaters.

Two men on board the boat were injured and taken to the hospital along with two of the wardens and one trainee for their injuries.

‚ÄúIncidents such as these are incredibly tragic‚Äù said NDOW Lt. Chris Walther. ‚ÄúThankfully our game wardens were on the scene quickly and were able to provide life-saving aid.‚Äù

The evolution of cloud artificial technology and IoT has further transformed efficiency and access in a big way.





Gartner has predicted that by 2022 about 50 percent of the existing spend analysis and procurement tools will be replaced by AI-driven cloud-based purchasing platforms. Hence it makes perfect sense to use the same technologies to power procurement.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äî where the business world had to face disruptions in supply chains due to lockdown and movement restrictions ‚Äî e-procurement becomes even more important.





There are foundries and manufacturing industries involved in producing critical need materials who need to proactively source raw materials alongside an emphasis on the quality of the materials. The facility of e-tendering and e-contracting ensures speedy fulfilment of the need.

E-procurement platforms are technology-driven online portals which are owned and operated by companies and in some cases governments.

Businesses register on these platforms and state their requirements which has a list of registered vendors who digitally bid for the requirements. And as per the company‚Äôs considerations the contract is given to a vendor.





In a pandemic impacted business landscape the importance of a robust and shock-proof supply chain can‚Äôt be overemphasised.





Indian metal manufacturing sector requires a constant supply of quality raw materials for production and in the conventional approach there are several risk factors.





For instance the conventional procurement process requires the purchasing department to hold one-on-one interactions with the vendors where bids are submitted and evaluated manually. This inherently puts a limit to the number of vendors that can bid for a requirement and this limitation can impact the quality and reliability of the supply chain.





Through digital procurement a lot of complicated and cumbersome processes are either eliminated or become simplified. Here are a few examples:

E-tendering

Through e-tendering companies can make the procurement process simpler for specific raw materials and specialised goods such as machinery and can easily procure small or large quantities as required.

Vendor management

For any company that requires a steady flow of supplies and raw materials for its operations vendor management is a core need. This has to be done with a focus on production excellence cost control quality assurance and risk mitigation. Vendor management enhances value from the vendors and contracting speedier.

Cloud-based supply chain management

There is a need to compile and organise the supply chain data from suppliers. This is essential for cybersecurity purposes and future procurement planning.





The data collection also provides insights about sources and the flexibility of modifying supply chains in instances of remote working. In the wake of the pandemic cloud-based procurement has become a highly beneficial option for manufacturers.

Data analytics-driven crisis management

Automatic data analysis in the source-to-pay (S2P) process is extremely important for businesses more so in crisis management situations. A good e-procurement platform allows such desired analytics-driven crisis management helping you deal with the changes more effectively and speedily.

Production driven procurement

Traditionally the production process and procurement existed in silos. However with the advent of technology there is an opportunity to ensure better harmony and coordination between these two functions.





As per a study ensuring procurement and production processes‚Äô joint optimisation could result in up to a 25 percent increase in efficiency.





By opting for e-procurement businesses also derive various benefits and can drive leaner and optimised procurement operations. A company can not only purchase the required raw materials but can also maintain real-time inventory records.





As a business you can determine the volume of raw materials in stock and required over a specific time. Considering the standard time taken by the procurement and delivery processes business leaders can proactively manage inventory and place orders for raw materials.





Transparency of operations is another great benefit of e-procurement. At any time all the information is precisely stacked into various segments and there is easy access to process timelines.





Records related to a purchase made a year ago can be as easily accessible as the information for the previous week. Thus there is greater management of revolving credit and payment cycles without any friction with the vendors.





Time is of the utmost essence in the post-COVID scenario and e-procurement proves to be a great time saver. An organisation can place its requirements online select from the bids submitted after due analysis and place the order.





The order fulfilment becomes faster and the invoicing and payments are handled digitally. The cost of time and reliability has never been higher. Imagine if one could have reliable procurement platforms and save millions in interest and working capital costs.

Conclusion

Manufacturing sector players are now familiar with the role e-procurement can play in resolving their problems and eliminating the supply chain bottlenecks.





Advanced AI-driven e-procurement platforms provide constant inputs analytics and help businesses set parameters for their requirements.





By using such platforms to source raw materials manufacturers can seamlessly focus on productivity and manufacturing without any production and procurement worries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdkbm9ubGluZS5jb20vRGV0YWlscy85NTA5MjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE Business: Watania signs BIOS Middle East as Business Continuity Provider,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.gdnonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /Details/950922 (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdkbm9ubGluZS5jb20vRGV0YWlscy85NTA5MjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Crystal clear display

Larger screen than previous model

Built-in smart home hub Cons Expensive

No Z-Wave integration

We had a feeling that the Amazon Echo Show was due for an update. With competition from Google Assistant via Lenovo‚Äôs gorgeous Smart Display and JBL‚Äôs Link View which both feature better sound and display quality Amazon needed to catch up.

The company delivered with the (2nd generation) Amazon Echo Show  an Alexa speaker with a screen when that was released in October 2018 with a starting price of $230. Needless to say the market continues to grow with new entries adding new features that make smart displays valuable gadgets in the home.

Of course you may want to consider its successor in the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) which in notable for having a 10-inch display attached to a motor ‚Äî so that it can follow your movement around a room. Plus it also doubles as a security camera with Alexa Guard enabled. Or perhaps some of Amazon‚Äôs other smaller sized smart displays like the Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) or Amazon Echo Show 8 (2021).

Alexa Show me movie times

Like the previous Echo Show the new Show looks a little bit like a propped-up tablet. But the new Show has a bigger 10-inch crystal clear display (the old one was 7 inches). It serves as a smart hub meaning that it can use the Zigbee protocol to connect to smart home devices.

Another difference between the old and new devices is the shape. The older version resembled a blocky old-school TV while the new one is more streamlined with a sandstone or charcoal fabric backing. It‚Äôs ideal for a kitchen environment where you could ask Alexa to show you tutorials on say how to make lasagna.

Amazon stepped up sound quality by adding dual two-inch premium drivers a passive bass radiator and Dolby processing. In addition you can adjust the treble and bass with just your voice from across the room. You can also use the Show to set up Alexa‚Äôs Multi-room audio feature.

You can adjust the treble and bass with just your voice from across the room.

The Show features better integration with Ring (owned by Amazon) security products specifically its video doorbells. When your Ring doorbell rings you can see who‚Äôs at the front door on the Show screen. With a Hulu subscription you can also watch live TV on the device and make Skype calls.

Beyond that the Show does all the things a regular Echo speaker can do like add items to your shopping list set timers or tell you the square root of 52000 (answer: 228.03508502). For those of you who get creeped out by devices with a screen in your homes there‚Äôs a way to turn both the camera and speaker off for privacy.

Alexa play Cardi B.

We got a chance to tinker with the new Show and came away impressed with the improved sound quality. We mean significantly improved. We set the new Echo Show next to the old one to conduct side-by-side testing on sound and were blown away. It‚Äôs clear that Amazon bumped the sound from the good enough category to the good-enough-to-play-during-a-party category.

We asked Alexa to play Cardi B.‚Äôs I Like It which has a decent amount of bass. While our old Echo Show tends to sound a bit muffled with songs featuring bold bass the new Show handled the task well providing a grown-up clear bold room-filling version of the song. We had a similar experience when we asked Alexa to take it down a notch with The Beatles‚Äô Let it Be. The instrumentals and lyrics blended well. And if you want more oomph you can optionally pair the Show with the new Echo Sub and other Echo speakers to double down on sound.

We had both devices play Uptown Funk and found that the new Show did an excellent job of projecting a bolder fuller sound across the room creating a multi-dimensional version of the song that wasn‚Äôt present before.

The improvements are big when it comes to the display too. We watched a few minutes of an episode The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and again the improvement in display clarity was stark. Crisp clear images appeared on the screen and the device could definitely be used as a TV if you wish. While it doesn‚Äôt quite match up to the clarity of Lenovo‚Äôs Smart Display with Google Assistant it was a huge improvement over the previous Echo Show.

Obviously it would be a bit difficult to gather ‚Äòround the device as you would a TV because of the way it‚Äôs propped up at an angle. But if you want to watch the game while cooking dinner you‚Äôll get a robust look at what‚Äôs happening.

Alexa turn on the downstairs lamp

We were easily able to get the Show up and running in our smart home. Once plugged in it asked for our Amazon Prime account info our Wi-Fi password and we were good to go. We should note that we already have the Alexa App installed on our phone and we connected the device to a pre-existing network of Echo devices. If this is your first Echo you‚Äôll have more work to do on the front end including setting up your preferred language connecting music streaming services to your account and adding smart home devices that you want your Echo to control. The Alexa app and Show screen will walk you through the steps for a painless setup.

We connected the Show to our Nest camera and were looking at footage from it in no time. The new Show‚Äôs bigger screen and clearer display made a stark difference: We could see whether our son‚Äôs eyes were open or closed while laying in bed ‚Äî something we weren‚Äôt able to do before. We also connected our Noon and Philips Hue lighting and smart plugs and were easily able to turn each device on and off with just the sound of our voice.

Otherwise the Alexa voice assistant is the same you‚Äôd find in any Alexa device ‚Äî she can solve math problems for you tell you what her favorite superhero is set multiple timers make phone calls and so much more. The advantage of a screen comes into play when you need to see video footage play movies or cooking videos make video calls or even answer the Ring doorbell from your voice a new feature that we‚Äôll test out when we get a Ring doorbell installed.

A couple of dings: While we‚Äôre happy to see Zigbee integration we wish Amazon added Z-wave functionality as well to make the Show compatible with a larger variety of smart home devices. Many hubs like Samsung‚Äôs SmartThings Wi-Fi include both. If you want to use any of the more than 2400 devices that use Z-Wave you might need to invest in one.

The fabric backing is definitely an improvement.

Price-wise it has gotten better over time now generally getting down as low as $180. Currently however it sits at its normal $230 cost. In comparison the 10-inch Lenovo Smart Display is $180 while the Google Next Hub Max is $230.

Overall though we came away impressed with the improvements Amazon made in its overhaul of the Echo.

Warranty information

The Echo Show comes with a one-year limited warranty and service. You can buy an extended one- two- or three-year warranties separately.

Try these new features

Alexa keeps getting smarter thanks to frequent updates that expand her toolkit. You can try the following new features with the Amazon Echo Dot with Clock.

Wellness Tips

Working from home has its challenges especially when it relates to health and wellness. Alexa can help by providing some useful wellness tips. To hear them just say ‚ÄúAlexa what is my wellness tip of the day?‚Äù

Group conversation for all of your devices

Getting someone‚Äôs attention in another room can be challenging especially if you have kids who routinely crank the music in their rooms. You can now conduct group conversations using Alexa‚Äôs Drop In feature where you‚Äôll be able to connect to other Echo devices. Essentially it‚Äôs an intercom system.

Get your reminders on all devices

You can always stay up-to-date with your reminders thanks to a new feature that will play them across all of your Alexa devices. In order to enable this you need to select the Announce on all devices under Settings > Reminders within the Alexa app.

Daily Music Pick

Tired of the same playlist or carousel of songs playing on your Alexa device? Then check out the daily music pick feature that will provide daily music recommendations from Amazon Music. All you need to say is ‚ÄúAlexa play the Daily Music Pick‚Äù and a new artist will automatically choose a song album or playlist.

Our Take

Overall the new Echo Show is better than the old one in every way. With bold sound a 10-inch crystal clear display added smart hub and a streamlined softer look we‚Äôre impressed that Amazon made so many strides in significantly improving the product.

Is there a better alternative?

Smart displays continue to be highly competitive and Google Assistant devices provide the strongest competition. The Google Nest Hub Max ($230) stands tall for being an ultimate smart display that adds one key element you won‚Äôt find in other devices it doubles as a security camera as well. This means it can keep tabs on your home while you‚Äôre away. The Lenovo Smart Display 7 also featuring Google Assistant is a device with a compact design and affordable price point ($100). And even though it‚Äôs not out yet its $250 priced successor may seem like a solid buy as well given its newer features.

As for Echo devices if you don‚Äôt need the screen an Echo ($100) or Echo Dot with LED clock ($60) can provide you with a smart speaker with Alexa voice assistant embedded. You‚Äôll be missing the Zigbee smart hub capabilities though and getting a cookie-baking tutorial would be more difficult without the screen. And finally its successor in the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) for $250.

How long will it last?

Amazon Echo devices and Alexa are both here to stay. Alexa is always getting better via firmware updates and added skills. The Echo Show hardware feels sturdy enough to last at least a few years and support for the device should continue for a long time.

Should you buy it?

If you‚Äôre looking for an Alexa-based smart speaker with a screen this is the one to buy. If you‚Äôre not married to Alexa take a look at the Google Nest Hub Max. Either way you‚Äôre getting a great device.

Fleet replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk (T-AO 206) the Military Sealift Command‚Äôs newest ship was christened during a ceremony at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in San Diego Calif. today.



The event was attended by the family of the ship‚Äôs namesake as well as other dignitaries included Carlos Del Torro Secretary of the Navy; former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus; Vice Adm. Jeffery Hughes Dep Chief Naval Operations for Warfighting Development; Rear Admiral Stephen Barnett Commander  Navy Region Southwest; Rear Adm. Michael Wettlaufer Commander Military Sealift Command; Capt. James White Milk's civil service master; Todd Gloria Mayor San Diego Rep. Susan Davis (ret); Dr. Jen Campbell San Diego Council President; Anne Kronenberg activist and Milk‚Äôs former campaign manager; members of the Harvey Milk Foundation and members of the LGBTQ+ community.



The ship honors Navy veteran and LGBT activist Harvey Milk one of the first openly gay candidates elected to public office as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978. He was assassinated On November 10 1978 (10 months after he was sworn in) by fellow City Supervisor Dan White. Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for his activism. USNS Harvey Milk is the first ship named for an openly gay person.



‚ÄúThe secretary of the Navy needed to be here today not just to amend the wrongs of the past but to give inspiration to all of our LGBTQ community leaders who served in the Navy in uniform today and in the civilian workforce as well too and to tell them that we‚Äôre committed to them in the future‚Äù Del Toro said noting that Milk resigned his commission and discharged from the Navy for being gay. ‚ÄúFor far too long sailors like Lt. j.g. Milk were forced into the shadows or worse yet forced out of our beloved Navy. That injustice is part of our Navy history but so is the perseverance of all who continue to serve in the face of injustice.‚Äù



""My uncle never dreamed of having a ship or a street or a park or a school named after him"" said Stuart Milk Harvey's nephew and the keynote speaker at the ceremony. ""What we celebrate today is that the Navy honors the difference between tolerance and acceptance.""



The 746 foot Milk is the second ship in the new John Lewis-class previously known as the TAO(X). This class of oilers has the ability to carry 162000 barrels of diesel ship fuel aviation fuel and dry stores cargo. The upgraded oiler is built with double hulls to protect against oil spills and strengthened cargo and ballast tanks and will be equipped with a basic self-defense capability including crew served weapons degaussing and Nixie Torpedo decoys and has space weight and power reservations for Close In Weapon Systems such as SeaRAMs and an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System. The Lewis-class of oilers will replace the current Kaiser Class fleet replenishment oilers and they age out of the MSC fleet.



‚ÄúA Navy veteran and tireless advocate for equality and universal rights having Harvey Milk as the namesake for this ship as she adds to our Nation‚Äôs strategic advantage in agile logistics is absolutely awesome!‚Äù said Wettlaufer. ‚ÄúWith enhanced capabilities in storage and delivery of fuel and cargo Harvey Milk will support our Navy in the away game as we keep our country safe far from home and protect the sea lines of communication. Important to our economic vitality and assuring allies and partners this ship will help promote freedom of access to international seas and the rules based international order that has sustained the peace over the last 70 years.‚Äù



Speaking before breaking a bottle of champagne across the ship‚Äôs hull the ship‚Äôs sponsor Paula Neira Clinical Program Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health and a Navy veteran said ""When Harvey Milk sails she'll send a message both domestically and around the globe to everybody that believes in justice and freedom and liberty that there is a place for you in this family.""



Following the traditional champagne christening Milk slid down into the water with its horn blowing streamers flying and music from the Navy Band Southwest playing.



Five more Lewis-class oilers are on order for the Navy.

Kennedy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL2EzNjk0NTUxMi9mLTE2LWhpc3Rvcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the F-16 Is Such a Badass Plane | F-16 History,"When U.S. Air Force Captain Gary ‚ÄúNordo‚Äù North took off as leader of a flight of four F-16s on a December morning in 1992 the Fighting Falcon was already a globally respected‚Äîand feared‚Äîfighter. By then more than 2500 F-16s had been delivered worldwide amassing nearly 5 million flight hours.

But that Sunday morning North cared only about the two-seat F-16D he was flying and the three others from his ‚ÄúTop Hats‚Äù 310th Fighter Squadron. They were aloft on the border of southern Iraq as part of Operation Southern Watch patrolling the no-fly zone that the U.S. U.K. and France had established following the Gulf War.

As the flight met up with a KC-135 tanker North and his backseater in ‚ÄúBenji 41‚Äù (the F-16D‚Äôs call sign) heard intense communications between another flight of four F-15 Eagles and an E-3 AWACS airborne control aircraft. An Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) MiG-25 Foxbat had crossed into the no-fly zone baited the Americans and hustled back north at supersonic speed with the F-15s in chase.

In full afterburner the Eagles quickly exhausted their fuel and were forced to leave. That left Nordo‚Äôs F-16s as the go-to American fighters in the area. As described in Craig Brown‚Äôs Debrief: A Complete History of U.S. Aerial Engagements  North and his wingman cut their refueling short taking on only enough gas to cover their assigned patrol time and leaving the two remaining Top Hats to fully refuel.

‚ÄúSomeone was going to die within the next two minutes‚Ä¶and it wasn‚Äôt going to be me or my wingman.‚Äù

Almost immediately AWACS controllers vectored the pair of F-16s toward another Iraqi MiG heading for the no-fly zone which quickly turned back north. In quick succession the E-3 picked up two more Iraqi fighters. Each time North‚Äôs F-16s turned toward them they turned away from the no-fly zone. But a third entering the zone 30 miles west at 30000 feet kept flying east‚Äîstraight toward Benji 41.

While the other two F-16s scrambled to the area from the tanker Nordo lit his afterburner turning his jet and his wingman north to trap the MiG south of them in the no-fly zone. The IQAF fighter couldn‚Äôt flee back to Iraqi territory without a fight.

‚ÄúSomeone was going to die within the next two minutes‚Äù North recalled ‚Äúand it wasn‚Äôt going to be me or my wingman.‚Äù

In addition to two short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles Benji 41 was carrying a pair of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) on its wingtips. North visually picked up the MiG-25 eight miles off his nose. Calling the E-3 for clearance to fire he also told his wingman to go active with his electronic jamming pod. A long 15 seconds later North heard ‚ÄúCleared to kill cleared to kill Bandit Bandit!‚Äù from the AWACS controller .

Nordo fired an AIM-120 calling ‚ÄúFox!‚Äù as it came off his wingtip. The AMRAAM closed on the MiG-25 at Mach 4 shattering it into three large pieces and a fireball in seconds. Diving in afterburner North and his wingman scooted south at top speed.

Despite almost two decades of service North‚Äôs was the first aerial kill for an American F-16.

The Lightweight

Read the Story Popular Mechanics / Ed Valigursky An illustration of the YF-16 published in the November 1975 issue of Popular Mechanics.

As with every fourth-generation U.S. fighter the F-16 was defined by the Air Force‚Äôs experience in Vietnam. In the late 1960s former Air Force fighter pilot Colonel John Boyd and a group of fighter technology analysts known as ‚Äúthe Fighter Mafia‚Äù called for development of a highly maneuverable lightweight fighter aircraft that would be an alternative to heavy complex fighters like the F-4 Phantom F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle‚Äîsome of which were still in design stages.

This idea gained funding and quickly evolved into the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program. In February 1972 six manufacturers submitted design proposals all based on two prime considerations: turning radius and acceleration.

Two months later the General Dynamics Model 401-16B and the Northrop P-600 were chosen for development and a 300-hour fly-off at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Known as YF-16 and YF-17 the prototypes both weighed in at about 20000 pounds empty which was relatively light compared with the 28000-pound F-15 and the 40000-pound F-14.

A team including General Dynamics chief designer Harry Hillaker rolled the YF-16 out in December 1973 just 21 months after the development contract was placed. The diminutive largely aluminum single-engine design incorporated a cropped delta wing blended with the fuselage body. Forward wing strakes an underslung intake and aft underbody ventral fins contributed to a dynamically unstable configuration controlled by the world‚Äôs first fly-by-wire production flight control system.

Combined with a 23840-pound-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-100 afterburning turbofan the purposely unstable design offered a 1.4-to-1 thrust-to-weight ratio eyeball-popping 9G maneuver capability and exceptional pilot visibility under a frameless bubble canopy.

But the YF-16 still needed to provide itself against Northrop‚Äôs competition. After 10 months of testing it was clear that the YF-16 had significantly better maneuverability a longer range and a lower cost than the YF-17. In January 1975 the Air Force pronounced it the winner of the competition and said Uncle Sam would buy at least 650 of them. But the YF-17 didn‚Äôt disappear into obscurity; it would go on to form the bones for the U.S. Navy‚Äôs future F/A-18 Hornet.

The F-16 Reaches Fighter Fame

Despite its initial lightweight day-fighter emphasis the F-16 would immediately develop into a multi-role fighter-bomber. As the LWF was underway NATO allies Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Norway were on the lookout for a replacement for their Lockheed F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers. The similarly sized single-engine YF-16 fit perfectly.

The USAF was also looking to cost-effectively replace the fighter-bomber capabilities of its F-105s and F-4s with an aircraft that could mix with the air-superiority-focused F-15. These imperatives drove changes to the first production F-16s which included a longer fuselage (by 10.6 inches) increased wing area larger ventral fins and two more underwing weapons stations. A larger nose radome also accommodated a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar. As a result weight was increased by 25 percent over the YF-16.

The U.S. Air Force accepted its first production F-16A in January 1979. The 34th Tactical Fighter Squadron became the first unit to fly the F-16 which was officially named ‚ÄúFighting Falcon‚Äù in July 1980. By that time two European production lines had been started and the Belgian Royal Netherlands and Norwegian air forces began receiving F-16As. So did the Israelis.

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) called the F-16 ‚ÄúNetz‚Äù (Hawk) and threw it into combat less than a year after taking delivery. In July 1981 the IAF launched Operation Opera which saw eight F-16As each carrying two unguided 2000-pound bombs boldly fly into Iraq escorted by six IAF F-15As where they struck a nuclear reactor.

The Fighting Falcon‚Äôs first aerial victories came courtesy of the IAF in April 1982 when a Netz shot down a Syrian Air Force MiG-23. That June Israeli F-16s took on more Syrian MiGs during the conflict in Lebanon ultimately being credited with 44 kills.

Its early success in combat combined with its relatively low cost and versatility made the F-16 a hot seller. By May 1982 Venezuela was already the 10th Fighting Falcon customer. In April 1983 the USAF Thunderbirds demonstration team flew its first public air show with F-16s.

From Turkey to Thailand the F-16 was in high demand. Today this fighter is or has been operated by 25 countries and 4588 have been built making the F-16 the second most produced American supersonic jet fighter after the F-4 Phantom. According to Lockheed Martin there have been 10 production blocks of the F-16 from Block 1 in 1979 to the latest Block 70/72 generically known as the F-16V. Between countries blocks and models a total of 139 versions of the jet have been produced over the past four decades.

The Viper and the Weasel

David Poole // Getty Images Illustration of F-16A fighter jets during Operation Desert Storm.

Over the decades the F-16 has unofficially been referred to as ‚Äúthe Viper.‚Äù The name was given it by early F-16 pilots at Hill Air Force Base in Utah reportedly referring to its look before takeoff or to spacecraft in the popular late-‚Äô70s sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica.

Retired USAF Lieutenant Colonel Dan Hampton remembers the first time he saw an F-16 up close. After graduating from flight school in 1987 Hampton went to Luke Air Force Base in Arizona to transition to the Viper. He showed up on a Saturday when things were slow.

‚ÄúI remember dropping my stuff off in the visiting officers‚Äô quarters and driving over to the squadron. Nobody was around. I got out on the flight line and walked up to an airplane. It was the first time I‚Äôd actually seen an F-16 up close. I couldn‚Äôt even get in it but I was thrilled.‚Äù

After training in the F-16A which Hampton and fellow pilots called ‚Äúcoal burners‚Äù because of their age and early F100 engines he went to his first operational unit at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany to learn the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) mission basically taking out enemy surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites using the F-16C. The Air Force called these missions and the aircraft that flew them ‚ÄúWild Weasels.‚Äù

Hampton would go on to fly 151 Wild Weasel sorties in the Viper during both Gulf Wars becoming one of the most decorated Air Force pilots since the Vietnam War. The F-16 he says was and is an ideal Wild Weasel platform owing to its small size (which makes it hard to spot on radar or visually) its modular design (making upgrades easy) and its agility.

‚ÄúThe great thing about the Viper‚Ä¶was that you could do the air-to-air fight on your way into and out of the target area‚Äù Hampton says. ‚ÄúIn the second Gulf War they sent all the [F-15C] Eagles home after the first 10 days. They weren‚Äôt needed because we were there.‚Äù

On one Wild Weasel sortie near Baghdad which Hampton describes in his book  he and his wingman were diverted from SAM killing to intercept Iraqi helicopters attempting to spirit Saddam Hussein away from U.S. forces. The two F-16s rolled in through a cloud break ‚Äúwith everything in Baghdad shooting at us‚Äù and dropping cluster bombs on nearby anti-aircraft sites.

‚ÄúWhen we found the helicopters we hit one with a Maverick [air-to-ground missile] strafed a couple more and my wingman put an AIM-9 [Sidewinder] into one‚Äù Hampton told Popular Mechanics. ‚ÄúThe helo was about to lift off and my wingman didn‚Äôt have any other ordnance left so he shot the Sidewinder at him. There were missions where we used everything we had.‚Äù

The Future of the F-16

ARIS MESSINIS // Getty Images A UAE Air Force F-16 takes off from Andravida Greece April 19 2021.

F-16 production is still going strong at the plant in Greenville South Carolina owned by Lockheed Martin which acquired General Dynamics‚Äô aircraft business in 1993. Right now there‚Äôs a 128-jet backlog for the latest Block 70/72 version ordered by five nations.

Among those nations is Taiwan which will put F-16Vs to vital use facing China across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan‚Äôs new Block 70 Vipers will leverage advanced scanned-array radars more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engines and AGM-158C long-range anti-ship missiles to dissuade China.

With the U.S. Air Force extending the lives of its older F-16s to 12000 flight hours the aircraft could possibly serve into the late 2030s. And the USAF‚Äôs recently muted desire for a non-stealthy Multi-Role Fighter (MR-X) to replace many of its Vipers could see it revisit the aborted delta-wing F-16XL  among other designs.

For the present F-16s around the world will add to the more than 19 million flight hours flown by the type to date. But with all its abilities its best feature is also its most important one‚Äîtaking care of its pilots.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great airplane‚Äù Hampton says. ‚ÄúIt always brought me home alive and I‚Äôm grateful for that.‚Äù

After the YF-16 and YF-17 battled it out to become the next U.S. fighter jet the winner General Dynamics' YF-16 which would become the F-16 made its debut in the pages of Popular Mechanics in November 1975. Described as an aircraft that ""excited so much interest in the world"" the F-16 continued generating that excitement for decades and remains in use by air forces around the world.

Never before has a single military aircraft excited so much interest the world over. It's the F-16 newest hottest addition to U.S. air might and a plane that may well become the most sought after of all time Scarcely off the drawing board the fighter has not only been adopted by our own Air Force but has become the popular choice of four other NATO nations beating out such stiff competition as the famous French Mirage and the radically new canard-winged Swedish Viggen.

Belgium Norway Denmark and the Netherlands have jointly signed up to purchase 350 of the sleek multi-role supersonic jets and other countries including Canada may follow suit. The U.S. Air Force has ordered 650 and the Navy is expected to buy 800 more for carrier use bringing the initial total to 1800. With anticipated additional purchases production runs may eventually go as high as 3000 to 4000 possibly the greatest number of any one aircraft type ever manufactured.

Popular Mechanics / Ed Valigursky Needle-nosed F-16 is small light highly maneuverable fighter capable of Mach 2 speeds.

What accounts for the F-16's incredible appeal? It's not the biggest not the fastest not the most powerful. In fact by modern fighter standards it's a relative baby. Developed by General Dynamics the single-engine single-seater represents a new concept in low-cost high-performance lightweight fighters designed to provide both air superiority and economy at the same time.

It's fast tough deadly and versatile‚Äîall for what is considered the remarkable price of $4.6 million per plane. That may not sound ""cheap"" to those of us who cringe at a $50 grocery bill but in the world of military hardware it's a bargain‚Äîother comparable fighters go for $8 to $12 million apiece.

With an overall length of 47 1‚ÅÑ2 feet and a wingspan of 31 the F-16 is considerably smaller than earlier fighters like the F-14 Grumman Tomcat (62 by 64 feet) and the F-15 McDonnell Douglas Eagle (64 by 43 feet). It's also a lot lighter grossing 22500 pounds against 57300 for the F-14 and 40000 for the F-15. Its small size and low weight are actually the secret of the F-16's phenomenal performance. Compared to other typical fighters it has three times the combat range nearly twice the acceleration rate and less than two-thirds the turning radius at supersonic speeds‚Äîall of which mean it can outfly and outfight just about anything else around.

Mach 2 Speed at Combat Height

Powered by a 25000-pound-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine the F-16 is capable of speeds up to Mach 2-twice the speed of sound‚Äîor nearly 1500 mph at combat altitudes. It is in fact one of the few fighters that can continue to accelerate while climbing straight up.

The F-16's short turning radius and high acceleration allow it to ""close"" with an enemy aircraft and come out on top‚Äîthe key to combat superiority in one-on-one dogfight-type situations. Standard armament consists of two wingtip-mounted Sidewinder missiles and a 20-mm Vulcan cannon capable of an awesome firing rate of 6000 shots a minute. Up to 11000 pounds of additional armament can be carried on under-wing pylons-extra missiles bombs napalm special weaponry‚Äîwhatever is required for the mission.

For long-range operation there is provision for midair refueling or external auxiliary fuel tanks. It's this kind of flexibility that makes the F-16 such a versatile all-purpose plane‚Äîit can carry out air-to-air air-to-ground ground support long-range bombing fighter escort and carrier-based operations.

Fairfax Media Archives // Getty Images A model of the YF-16.

The F-16 is both complex and simple highly sophisticated in design yet ingeniously simple in construction. Elevator panels wing flaps and most of its main landing gear are interchangeable-a repair depot need stock only half as many parts as usual. Servo-actuators operating the controls are identical and interchangeable. The fuselage is designed in three modular sections-nose midsection and tail. The modules can be built in different factories-even in different countries‚Äîthen assembled when needed. If one module is damaged it can be replaced with a duplicate-like changing a fender on a car‚Äîwithout keeping a valuable plane out of service for time-taking repairs.

The P&W F100 engine is the same time-proven one used in the F-15 so engine stocks replacement parts and maintenance know-how are well established. Of the F-16's 373 equipment components 257 are stock off-the-shelf items. Only 50 types of fasteners are used‚Äîall standard‚Äîagainst up to 250 for other fighters.

Now you can begin to see why so many countries are intrigued by the F-16‚Äîits economy and simplification are an air force's dream. The advantages of having a number of NATO nations operating the same aircraft are obvious-parts training and manufacturing facilities can be pooled urgently needed items can be shared stockpiling of many components is reduced and repair and maintenance are vastly simplified.

Entire Plane a 'Lifting Body'

Gilbert UZAN // Getty Images

Aerodynamically the F-16 is a masterpiece of engineering ingenuity. The flattened oval fuselage blends into the wings so the entire plane becomes in effect a ""lifting body.‚Äù Forebody strakes‚Äînarrow flaring strips ahead of the wings‚Äîhelp prevent wing-root stalling at high angles of attack adding lift and improving maneuverability. Leading-edge wing flaps which also increase lift are computer-controlled and function automatically according to speed and attitude‚Äîthe pilot can concentrate on fighting without giving them a thought. Trailing-edge flaps and ailerons are combined into ""flaperons"" that operate independently as ailerons collectively as flaps‚Äîanother simplification.

All controls are electrically operated by so-called ‚Äúfly-by-wire.‚Äù This eliminates mechanical linkages more prone to failure provides more sensitive responsive handling and increases pilot safety. Backup control wires continue to function even if other wires are shot away‚Äînot possible with cable linkages.

The special ‚Äúhigh G‚Äù cockpit incorporates a sharply back-tilted seat‚Äî30¬∞ compared to the usual 13¬∞‚Äîto help the pilot withstand high G forces in combat. A ""side-stick"" controller found to produce more precise maneuvers replaces the old between-the-knees control stick. Speed brakes that open out like a book near the tail let the pilot slow quickly for emergency maneuvers or short-field landings.

All in all the F-16 is a lot of plane for the money. It's expected to give the NATO nations air superiority through the '80s and into the '90s. Its purchase by so many other countries has already been hailed as ‚Äúthe sale of the century.‚Äù Actually the F-16 may well turn out to be the buy of the century.",,,,,,
GIS,General Mills,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hdC1nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLWEtc3VycHJpc2UtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy1pbi1hLW1vbWVudC1vZi1zdWNjZXNzLzYwMDA3NjgxNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At General Mills a surprise restructuring in a moment of success,"The news in late May ripped through the General Mills headquarters workforce even though nearly everyone was still working at home: Some director-level executives had been laid off.

Shock mixed with confusion since the Golden Valley-based food maker at the time was just finishing a fiscal year with its highest sales ever. In just a few days it became clear to workers that the company was undertaking its biggest restructuring in six years. Over the next few weeks thousands would await word of their fate.

Since the 1980s layoffs happened at General Mills every few years often because it had too many people in certain roles as it bought or sold businesses. But this time was different. The company not only prospered in the pandemic but it seemed to be operating efficiently a path that executives wanted.

""It's not as if we had employees hanging around wondering what to do"" Jeff Harmening the company's chief executive said in an interview with the Star Tribune.

The change now unfolding at the company he said ""all stems from where we see the world moving and what we need to accomplish.""

General Mills he and other executives said in recent weeks needs to evolve to focus more on consumer data online shopping and strategy including mergers and acquisitions. The global pandemic accelerated the need for change.

There was some overlap with its corporate functions and its global activities but the restructuring ‚Äî and accompanying layoffs initially of around 800 of its 35000 employees ‚Äî is aimed at creating space on the balance sheet for its newest priorities.

""We are operating from a position of strength right now"" Harmening said. ""The way consumers receive marketing information the way they shop is different. You can't meet a changing external environment by keeping everything the same internally. We need to keep changing.""

General Mill executives have used buzzwords like ""data and analytics"" ""e-commerce"" and ""digital marketing"" in investor presentations for several years. During the pandemic those themes moved from pocketed corners of the organization to central pillars.

In 2020 many shoppers searched nearly exclusively online for groceries clothes and household goods. This produced a flood of new consumer data said Barry Brunsman a principal at KPMG's Minneapolis office.

""That burst open the door"" Brunsman said. ""All of sudden that abundance of data and the emergence of a broader set of data scientists creates the possibility for people to really think about their model.""

General Mills' portfolio skews heavily toward traditional packaged foods that are slow to grow and shaped by demographics. Its success of the past year means little for the future said Myles Shaver a professor at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management.

""There were pressures on the company before the pandemic and those things are going to manifest again"" Shaver said.

General Mills has a long history of entering other businesses exiting them and making big changes even as its most popular products ‚Äî Gold Medal flour Cheerios Chex Trix and other cereals Betty Crocker mixes ‚Äî sell steadily along.

In the middle of the 20th century it made kitchen appliances. By the 1980s it was a conglomerate that also sold toys operated restaurant chains and fashion retailers like Talbot's and Eddie Bauer. In 2001 it bought Pillsbury the other big food maker in Minneapolis.

General Mills today is much more focused with about 90% of its approximately $18 billion annual revenue coming from human food and the rest from pet food a business it re-entered three years ago by purchasing the Blue Buffalo brand.

Six years ago the company laid off about 5000 workers in waves. Investors at the time pushed food-industry companies to slash costs and even hand off some manufacturing.

But the arrival of COVID-19 showed the power of large food producers that controlled their manufacturing and relationships with distributors. General Mills quickly implemented safety measures at its plants to keep lines running just when shoppers ambushed grocery stores in the pandemic's early weeks.

Harmening at the time said the company's workers ""stepped up in an incredible and safe way to ensure a reliable food supply and we thank all of you.""

As a result of that goodwill General Mills' workers described a sense of being blindsided by the layoffs. For much of June workers waited to find out if they'd have a job come July.

On Friday June 18 all North America workers were invited to join a ""pre-status"" virtual meeting on June 23 or 24. Following that meeting each employee would receive an e-mail saying one of two messages: continuing with the organization or displaced.

Employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their severance pay described it as feeling impersonal and cold. Different workers called the process upsetting cringe-worthy or sad.

Harmening said ""Change is hard. It's hard for our employees. It's hard for me as a CEO.""

General Mills is likely to run a leaner operation for several months as it evaluates needs then starts hiring people back with the desired skills said Anne Sample a former human resources executive who now runs Navigate Forward a Minneapolis firm that helps displaced executives.

""You don't want to go back and do a second restructuring six months after the first one"" Sample said. ""You don't want to break that corporate trust because the restructuring already changes the relationship between the company and the workers.""

Her company is working with several laid-off General Mills executives to find new jobs.

""Talent is pretty sticky in the Twin Cities"" Sample said noting that many will land in other high-level roles locally. Her clients all at the upper levels are finding new jobs quicker now than before the pandemic.

General Mills leaders and representatives talk about the restructuring as a move into ""connected commerce."" That's a somewhat broad term that can mean different things to different industries Brunsman said.

For consumer goods companies connected commerce generally means getting closer to consumers to understand who likes what ‚Äî and where.

In the traditional sales model a food manufacturer like General Mills depends on its retailers to relay back information to them about what sort of products are selling. Or by buying third-party data.

""That was at best a loose connection between the consumer goods company and the people they are actually trying to please with their product"" Brunsman said.

General Mills now harvests vast troves of data from two of its own sources: its digitized Box Tops for Education platform and its popular in-house recipe websites BettyCrocker.com and Pillsbury.com which saw a huge uptick in site visits during the pandemic.

Armed with detailed data ‚Äî and with employees who specialize in analyzing it ‚Äî consumer goods companies can rethink their entire distribution model.

""So instead of thinking about distribution into a region you can think about distribution into a neighborhood"" Brunsman said.

For the U's Shaver whose research has included how the Twin Cities became home to so many large publicly traded companies the latest makeover at General Mills is no surprise.

""Most successful companies are constantly keeping an eye on how they're evolving"" Shaver said. ""If General Mills was not evolving I would be much more concerned.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0b29uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L21hcmtldGluZy1teW9waWEtYW5kLWJyYW5kLWNob2ljZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,marketing myopia and brand choice,"Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)

Faris Yakob wrote an interesting piece last year on what motivates consumers to buy particularly in the few seconds a consumer spends at shelf. He wrote:

‚ÄúIn 2005 P&G coined the term ‚Äúfirst moment of truth‚Äù to describe the importance of packaging in their marketing model. The first point of contact is encountering an advertisement the second is when they take an action towards the brand such as visiting a store or searching the web the third is when they find it.

‚ÄúThen all prior brand communication comes to bear on a single moment: the three to five seconds when the consumer stands in front of the shelf and decides what to buy.

‚ÄúInteresting and innovative packaging can make up for lower media weights as with craft beers or companies like Method soap that focused on making their bottle something people would be proud to display in their homes.‚Äù

A few years before I worked on the Method soap brand Faris writes about I was a Marketing Intern at General Mills. The CMO at the time Mark Addicks shared some marketing career advice that always stuck with me. He warned that too much time in the marketing offices would lead to breathing our own exhaust.

In particular he urged us to spend as much time as possible in grocery store aisles silently watching as people shop the categories we work on. He said we‚Äôd soon discover that many of the things that marketers obsess over don‚Äôt have nearly as much impact as we think in the actual moment someone choses to buy.

Mark went on to suggest that whenever we join a new brand team the first thing we should do is take out an empty notebook and fill if with everything we think we know about the brand before we start working on the brand. That notebook will then become a valuable resource he said because it‚Äôs uncorrupted with the institutional knowledge big companies have access to.

All of this corporate research ‚Äî shopper decision trees category management decks and the like ‚Äî can be valuable. But followed too closely they can lead to marketing myopia. Consumers don‚Äôt think about brands nearly as much as the marketers of those brands think about the brands.

I‚Äôm struck by this classic line from Byron Sharp in ‚ÄúHow Brands Grow‚Äù:

‚ÄúRather than striving for meaningful perceived differentiation marketers should seek meaningless distinctiveness. Branding lasts differentiation doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Supermarkets brace for inflation,"This time last year consumer panic-buying decimated the baking aisle at my local supermarket. I know because I tried in vain to find yeast and flour for a good three weeks. By the time grocery shelves returned to a somewhat normal state I had developed a permanent chip on my shoulder toward the neighbors I saw scurrying about with 20 cans of chicken noodle soup in their carts. But now supermarkets themselves are doing the stockpiling loading up on certain products before the grocery biz experiences ‚Äúsome of the highest price increases in recent memory‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reports.

WSJ cited Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc. the nation‚Äôs largest grocery store wholesaler as an example. The company recently purchased up to 20% more inventory mainly of shelf-stable packaged foods in preparation for coming price increases from major companies such as General Mills Inc. Campbell Soup Co. and J.M. Smucker Co. ‚ÄúWhen you have a uniquely inflationary period like now it‚Äôs a feeding frenzy‚Äù said Tony Sarsam chief executive officer of Michigan-based food retailer and distributor SpartanNash Co.

WSJ explains that supermarket stockpiling is a burden on an already stretched U.S. food supply chain. The grocery industry is struggling with transportation costs ingredient shortages and a reduced workforce (at least at current grocery store wages) which you can read more about here. Interestingly consumers haven‚Äôt yet felt the effects of those major price increases largely because markets are still burning through their stockpiles. While you may notice a slight increase in the cost of some of your pantry staples retailers are reportedly working to keep prices low to compete against discount or low-price chains like Walmart and Aldi WSJ reports. But with a barely recovered food supply chain and perhaps permanently altered consumer buying habits you have to wonder: how much more can our brittle food economy take?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXctY28tb3AtaW4td2VzdGVybi1taW5uZXNvdGEtYWltcy10by1jYXBpdGFsaXplLW9uLWtlcm56YS82MDAwNzYxOTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Minnesota co-op wants to profit from getting Kernza wheat in marketplace,"Anne Schwagerl her husband and his parents farm rye oats and barley on 780 acres near Browns Valley in western Minnesota. This year they'll harvest a new crop for the first time: Kernza.

""We're in what I believe is a moderate drought and all three of those early-season crops are way ahead of schedule ‚Äî turning brown now ripening now. We'll be harvesting rye by the end of the week"" Schwagerl said. ""The Kernza on the other hand is still growing. It's still green.""

Schwagerl is among a small group of organic farmers who gathered Thursday in Madison Minn. to officially incorporate the Perennial Promise Growers Cooperative. They say it's the first-ever co-op for growers of Kernza a perennial wheat with deep roots that research has shown can help protect water supplies from nitrates store more carbon in the soil and reduce soil erosion.

Products made with Kernza aren't widely distributed yet. But the farmers behind the new co-op aim to cultivate new customers and share information about the most effective ways to plant and cultivate harvest store and sell Kernza.

""The farmer who wants to grow this won't have time to focus on finding and developing markets"" said Carmen Fernholz a longtime organic farmer who helped organize the co-op and hosted Thursday's event at his Madison farm. ""We said let's put our growers together pull together usable amounts of our crop and find someone to market it for us.""

The co-op will hire a full-time marketing agent Fernholz said. Brewers and distillers bakeries restaurants and school districts around the state have started showing interest he said.

Beer brewed from Kernza ""has a really unique flavor"" Fernholz said.

In 2019 the General Mills organic food brand Cascadian Farm had to vastly scale back plans for a Kernza-based cereal due to insufficient supply of the grain. But the company has continued to support research efforts and planners of the co-op event on Thursday said a General Mills representative would be on hand.

General Mills told the Star Tribune on Thursday that Cascadian Farm would launch a new limited-time-only Kernza cereal at Whole Foods this fall.

Organizers expect 50 to 100 growers to sign up initially for co-op membership likely comprising most to all of the farmers who have decided to try Kernza. The group has been working with the the Forever Green Initiative a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and the USDA that's researching crops and methods meant to make environmentally beneficial practices more economically viable for farmers.

Right now a little over 1000 acres in Minnesota have been planted with Kernza according to Colin Cureton with Forever Green. That's up from 100 acres just two years ago and Cureton thinks it's feasible that number could double in the next few years. Interest is growing in other states and nationally he said.

Ben Penner who raises crops on rented land in Scott and Le Sueur counties planted 34 acres of Kernza on a farm near Belle Plaine last September. He plans to harvest 20 of those acres within the next month and he expects they will yield 500 pounds per acre. He's motivated by the environmental benefits but said he got involved with the co-op efforts because he wants to prove to fellow farmers there's a customer base to be had.

""I am convinced that farmers can and will grow it as the market develops"" he said.

Fernholz was certified as an organic farmer in 1975 decades ahead of widespread consumer interest in organic products. He started planting Kernza in 2011 and in August 2019 he said he turned 800 pounds per acre from a batch planted the previous September.

That's a fraction of the yield from more traditional crops and ""we know we'll probably never get the same yield we do with [traditional] wheat"" Fernholz said. ""But the big benefit is the perennial nature. It's less work and less resources and if we can generate revenue that's competitive all the better."""

China‚Äôs best-selling EV last year was the newly introduced Hong Guang MINI EV which is produced by General Motors and its Chinese partner Wuling. This year some projections suggest that the automaker might sell as many as 400000 units of the car.

One of the biggest appeals of the little EV is its price as it sells for the equivalent of just over $4000 USD. This however means that there isn‚Äôt much room for profit. In fact China‚Äôs Xcar reports that GM and Wuling make a profit of 89 Yuan on each example they sell. At today‚Äôs exchange rates that‚Äôs the equivalent of just $13.73 USD.

Despite the low profit GM and Wuling are unlikely to be too frustrated. First of all if they indeed sell 400000 vehicles that amounts to nearly $5.5 million which though not massive on the scales that GM operates is still nothing to sniff at.

More importantly though GM is borrowing a trick from Tesla. It may well be that any profits GM and Wuling make on the sale of the Hong Guang MINI EV is just gravy on top. The companies may be looking to sell the car for the valuable positive energy points it can net them.

Like in the U.S. Chinese automakers get credits for the green cars they sell and lose them for their polluting cars. Any leftover positive credits they have at the end of the year can be sold to other manufacturers. Xcar reports that each credit is worth about 3000 yuan ($462 USD) and every Hong Guang MINI EV is worth two positive points for GM and Wuling so maybe the little EV‚Äôs worth to them isn‚Äôt so little after all.

Introduced last summer the Hong Guang MINI EV features a 17.4 hp (13 kW) electric motor and either a 9.2 kWh or a 13.8 kWh battery. With the smaller battery it‚Äôs capable of 120 km (75 miles) of range and with the larger it can travel up to 170 km (110 miles) on a charge.

General Motors is recalling 410000 of its 2015 and 2016 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups because the side airbags may suddenly explode. The problem is most serious in areas with hot weather. The recall affects 2015-2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 2500 and 3500 vehicles as well as 2015-2016 GMC Sierra 1500 2500 and 3500 trucks.

What is Causing the Recall

GM is concerned that the upper side airbags also called roof-rail airbags can go off even if there isn‚Äôt a crash. Last month three different vehicles had the airbags explode while no one was inside. Luckily no one was injured. One of the trucks was in Florida two others happened in Texas. While all three were 2015 Silverados GM is concerned the problem could affect the GMCs as well because they contain the same airbags. GM determined that the cause is corrosion inside the inflator caused by moisture introduced during manufacturing and aggravated by hot temperatures. According to the Associated Press the inflators were made in Mexico by Joyson Safety Systems.

How GM Will Fix the Problem

This airbag recall affects 410019 trucks. Dealers will replace the left and right side roof-rail airbag modules free of charge. The NHTSA campaign number for this recall is 21V504000. GM‚Äôs number for this recall is N202324251. GM will send letters to owners in August notifying them of the recall. However it may take some time before parts are widely available to fix the airbags. Owners who are concerned may contact Chevrolet customer service at 800-222-1020 or GMC customer service at 888-988-7267.

A small number of the same trucks were recalled late last year for the same problem.

Second-generation Apple AirPods with wireless charging indicator Todd Haselton | CNBC

When AirPods were first released in 2016 they were a marvel of miniaturization. To ditch cords and go wireless Apple packed several chips microphones and speakers into each headphone which weigh about 4 grams. Without a cord the earbud gets its power from a tiny cylindrical battery that has about 1% of the capacity of an iPhone's battery. But lithium-ion batteries like those used by the AirPods wear out the more they are used. Some owners have noticed that after a few years used AirPods eventually will last only an hour or so before needing to be recharged -- a big decay from the four-to-five-hour battery life they have when new. Because each AirPod is so small and so tightly packed into its housing it's almost impossible to swap out the old battery for a new one. Most people give up and just buy a new pair. The limited lifespan of AirPods is exactly the kind of problem that the ""right-to-repair"" movement wants to fix. Repair shops and lobbyists that support repair reform want lawmakers to implement a variety of rules including increased access to manuals and official parts and consumer protections around warranties. But one of their most important requests is for companies to design products with repair in mind instead of packing gadgets with unlabeled parts and sticking them together with glue forcing users to use a knife to take them apart. This desire puts repair advocates at odds with hardware companies like Apple whose business models depend on customers upgrading to the latest model every few years. When Apple offered cheap iPhone battery repairs a few years ago it hurt sales as consumers were able to hang on to their old phones for longer instead of upgrading. Apple also charges customers for repairs and extended warranties. ""We design our products for durability in order to minimize the need for repair"" Apple wrote in an environmental report earlier this year. ""But in the instance a repair is needed we believe our customers should have convenient access to safe and reliable repair services to get their product back up and running as quickly as possible.""

The right-to-repair movement gains steam

Policymakers have started to engage more closely with right-to-repair advocates in recent years. State-level bills have been introduced in a majority of states but electronics companies have lobbied against them and none have passed. In May the Federal Trade Commission released a 56-page report on repair restrictions concluding that repair restrictions have ""steered consumers into manufacturers' repair networks or to replace products before the end of their useful lives"" ‚Äî exactly the problem users are running into with their AirPods. The Biden administration on Friday ordered the FTC to write new regulations targeted at limiting manufacturers' ability to hamper independent or do-it-yourself repairs as part of a sweeping executive order. New repair rules have not yet been drafted. ""Tech and other companies impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs making repairs more costly and time-consuming such as by restricting the distribution of parts diagnostics and repair tools"" the White House wrote in a fact sheet about the order on Friday linking to a story about fixing Apple products. Apple declined to comment on the White House executive order. The FTC has not said what it plans to do but repair advocates want a few key policy changes as detailed in its May report. They want companies to be required to make official replacement parts available. They want access to tools that could make repairs easier without reverse-engineering the tools or parts themselves. And ultimately they want products to be designed with longer lifespans. Apple is not the only company that would be affected by these policies. Much of the recent pressure is on medical device companies and tractor manufacturers. But given Apple's ubiquity it has become a poster child for repair especially because it promotes its environmental efforts as a corporate value. Apple has launched a program it calls the ""Independent Repair Program"" which gives repair shops the option to enter into a certification process and contract with Apple in order to get access to authentic Apple parts tools and manuals. Apple has also reduced the price of its battery replacement for iPhones and recent models have been designed to make it easier to replace a battery or cracked screen according to iFixit. Plus compared to other consumer electronics companies Apple has a large existing network of stores and authorized repair shops. Still many Apple products remain challenging to repair at home or as a business with no contact with Apple.

The only AirPods battery replacement company

iFixit a company that provides disassembly instructions and sells replacement parts for gadgets gives AirPods models a score of zero out of 10 for repairability. According to iFixit repairing these earbuds involves soldering hot air guns and slicing through glue ‚Äî that is if replacement battery parts are even available. In the end a would-be home repairer would have to put the four-gram computer back together again. Apple provides ""battery service"" for AirPods at the cost of $49 per earbud. But functionally Apple simply gives you a replacement pair and the old earbuds are recycled. It's not a repair it's a replacement. And it's expensive. AirPods originally cost $159 so opting for battery service costs more than half of the price of a new pair. Apple sold about 72.8 million AirPods units in 2020 according to a CounterPoint research estimate so tens of millions of consumers will face the same lack of choice in the coming years.

Replacement AirPods from PodSwap CNBC

PodSwap is a Miami company founded by Emma Stritzinger and Emily Alpert which aims to keep AirPods ""out of the landfill."" They're not associated with Apple. They believe they're the only company performing AirPod battery replacements although other companies ""refurbish"" old AirPods the founders told CNBC. The company was formed after the founders experienced dying AirPods themselves and thought that upgrading or replacing them would be wasteful and impractical. I recently replaced a pair of AirPods that were only holding a charge for 45 minutes -- too short to complete a phone call. I paid $59 on PodSwap's Shopify site and a few days later received a replacement pair of AirPods with new batteries. They weren't my old AirPods they were another set that had their batteries replaced. Along with those new pods PodSwap includes a box and a return label. It wants your old AirPods back. It then cleans and sanitizes the old pair puts in new batteries and sends them out to the next person who wants to change the battery in their old AirPods. But PodSwap faces many challenges that show why repair advocates want new rules. Alpert said the design of the AirPod makes it challenging for repair shops or companies like theirs to do a lot of battery replacements. PodSwap's process uses both robotics and manual labor the founders said. ""The process was developed through trial and error and a large number of units were 'sacrificed' and ultimately recycled. One major challenge we faced was overcoming the uniqueness of this product. Each AirPod is assembled with slight differences which creates complexity in the disassembly"" Alpert said.

Scott T. Tagawa MD MS

In a cohort of the phase II TROPHY-U-01 trial reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Scott T. Tagawa MD MS of Weill Cornell Medicine New York and colleagues found that the antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan-hziy produced durable responses in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.1 The trial supported the April 2021 accelerated approval of sacituzumab govitecan in this setting.

As explained by the investigators sacituzumab govitecan is a Trop-2‚Äìdirected antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti‚ÄìTrop-2 humanized monoclonal antibody coupled to SN-38 (active metabolite of the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor irinotecan) with a high drug-to-antibody ratio. The hydrolyzable linker permits a dual mechanism of action: internalization of Trop-2‚Äìbound sacituzumab govitecan delivers SN-38 inside tumor cells resulting in cell death; the hydrolyzable linker enables SN-38 to be released into the tumor microenvironment resulting in killing of adjacent tumor cells.

As stated by the investigators: ‚ÄúPatients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who progress on platinum-based combination chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors ‚Ä¶ have limited options that offer objective response rates of approximately 10% with a median overall survival of 7 to 8 months.‚Äù

Study Details

The current report presents findings in cohort 1 of the multicohort trial enrolled from August 2018 to November 2019. In the cohort 113 patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease received sacituzumab govitecan at 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome measure was overall response rate on blinded independent central review. Safety analyses included specific evaluation of the effect of UGT1A1 genotype status on incidence of adverse events.

Among all patients median age was 66 years (range = 33‚Äì90 years 23% ‚â• 75 years) 78% were male and 74% were White (no reported race for 20%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 (28%) or 1 in all patients; 96% had metastatic and 4% had locally advanced unresectable disease; 66% had visceral metastases including lung in 43% liver in 34% and other in 13%. Overall 96% had received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 99% had prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy; 79% had prior cisplatin and 21% had prior carboplatin; and 8.8% had prior enfortumab vedotin. The median number of prior systemic regimens was three (range = 1‚Äì8) and the lines of metastatic regimens were one for 20% two for 27% and at least three for 50%. Bellmunt risk scores were 0 in 16% 1 in 48% 2 in 28% and 3 in 8%.(The Bellmunt score is based on the presence of the following risk factors: liver metastases hemoglobin < 10 g/dL Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score > 0 and time since completion or discontinuation of therapy < 3 months.) UGT1A1 status was wild-type (*1/*1) in 40% heterozygous (*1/*28) in 42% homozygous (*28/*28) in 12% and unknown in 7%.

Responses

Data cutoff was in September 2020. An objective response was observed in 31 patients (27.4% 95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.5%‚Äì36.6%) including a complete response in 6 (5.3%). Stable disease was observed in an additional 38 patients (33.6%). A reduction in the size of target lesions was observed in 72 of 94 patients (77%) with at least one postbaseline target lesion measurement.

Median time to objective response was 1.6 months (range = 1.2‚Äì5.5 months). At a median follow-up of 9.1 months (range = 0‚Äì19.9 months) median duration of response was 7.2 months (95% CI = 4.7‚Äì8.6 months). Response durations ranged from 1.4 to 13.7 months among patients with a complete response. At data cutoff 30 of 31 patients with an objective response remained alive and 4 had an ongoing response.

Responses were observed in all evaluated subgroups including patients with at least two prior lines of therapy (response rate = 27.3%) those with any visceral (response rate = 28.0%) and liver metastases (response rate = 31.6%) at baseline and in all Bellmunt risk groups (response rates = 27.8% 35.2% 18.8% and 11.1% for risk scores of 0 1 2 and 3 respectively). Response rates were 22.2% 31.9% and 30.8% among patients with UGT1A1 status of wild-type heterozygous and homozygous respectively. Among 10 patients who received prior enfortumab vedotin response was observed in 3 (30.0%); 2 of these patients had progressive disease as best response to enfortumab vedotin.

Median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% CI = 3.5‚Äì7.2 months; range = 2.4‚Äì8.9 months). Median overall survival was 10.9 months (95% CI = 9.0‚Äì13.8 months; range = 3.8‚Äì19.8 months).

The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were diarrhea (65%) nausea (60%) fatigue (52%) alopecia (47%) and neutropenia (46%). The most common grade ‚â• 3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (35%) leukopenia (18%) anemia (14%) diarrhea (10%) febrile neutropenia (10%) lymphopenia (7%) and urinary tract infection (6%). Grade ‚â• 3 serious treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than one patient included febrile neutropenia (n = 10) diarrhea (n = 4) urinary tract infection (n = 4) sepsis (n = 2) and thrombocytopenia (n = 2). One case of interstitial lung disease (grade 2) was observed.

Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in seven patients (6%) most commonly due to neutropenia febrile neutropenia and sepsis. One treatment-related death occurred (febrile -neutropenia and sepsis).

KEY POINTS Sacituzumab govitecan produced an objective response in 27% of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors.

The median duration of response was 7.2 months.

In an analysis according to UGT1A1 status any-grade neutropenia and grade ‚â• 3 neutropenia were numerically more common in homozygous patients (54% and 54%) than in heterozygous (51% and 34%) and wild-type patients (38% and 31%). Any-grade diarrhea occurred in 69% 75% and 53% of patients respectively. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 8% 6% and 7% respectively. Treatment interruption due to adverse events occurred in 69% 36% and 42% respectively.

The investigators concluded: ‚ÄúSG [sacituzumab govitecan] is an active drug with a manageable safety profile with most common toxicities of neutropenia and diarrhea. SG has notable efficacy compared with historical controls in pretreated [metastatic urothelial carcinoma] that has progressed on both prior [platinum-based combination chemotherapy] regimens and [checkpoint inhibitors]. The results from this study supported accelerated approval of SG in this population.‚Äù

And why would he be anyways? He is the founder of the U=U movement that according to Prevention Access Campaign‚Äòs website ‚Äú1050 organizations from 102 countries have signed on to share the U=U message in ways that work for their communities.‚Äù

And we are so thankful for Bruce. He has led a difficult at times movement of advocates then organizations and government bodies to finally tell people living with HIV the truth about our bodies our viral loads and if we are infectious. The truth here has little to do with sex. It‚Äôs about the truth. And Richman made it possible for us to know the truth.

As we begin to celebrate 5 years since the undetectable equals untransmittable movement launched imstilljosh.com asked Richman to reflect on the past 5 years and to look forward for himself the movement and the entire HIV community.

THE BRUCE RICHMAN INTERVIEW

Josh Robbins: It‚Äôs been 5 years since U=U launched. Where does the movement stand today?

Bruce Richman: Yes! It‚Äôs incredibly inspiring! We accomplished our first goal to officially change the assessments of risk. U=U activists researchers public health officials and other allies worked hard to confirm U=U by securing endorsements from the worlds‚Äô leading medical scientific and public health institutions.

Today U=U stands strong led by a global community and publicly endorsed by the field‚Äôs most influential organizations including the WHO UNAIDS HHS NIH CDC CDC Global and health ministries worldwide. PEPFAR requires U=U education in all 50+ PEPFAR countries. Recently the United Nations General Assembly issued a Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS encouraging countries to leverage U=U to fight stigma and discrimination. You can‚Äôt get much higher than that. I think the next step is Beyonce. LOL.

There‚Äôs also groundbreaking U=U research like the Positive Perspectives Wave 2 study that shows that when healthcare providers inform patients about U=U they report greater viral suppression adherence sexual health mental health overall health and comfort sharing their HIV status than those who were not informed. And a recent study showed that U=U messaging in HIV testing outreach increased testing rates among men in South Africa.

To sum it up there‚Äôs overwhelming proof and endorsements of the U=U science and growing data showing the impact that U=U education can have on personal and public health. A strong community-led movement of 1050 official partners in 102 countries on every continent has committed to sharing the information. So the movement is very well positioned for the next phase: to collaborate with global partners to ensure that the U=U science is integrated into treatment policies and guidelines public health communications clinical work and advocacy.

The energy continues to grow because of the people with HIV and people who care about us who are speaking the truth with tremendous conviction and courage. It is breathtaking.

Reflections of 5 Years of U=U

JR: What‚Äôs been the greatest joy in the past 5 years for you as the leader?

BR: There have been so many. The movement even during the most difficult years as you remember has been the most joyful experience of my life.

Sharing this message for the first time with people with HIV is pure bliss. I hope everyone in our field can experience that moment. Even though I‚Äôve been sharing this news for five years it‚Äôs always emotional for me and I‚Äôm usually in tears of understanding. One of my most vivid memories is from the Opening Doors conference for people with HIV in Canada in 2017. Brigitte Charbonneau who was 70 at the time stood up and said ‚Äúis it true?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes it‚Äôs true‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it really true?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù ‚Äî we both started crying. She‚Äôd been using condoms with her husband for twenty years and always felt fear of passing on her HIV. She‚Äôd never been intimate with him without fear. So of course she called her husband right away and went home!

Brady Dale Morris Marci Egel-Guzowski and other folks I‚Äôve met along the way say that U=U has enabled them to get married. Others are dating in relationships and so many people with HIV are having sex without fear for the first time in years. Claire Gasamagera points to her beautiful boys as U=U babies and I‚Äôve seen U=U tattooed on bodies around the world

It feels profoundly meaningful to be a part of something so beautiful much bigger and more important than me.

And I‚Äôm in awe of the people in this movement from every conceivable background. Many are community activists and others are from NGOs research medicine and public health. Remember I didn‚Äôt risk anything when I started speaking out about U=U. I was an unknown outsider with HIV who had no stake or standing in the field. Other folks had the conviction and courage to risk their personal and professional reputations. Some actually risked their lives. They spoke out radically against the established ways of thinking which meant being judged and criticized by their colleagues bosses doctors communities and the entire field! And they won. They are changing lives by changing the narrative about our bodies ‚Äì city by city country by country. This is their victory. I don‚Äôt feel like the leader; they‚Äôre all leaders. I feel I‚Äôve had the honor to be a part of their movement.

The Gaps To Fix With U=U

JR: What‚Äôs missing still?

BR: There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of work to be done with many gaps and inconsistencies in messaging clinical communications and advocacy work.

For instance we‚Äôre noticing that some global and national end the epidemic strategies and advocacy for access to treatment and care leave out the U=U public health argument.

US leaders issued a call to action in The Lancet which describes the public health argument:

‚ÄúAdvocates should be equipped to use the so-called public health argument from U=U in advocacy to increase access and remove barriers to quality health care; ensuring people with HIV have the treatment and services they need to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load not only saves lives but also is an effective way to prevent new transmissions.‚Äù

(Call to action: how can the US Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative succeed? Chris Beyrer MD MPH Adaora Adimora MD MPH; Sally L. Hodder MD; Ernest Hopkins; Greg Millett MPH; Sandra Hsu Hnin Mon MSPH; Patrick S. Sullivan DVM PhD; Rochelle P. Walensky MD MPH; Anton Pozniak MD FRCP; Mitchell Warren; Bruce Richman EdM. JD; Raniyah Copeland MPH; Kenneth H. Mayer MD ‚Äì February 18 2021)

We need to make this connection as straightforward as possible. We‚Äôre not there yet.

Many of the strategies and other related public advocacy documents and videos call for equity and universal access to treatment and care to improve the well-being of people with HIV and based on our right to healthcare. Personal health and rights-based approaches are critical to inspire activism. That‚Äôs why we started U=U.

But I don‚Äôt know when we‚Äôll be at a place where policymakers and world leaders value the well-being of people with HIV. And as of now there are many parts of the world where healthcare is not yet a human right. So we need to keep fighting and I hope we will get there.

In the meantime when we advocate universal HIV treatment and care we must clearly and repeatedly show how it addresses the interests of policymakers to prevent HIV and end the epidemic. When we call for access to treatment as part of ending the epidemic goals we need to be clear that treatment not only keeps us healthy but it also prevents new HIV transmissions. Dr. Fauci calls U=U ‚Äúthe foundation of ending the epidemic.‚Äù Along with PrEP we can get there. But if we advocate for HIV treatment and care only from the personal health and rights-based approach or minimize the public health argument we‚Äôre wasting opportunities to meet our interest to improve the lives of people with HIV.

We‚Äôve also been disappointed to see major campaigns explain how HIV has changed with phrases such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a death sentence‚Äù ‚Äúpeople with HIV can live long healthy lives‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe still need to end the stigma‚Äù without sharing the news that people with HIV on effective treatment can‚Äôt pass it on. C‚Äômon folks! It takes less than ten seconds to add in!

I think we need to really reconsider the messaging we‚Äôve been using and recycling for many years. We now have dramatically transformational news with U=U and we need to use it.

We now have dramatically transformational news with U=U and we need to use it. ‚Äì Bruce Richman

JR: If you could clear up one misconception of the movement what would it be?

BR: There is a common misconception that U=U doesn‚Äôt benefit people with HIV who are struggling with the social structural and legal barriers to treatment and care. Folks especially in the US are often reluctant to educate about U=U because of this concern.I can understand how on the surface it might seem that knowledge about the prevention benefits of treatment wouldn‚Äôt help someone who has no access to that treatment.

When you think about it the U=U public health argument is the most crucial development in our advocacy to increase access and remove barriers to treatment and care. Because when people with HIV have the treatment and care that we need to stay healthy we also can‚Äôt transmit HIV. Suppose policymakers are well informed about the public health argument. In that case they will make decisions about budgets and programs to provide life-saving services to people with HIV based on end-the-epidemic and public health goals.

Unfortunately this is still not well understood or utilized as a leading point in advocacy. This underscores how important it is to promote better understanding of the U=U public health argument and how to communicate it effectively in advocacy.

We‚Äôve also seen U=U benefit people not on treatment or struggling with adherence and who have risen from depression and isolation because they‚Äôve learned about U=U. They feel renewed. They feel more hope. They rise as activists to demand treatment and viral load testing. It can be inspirational and aspirational. There‚Äôs an M=M (U=U) campaign for the Warao the oldest indigenous tribe in Venezuela where access to even basic necessities is limited.

There will continue to be many misconceptions about U=U and the innovators who talk about it. Humans are hardwired to resist change even when it may be good for us and the communities we serve. People seek out data to confirm old ways of thinking and behaving. Some of the data is valid and other times it is non-existent.

So we all need to be critical of the critiques of U=U. We encourage folks to be bold and keep talking about U=U in inclusive and conscious ways. Recognize that no one with HIV is a danger regardless of viral load ‚Äì there are still condoms and PreP in some parts of the world. We need to keep educating about U=U and using it in our advocacy to ensure no one is left behind.

The Success of A Global HIV Movement

JR: What‚Äôs the prize? When will you say this was a success?

BR: Our first phase was a success. U=U is fact. You can turn to any of the most influential organizations in our field and it is supported. Even the community movement behind U=U is acknowledged in some official documents.

The next phase will be a success when U=U or related language is institutionalized in the medical and public health establishments of the majority of the 102 countries where U=U has partners. This will provide much-needed backup for our in-country partners to integrate U=U into their treatment policies and guidelines public communications clinical work and advocacy.

The prize will be when all people with HIV have access to quality healthcare to stay healthy and live free of the stigma and fear of passing on HIV.

Looking Back On The Fastest Growing HIV Movement Globally

JR: And do you have any regrets? If so what are they?

BR: I regret that I let my emotions take over too much. During the first few years I was consumed by outrage about how people with HIV are exploited and devalued in this field especially people already marginalized by healthcare systems worldwide. And I was genuinely dumbfounded by the many ways people would undermine the campaign and message even when it was in their best interests.

There can be a lot of horizontal hostility in social justice movements and I would take it home with me which was easy since my office was my studio apartment! I spent too much energy trying to listen and understand every criticism of U=U particularly in the US instead of listening selectively to the folks whose opinions really matter.

I let the anger and outrage repeatedly burn me out. I‚Äôd wake up and go to sleep ready to fight. It wasn‚Äôt helpful personally or professionally. My ex-boyfriend and staff really helped me called me out on it and hold me accountable now.

I‚Äôm still working on it. I‚Äôm an emotional and passionate person and the abuses I observed and felt are still going on but I hope I‚Äôm working toward change in ways that will be more effective and healthy for the movement and me.

Looking Forward for U=U for 5 More Years

JR: In 5 years where should this movement be? What‚Äôs in store?

BR: In five years the community-led movement will be strengthened and well organized. It will have institutionalized U=U in the majority of our 102 countries and other countries where new partners are based.

By institutionalize I mean the U=U science not necessarily the slogan will be integrated from the grassroots to government. For instance health ministries will update treatment guidelines (like the US Brazil Canada Australia Vietnam England); HIV medicine associations and education establishments will teach about and require HCP/ patient U=U communication (like ASHM IAPAC and British HIV Association); public health campaigns will feature U=U related messaging (like Terrence Higgins Trust Lila; ACT Up Dublin; CATIE; NAM aidsmap; ViiV Healthcare; Gilead Sciences; AIDES Love to Love Organization and so many more); grantmaking organizations will require U=U education (like PEPFAR and Washington DC Department of Health); journalists will be trained in the new reality of HIV including U=U and PrEP (like HIV Ireland CDC Vietnam US Embassy in Nigeria); advocacy groups and global advocacy communications will prominently put forth both the personal and public health rationales for ending inequity and barriers to care (like ICASO); and PLHIV groups will be organized actively leading the global and national movements and holding community and governmental organizations accountable (like VNP+ in Vietnam; TIM in Australia; Positively UK in the UK; Phenomenally Positive Youths in Zambia). There are so many more excellent examples!

That seems like a moon shot in five years but we‚Äôve already seen national U=U rollouts in countries like Vietnam and Zambia and many meaningful community driven initiatives worldwide. We‚Äôll be successful if our most influential global allies like PEPFAR WHO UNAIDS CDC USAID and private industry partners collaborate to stimulate and support U=U community movements in key regions and countries. We‚Äôre currently bringing together U=U champions from these agencies to do that.

In five years the movement will continue to be community-led. I‚Äôm adamant about this. And when I mean community I mean the right community finding the right people to take leadership in the movement and this field. I fully believe the folks who stood up and stuck their necks out for U=U are those people. They are often under the radar. We‚Äôve found the doers the self-motivators the originals. I hope the field starts to recognize the extraordinary people in this movement hire them invest in them and move them into leadership positions. These folks are the leaders and innovators the field needs to represent people with HIV and bring us to the end of the HIV epidemic.

In five years we will have formed powerful regional collaboratives led by the U=U champions worldwide. Part of the collaboratives‚Äô role is to ensure that when U=U keeps moving into the establishment which it should it is done equitably and meaningfully. By this I mean that U=U data resources and know-how are shared even among agencies that compete. We have no time to waste reinventing the wheel. People with HIV are suffering around the world because they and others believe they‚Äôre infectious. U=U is like a vaccine against stigma isolation depression for many of us. It has given us new life. We can‚Äôt fully enjoy it unless we share it.

U=U is still radical change. ‚Äì Bruce Richman

U=U is still radical change. I‚Äôve learned a hard lesson from being a part of this movement that humans are hardwired to resist change even if it is good for them and the communities they serve. However I‚Äôm confident that the U=U collaboratives and movements will continue to break through the inertia until U=U becomes common knowledge.

I‚Äôm as excited about this next global phase as I was about our launch of U=U in 2016. We‚Äôre in a fantastic place. Because of the power of science and people with HIV we‚Äôve established that U=U is fact and we have a powerful network reaching 102 countries. Now we‚Äôre making sure everyone knows about U=U and has access to the treatment and care to experience it too

I‚Äôm as excited about this next global phase as I was about our launch of U=U in 2016. ‚Äì Bruce Richman

JR: Finish this sentence for me: Bruce Richman is __________. U=U ________.

BR: Bruce Richman is incredibly grateful. U=U changes everything.",,,,,,,,,
GPN,Global Payments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnRzL2hhcm5lc3NpbmctcG93ZXItbG9jYWwtcGF5bWVudHMtc29jaWFsLWNvbW1lcmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harnessing the power of local payments in social commerce,"A staggering 3.8 billion people use social media around half the internet users worldwide. With these figures in mind social media giants are eager to reach the digitally connected consumer and monetise their userbases. Gone are the days where social media was simply a place to see what friends were doing and give them a 'like.' With the likes of TikTok Facebook and Instagram leading the charge purchasing products online is now as easy as liking a friend's post. In fact with over one in three global shoppers having made a purchase on social media in the past year ‚Äì social media is rapidly becoming the new online marketplace of choice.

However while a good tool for attracting customers social commerce must work hand in hand with digital payments to truly unlock success. Converting browsers to buyers on social media will rely heavily on a brand's ability to offer a range of local payment methods at the checkout.

A growing opportunity for merchants

In the US by the age of 12 most children have access to a social media account but that‚Äôs not to say that this is the only audience social media is appealing to. Senior citizens in the US are the fastest growing group of Facebook users with numbers doubling between 2019 and 2021 indicating a lucrative opportunity for merchants appealing to a broad range of demographics.

In fact Facebook is certainly leading the pack when it comes to social media ‚Äì with over 2.7 billion monthly active users worldwide. For European regions such as Italy the pandemic has also contributed to the explosion of social media usage. Time spent on Facebook‚Äôs suite of apps rose 70% in March 2020 ‚Äì indicating the potential for social commerce uptake as people acclimatise to using these platforms to access shopping entertainment and communication.

For China however a country where the likes of Facebook YouTube and Twitter are blocked to consumers sites such as Tencent WeChat and Weibo have been attracting millions of users making China one of the biggest social media markets in the world. With multiple demographics across the globe now engaged with social media channels and more than comfortable with shopping online the opportunity for merchants to trade on these platforms is greater than ever before.

Unlocking the power of social commerce

Because of the extensive reach and the power social media holds brands embracing social commerce can scale rapidly. Everyone can do it from international companies to individuals selling their goods on Instagram. But it's much more than just adding a 'Buy Now' button. While social media platforms certainly have the power to unlock online and cross-border growth the process will not be successful if merchants do not operate with consumer payment preferences in mind.

To enable a seamless transaction through social media channels merchants and payment service providers (PSPs) need to take a highly customised and localised approach to digital payments. Consumers have become accustomed to choice when it comes to online payments ‚Äì from buy now pay later (BNPL) offerings such as Klarna to increasingly popular bank transfer payments such as Pay by Bank App or Trustly. Because of this expectations around payment preferences have skyrocketed in recent years. So much so that 44% of UK consumers will abandon a purchase if their favourite payment method isn‚Äôt available. To ignore this when selling through social channels would be a huge mistake and a missed opportunity for retailers operating on these platforms.

A global strategy with local payments at its core

While digital payments have the power to unlock the true power of social commerce integrating a diverse portfolio of payment methods is no easy task. Although merchants are becoming increasingly aware of the need for a social strategy with local payments at its core the cost and complexities associated with such integrations are acting as a major barrier for businesses. In fact for smaller e-commerce players especially local payment options may feel completely out of reach.

To overcome this merchants and payment service providers are increasingly turning to infrastructure providers to meet the demands of global consumers. Partnerships of this kind mean that merchants and PSPs can take advantage of payments technology and on-the-ground local market knowledge.

Speed to market is everything in today‚Äôs digital-first retail era and merchants that are able to get up and running with a diverse acceptance of the right local payment methods quickly will be able to take strides ahead of the competition.

Those that neglect to consider the importance of local payments will see themselves fall short of their competitors and lose access to thousands of potential customers.

Most places accept Visa and Mastercard as well as local payments systems such as Giro in Germany or Carte Bancaire in France. When that same shopper goes online they have even more options including PayPal and sometimes Alipay the Chinese payments giant and perhaps options offered by new fintech startups such as Klarna‚Äôs buy-now-pay-later service.



Yet despite this surfeit of choices many of Europe‚Äôs largest banks are backing an effort to build a new European-wide payments network that could replace national payments networks and challenge the dominance of Visa and Mastercard across the continent.

Previous efforts to create such a pan-European payments network failed. Most recently one called the Monnet Project collapsed before it ever got off the ground in 2011. This time the project is likely to at least make it to launch. That‚Äôs because the new European Payments Initiative (EPI for short) is as much about politics as it is about business.

The nuclear option

The European Commission and European Central Bank began a concerted drive to pressure banks to build a Europe-specific cross-border card payment system in 2018. That‚Äôs when the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran often referred to in the U.S. as simply ‚Äúthe Iran nuclear deal.‚Äù The EU continued to abide by the agreement and did not want its policies vis-√†-vis Iran dictated by the U.S. and Trump. And yet it now faced the increasingly real threat that the U.S. could impose what are known as ‚Äúsecondary sanctions‚Äù that would force Mastercard and Visa which are both U.S. corporations to cut off access to any European financial institutions or companies that continued to do business with Iran. The vast majority of cross-border card transactions in Europe are handled by either Mastercard or Visa.



‚ÄúThe EU may be more exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is not used in its best interests or is even used against it‚Äù Benoit Coeure at the time of a member of the ECB board told a conference in Brussels in December 2019.



But some international payments executives say this fear was always overstated. The U.S. never actually moved to cut off European access to Mastercard and Visa.



The threat may indeed have come less from the U.S. government and more from powerful U.S. and Chinese technology companies. The ECB was alarmed that Facebook‚Äôs now defunct Libra project as well as Chinese payments solutions such as Alipay and WeChat Pay would leave Europe in the dust with the ECB having no ability to regulate the payments networks and Europe‚Äôs banks largely cut out of consumer payments.



‚ÄúFrom a European point of view it is important to establish a European payment scheme to remain independent‚Äù a Deutsche Bank spokesperson tells Fortune explaining why the bank Germany‚Äôs largest decided to join the EPI.

SEPA protocol

There were other reasons the ECB was pushing for the EPI too. Not only were European banks not at the cutting edge of innovation some were lagging an entire technological cycle behind. Cross-border bank-to-bank transfers in Europe can use something called the single euro payments area (SEPA) protocol. But banks some still using computer systems designed for the days of mainframes would process these SEPA transactions in batches once per day and it sometimes could take up to three business days for the transaction to be settled and the money to actually appear in the recipient‚Äôs account.



The ECB worried the lack of instant payments put European consumers and businesses at a disadvantage compared with those in other large markets like the U.S. and China. (The ECB has even broached the idea of creating its own wholly digital currency in an effort to catch up.)



The added friction of these cross-border transactions reinforces monetary borders between states that the ECB is dedicated to eradicating. So it has pushed Europe‚Äôs banks to move to a new transfer system where amounts up to ‚Ç¨100000 could be transferred within 10 seconds and it has said it would like card and credit payments to be handled through the same instant transfer protocol. But many of Europe‚Äôs banks don‚Äôt have the infrastructure to handle cross-border card transactions in this way and adoption of the new instant payment method has been slow.



The desire to meet the ECB‚Äôs demands led a group of 31 European banks from seven countries including some of the biggest banks in Germany and France to form the EPI. Two large payment processors have also joined as initial shareholders. (The project was initially known by the acronym PEPSI‚Äîfor Pan-European Payment System Initiative‚Äîbut the beverage company apparently objected forcing a name change to EPI.)

‚Ç¨6 billion project

Martina Weimert a former partner at financial consulting firm Oliver Wyman who has been appointed chief executive officer of the Brussels-based corporation in charge of implementing the project says that the EPI will start with peer-to-peer payments since those don‚Äôt require the EPI to have a large merchant network in place or have dedicated physical payments terminals. Those features will come later she says. She told the Financial Times earlier this year that the EPI will cost ‚Äúseveral billion euros‚Äù to get up and running. Private estimates range as high as ‚Ç¨6 billion.

The EPI says it plans to have a new payments network built on the new instant SEPA protocol up and running by sometime in 2022 with a full suite of features available by 2025. It‚Äôs a goal that even the association of German savings banks (known by the acronym DSGV)‚Äîa key backer of the EPI with its head Joachim Schmalzl serving as the EPI‚Äôs chairman‚Äîacknowledges is ‚Äúextremely ambitious‚Äù and will depend on a consensus among the consortium of participants that may prove difficult to achieve.



This is especially true because many European payments experts note that some Nordic countries including Sweden and Denmark have already built successful instant payments networks and that they are unlikely to want to switch to a pan-European system. And there‚Äôs already another rival instant payments clearinghouse called the EBA that is wholly owned by European banks.



Meeting the EPI‚Äôs timetable may be even more difficult given that the organization hasn‚Äôt even figured out exactly how it will make money yet.

In her FT interview Weimert insisted the EPI would offer ‚Äúa different business model‚Äù than Mastercard and Visa which make money by charging merchants what are known as ‚Äúinterchange fees‚Äù to cover the costs of processing payments as well as guarding against fraud. (The networks also charge other service fees to the banks that issue the cards). European politicians and regulators have long been opposed to interchange fees and in 2015 capped the amount card networks could charge. But Weimert was vague about exactly what that alternative model will be saying only that the EPI would charge merchants‚Äô banks for the instant payment processing service and that the banks could then pass some of this cost on to merchants.

This lack of clarity may be one reason a number of large European payments processors have not rushed to join the EPI and are instead taking a wait-and-see approach. A number of payments industry insiders said that the current cross-border payments system was working relatively well and that the EPI was ‚Äúa solution looking for a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄòBuilt for the digital age‚Äô

Gilles Grapinet the chairman and chief executive officer of Worldline which is Europe‚Äôs largest payments processor and which is taking part in the project says that he thinks there is value in creating a new payments network from the ground up rather than grafting new functionalities onto networks that date from the 1970s and 1980s and were originally designed just to process physical card payments. ‚ÄúWe think it is a great opportunity to design a new payment brand that is built for the digital age‚Äù he says. Grapinet says that the EPI would be designed from the start to be omnichannel‚Äîable to be used seamlessly for in-store and online purchases debit and credit payments as well as for instant peer-to-peer money transfers. None of Europe‚Äôs domestic card payments networks can do this presently.



That‚Äôs also the reason Nets a Danish payments processor that is poised to expand throughout Europe following its acquisition by Italy‚Äôs Nexi Group says it is participating in the EPI. Torsten Hagen Jorgensen Nets‚Äô chief executive officer of issuer and e-security services says the project should benefit Europe‚Äôs consumers who are increasingly demanding a single digital payments option that they can use wherever they shop online or in stores.



Worldline‚Äôs Grapinet says merchants should welcome the EPI too. Right now the lack of a unified debit card payments network means that large retailers with hundreds or thousands of stores across Europe have to connect to potentially dozens of local payment networks each of which has its own fees charges and payments terminals. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of extra cost to get connected to all these local schemes‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is in the interests of merchants to have a more unified payment landscape.‚Äù

Although the EPI is often positioned as a rival to Mastercard and Visa Jason Lane Mastercard‚Äôs executive vice president in charge of European market development says he doesn‚Äôt see the new payment network that way. In fact Lane says that the EPI will likely have to partner with Mastercard and Visa to handle cross-border payments outside of Europe. What‚Äôs more Mastercard is bidding to become a technology provider to the new payments system helping it with things like anti-fraud measures and contactless payments. ‚ÄúWe are adopting a collaborative mindset‚Äù Lane says. ‚ÄúWe think it makes sense to have this European entity.‚Äù



Visa would not comment on the record for fear of antagonizing the European banks who are members of its payments network.



Given the political pressure to make it happen it is almost certain the EPI will eventually launch. But European consumers would probably be wise to not take a scissors to their Mastercards and Visas just yet.



Correction July 11 2021: A previous version of this article misstated where the Giro card payment network is predominantly used. It also wrongly identified Nets as the acquirer in its merger with Nexi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9mYWN0Lm9yZy90YXhpbmctbXVsdGluYXRpb25hbC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxing Multinational Corporations,"Tax Policy

Taxing Multinational Corporations

By Daniel N. Shaviro ¬∑

The Issue:

In debates regarding higher versus lower corporate income taxes an important issue is the impact that changes in either direction would have on the level of domestic investment and consequently on economic growth the strength of the labor market and government revenues. Proponents of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) argued at the time of its enactment that cutting the United States corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent would spur investment in the United States particularly by multinational corporations. Some further claimed that by reason of these investment responses the TCJA would only minimally if at all reduce federal income tax revenues. More recently there have been warnings that the proposed partial reversal of the TCJA‚Äôs corporate tax rate cut would slow investment and hamper economic growth.

What do economic reasoning and recent experience teach us about the effects of corporate tax rates on investment and economic growth in a global environment?

The Facts:

The argument that lowering the corporate tax rate increases domestic investment economic growth and jobs focuses on the after-tax return on investment. A multinational corporation will have investment opportunities across the countries in which it operates. Its return on an investment in a particular country may partially depend upon the statutory tax rate in that country ‚Äì a higher tax rate all else equal reduces the after-tax profit. Lower expected after-tax profits will reduce investment. Conversely if a country cuts its statutory tax rate it should expect to see more domestic investment (by both solely domestic companies and multinational corporations) all else equal. This in turn would be expected to raise this country‚Äôs stock of capital and with more equipment machines and factories national income should rise. Workers‚Äô incomes could also increase since the greater stock of capital would make them more productive potentially raising their wages. The increase in economic activity would mute the shortfall in government revenues due to the tax cut. Note that these outcomes assume companies respond to lower tax rates by investing more that this leads to higher national income and that worker pay responds to changes in productivity.

Note that these outcomes assume companies respond to lower tax rates by investing more that this leads to higher national income and that worker pay responds to changes in productivity. The TCJA offers an example to test whether a tax cut spurs investment. There is an emerging consensus that the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act fell well short of raising investment to an extent consistent with the argument outlined in the previous bullet point. For example a study conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that the growth in business investment over the 2017 to 2019 period fell short of what would be expected either under the above argument outlined or based on the historical relationship between tax cuts and investment. In addition the TCJA appears to have resulted in a substantial reduction in government revenue ‚Äî an estimated $275 billion or 7.6% of government revenues that were expected before the tax cuts took place. A respected independent analyst the Tax Policy Center recently estimated that ‚Äì even before the pandemic‚Äôs onset ‚Äì the TCJA was on a path to lose $1.6 trillion of government revenues over ten years. This exceeds the initial estimate of a $1 trillion shortfall reflecting the tepid response of investment to the lower tax rate as well as other features of the Act.

The disappointing investment and revenue response to the TCJA reflects some important features of the current tax and economic environment; among these is companies‚Äô ability to earn high profits in a country through valuable intellectual property (IP) that need not be generated in that country. To illustrate how valuable intellectual property may reduce multinational corporations‚Äô responsiveness to tax rate changes when they are earning high profits in particular countries consider Facebook when it is deciding whether to use its platform to generate advertising revenues from the users in a given country. It can be active in that country at a relatively low added cost allowing it to earn high profits there (taking as given the IP it has) without reducing its presence in other countries. In addition unlike a firm that is deciding where to place a new factory with only one such factory being needed to support expected global production levels Facebook‚Äôs profits from engagement in each country may be largely independent from profits it would earn in any other country. Under these circumstances it may neither be tax-deterred by local corporate taxes that merely reduce the after-tax level of such high profits nor encouraged to do more by lower tax rates. Moreover insofar as valuable IP allows multinational corporations to earn high profits in those countries that do not affect their profitability in other countries the same analysis can apply to bricks-and-mortar companies that operate through conventional retail establishments such as McDonalds and Starbucks (whose IP is their brand). Such companies likewise can decide separately on their activity levels in each country rather than choosing between countries and will not be deterred by an increased tax rate insofar as the IP‚Äôs value still permits them to earn high profits.

A second key feature of the current tax and economic environment that helps to explain the disappointing investment growth and revenue response to the TCJA is that the statutory tax rate differs from the effective tax rate facing corporations. The actual tax rates paid by United States corporations are far below the statutory rate (e.g. 35% before the TCJA 21% after) because of a range of available deductions and other tax benefits. For example many large U.S. companies pay no current-year income taxes at all in years when they report high profits to shareholders due to legal deductions and exemptions in the tax code. At least 55 of the largest corporations in the United States paid zero dollars in federal corporate income taxes in 2020. This may cause the actual effect of a tax cut to be much smaller than what would be expected based on a consideration of the change in the statutory rate alone.

This may cause the actual effect of a tax cut to be much smaller than what would be expected based on a consideration of the change in the statutory rate alone. The effect of a statutory tax cut is even more muted for multinational corporations because of a pervasive accounting practice known as ‚Äúprofit shifting.‚Äù Profit shifting occurs when multinational corporations book profits and deductions in such a way as to minimize their global tax liabilities. For example a multinational corporation could disproportionately report its gross income as arising in a tax haven such as Bermuda with low rates and its deductions as arising in high-tax-rate countries like the United States. Profit shifting reflects a separation between actual economic activity and where those activities are recorded for tax purposes. Profit shifting is especially feasible for highly profitable ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù companies such as Apple Amazon Facebook or Google (along with many of their less famous peers). The returns to investments for these ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù corporations reflect the value of IP ‚Äì a key input to corporate profitability today. But profit shifting is also available to a significant degree for traditional companies with retail outlets such as Starbucks and McDonalds if they likewise rely on valuable IP (such as brand names trademarks and knowhow) to generate large profits.

The ability of a multinational corporation to change its official corporate residence also affects its tax liability. United States international tax rules that have been around since 1962 (and that were retained in the TCJA) along with analogous provisions in numerous other countries‚Äô international tax systems tax U.S. companies‚Äô foreign source income that can easily be reported in tax havens (e.g. because it is ‚Äúpassive‚Äù like bank interest and dividends on portfolio stock). However these taxes can be avoided by non-resident multinational corporations giving rise to an incentive for ‚Äúinversion‚Äù - U.S. companies effectively reclassifying themselves as foreign companies. The feasibility of preventing this depends on issues such as how multinational corporations‚Äô place of legal residence is determined the ease of changing residence and how responsive new corporate equity and investments are to residence status.

The feasibility of preventing this depends on issues such as how multinational corporations‚Äô place of legal residence is determined the ease of changing residence and how responsive new corporate equity and investments are to residence status. The experience under the TCJA demonstrates the difficulty of addressing profit-shifting. The TJCA added two main provisions that were meant to address profit-shifting. The first known as GILTI (for ‚ÄúGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income‚Äù) imposed a10.5 percent tax on the amount of a U.S.-based multinational corporation‚Äôs income from foreign sources that exceeded a 10 percent return on all of its tangible property used in business abroad. The second known as the BEAT (for ‚ÄúBase Erosion anti-Abuse Tax‚Äù) addressed the use of deductible payments to shift reported profits outside the United States by both U.S.-based and foreign-based multinational corporations. However both provisions were seriously flawed. For example GILTI‚Äôs impact can be reduced by pairing high-tax with low-tax foreign source income to derive maximum benefit from the use of tax havens. The BEAT is rife with avoidance opportunities that reflect its hasty and sloppy design. A recent study using data predating the COVID pandemic found that the TCJA failed to make a significant dent in corporate profit-shifting. While the TCJA‚Äôs failure significantly to reduce profit shifting reflected its rushed and secretive enactment process it also testified to the inherent difficulty of the task.

The Biden Administration‚Äôs 2021 tax proposals offer two main responses to the concern that increasing taxation of the foreign source income of multinational corporations based in the United States will lead to a reduction in their investments. First the Biden Administration plan aims to strengthen the existing anti-inversion rules to prevent existing U.S. companies from effectively reclassifying themselves as foreign companies. Second it aims by multiple means including proposed U.S. tax rule changes to reduce tax competition between countries and increase the extent to which they instead cooperate towards ensuring that highly profitable multinational companies will pay significant taxes somewhere. In particular the U.S. is seeking to reach widespread agreement that such companies should face a 15 percent global minimum tax requiring them to pay at least that global rate whether to source or residence jurisdictions. These efforts have met with some initial diplomatic success in the form of a recent agreement between the G-7 nations to coordinate the design and imposition of a global minimum tax. However it remains too early to tell how these efforts will turn out in the end and challenges remain including the refusal by a set of countries to sign onto the deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JhaXNvbmRhbmdvci8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2cyMC1zaWducy1vZmYtb24tMTUtZ2xvYmFsLW1pbmltdW0tY29ycG9yYXRlLXRheC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtd2lsbC13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,G20 Signs Off On 15% Global Minimum Corporate Tax‚ÄîHere's How It Will Work,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2021/07/11/g20-signs-off-on-15-global-minimum-corporate-tax-heres-how-it-will-work/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JhaXNvbmRhbmdvci8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2cyMC1zaWducy1vZmYtb24tMTUtZ2xvYmFsLW1pbmltdW0tY29ycG9yYXRlLXRheC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtd2lsbC13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Ntb2RlbGFuYWx5c3QuY29tL3N0cmlwZS1idXNpbmVzcy1tb2RlbC_SATtodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzbW9kZWxhbmFseXN0LmNvbS9zdHJpcGUtYnVzaW5lc3MtbW9kZWwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stripe Business Model,"Known as the ‚ÄúPayPal for the mobile era‚Äù operating in 130 countries with customers like Google Amazon Microsoft and National Geographic the Stripe Business Model and history calls the attention of business scholars.

A brief history of Stripe

Stripe is a young company founded in 2010 by two also young prodigies: the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison. Patrick at only 16 was awarded the Young Scientist of the Year (for his work on Lisp programming language). He also had to leave high school earlier in order to attend his Computer Science classes at MIT. On his side John has the record of the highest score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (the last examination to qualify for university) and entered Harvard University for Computer Science too another Ivy League institution.

At the beginning of his freshman year (2007) Patrick and John founded Auctomatic an auction management system for marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. Auctomatic joined the winter batch of Y Combinator a seed money startup accelerator. Some months later the company would be acquired by Live Current Media for $5 mi ‚Äî and Patrick became its Head of Product Engineering ‚Äî at 19 years old. At that time John was entering Harvard. The next year John dropped out of Harvard and the two brothers started Stripe. Stripe‚Äôs first funding could not come from any other place than Y Combinator ‚Äî actually by its founder Paul Graham who previously knew Patrick.

A little long later the brothers met Peter Thiel and Elon Musk founders of PayPal. The result was an investment of $2 million and great insights and orientation according to Patrick. Stripe was finally launched in September 2011 and five months later raised another round of funding ‚Äî $18 mi from Sequoia Capital with participation from Affirm and PayPal.

In the following years Stripe would expand its operation and product line and its first clients included names like Lyft and Wish. In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic forced traditional companies to adapt to online sales boosting Stripe‚Äôs path which increased its valuation from $20 bi in 2019 to $95 bi the next year. Currently Stripe works with more than one million businesses all over the world and employs over 4000 people.

Who Owns Stripe

Stripe is still owned by its founders the brothers Patrick and John Collison with Patrick holding the position of the company‚Äôs CEO and John as the President.

Stripe‚Äôs Mission Statement

Stripe‚Äôs mission statement is ‚ÄúOur mission is to increase the GDP of the internet‚Äù.

How Stripe makes money

As a payment processing fintech Stripe makes money by taking a percentage and a fixed fee (depending on the package selected) on every payment it processes. This multisided business model depends on two related clients:

Customers : People who buy over the internet;

Nowadays the Stripe revenue model is based on 7 sources:

1. Payment Processing Fees

This is the greatest share of Stripe‚Äôs revenue handling payment transactions through the internet. This involves five payment processing products:

Payments : The most popular type used by clients such as Amazon. It charges 2.9% over each successful payment plus a fixed fee of $0.30 (plus 1% for international cards and 1% more when requiring currency conversion). For instant payouts it charges 1% of payout volume;

It charges 2.9% over each successful payment plus a fixed fee of $0.30 (plus 1% for international cards and 1% more when requiring currency conversion). For instant payouts it charges 1% of payout volume; Billing : For subscriptions and invoicing for businesses with recurring revenues such as SaaS companies like Slack. There are two plans. Starter with 0.5% of recurring charges and Scale with advanced integrations starting at 0.8% of recurring charges;

: For subscriptions and invoicing for businesses with recurring revenues such as SaaS companies like Slack. There are two plans. Starter with 0.5% of recurring charges and Scale with advanced integrations starting at 0.8% of recurring charges; Connect : For platforms and marketplaces that need infrastructure to pay the third-party sellers such as Shopify. The Standard plan is free of charge. Custom or Express plan charges $2 per monthly active account plus 0.25% and $0.25 per payout sent;

: For platforms and marketplaces that need infrastructure to pay the third-party sellers such as Shopify. The Standard plan is free of charge. Custom or Express plan charges $2 per monthly active account plus 0.25% and $0.25 per payout sent; Terminal : For an in-person point of sale payments with hardware for clients like ShowClix. For in-person card processing it cuts 2.7% plus $0.05 per charge. For international cards 1% plus 1% if currency conversion is required;

: For an in-person point of sale payments with hardware for clients like ShowClix. For in-person card processing it cuts 2.7% plus $0.05 per charge. For international cards 1% plus 1% if currency conversion is required; Invoicing: A global invoicing platform that creates and sends a Stripe-hosted invoice in minutes. Or uses the Invoicing API to automate payment reconciliations. The Starter plan offers 25 free invoices per month and charges 0.4% per paid invoice after that. The Plus plan with advanced features charges 0.5% per paid invoice.

2. Atlas

It is a service for customers to set up and incorporate a startup business within minutes. Stripe incorporates the business in Delaware integrates the business with their payment infrastructures and gives credits and discounts from businesses like Amazon Web Services (AWS) plus legal and accounting firms. A one-time setup fee of $500 has to be paid. Also the ongoing costs encompass a Delaware registered agent ($100 per year) corporate tax prep (starts at $250 per year) Delaware tax filing (starts at $225) and a business bank account.

3. Radar

It is a machine learning application that helps businesses detect and identify fraudulent transactions used by clients such as Kickstarter and OpenTable. Its algorithms mark suspicious payments and stop processing the transaction. Stripe charges $0.05 per screened transaction.

4. Sigma

It is Stripe‚Äôs warehousing tool used for businesses to analyze their operations and finances to help teams get insights into the ventures. It charges a monthly fixed fee according to the infrastructure needed plus a variable fee per credit card charge which starts at $0.02 per charge.

5. Issuing

It is a corporate service to create cards for businesses and their employees. Stripe charges $0.10 per virtual card and $3 per physical one. The first $500K in card transactions are free after that the cost is 0.2% plus $0.20 for each transaction. Again for international payments 1% plus $0.30 and additional 1% for currency conversion.

6. Treasury

It is an invite-only service that allows businesses to embed financial services in their marketplaces or platforms for their customers to hold funds pay bills earn interest and manage cash flow. The fee is customized.

To sum up although Stripe has conquered a great market share it still has plenty of prospects to go even bigger such as the mentioned initial public offering (IPO) ‚Äî which may not happen anytime in the near future though according to the founders ‚Äî and other possibilities in the financial market itself."

Oakland hit eight homers in two days with back-to-back homers in the second inning of both games. Lowrie‚Äôs drive to straightaway center was nearly caught at the wall by a leaping Eli White and Murphy followed by blasting an 0-2 pitch to left-center.

The Rangers‚Äô Nick Solak in a 10-for-55 slump and batting ninth for only the second time this season hit a one-hop double off the wall in right-center with two out to score David Dahl.

*Eye-popping statistics. Record-setting individual achievements. Must-see TV highlights. All adding up to ‚Ä¶ zero team success.

Don‚Äôt look now but Joey Gallo and Luka Doncic are the same person.

While his team flounders 19 games under .500 the Texas Rangers‚Äô outfielder is again commanding and dazzling in his own personal spotlight. Wednesday at Globe Life Field he smashed two mammoth homers ‚Äì 440 and 462 feet ‚Äì to give him 23 before next week‚Äôs All-Star break. The second homer was the longest hit by a Ranger in the new park and allowed him to become the first player in franchise history to hit 10 in a 10-game span. Just to remind fans that he‚Äôs not a one-trick pony the Gold Glove right fielder also threw out a runner with a laser to third base. So intimidating is Gallo that with a 5-2 lead and the bases loaded in the 8th inning the Detroit Tigers cautiously pitched around him for a unintentional intentional walk. Not surprisingly the strategy to surrender a run but mitigate the damage worked as the next two Rangers struck out and Detroit escaped with a 5-3 victory.

If this all sounds too familiar you must be a fan of the Dallas Mavericks. Because the last two seasons it‚Äôs been Doncic with the tape-measure shots via 35-foot step-back 3-pointers the onslaught of triple-doubles and barrage of almost nightly ‚ÄúLuka is the first NBA player to ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù

The Mavs obviously are more successful than the Rangers or are they? Despite singular superstars that sell tickets win games and help keep their teams relevant neither franchise has won a playoff series since 2011.

At this point the Mavs and Rangers are like a Perrier-flavored Dave Matthews Band made listenable only by nightly guitar solos by Eddie Van Halen.

*When Dallas Cowboys training camp kicks off in 11 days Dak Prescott will be a full-speed 100-percent participant with a new $160 million contract. Mind and body right.

All is well.

But ‚Ä¶ based on his recent interview with ESPN I‚Äôm not sure the team was totally honest with us when they said the quarterback‚Äôs second ankle surgery was ‚Äúplanned.‚Äù Nor am I certain that I can comfortably read how he attempted to re-set his shattered ankle himself. Wince commence.

*The NBA‚Äôs 75th anniversary logo is a blatant back-court violation. By not updating the silhouette of Jerry West into the 21st Century the league is chaining itself to the past. Plus it‚Äôs bland blanderson.

*Amazing how hockey in DFW magically melts the second the Dallas Stars stop playing. The Tampa Bay Lightning won their second consecutive Stanley Cup this week. But honestly I forgot the NHL Playoffs were even occurring. The Stars last took the ice 60 days ago. This might be a Stars town but it definitely isn‚Äôt a hockey town.

*As I‚Äôve said before The Fan has more total radio listeners but The Ticket has more dedicated listeners that tune in longer. The race for DFW sports radio essentially stayed the same in May with The Ticket finishing No. 1 among Men 25-54 with a 7.9 compared to The Fan at No. 8 with a 4.0. Interesting stats to me continues to be cume or in radio parlance cumulative audience. During May the total number of people that listened to The Fan for at least five minutes of a given quarter-hour was 107000 well ahead of The Ticket‚Äôs 89000 but way behind DFW‚Äôs most popular station: Jack FM with 221000.

*Speaking or radio ratings the shine has worn off of Ben & Skin at The Eagle. In May 2020 their show clocked in with a 9.1 rating No. 1 in their afternoon drive time slot. With a consistent decline in May 2021 that number dipped drastically to 4.6 only sixth-best in the market.

*While Gallo mashing in Denver‚Äôs mile-high air will be tantalizing on Monday night even a 550-foot homer or two won‚Äôt top what a Ranger once did in the All-Star Home Run Derby. In 2008 at Yankee Stadium Josh Hamilton hit an unfathomable 28 homers in the first round including several 500-plus feet. Few remember that he wound up losing the title leaving Ruben Sierra (1989) and Juan Gonzalez (1993) as the only Rangers to win the derby.

*As mesmerizing as Hamilton‚Äôs performance was give me the NBA Slam Dunk Contest over the Home Run Derby. Creativity and athleticism beats simply watching a ball sail over a fence.

*Very cool move by the Mavs to treat the Greater Dallas Big Brothers Big Sisters ‚Äúlittles‚Äù and ‚Äúbigs‚Äù to a free screening of Space Jam: A New Legacy Saturday morning. Also a tad vexing for some of us. I‚Äôm taking my little brother Ja to volunteer Saturday at White Rock Lake‚Äôs ‚ÄúShoreline Spruce Up.‚Äù It‚Äôs the 304th consecutive second Saturday of the month that the organization has kept Dallas‚Äô prettiest lake pretty. That‚Äôs right though seeing a free sports movie in the A/C sounds inviting we‚Äôre committed to picking up trash outside in the heat. I am a decent mentor. Trust me?

*Zero sympathy for Dallas sprinter Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson. She qualified for the Tokyo Olympics but was then booted off the team after testing positive for marijuana. Pot will be legal everywhere sooner rather than later. But for now it‚Äôs illegal in international track and field competition. Yes even if you smoked it to cope with the death of a close family member. Richardson knew the rules and took the risk anyway. Actions have consequences.

*In 2020 the top three most popular female and male names remained the same for a second year in a row. Olivia Emma and Ava were the top three most popular names for baby girls and Liam Noah and Oliver were the most popular for boys. I personally know only one Olivia one Emma and one Noah. I clearly need to get out more. Or to hang around new parents.

*At age 5 I was beginning to get immersed in sports. Loved Lew Alcindor at UCLA and was curious where he was going to play in the NBA. I remember Dad telling me ‚ÄúWell either Milwaukee or Phoenix.‚Äù He then attempted to explain the dumbest rule in the history of sports: The 1969 NBA Draft‚Äôs No. 1 overall pick was determined by yep a coin flip between the two teams that finished last in their division the previous season. The Bucks won the toss and two years later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led them to their first and only championship. The Suns were left with the second pick ‚Äì the extremely forgettable Neil Walk. If nothing else this makes me root for the Suns in this year‚Äôs NBA Finals. Along with former Maverick Jae Crowder who did nothing except play his butt off in Dallas.

*Shame on Uber. In 2019 the Dallas City Council approved $9 million ‚Äì along with tax-break incentives worth about $20 million over 10 years ‚Äì to attract the ride-sharing giant. Uber took the deal moved in and promised to create 2500 jobs with a salary of at least $100000 by 2023. Now blaming the pandemic the company says it is only brining 500 jobs to its Deep Ellum office. So long tax breaks. One good re-neg deserves another.

*Though I still get goosebumps remembering my time covering the 1996 games in Atlanta I‚Äôve soured on the Olympics through the years. Corporate bribes. Judging and doping scandals. One-and-done venues built in areas of Brazil and Russia where poverty abounds and running water is scarce. Billed as pure amateur athletics nothing about it seems clean. That said I will tune in to Tokyo when Luka leads Slovenia in the hoops tournament. He had a ‚Äì stop me if you‚Äôve heard this one before ‚Äì triple-double to lead his country to its first Olympic berth. The win came against Lithuania the country coached and pretty much funded in the 1992 Olympics by former Mavs‚Äô GM and close Luka ally Donnie Nelson.

*Stumbled upon the Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest. It‚Äôs nonsense as a sports ‚Äúevent‚Äù of course. Nonetheless Joey Chestnut eating 76 hot dogs ‚Äì with buns ‚Äì is staggering. That he ate them in 10 minutes is ‚Ä¶ nauseating.

*Ever tried ordering the Soup of the Night?

*Luka also said if given a choice he‚Äôd rather win a gold medal for Slovenia than an NBA Championship for the Mavs. I have zero problem with this. None. Think of what it would mean for the poor country of two million vs. what it would mean to our prosperous Metroplex of six million.

*For the first time on Earth human-made materials outweigh all living things. Surprised it took this long.

*The Dallas County Commissioners Court declared July 6 as ‚ÄúLuka Doncic Day.‚Äù Seriously imagine what the kid will get when his team finally wins something. Dirk got ‚ÄúNowitzki Way.‚Äù Luka might get an entire freeway. The Luka Loop?

*Tried to get into the frenzy over the EURO 2024 soccer tournament. But nope not happening. In a given game there are approximately 100 backward passes away from the goal only about five shots actually on goal. Way too much foreplay for my liking. And more flopping than Chris Paul. Hard um pass.

*Serious question: How is QAnon still a movement when ‚ÄúQ‚Äù has been unmasked? I watched HBO‚Äôs Into The Storm documentary and in the final episode ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is revealed. It‚Äôs not Donald Trump. Or Steve Bannon. Or Michael Flynn. Or anybody inside The White House or for that matter anyone even remotely associated with government. ‚ÄúQ‚Äù ‚Äì the person who posted cryptic messages that were interpreted by millions as some sort of marching orders ‚Äì is none other than a random techy named Ron Watkins that went by the name ‚ÄúCode Monkey.‚Äù In the documentary‚Äôs finale he admits that he posted as ‚ÄúQ‚Äù. And he hasn‚Äôt posted anything since Dec. 8 2020. It‚Äôs over. Q is no longer anonymous. And Q no longer posts online. But somehow it‚Äôs still a thing. Delusion is powerful.

*RANGERS RISK: We all think the Texas Rangers are going to be putrid this season. Our lil‚Äô roundtable revealed predicted win totals of anywhere between 61 and 78 but no one thinks .500 is plausible. Let‚Äôs put our money where our mouth is. I‚Äôm going to bet a virtual $100 against the Rangers every game this season and after six months and 162 games see where I wind up. I‚Äôll keep a running tab right there each Friday and come September I‚Äôll (wink) disperse my profits to my most loyal readers. RECORD: 34-53 TOTAL: +$294.

That‚Äôs great because I could use the break! Instead this week we will look at both the good and bad surprises from the first half in the starting pitching realm. Who seemingly came out of nowhere and has been terrific? On the other hand which pitchers did we have high expectations for that have gone unmet? I will not cop out and use injuries as a cause for disappointment as injuries happen to pitchers every year. Instead we will look at those that we banked on who have not performed to expectations.

What?! Your league is not using Fantrax? Inconceivable! Check out everything Fantrax has to offer and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll come around to our way of thinking.

First Half Surprises: The Good

Carlos Rodon: Rodon was a free agent looking for work when the White Sox re-signed him to a one-year $4 million deal late this winter. A first-round draft pick Rodon had always been long on talent and short on results. Injuries plagued him: various shoulder issues bursitis and Tommy John surgery in 2019 all limiting his availability and effectiveness. Rodon won a rotation spot on the White Sox with an excellent Spring Training culminating in an All-Star nod this week. On the season Rodon is 7-3 with a 2.36 ERA and .96 WHIP. The 130 strikeouts place him in the top-10 of pitchers. Rodon relies on the improved velocity of his four-seam fastball (up three MPH to 95.9 since last year) and a vicious slider; batters are hitting .106 off that slider. He does not seem to have been part of this sticky ball controversy either; spin rates look consistent from year to year. Can he continue? The pedigree of being a top draft pick says yes but the checkered injury history really bears watching as the grind continues into the second half. But I would be a liar if I told you we saw this breakout coming. Rodon came within one hit batter of throwing a perfect game earlier in the season and has been one of two aces (Lance Lynn being the other) for the first-place Chicago White Sox.

Kyle Gibson: Gibson had been a serviceable back-end of your fantasy rotation for a number of years. At the very least he was a guy you could stream based on matchups and hope for a few strikeouts. I always felt somewhat comfortable taking him as a seventh or eighth starter as depth to guard against injuries. And then Gibson started the year with an awful line getting only one out in his season debut while giving up five runs in a shellacking. All he has done since then is be excellent: 6-1 2.29 ERA 1.07 WHIP. He has chipped in 88 strikeouts in 101 innings. OK so the K rate is not dominant but he is giving you quality innings and been an unexpected source of help for your teams. It‚Äôs a possibility that Gibson could be traded to a contender in coming weeks which would be something to monitor closely; he‚Äôs 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA in home starts in Globe Life Field his current home park.

Matt Barnes: I will fully admit that before the season began I was not taking Barnes anywhere unless I was speculating on a third closer. Well shame on me. Barnes has been terrific all year. He‚Äôs 4-2 with a 2.68 ERA and .86 WHIP. Barnes has a staggering 62 strikeouts in 37 innings. He‚Äôs got a 44.6 K%. He has cut the BB % to 7.2 and the xERA shows even better at 1.76. Controlling the walks has been the key for him and he has surrendered only 10 free passes all year. Barnes has locked down the Boston closer job and shows no signs of relinquishing it for a surprising first-place team.

Honorable Mention: Yusei Kikuchi Anthon DeSclafani Tyler Mahle

First Half Surprises: The Bad:

Gerrit Cole: I know it is hard to be disappointed in a guy who is 8-4 with a 2.91 ERA .96 WHIP and 135 punchouts in 105 innings. But based on where he was taken in most drafts the results over the last month or so have been mediocre; Cole was 2-2 with a less-than-league average 4.65 ERA. He gave up nine home runs in his five June starts. Last week he gave up four earned runs and three walks in 3.1 innings. Now this isn‚Äôt necessarily awful and these are usable stats but not for the guy you drafted in the first round to be your ace. Cole has also been mentioned fairly or unfairly in the Spider Tack controversy; was he using an extra illicit substance on the ball to get extra spin? We don‚Äôt know. But we do know that Cole has historically been among the best pitchers in baseball and there has to be some concern attached to him at this point of the year.

Blake Snell: I have never gotten the hype on Snell. His stuff is excellent but outside of his remarkable Cy Young season in 2018 he‚Äôs not been that great for fantasy purposes. Snell is 3-3 with a 4.99 ERA. YEs the 93 Ks in 70.1innings help but the 1.55 WHIP does not. What has happened to Snell? Well to start with the BB % is a career-worst 13.8 which puts him in the bottom 7% of all MLB starters. His hard-hit % is a career-worst 41.7. The inconsistency has been maddening; he has had games of 10 and 11 strikeouts where he got wins. He has also had four outings where he has given up more than five earned runs. Again similar to Cole above you likely drafted him as your top starter and if you did that you likely have been disappointed and likely have had to pivot off him. That being said I don‚Äôt know what you do with this; sell low? Hang on and hope for better? Start him each week hoping he figures it out? Snell did land on the IL this past week with a case of gastroenteritis. It did impact him going back more than a week and he was unable to make his last start because of it. Here‚Äôs hoping the rest does him good. Snell is too good to have been this bad.

Luis Castillo: Castillo is 3-10 with a 4.81 ERA and bloated 1.40 WHIP. Egads! What happened? Wasn‚Äôt Castillo a fantasy darling before the season started with many touting him as one of the top 5-6 starts in baseball? Taking a dive into the stats the first thing that jumps out at you is the lower K% down from 30.5% last year to a less-than-league average 21.2%. Castillo has 90 punchouts in 97.1 innings. As was noted by other writers Castillo‚Äôs velocity was down a tick (97.4 to 96.8 on his fastball and the slider 86.8 to 85.9) but that cannot be the only reason for his rough start. Location especially with the changeup appears to have been an issue for Castillo. There have been signs that he is breaking out of the slump in June and July: 2-2 with a 1.71 ERA in June and two more decent starts thus far in July resulting in no decisions but a 2.70 ERA and .90 WHIP. Most fantasy managers seem to have hung on to him and it looks like they might reap some benefits from that decision if Castillo can keep the ship moving in this better direction.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: JPMORGAN PEPSICO GOLDMAN SACHS

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr. (vs.$2.3B/qtr. cons.) for the remainder of this year‚Äù noted Daniel T. Fannon equity analyst at Jefferies.

Ola Ince‚Äôs abrasively modern interpretation complete with guns and overtones of street gang culture is a strange mix. On the positive side she has coaxed performances from the cast that are as dynamic as they are edgy frequently revealing fascinating new meanings from Shakespeare‚Äôs words. On the negative side she has decided that his language is not enough hence the signboard above the stage which pronounces on everything from the decline in youth clubs to suicide rates.

Like most if not all people in attendance I am fully invested in a lot of the messages she wants to get across. I raged about the death of Sarah Everard and attended a vigil for her I have written about and donated to charities to help teenagers avoid a life of crime and like so many of us ‚Äì especially over the last two years ‚Äì I have lost friends to suicide. Yet this didn‚Äôt stop the device of the electric signboard feeling forced and clumsy. Not least because it demonstrated a lack of faith in what a gifted cast might already extract from the script.

Surely Shakespeare‚Äôs enduring appeal is his ability to dissect emotions and agendas with such agility that each time you encounter them you can interpret your own experiences in a new light. Part of the joy even in his tragedies is the way he celebrates the sheer maddening complexity of humanity whether he‚Äôs talking about violence power attraction or love.

So many of the signs by contrast seem reductive and at worst irrelevant. Take another one ‚Äì ""Love is a matter of life or death for young people who don‚Äôt have a secure attachment to a guardian."" Again I feel invested in this message; I fostered a baby born addicted to class-A drugs and attended classes for more than a year in order to understand the importance of attachment. It‚Äôs crucial. But why is the sign here? Juliet‚Äôs biological parents may be distant but her nurse (wonderfully played by Sirine Saba) has clearly been emotionally invested in her from the word go. Beyond this surely for both Romeo and Juliet the crux of their predicament is that ultimately they are far too strongly attached to their families.

If the aim is to be hard-hitting and relevant in a way that helps those teenagers who may see the performance why has the issue of Covid been ignored? The production turns the ball where Romeo and Juliet meet into a clubbing scene ‚Äì which is effective and has both funny and touching moments. But if you‚Äôre happy to feature rap lyrics and the exchange of mobile numbers why not allude to the fact that we‚Äôre living in a time where the pandemic has made it forbidden for teenagers to party or to be intimate with each other and that this has had a major impact on adolescent mental health? Sure many have broken the rules but would it be that hard to incorporate just a couple of visual references to the fact that it‚Äôs controversial to touch anyone regardless of their families?

It‚Äôs not the job of a critic to suggest what a director should do ‚Äì not least an award-winning director like Ince ‚Äì but this is just another indication of the frustratingly incomplete logic on display here which is compounded by the positive aspects on view. Not least among those are Alfred Enoch‚Äôs engaging streetwise Romeo and Murrell‚Äôs pragmatic and self-possessed Juliet. The two (pictured above) look like any pair of kids you might see on a London street and the chemistry between them is easy and credible.

Ince has coaxed fantastically clear enunciation from the cast members as well which is no small feat in such an acoustically tricky space. This pays off particularly well when it comes to Saba‚Äôs nurse who with her dark plait and glasses looks more the trendy cousin but even so conveys a level of empathy that is extraordinarily moving. The scene where she thinks she has discovered Juliet dead is one of the most devastating I have seen. Silas Carson‚Äôs Capulet reveals an unusual combination of vulnerability and hard-headedness. When he expresses his view that Juliet is too young to be married off (here the script has been adjusted so that she‚Äôs 16) you perceive a distress on his part that even successful marriages are a tragedy for girls with other things to live for. (The supporting cast also includes Adam Gillen Mozart in the National's recent Amadeus and pictured above as a hectoring Mercutio.)

This is a reasonably fast-paced evening ‚Äì one hour fifty straight through ‚Äì so not bad for YouTube-honed attention spans. And if just one teenager feels they can ask for help as a result of the signs then the production will have achieved something good. Yet how much more might be achieved by letting the teenagers get immersed in the story without signposting what they might or might not be worrying about when they do so? Shakespeare lasts because he is able to distil the hopes and worries of people in all kinds of situations against infinite political and social backdrops. If he could be trusted to do so here the evening would gain as much punch as Juliet does from those kick-boxing lessons.",,,,,,,,,

By Stacey Dressner

You could practice your golf swing endlessly at the local driving range hoping you might improve your golf game.

Or you can head to GOLFTEC a golf training center in West Hartford that offers a technology-based system that analyzes and evaluates your golf swing then sets you up with lessons and your own golf pro or ‚Äúcoach‚Äù who instructs you on exactly what to do to improve your game.

‚ÄúOur goal is to help people play better golf‚Äù said Dave Souza co-owner and manager of the West Hartford GOLFTEC and one of the center‚Äôs certified personal golf coaches.

For Souza GOLFTEC is a family affair.

The West Hartford native and his wife Shannon opened the state-of-the-art GOLFTEC center on New Britain Avenue in March 2017 along with his parents and co-owners Bill and Michelle Souza who also live in West Hartford. The family now owns the franchise rights for GOLFTEC in Hartford County and plans to open even more of the training centers down the road.

Since it opened GOLFTEC in West Hartford has given 33000 lessons to more than 3200 clients. Its revenue has grown to $3.5 million.

‚ÄúThe response has been great‚Äù Dave said noting that word of mouth from satisfied customers drawing in more customers.

‚ÄúIt just seems to be snowballing in a really positive way‚Äù he said.

GOLFTEC is the perfect business for the Souzas two of whom are longtime golfers and passionate fans of the sport ‚Ä¶ and two of whom are in the process of following in their footsteps.

‚ÄúMy dad and I are the primary golfers‚Äù said Dave. ‚ÄúMy wife is starting to learn and my mom is also in the process. They‚Äôre GOLFTEC students.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning now because I have a really good coach ‚Äì my son David‚Äù Michelle said with a laugh. ‚ÄúIt gives me a social physical outlet that I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. And it doesn‚Äôt take a team. You can play by yourself; you can play with a group; you can play as a couple. That‚Äôs also pretty fun.‚Äù

Love at first swing

Dave says he fell in love with the sport of golf as a kid after attending the Canon Greater Hartford Open ‚Äì now the Traveler‚Äôs Championship ‚Äì with his father.

‚ÄúI was 10 or 11 years old and I just fell in love with the athleticism and the finesse of the sport. I‚Äôve been passionate about golf ever since‚Äù he said.

Young Dave immediately asked his dad for a set of golf clubs ‚Äì and the rest as they say is history. He and his father have been golfing together at Rockledge Golf Club ever since.

Calling his dad ‚Äúa great athlete‚Äù Dave said the elder Souza played baseball for Amherst College among other sports until he decided to switch courses and try out for the college golf team. He quickly fell in love with the sport.

‚ÄúI love the humility of the game the camaraderie the physical part of it as well as the personal challenge‚Äù said Bill. ‚ÄúYou can play it until you are old and anyone can play because of the handicap system. It‚Äôs a game that everyone can come together to play.‚Äù

A 2005 graduate of Hall High School Dave took his passion for the sport to Florida State University where he majored in professional golf management. Following graduation he set out to find a job in the golf world in New England to be close to Shannon to whom he was then engaged and who was working in Boston. In 2010 he found what he was looking for at the Burlington GOLFTEC Center. He later worked at the Boston GOLFTEC for seven years.

But Dave‚Äôs heart was always back home in West Hartford.

‚ÄúGrowing up I always wanted to try to return and open some sort of golf center in West Hartford‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAfter working at the GOLFTEC in Boston I knew that it would do really well in West Hartford if we could open up a franchise.‚Äù

Headquartered in Denver GOLFTEC has grown from one small center in 1995 to 200 locations worldwide today.

Dave proposed the idea of opening a GOLFTEC franchise to his parents and they loved the idea. And so in March 2017 Dave and Shannon and Bill and Michelle opened their first GOLFTEC center on New Britain Avenue in West Hartford.

‚ÄúWhen this opportunity came along we said ‚ÄòWe know West Hartford well we know there are a lot of golfers here and a lot of golf courses nearby. And there is a lot of interest in good physical activity and sports‚Äô‚Äù says Michelle. So we just said ‚ÄòOkay let‚Äôs explore it.‚Äô And we did. To be in the position to have a family business where you‚Äôve helped fulfill one of your children‚Äôs professional dreams is pretty neat.‚Äù

Today Dave serves as manager and coach of the West Hartford GOLFTEC; Michelle the former marketing and development director for Jewish Family Services in West Hartford handles the center‚Äôs marketing and does some of GOLFTEC‚Äôs corporate marketing; and Bill a technology executive now retired from Cigna and ESPN handles the business‚Äôs financial and back-office side operations.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre attracting people from all over ‚Äì people from the Connecticut shoreline Massachusetts the Berkshires. Our customers are half local and half long distance. It‚Äôs an attraction‚Äù Bill said.

Covid put plans for additional franchises in greater Hartford on the back burner for a while but as things normalize the Souzas are hoping to open one or two more GOLFTEC centers within the next few years.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping to open more centers because we‚Äôre helping people play better golf‚Äù Dave said. ‚ÄúThe more we can get out there and help the more people will come to the game and that‚Äôs our objective.‚Äù

The toy company has especially been making the most of the MCU's 2021 projects having already produced six-inch scale Marvel Legends figures for WandaVision The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Loki and Black Widow as well as a large selection of characters from the Infinity Saga.

They also have a great many figures in the works for Marvel Studios' upcoming installments such as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Eternals. In fact the entire main series of Eternals figures leaked several months ago giving fans a better look at the characters and their costumes.

The main Eternals wave covers most of the main cast. Taking into account that Salma Hayek's Ajak is slated to release as a store exclusive there was still one character yet to receive a figure: Thena as portrayed by Angelina Jolie.

THE MARVEL LEGENDS THENA IS FINALLY REVEALED

Eternals

An image of the Marvel Legends figure based on Angelina Jolie's Thena in Eternals has surfaced online:

The figure itself doesn't exactly show off a lot about Angelina Jolie's character but it's worth noting that she does come packed with four gold-colored weapons including what looks to be a staff with a crescent shape atop it. It's been previously revealed that Thena has the ability to create weapons out of thin air much like another MCU character ‚Äî Hela from Thor: Ragnarok. That's probably as far as their similarities travel though.

WAITING FOR THESE FIGURES WON'T BE ETERNAL

Now none of these figures have made it into stores or online retailers as of yet at least not in any official capacity. The Eternals wave isn't officially due out until October 2021 about a month before the film hits theaters.

However since the figures in question have already leaked and been purchased by collectors in various locales it stands to reason that the Marvel Legends Eternals offerings are sitting in one of Hasbro's warehouses simply waiting to be shipped to stores. This is particularly likely given the production cycle for these figures and the delay of the film itself caused by the pandemic.

Additionally since Thena is not part of the main wave she will likely be available for purchase exclusively from a specific retailer such as Target or Amazon.

Next up in our annual prospect review and forecast series is Brett Leason forward for the Hershey Bears. (You can access all of our Capitals Prospect Reports and player analysis on our ‚ÄúProspects‚Äù page right here.)

VITALS

Leason a 6‚Äô-5‚Äù 225 lb right-winger was drafted by the Capitals in the second round of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft and spent the last two seasons playing for the Hershey Bears in the AHL. Leason was signed to a three-year entry-level deal on July 11 2019. He will be a restricted free agent at the end of the 2021-22 season.

CAREER

‚ÄúWhen we had our first round pick we had a chance to get Connor McMichael or Brett Leason but we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd end up with both of them.‚Äù Those were the words from Capitals‚Äô general manager Brian MacLellan just after the draft in 2019.

MacLellan told Leason at the time that he‚Äôd spend the next year in Hershey and that he needed to work on being quicker and making smarter decisions along the wall among other things. He‚Äôd then come back with a year of pro experience under his belt and be better equipped to have a crack at making the Capitals roster the following season.

Leason would indeed spend the next season in Hershey getting acclimated to the professional game. But the Calgary native struggled for most of his first AHL season. In the end he recorded just three goals and 11 assists in 50 games played shooting just 5.4% on 56 shots.

But Leason has started slow and finished strong before.

The right winger recorded just eight goals and 10 assists while playing for the Tri-City Americans in the WHL during the 2016-17 season. 12 games into the 2017-2018 season Leason was traded to the Prince Albert Raiders.

Leason‚Äôs 2018-2019 season saw a massive jump in scoring as he spent a good portion of the season on the top line with fellow Capitals‚Äô prospect Aliaksei Protas and WHL veteran Sean Montgomery. In 55 games Leason posted 36 goals and 53 assists for a combined 89 points. In 22 playoff games Leason added another 10 goals and 15 more assists helping the Raiders win the WHL championship.

The 2020-21 season saw a marked improvement for Leason. He topped his goal output from last season posting nine goals and 11 assists in just 33 games played. He looked much more comfortable on the ice in his sophomore campaign. He was much better in his puck battles and play in tight spaces but also began to expand on his play-making capabilities.

2020-21 MONTH-BY-MONTH RECAP AND TREND ANALYSIS

The following is a compilation of our month-by-month prospect reports for the 2020-21 season for Leason. You can find all of our monthly prospect reports on our ‚ÄúProspects‚Äù page in the top menu.

JANUARY

Leason was invited to attend Capitals training camp which began on January 3. He was re-assigned to Hershey on January 11.

The Bears opened training camp on Saturday January 23. The season began for the Bears on February 5 against the Binghamton Devils.

TRENDING: SAME

FEBRUARY

After struggling through his rookie campaign Leason looked like a completely different player to start the season. He is playing with a lot more confidence than he did as a rookie. The Calgary Alberta native has already equaled his goal total from last season tallying three times in just eight games.

Leason is being used as a penalty killer this season and has played more responsibly in his own end. He consistently makes good plays on the back check and blocks shots. His newly found complete game was on display against Binghamton on February 17 as Leason scored his first goal of the season on a wrist shot from the right circle early in the second period.

With the game tied in the third period the second-year winger went down and blocked a shot to keep the game even. He played a physical game and his line was a threat every time they were on the ice.

Leason would score two goals against the Binghamton Devils on February 26. The first a nice drive around the corner for the score.

Leason would add an empty net goal at the end of the game.

TRENDING: UP

MARCH

After getting off to a good start in February Leason cooled off offensively as March went along. The month started out well for the former Prince Albert Raider.

He had the helper on Axel Jonsson-Fjallby‚Äôs shorthanded goal at Lehigh Valley on March 3. The winger followed that up with a pair of assists including the primary assist on Jonsson-Fjallby‚Äôs game winner in Hershey‚Äôs 4-1 win over Lehigh Valley on March 6.

Leason then surpassed his goal total from his rookie campaign by netting his fourth goal of the season against Binghamton on March 7.

That goal is the last point Leason recorded for the month. He was scoreless in his last seven games. Leason still sees a lot of time on the penalty kill and is not afraid to get down to block shots but he needs to find his offensive game on a more consistent basis.

TRENDING: DOWN

APRIL

Leason‚Äôs strong sophomore season continued in April. He registered a point in six of the eight games in the month.

He started the month with a five-game point streak. The second-year winger dished out an assist in the first four games of his streak including the primary assist on Joe Snively‚Äôs game-winner against Binghamton on April 7.

Leason tallied Hershey‚Äôs first goal against Binghamton on April 17. He finished off a well-executed give-and-go with Aliaksei Protas.

Just like old times! Leason to Protas to Leason for the finish. Game tied 1-1. #ALLCAPS #CapsProspect #HBH pic.twitter.com/BIVJT4cqwz ‚Äî NoVa Caps (@NoVa_Caps) April 17 2021

Leason added a shorthanded goal against Lehigh Valley on April 21 to bring his season total to six double the amount of goals he scored in his rookie campaign.

Leason has also equaled his point total from last season and did so in 24 fewer games. He has six goals and eight assists in 26 games played so far this season. He has 51 shots for a 11.8% shooting percentage more than double last season‚Äôs rate.

TRENDING: UP

MAY

Leason finished the season strong. The second-year winger netted three goals in May including two game-winners and also dished out three assists.

Leason compiled four points in the last two games of the season. He had the primary assist on Connor McMichael‚Äôs game-winning goal on May 15 versus Binghamton. He followed that up with a three-point game in the season finale on May 16. He picked up the assist on McMichael‚Äôs opening goal in the first.

Nice feed from Connor McMichael to Brett Leason for a 5-on-3 goal. It‚Äôs Leason‚Äôs second goal of the game and 9th of the season. McMichael had 1g 3a in game. Bears lead 5-2. #HBH #CapsProspect #ALLCAPS pic.twitter.com/qGK4UjopPb ‚Äî NoVa Caps (@NoVa_Caps) May 16 2021

Leason‚Äôs goal early in the second proved to be the game-winner as he closed out his season with a five-on-three power play goal off of a sweet feed from McMichael.

McMichael to Leason gives Bears 3-0 lead early in 2nd period. It‚Äôs Leason‚Äôs 8th goal of the season and McMichael‚Äôs 3rd point of the game. #CapsProspect #ALLCAPS #HBH pic.twitter.com/1Z5BbpKcf3 ‚Äî NoVa Caps (@NoVa_Caps) May 16 2021

Leason scored nine goals in 33 gamess in his sophomore campaign six more than he did in 50 games as a rookie. He equaled his assist total with 11. Leason amassed 20 points on the season fourth most on the Bears.

TRENDING: UP

PLAYER FORECAST

Leason‚Äôs slow start in his rookie campaign was quickly set aside as the 2020-21 season rolled along. He looked much more comfortable this season and began to display his next-level skills on a more regular basis.

The coming season should be a big one for Leason. He and former Prince Albert Raiders teammate Aliaksei Protas should have a good season and will be exciting to watch.

With a solid third year in the AHL Leason could be looking at a potential role with the Capitals beginning with the 2022-23 season.

""Did we pass it?"" I asked my Uber driver.

A quick glance at the map on the phone told me we had indeed ‚Äî not surprising once I saw the modest entrance at the Motto By Hilton Philadelphia Rittenhouse Square.

But that shouldn't stop you from considering this property for your next stay in the City of Brotherly Love.

A recent trip to check out the new property in my (also new) hometown turned up a trendy hotel with helpful staff budget-friendly rooms and what looks to be two great options for drinking and dining once open for business.

Motto is part of a ""design-forward centrally-located"" urban lifestyle-category hotel expansion according to Hilton. The brand strives to offer ""efficient and flexible guest rooms activated social spaces locally inspired design and a communal vibe.""

In a time when headline after headline is all about high travel demand driving prices up the Motto in Philly is refreshingly affordable.

I booked a night in a queen studio room less than a month out for only $119 total using the ""Travel and Save"" (formerly ""Express Saver"") rate option directly through Hilton. This discounted rate for Hilton Honors members gives you the option to change or cancel your reservation up to one day prior to arrival waives the early departure fee (when relevant) and allows for early check-in and late checkout when available.

I used my Chase Sapphire Reserve to book for its 3x Ultimate Rewards points on travel and dining ‚Äî points that can be transferred to 13 hotel and airline partners. Another card to consider using if it's in your wallet is the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass¬Æ Card which is currently offering a welcome offer of 130000 Hilton Honors bonus points after you spend $2000 in purchases on the card within your first three months of card membership.

If you'd rather use points to book a queen studio (considered a premium room reward) will set you back 62000 points per night.

Location

The Motto By Hilton Philadelphia Rittenhouse Square's location is prime for first-time visitors to the city especially those arriving at or departing from the 30th Street train station which is less than a mile away. Here you're in the heart of downtown blocks from the iconic City Hall and close to Philadelphia's incredible art museums all along Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Restaurants shops and bars abound.

While you won't be far from the lovely Rittenhouse Square don't come expecting park views ‚Äî despite the property name. The hotel is on a busy downtown street in Center City West and as mentioned above the modest black facade which blends in with the surrounding businesses means it's easy to miss the entrance on the first pass.

Check-in

When I arrived on a rainy Tuesday evening in early June I tried to skip the front desk and head straight to my room using the contactless arrival option on my phone as prompted by the Hilton Honors app. After several unsuccessful attempts to enter my room I headed downstairs where I was told by the staff that digital entry was not yet up and running during my stay at which point the hotel had been open for less than a month.

I was able to walk right up to the front desk without having to wait to check in. I was welcomed by the staff and upon pulling up my reservation my Gold status was acknowledged. I was handed good old-fashioned key cards and a letter outlining the perks of my stay as a Gold member: free Wi-Fi two bottles of complimentary water late checkout upon request and a complimentary coffee and pastry at the adjoining El Cafe or 1000 bonus points.

I wish the complimentary bottles of water advertised in the welcome letter would have been offered upon check-in or in the room. Instead I had to return to the front desk later in my stay to retrieve them. I also ended up having to retrieve my breakfast token from the front desk the following morning as it was not in the welcome letter envelope as intended.

Prior to check-in I was able to choose my room through the app. I had two options: Room 822 or Room 922. I went with the higher floor hoping for an improved view. This turned out not to matter as the view was of the inner workings of downtown (no disrespect Philly).

My room was minimalist in design with a handful of economy furniture pieces throughout. Trendy youthful jewel tones and pastels matched the hallways.

The queen-sized bed was extremely comfortable and flanked by a side table that hosted a small pendant lamp digital clock radio and a safe. A tray table on the other side of the bed turned out to be quite handy for propping up my laptop and getting work done. My only complaint was the lack of outlets in proximity to the bed. There was one wall outlet with two open sockets within reach but it was by no means convenient and had another guest been in the room (the room was advertised as sleeping up to four people) things would have gotten messy.

A large TV equipped with Netflix was mounted on the wall across from the bed.

A sleeper sofa a storage bench perfect for resting an open suitcase and a bistro table with two chairs were the other furniture in the room. Around the corner on the way to the bathroom was the world's smallest hanging rack (which fit four hangers) and a few small open corner shelves.

The bathroom was spacious and well lit. A large mirror overlooked a single sink with ample counter space and a shelf below for towels and appliances. Other than some tile work there was not a single decorative item in the bathroom ‚Äî or in the bedroom for that matter. You don't realize how much you'll miss generic hotel art until it's not there.

Toiletries which the website touts as ""premium bath amenities"" included one Malin+Goetz bar of hand soap near the sink and three nondescript shampoo conditioner and body wash dispensers on the shower wall.

The room's view was of an uninspiring downtown cityscape but the window shades kept the light out and I couldn't hear a thing in terms of street noise. Coupled with such a comfy bed it made for some heavenly sleep.

Hilton says that Motto rooms are equipped with smart room technology such as the ability to adjust the temperature and lighting through the app. If that's true I totally missed it. Nothing about the light fixtures read smart technology and the staff never mentioned anything.

The room was squeaky clean (it honestly felt like I may have been the first or one of the first to stay there) and sealed with a ""CleanStay"" sticker when I arrived.

(Photo by Jane Frye/The Points Guy)

My only gripe about the room other than the lack of accessible outlets was that the air conditioning vent blew directly down onto the bed. Obviously this is not something the hotel has much control over but it would definitely get old during a prolonged stay.

Amenities

The only real amenity here was a compact fitness center located in the basement and like the rest of the hotel it was pretty utilitarian. There was a row of various cardio machines a rack of miscellaneous equipment such as stability balls and resistance bands and free weights.

(Photo by Jane Frye/The Points Guy)

Every other cardio machine was blocked off for social distancing purposes. I was told by a fellow gym user that guests were required to make a reservation for a one-hour slot in advance ‚Äî something the front desk had not mentioned upon check-in.

When I inquired later about needing a reservation the front desk staff confirmed the policy but reassured me that there was ample availability for reservations going forward. I'm still trying to figure out why every other machine was roped off given the one-at-a-time policy.

There were no towels on the towel rack or water in the water dispenser when I was down there which I chalk up to the ongoing hotel staffing shortages. The added element of having to wear a mask during my workout had me really missing these two items.

Food and beverage

This is where the Motto will shine ‚Äî if and when the spaces finally open.

Condesa is the bar and restaurant on the first floor named after the hip Mexico City neighborhood. It's spacious (140 seats) and fun with contemporary hues curved sectional couches and a fireplace off to the side ‚Äî perfect for unwinding after a long day of sightseeing.

(Photo by Jane Frye/The Points Guy)

The hotel's website says the menu will highlight ""regionally-inspired dishes centered around Mexican heirloom corn tortillas traditionally made with volcanic-stone ground masa and done entirely on-premise each day"" and that the bar will offer ""mezcal- and tequila-based cocktails."" All things I like. It lists the chef as Nick Kennedy part of Philly's popular Defined Hospitality group but Condesa's Instagram says it will be Alberto Sandoval a Mexico City native. Given there's no shortage of incredible talent in the city when it comes to Mexican cuisine I hope the latter is true.

When I asked at the front counter I was told the lobby space would be opening in July. However as of early July the website says it's still closed.

The adjoining El Cafe on the first floor where guests can redeem their breakfast credit was pouring Stumptown coffee and had a surprisingly fancy array of pastries from local French bakery Au Fornil to choose from (a brief and possibly temporary departure from the hotel's Mexican dining theme and decor) ‚Äî think ham and swiss croissants blueberry tarts and spinach and goat cheese quiches.

(Photo by Jane Frye/The Points Guy)

I ordered the croissant ($5) and a large coffee ($3) ‚Äî the perfect breakfast if you're looking to fuel up before trekking to Independence Hall or a long day of business meetings. Guests could enjoy their breakfast at a few high-top tables nearby or in an adjacent lounge area.

(Photo by Jane Frye/The Points Guy)

I didn't get to check out the open-air rooftop restaurant El Techo (listed on the website as ""Condesa's taqueria"") due to it being closed but its Instagram page says it reopened as of June 17 on Wednesdays through Saturdays for walk-ins only with Sandoval running the kitchen. I hope to make it back to check out the views and the menu.

Service

Having made more trips to the front desk than I would have liked I can attest to the fact that the front desk staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The extra trips made throughout my stay were for issues that hopefully will get worked out with time and experience.

Related: Should you stay at a new hotel right when it opens?

In terms of housekeeping while the missing towels and lack of water in the gym weren't ideal I was more than impressed with the cleanliness of my room. It was truly spotless.

Overall impression

The Motto By Hilton Philadelphia Rittenhouse Square is a great property for the price point. And as its on-site restaurants and bars reopen it will be an even more attractive option.

I heard someone who looked to be there on business say how much they enjoyed their stay while checking out and that they looked forward to returning ‚Äî and I can see why.

The service is green yet friendly and the common spaces are fun enough to make up for the basic rooms. Minus the bizarre decision to force guests to play a veritable ""Hunger Games"" of sorts with the bedside outlets the hotel is extremely functional and knows its target audience (with the exception of the lingering clock radio ‚Äî no idea who is using that).

Elvis Presley‚Äôs ex-girlfriend Linda Thompson has revisited Las Vegas where she spent many months with The King during his residences there in the early 1970s. Elvis dated the former Miss Tennessee model from 1972-1976 and they lived together at Graceland. During her recent trip to Las Vegas the 71-year-old paid tribute to Elvis by visiting the old Hilton hotel originally called The International and now Westgate where The King performed two shows a night.

Mill Spring NC ‚Äì July 10 2021 ‚Äì The July edition of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Lights‚Äù returned to the Tryon International Equestrian Center & Resort (TIEC) bringing a lively crowd to watch as Brittni Raflowitz and Hilton van de Breepoel claimed their first FEI Grand Prix victory in the $137000 Night in the Country Grand Prix CSI 3* with a jump-off time of 41.15 seconds. Sean Jobin (CAN) and Darius the 2008 Dutch Warmblood gelding owned by Foxridge Farms Stables (Warrant x Calvados/Sable Rose) followed close behind claiming the second place spot with a time of 44.961 seconds. Riding in the victory gallop with a third place ribbon and a time of 40.267 was Scott Keach (AUS) and Fedor the 2005 Belgian Warmblood gelding (Kashmir Van Schuttershof x Orkaan) owned by Keach himself along with Southern Cross Equestrian LLC.

Thirty riders tackled the first round of the Alan Wade (IRL) designed course six of which returned for the shortened second round. After Jobin laid down the first double-clear performance of the night Raflowitz followed and posted an unbeatable time using her new strategy: not walking the jump-off track prior to riding it. ‚ÄúI talked to Scotty Keach right before I went in and went over it. He told me ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know if you can get eight down the first line but you can try to do that. Definitely try to do seven [strides] from oxer to oxer.‚Äô

‚ÄúI landed off of fence one I moved up and said ‚ÄòOoh! I see eight!‚Äô And then I turned back to the seven and rode it exactly how he told me. I tried not to go too crazy on the rollback or the in-and-out. Going home I let him go but then brought him back to say ‚ÄòOkay take a breath now. There‚Äôs only one clear.‚Äô So that was kind of my thought process as it went on!‚Äù

Raflowitz has owned her mount affectionately known as ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù for the past eight years culminating in a partnership visible to fans in Tryon Stadium. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to say that we‚Äôre bonded in a way that I‚Äôve never had with a horse and I know pretty much everything he‚Äôs thinking‚Äù she said smiling. ‚ÄúHe knows what I‚Äôm thinking and feeling so I think it really helps to have a partner going into a competition like this and just know that you can trust him.‚Äù

Alejandro Validivia was presented with the Tryon Resort groom‚Äôs award for his care and dedication to Hilton van de Breepoel alongside Ringmaster Steve Rector.

With a farm only ten minutes from TIEC Raflowitz considers the facility home. ‚ÄúI love Tryon. It‚Äôs one of our favorite horse shows. We have a farm ten minutes away from here. Really it‚Äôs home for us and that makes this win all the more exciting!‚Äù Coming off an exciting first FEI Grand Prix win she hopes to be heading to Michigan to compete at the CSI 5* level after her success at TIEC.

Raflowitz concluded by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so grateful to my whole entire team and to my horse. My horse is my heart and my soul and I am just so happy that my first FEI Grand Prix win could be with him. To hear my country‚Äôs national anthem for the first time on the podium I got so teary eyed. So now we go home we go back to work and we see what happens next time!‚Äù

It was in my days before I really started on luxury travel. I remember meeting a friend for a gin and tonic and thinking how sophisticated it was in the hotel. Certainly better than my grotty local pub!

I have stayed there are few times the rooms are also fairly recently remodelled. Now they have completely redone all the public areas and the fitness space. I was invited to stay to review the newly upgraded property.

Location and price of Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4

This is really the only negative you could find about the hotel. Even pre-Covid the connections with T4 have always been a little slow with no direct Heathrow Express services. However given that the Sofitel is now a quarantine hotel there are no T5 hotels on site. The only options now are the Aerotel in T3 or the Heathrow Garden Inn at T2. The walk with luggage from T2 is pretty long to the Heathrow Express. By the time you have done that it is just as quick to get to T4. And the Hilton is definitely a nicer property.

The other ways to get here are an Uber which is expensive from T5 due to the Heathrow charges and could be around ¬£20! The Hoppa bus is the best option if you have luggage and don‚Äôt want to take a normal bus. This is now free for hotel guests and runs hourly from T5 to the Hilton T4. Otherwise the 482 or 490 bus will take you to T4 which the Hilton is attached to by walkway. If you are coming from London the bus also stops at Hatton Cross tube 10 minutes by bus from the hotel.

I took my car to the hotel and then drove myself to the airport the next day and parked with FHR. They represent various meet and greet services. I usually use MBW or Star Parking both of which pick the car up from the short-term parking and deliver it back there. So a week is costing me ¬£55 with the current 25% off.

The hotel is currently one of the best-priced options at Heathrow for the standard of hotel. You can usually get it from ¬£90 and even a Junior suite like the one I had is only around ¬£150 on quiet days. If you are a Diamond member it‚Äôs also great value with the lounge replacement. (see below). It‚Äôs probably slightly closer than many of the Bath Road options.

Check-in at Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4

The hotel was very quiet. I drove up to drop my luggage off as the car park is up a set of stairs to reception. I was allowed to leave my car by reception while I checked in and looked after my luggage. The receptionist was helpful and assistance was offered for my luggage to be taken to the room. The lounge is not currently open but they explained the process. The lounge is normally very good there which you can see from my previous review.

One of the things I like most about the hotel is the vast atrium that the reception and restaurants sit in. If you have been in an airport or plane for a long time it always feels great to be somewhere so open and airy. The new decor looked very contemporary and upmarket in reception. There is now also a large central food and beverage area with a bar/cafe and a more formal restaurant.

Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 Room

I was upgraded to a Junior Suite but I have stayed in the normal rooms on previous visits. The rooms here are modern and the aviation geek loves the room number signs with the planes. Also each room has a real airport feel to it with the illuminated maps on the wall.

The room felt very spacious and would be perfect for a longer layover or if you wanted to work. The desk area felt spacious and there were plenty of sockets at desk level for charging.

There was a lot of storage space in the wardrobe which is probably unnecessary in an airport hotel but it also had all the essentials such as an iron and morning board and robe with slippers. I liked that there was plenty of mineral water supplied and in glass bottles too. Everything appeared very clean but there were some individually wrapped wipes as well for extra peace of mind.

It felt more like a proper suite than a junior suite given the available space although it didn‚Äôt have a door between the lounge and bedroom area. The room overlooked the atrium so it was quiet. I have always liked the coffee/mini bar area in this hotel as it‚Äôs easy to access and looks stylish. It‚Äôs always good to have a proper Nespresso machine when you have a 5 am start as I did!

The bed was not too firm for me which I found in some Hilton‚Äôs. However they seem to be all moving to the Hilton bed which I find comfortable. The main things I am looking for in an airport hotel are a comfortable bed a quiet room and a socket next to the bed. The Hilton T4 delivers on all those fronts.

There was both a normal socket and a USB next to the bed on both sides and simple to use light switches. I always want a room where I can control the temperature as I like a cold room to sleep in and there were no problems with this at the Hilton.

Next on the wish list is a decent shower to wake up with or refresh after a long journey.

The bathroom felt very modern and had a large walk-in shower with a raindrop shower or a more traditional one if you preferred. This is the same in the standard rooms as well.

I liked the large vanity unit so you could just dump your washbag on it without unpacking it on a quick stay. Toiletries were plentiful and the standard Hilton Crabtree & Evelyn.

The room itself was a little on the dark side in the evening but the bathroom was well-lit enough which is important. There was even a magnifying mirror for shaving which you don‚Äôt always get in airport hotels.

Here is what a standard room looks like:

It has the same desk bathroom and minibar but when I last visited there was not a Nespresso machine in these rooms.

Food and drink including Executive Lounge substitute

OXBO Caf√©

I ate at the caf√© because the restaurant is only open in the evening. The cafe menu has a good choice of healthy or more naughty treats and feels modern.

The OXBO cafe/bar is very smart and I like the effect of all the greenery.

There‚Äôs a good mix of seating areas whether you just want to grab a drink or go for more of a formal sit-down meal.

I sat at one of the tables since it was very quiet when I was there.

I decided to start with the cauliflower fritters. Fritters seem easy but have eaten enough bad ones but it is the sign of a decent restaurant if they are good!

These were pretty much perfect. The batter was thin and crisp with a nice hint of spice. However you could still taste the cauliflower and it retained just the right amount of firmness. The accompanying tomato chutney added a little hint of sweetness which worked well with the cauliflower.

One of their signature dishes in both the restaurant and the bar is the burger so I thought I had better try it. I really liked the sound of the rarebit topping as something a bit different. Boy was it enormous!

The brown ale rarebit was indeed the dish‚Äôs highlight with the oozing hot cheese smothering both beef patties. I also liked the smoked tomato chutney which offset the rich cheesiness! I had swapped my regular fries for the vegetable version and was pleased to see they were still crisp on the outside.

Restaurants at Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4

OXBO restaurant

This is the fancier dining place at the hotel which overlooks the lake. The booths with the luggage-inspired seats looked fun!

The menu has both the dishes I tried plus a wider selection of more sophisticated choices:

Executive Lounge substitute

As the lounge is closed the Hilton is offering a very generous alternative. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see the options but my friend @flylikelinz supplied these images of the choices. Between 6-8 pm you can order any of the drinks listed plus whatever you fancy from the selected snacks including those great cauliflower fritters!

Breakfast at Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4

I was getting up very early too early for the main breakfast. However they do room service even at very early hours of the morning but with cold food. Room service is delivered in 15-minute slots so it‚Äôs best to be cautious with timings in case it arrives right at the end of the slot. I had just ordered a muffin and yoghurt. The muffin was actually delicious very moist and packed full of pieces of apple.

The Hilton Heathrow T4 now also offers a bespoke Family Experience for travellers below the age of 12. Children enjoy a Kids Welcome and a dedicated Kids Breakfast experience and the Kids Menu. In addition the hotel has kids‚Äô amenities available upon request.

Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 Facilities

Sadly the pool has now been replaced with more meeting space but the gym and changing rooms have been refreshed. There is also a business centre available which is very handy for printing all those documents you now need to travel!

Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 Conclusion

It was quite a while since I had last stayed here and I was pleased to see that not only had the public areas been improved but the rooms were just as good as before. Moreover the addition of the OXBO restaurant and cafe gives a choice of a proper meal or more of a casual drinks and nibbles environment perfect for an airport when you could want either!

Given the great price of the hotel it is one of the most modern and comfortable hotels near T5 (the Hilton T5 is not open for bookings).

HOOVER ‚Äî The woman police say drove through Home Depot in Trussville in August 2020 to steal from the business was arrested in Hoover on additional charges.

Gwendolyn Braswell 43 of Bessemer is now charged with second-degree robbery and first-degree theft.

The charges come after incidents on July 6 and July 7 according to Carol Robinson with al.com.

Braswell is accused of entering the Circle K on John Hawkins Parkway and stealing 80 cartons of cigarettes from the stockroom. The first day she left the store without incident. But on the second day the cashier at the store tried to stop her. When she did police said she brandished a stun gun and left the store with a male accomplice.

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

It‚Äôs been a roller-coaster ride for lumber prices over the last year ‚Äì and it‚Äôs drawn outsize attention from the aisles of Home Depot to the Federal Reserve.

Lumber prices surged to record highs this year on the back of booming demand from homebuilders and do-it-yourselfers with plenty of time on their hands. The price surge was so big and sudden it became a symbol of what some economists feared: rampant inflation.

But over the past two months lumber prices have been dropping equally fast giving weight to the central bank‚Äôs argument that pandemic price spikes for many products are likely to be temporary.

That‚Äôs not the end of the story however. Lumber prices may have fallen but they are still elevated creating new headaches for the critical housing sector. And companies in the lumber industry are wrestling with a new pandemic problem: a shortage of workers.

Here are three things that the rise fall and now volatility of lumber prices tell us about the pandemic economy.

Behind the great rise of lumber prices

The supply shock that sent lumber prices to record levels this year did not come from a shortage of trees: The price of raw timber has barely budged.

Instead the lumber crunch was centered on sawmills which cut round timber into square boards.

‚ÄúYou can think of us as the grain mill in the ecosystem of the timber industry‚Äù says Ross Stock a third-generation sawmill operator who runs Western Cascade Industries in Toledo Ore.

In the early months of the pandemic many sawmills shut down both for health reasons and because they assumed demand for lumber would plummet.

Instead demand took off. Stuck at home Americans in large numbers began adding decks repairing fences and even building treehouses.

Professional homebuilders also got busy as rock-bottom interest rates and a desire for more space pushed demand for housing into high gear.

According to the National Association of Home Builders single-family home construction jumped 12% last year and remodeling activity climbed 7%. Meanwhile domestic sawmill output rose just 3.3%.

As a result lumber prices soared ‚Äî from $349 per thousand board feet in April 2020 to $1514 this May according to the trade journal Fastmarkets Random Lengths.

‚ÄúIt was absolutely an astonishing run‚Äù Stock says.

That run in lumber prices sparked concerns about inflation as prices across a range of goods similarly jumped.

And then there was the great fall ‚Ä¶

Since lumber prices peaked in May however demand has cooled sharply.

With vaccines rolling out and the impact from the pandemic easing do-it-yourselfers have found other ways to spend their weekends.

‚ÄúPeople are stuck at home less. They can go out and travel more. They can go out to restaurants and bars‚Äù says Dustin Jalbert a Fastmarket economist who follows the lumber industry. ‚ÄúIn the home centers like Home Depot Lowe‚Äôs the wood volumes going through there have slowed substantially especially for items like decking and fencing.‚Äù

Professional homebuilders are also tapping the brakes in part because it‚Äôs taking longer to get appliances and doors and other building materials.

Florida homebuilder Chuck Fowke ordered windows for a house he was building in November. They finally arrived six months later.

‚ÄúYou have builders who have building permits that aren‚Äôt starting the houses‚Äù says Fowke who‚Äôs also the chairman of the National Association of Home Builders. ‚ÄúYou have some that poured their slabs and they haven‚Äôt gone any further.‚Äù

In the last two months the composite price index compiled by Random Lengths has tumbled by 50% to $770 per thousand board feet.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sees that drop as a good sign.

‚ÄúPrices like that that have moved up really quickly because of shortages and the bottlenecks and the like they should stop going up and at some point in some cases should actually go down‚Äù Powell told reporters in June. ‚ÄúAnd we did see that in the case of lumber.‚Äù

But for lumber that‚Äôs still not the end of the story

Despite the recent drop in prices lumber still costs about 80% more now than it did before the pandemic ‚Äî a premium that builders say is adding tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a new home.

And the supply of lumber is still not growing very fast.

Sawmill operator Stock says building a new mill would cost tens of millions of dollars. He‚Äôs trying to boost output at his current mill but like other in-demand industries such as restaurants and hotels he‚Äôs now struggling to find workers.

‚ÄúIt takes time to improve a mill. It takes time to develop people‚Äù Stock says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked in sawmills since I was 8 years old. It‚Äôs hard work.‚Äù

Forecasters say lumber prices may have more room to fall. But price volatility creates its own headaches.

‚ÄúThe challenge right now for a builder is if you‚Äôre asked to give someone a price for a home it‚Äôs very difficult‚Äù says Fowke the Florida homebuilder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre used to having prices change every six months or every 12 months. We‚Äôre getting price changes every two weeks.‚Äù

And even if two-by-fours are no longer propping up inflation that doesn‚Äôt mean prices will return to their pre-pandemic wood floor. So lumber may continue to capture headlines as yet another example of a product upended by the unprecedented pandemic.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like the price of gasoline‚Äù says Jalbert the economist. ‚ÄúLumber has been the sort of poster child for these supply shocks that we‚Äôve seen.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyb25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2p1ZGdlLXNldHMtZGVjZW1iZXItdHJpYWwtZGF0ZS1mb3ItcG90dHN0b3duLW1hbi1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWd1bnNob3Qtc2xheWluZy_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZXBvcnRlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMC9qdWRnZS1zZXRzLWRlY2VtYmVyLXRyaWFsLWRhdGUtZm9yLXBvdHRzdG93bi1tYW4tYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1ndW5zaG90LXNsYXlpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge sets December trial date for Pottstown man accused of gunshot slaying,"NORRISTOWN ‚Äì A judge has set a December trial date for a Pottstown man accused of the Easter Sunday 2019 gunshot slaying of another man in the borough.

The jury trial for Stephen Moore 33 of the 400 block of Chestnut Street will begin on Dec. 6 according to an order issued by Montgomery County Judge William R. Carpenter who will preside over the trial. The trial is expected to last five days.

Moore faces charges of first- and third-degree murder and person not to possess a firearm in connection with the alleged 12:26 p.m. April 21 2019 fatal shooting of 25-year-old Joshua Alexander Smith which occurred in the 600 block of Industrial Highway.

The trial date was selected after a conference between the judge and the lawyers in the case and selected to accommodate the availability of the lawyers and witnesses.

‚ÄúThis date is consistent with the business of the court in dealing with the COVID judicial emergency and its aftermath. There shall be no continuance‚Äù Carpenter wrote in the order. ‚ÄúAttorneys are directed to properly notify any necessary witnesses and to have them available to testify when needed.‚Äù

Moore‚Äôs trial originally was scheduled for October 2020. However all jury trials were suspended in the county in March 2020 as a precaution when the coronavirus pandemic surfaced.

With vaccinations now increasing and the COVID-19 positivity rate decreasing in the county judges are beginning to schedule jury trials once again.

If he‚Äôs convicted of first-degree murder an intentional killing Moore faces life imprisonment. A conviction of third-degree murder carries a possible maximum sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison.

Moore will remain in the county jail without bail while awaiting trial.

Assistant District Attorney Lauren Elizabeth Marvel is handling the prosecution. Defense lawyer Carrie L. Allman the chief homicide lawyer in the Montgomery County Office of Public Defender represents Moore.

The investigation began when Pottstown police responded to a reported shooting at the Industrial Highway address and found Smith suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. Smith was transported to Pottstown Hospital Tower Health where he was pronounced dead.

As officers were responding to the homicide scene a Pottstown police officer observed a silver 2015 Jeep traveling at a high rate of speed eastbound on Industrial Highway away from the shooting scene and began following the vehicle which crashed at the intersection of High and Wilson streets according to the criminal complaint filed by county Detective James McGowan who is now retired and Pottstown Detective Sergeant Thomas Leahan.

As police approached the crash the male driver exited the Jeep and fled the scene on foot according to the arrest affidavit. Following the crash detectives recovered a Ruger .38-caliber pistol from the center console of the Jeep and a Taurus 9 mm pistol and two cellphones also were recovered at the scene.

The investigation revealed that Moore and Smith left Smith‚Äôs residence together earlier in the day in the Jeep operated by Moore and owned by Moore‚Äôs wife.

The victim and Moore went together to the Home Depot store in Pottstown and were captured on surveillance video as Moore purchased a screwdriver just minutes before the shooting.

Surveillance video in the area of High and Wilson streets captured the Jeep striking a tree and a male running from the scene. The fleeing man matched the physical appearance of Moore as he was depicted in the Home Depot surveillance video detectives alleged.

During an autopsy a forensic pathologist recovered a fired bullet from Smith‚Äôs body and determined Smith died from gunshots to the head and neck according to a criminal complaint. Ballistics tests determined that the bullet recovered from Smith‚Äôs body was fired from the Ruger .38 caliber gun found in the Jeep according to the arrest affidavit.

Moore was arrested on Dec. 3 2019 inside a residence in the 800 block of North Charlotte Street in Pottstown by the Montgomery County SWAT Western Region.

In the criminal complaint detectives alleged Moore has a previous conviction for aggravated manslaughter in Camden N.J. for which he served time in prison and as a result he is prohibited from possessing a firearm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbGFib3Jub3Rlcy5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy93ZS13YW50LXNlZS1vdXItZmFtaWxpZXMtZnJpdG8tbGF5LXdvcmtlcnMtc3RyaWtlLW92ZXItODQtaG91ci13ZWVrcy1tZWFnZXItcmFpc2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We Want to See Our Families': Frito-Lay Workers Strike Over 84-Hour Weeks Meager Raises,"Frito-Lay workers in Topeka Kansas have been on strike since Monday over low pay and forced overtime.

Some workers have been forced to work 12-hour shifts seven days a week for weeks on end due to short staffing. They want to see that change.

‚ÄúNobody I know loves Frito-Lay enough that they want to live there‚Äù said Monk Drapeaux-Stewart a box drop technician responsible for keeping the plant‚Äôs machines supplied with cardboard. ‚ÄúWe want to go home and see our families. We want to have our weekends off. We want to work the time that we agreed to work‚Äîand hopefully not much more than that.‚Äù

‚ÄòBOTTOM OF THE LADDER‚Äô

The last several contracts have featured lump sum bonuses most years leaving wage rates stagnant for most classifications. Drapeaux-Stewart said he‚Äôs only gotten a 77-cent increase over the last 12 years.

Meanwhile the Topeka area has attracted several new manufacturing facilities and large warehouses over the past 20 years taking advantage of its location smack in the center of the country with access to a number of highway arteries. The Frito-Lay facility which has been around for 50 years now competes for workers with a Mars chocolate facility a Bimbo bread bakery and Home Depot and Target distribution centers as well as a Goodyear tire plant that opened in 1945 (workers there are members of the Steelworkers). A Walmart distribution center is slated to open in September.

‚ÄúBetween all those industries Frito-Lay sits at the bottom of the ladder as far as wage scales‚Äù said Mark Benaka business manager for Bakery Workers (BCTGM) Local 218 which represents workers at Frito-Lay and Bimbo. Other local facilities have offered significant wage increases in recent weeks Benaka said but Frito-Lay continues to offer pennies.

‚ÄúFifteen 20 years ago Frito-Lay had a really good reputation‚Äîall you need is a high school diploma and you‚Äôve got this job with good pay and benefits‚Äù said Drapeaux-Stewart who started working at the facility 16 years ago. ‚ÄúBut slowly all of that has been whittled away.‚Äù

That‚Äôs made it difficult to maintain workers‚Äîand led to the mountains of forced overtime.

‚ÄúConditions are really just deteriorating as each contract rolls by‚Äù said Cheri Renfro an operator in the Geographic Enterprise Solutions department where workers fulfill orders for smaller mom-and-pop shops and gas stations.

Renfro estimated that the company brought in more than 350 employees in the last year‚Äîand lost the same amount. ‚ÄúYou have to wonder as a company why wouldn‚Äôt you question that‚Äîsay ‚ÄòHey what‚Äôs going on?‚Äô‚Äù

CONTRACT VOTED DOWN

Last week workers voted down the latest contract offer from the company which included a 2 percent wage increase this year and a 60-hour-a-week cap on the amount of hours a worker can be forced to work. The wages weren‚Äôt enough and the overtime cap would have meant more senior workers being forced in on weekends workers say.

Other issues fueling workers‚Äô anger include safety a punitive attendance policy and pressure from inexperienced supervisors competing for promotions. ‚ÄúThis storm has been brewing for years‚Äù Renfro wrote in a letter to the Topeka Capital-Journal in which she outlined examples of the plant‚Äôs ‚Äútoxic work environment‚Äù including management keeping the line going after a worker collapsed and died and refusing bereavement leave for a worker whose father passed away during the Covid lockdown since there was no funeral.

In late June Local 218 members voted 353 to 30 to approve a strike.

‚ÄúIn the past people were afraid to go on strike‚Äîyou keep hoping every contract is gonna be better‚Äù said Renfro. ‚ÄúBut as time has gone on the company has proven they are not gonna get better and they are not gonna work with us.‚Äù

SNACK SURGE

Frito-Lay is a division of PepsiCo and has been a major contributor to the company‚Äôs bottom line earning $1.2 billion in profits on $4.2 billion in revenue in the first quarter. Last year the division was responsible for over half of PepsiCo‚Äôs operating profits with profits of $5.3 billion on $18.2 billion in revenue. PepsiCo also owns brands including Mountain Dew Quaker Oats Gatorade Tropicana and Aquafina.

Topeka is one of the largest of Frito-Lay‚Äôs 30 U.S. manufacturing facilities; most are nonunion. The 850 workers there make package and ship nearly every type of Frito-Lay snack: Lays potato chips Tostitos Cheetos Sun Chips Fritos every flavor of Dorito and more. Six hundred are members of Local 218 (Kansas is a right-to-work state).

The plant never slowed down during the pandemic workers said. Instead production increased as people ate at home more and bought more comfort foods like chips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned that when something‚Äôs hitting Americans beneath the belt the two main items that never suffer are snack foods and alcohol‚Äù said Benaka who retired from the plant in 2017 after 37 years.

Workers were at one point given an extra $20 a day to work during the pandemic up to $100 a week‚Äîbut that only lasted a few weeks. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if they were afraid we were gonna get used to the higher wage‚Äù said Renfro.

Production at the plant fluctuates seasonally‚Äîit‚Äôs busier in the summer and around big holidays and the Super Bowl. Workers are used to overtime during those periods. But recently the overtime has become constant. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôve having overtime when we shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äù said Renfro‚Äîand a lot more of it.

‚ÄòI‚ÄôM DONE WITH GIVING EVERYTHING TO FRITO-LAY‚Äô

Renfro said she worked 73 hours during the week leading up the Fourth of July and then worked from 3 a.m. until 3 p.m. on the holiday. ‚ÄúI went to sleep‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even hear the fireworks I was so tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to miss going to so many holidays because I‚Äôm getting forced‚Äù said Renfro. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to call my mom and tell her I couldn‚Äôt make it. I don‚Äôt want to miss those moments anymore. I‚Äôm done with giving everything to Frito-Lay‚Äîmy time my holidays.‚Äù

One of the most hated forms of forced overtime at the plant is being forced to work a ‚Äúsuicide.‚Äù That‚Äôs when the company makes a worker stay four hours on top of their eight-hour shift and then forces them in four hours early before their next shift‚Äîleaving them only eight hours off.

Drapeaux-Stewart said these shifts have become increasingly common especially in departments with the worst understaffing like the warehouse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy that this has become the blue-collar everyday [worker‚Äôs] new normal.‚Äù

EMPTY SCAB BUSES

The company has set up a parking lot a mile from the plant. It‚Äôs running coach buses from the lot every 15 minutes to shuttle in temporary workers and out-of-state scabs.

But strikers suspect that the buses are a ruse. ‚ÄúMost of these buses are completely empty or have one to three people not counting the driver‚Äù said Drapeaux-Stewart. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs psychological warfare‚Äîthey‚Äôre trying to demoralize and dispirit the men and women of the union in the hopes we‚Äôll come groveling back for whatever crumbs they offer us.‚Äù

Benaka said the company also appears to be pulling empty trailers in and out of the facility to intimidate workers. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about folks who‚Äôve worked at this facility 30 or 40 years‚Äîthey know what an empty trailer looks like.‚Äù

Strikers are also monitoring the facility‚Äôs smokestacks to get a sense of the strike‚Äôs impact. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no smoke no steam no nothing no sign of production at all‚Äù said Drapeaux-Stewart.

‚ÄúUsually there‚Äôs always an odor coming out of Frito-Lay but it‚Äôs been smelling really good outside‚Äù said Renfro.

Local supporters have been donating food and water to the picket line. Some local restaurants have said they will stop serving Pepsi products. A local magazine 785 has set up a fund to help strikers pay their water bills.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really amazed at the community support‚Äù said Renfro. ‚ÄúIt makes you proud to be a part of this community.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary but it‚Äôs exciting‚Äù said Drapeaux-Stewart. ‚ÄúI have so much hope for this strike that we will finally get what we‚Äôve needed‚Äîthe guarantee of getting to see our families and earning a living wage to support those families.‚Äù

For more on the strike see the video from the picket line by More Perfect Union."

Others are Royal Foam Products Nigeria (mattress) ENGIE Fenix Nigeria (solar) Flour Mills of Nigeria (grain products) Envoy Hotel (hotel) and Flutterwave Technology Solutions (online payment).

According to the report Echostone‚Äôs application was rejected due to a contract project not allowed under IDITRA; while Benchmark Constrictions did not comply with the documentary requirement for PSI approval.

Latin America Hotel Investors Gain Interest in International Brands

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

""In the region there's a lot of small independent owner-operators that have their own brands with 30 or 35 hotels. They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

In an exclusive virtual fireside chat with Hotel News Now Smith said some of the feedback he's heard is that the company isn't using its scale to its full advantage.

""We've got to think like a small third-party management company and less like a large company"" he said. ""In other words we use our scale for things that are important to us but our [thinking] has to be like almost a small company that's really dedicated to each owner and each hotel.""

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Katie Canales/Insider



Online shopping surged during the pandemic and it made me realize the value of printers.

Some sites don't make it easy to return things and many stores stopped accepting in-person returns.

I bought one off Amazon and I wish I'd done it sooner.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

I never thought I'd own a printer. Then the pandemic hit.

In my mind it was a dusty household staple that my parents owned when I was a kid. As a 20-something living in the digital age what need did I have for physical copies of anything?

But after a year shut inside my apartment which followed years of already slowly growing addicted to shopping online I got fed up. The friction involved in returning something I ordered online was too much ‚Äì especially when some stores stopped accepting in-person returns for digital orders.

How many times have you lazily put off printing a return label only for the window to close leaving you with something that doesn't fit and your wasted money in the retailer's pockets? Be honest.

So I pulled the plug and I bought a $70 HP DeskJet from Amazon which came with ink cartridges and a package of copy paper.

It's made me feel like I can rule the world or at least lets me more easily get my money back on something I don't want.

6 out of 8 colleagues told me they didn't have a printer

I know I'm not the only one with a pile of online orders sitting in the corner‚Ä¶

Katie Canales/Insider



As a quick test I asked my teammates on Slack if they owned a printer. Six people said they didn't and two people said they did.

Obviously owning a printer isn't a novelty ‚Äì plenty of people do. In 2019 62% of American households had one in fact according to Deloitte.

But I'm likely not the only one who was driven to buy one during the pandemic when stores and offices closed and people flocked in droves to shopping online.

As Bloomberg's Tara Lachapelle noted in a mid-2020 column about a printer comeback the surge in online shopping ""brought with it the inconvenience of needing to make returns and print shipping labels. That's something office workers may have tended to do ‚Äì shh! for I must whisper this part ‚Äì at the office.""

Deloitte estimated that the home printer market would surge 15% in 2020 to $29 billion. I took a bite out of that market last month when I bought my printer.

I can print labels from my iPhone. It's so easy.

Easy peezy.

Katie Canales/Insider



My HP DeskJet is Bluetooth-enabled meaning I can print things wirelessly from my iPhone. The HP Smart app helped me easily set everything up and showed me how to insert the ink cartridges.







I buy most things on the internet: shoes clothes skincare products. And since I moved recently I'm also buying bath mats shower curtains sheets and other household items. Not everything looks good or turns out to be what I wanted.

Take for example a blue-green shower curtain I bought from Bed Bath and Beyond. It didn't make the cut so I downloaded the return label on my iPhone and selected HP Smart as my printing option.

Then with my handy dandy packaging tape dispenser in hand I attached the label to the package and taped it shut.

Don't judge my taping job‚Ä¶

Katie Canales/Insider



I stack the packages by the door and run them to UPS FedEx or USPS whenever I'm headed out.

It's worth noting that some retailers won't make you return items but will still give you your refund ‚Äì Amazon has done this to me a couple of times in the past. And also some ‚Äì including Amazon ‚Äì won't require you to print a return label. They'll simply ask you to take it to a carrier that will handle that for you (though sometimes for a fee).

But some retailers won't let you return certain items in-store only online.

So at the end of the day it's nice to have the printer in the apartment where I can print the label and affix it to the package in one go.

The nostalgia doesn't hurt either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvaW5maW5pdGFzLWh5YnJpZC1jaGFyZ2VyLWhlbHBzLWJtdy1zNTUtZW5naW5lLWRldmVsb3AtOTg2LWhwLTE2NTA5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Infinitas Hybrid Charger Helps BMW S55 Engine Develop 986 HP,The S55 however still is relevant because of the aftermarket scene. From software calibrations to beefier internals there are too many options to list here. The latest of the lot comes in the guise of the Hybrid Charger from Infinitas  a German company from Gachenbach that promises up to 1000 PS (986 horsepower) and a staggering 1100 Nm (811 pound-feet) of torque.SK3RR is the name of the range-topping variant of the Hybrid Charger which doesn't have a price tag at the present moment. The base option is ‚Ç¨6998 or $8310 at current exchange rates plus ‚Ç¨2112 ($2510) for installation including the value-added tax. The lowest configuration is nothing to scoff at either thanks to 600 PS (592 hp) and better still it‚Äôs also the only Hybrid Charger currently available for registration with a T√úV report in Germany.In regard to how it actually works the Infinitas Hybrid Charger can be summed up as an additional compressor that pre-compresses the air for the turbochargers. Pre-charging presents multiple advantages over the bone-stock S55 including reduced boost time better response and higher boost pressure. The next level up from the base SK1 is the SK2 which develops 700 PS (690 hp) and 900 Nm (664 pound-feet) of torque. The SK2CS and SK3 flaunt 800 and 900 metric ponies (make that 789 and 888 horsepower).As you would expect from 3.0 liters of displacement and six cylinders in a line Infinitas recommends upgraded internals from the SK2CS upward. Obviously enough the F87 M2 coupe is also compatible with the Hybrid Charger.Speaking of which have you seen the leaked front bumper of the G87 M2?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJzY29vcHMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvc3RlbGxhbnRpcy1kZXRhaWxzLWl0cy1mb3VyLW5ldy1ldi1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtaGludHMtYXQtaGlnaC1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1tb2RlbC10aGF0LWNhbi1oaXQtNjItbXBoLWluLTItc2Vjb25kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stellantis Details Its Four New EV Platforms Hints At High-Performance Model That Can Hit 62 MPH In 2 Seconds,"Stellantis‚Äô EV Day was packed with flashy teasers but the more important news is the four newly announced platforms that will serve as the backbone of the company‚Äôs future.

With that in mind we‚Äôre taking a closer look at the architectures and their initial specifications.

Kicking things off is the STLA Small platform which will underpin the company‚Äôs small vehicles. The automaker didn‚Äôt go into specifics but a chart suggested models based on the architecture will roughly measure between 137.8 ‚Äì 165.4 inches (3500 ‚Äì 4200 mm) long.

These models are slated to have 37-82 kWh battery packs which promise to provide a range of up to 300 miles (500 km). They will also have 400V technology as well as an electric motor developing 94 hp (70 kW / 95 PS). However some STLA Small models will have upgraded motors that produce between 168 hp (125 kW / 170 PS) and 241 hp (180 kW / 245 PS).

Moving on the STLA Medium platform will underpin premium vehicles that roughly measure between 165.4 ‚Äì 196.9 inches (4200 ‚Äì 5000 mm) long. They‚Äôll have 87-104 kWh battery packs which deliver up to 440 miles (700 km) of range.

The majority of these models will have an electric motor that develops between 168 hp (125 kW / 170 PS) and 241 hp (180 kW / 245 PS). However some will have motors with outputs ranging from 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS) to 443 hp (330 kW / 449 PS).

One step up is the STLA Large platform which will underpin all-wheel drive performance vehicles as well as American muscle cars. They‚Äôll measure around 189 ‚Äì 216.5 inches (4800 mm ‚Äì 5500 mm) long and have 101-118 kWh battery packs which allow for ranges of up to 500 miles (800 km).

Some STLA Large vehicles will use electric motors with outputs ranging from 168 hp (125 kW / 170 PS) to 241 hp (180 kW / 245 PS). However the majority will have motors that crank out between 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS) and 443 hp (330 kW / 449 PS).

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning there will be all-wheel drive variants so we could potentially see combined outputs as high as 885 hp (660 kW / 897 PS) for dual motor setups. The company alluded to this as they noted their upcoming EVs will be able to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in as little as two seconds. That‚Äôs quicker than the 840 hp (626 kW / 851 PS) Dodge Challenger SRT Demon which took 2.3 seconds to hit 60 mph (96 km/h).

Lastly the STLA Frame is a body-on-frame platform designed for full-size trucks and SUVs such as Ram‚Äôs F-150 Lightning competitor. It will underpin vehicles measuring around 220.5 ‚Äì 244.1 inches (5600 ‚Äì 6200 mm) in length and have 159-200+ kWh battery packs providing a range of up to 500 miles (800 km).

These vehicles will offer 400V and 800V technology as well as electric motors with outputs ranging from 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS) to 443 hp (330 kW / 449 PS). All-wheel drive variants are a given and that means they too could have combined outputs of up to 885 hp (660 kW / 897 PS).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZXIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWdyZWF0LXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Great Semiconductor Shortage | AIER,"Silicon is the crude oil of the Digital Age. About eight million metric tons are mined every year in China Russia Norway the US and elsewhere some of which is used in the $500 billion global market for semiconductors. In turn the manufactured silicon chips wafers and integrated circuits power tens of trillions of dollars worth of hardware running personal and business software wired and wireless communication devices consumer electronics automotive components industrial technology and other critical processes worldwide.

Manufacturing semiconductors involves not only a network of highly specialized firms in an often multistage production process but a dependence upon firms which produce the ultra-high precision equipment for the fabrication procedure. Thus while silicon is a metalloid and accordingly a commodity the various chips employing it describe a spectrum of complexity that runs from basic microcontrollers to high performance processors: each of which rarely has substitutes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not rocket science‚Äîit‚Äôs much more difficult‚Äù goes one of the industry‚Äôs inside jokes‚Ä¶Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories dust-free rooms multi-million-dollar machines molten tin and lasers. The end goal is to transform wafers of silicon‚Äîan element extracted from plain sand‚Äîinto a network of billions of tiny switches called transistors that form the basis of the circuitry that will eventually give a phone computer car washing machine or satellite crucial capabilities.

Beginning in 2020 and accelerating into 2021 a chip shortage has to various extents plagued the estimated 169 industries which depend upon them. While a small number of firms stockpiled chips in anticipation of just such an occurrence the overwhelming majority of firms for which semiconductors are a key factor input have had to reduce their output. But like so much else the inadequate supply of semiconductors is at the center of a handful of causes with policy blunders front and center among them.

Neo-Mercantilist Beginnings

Two major policy actions of the Trump Administration laid the initial groundwork for the present paucity of chips. The first came in 2018 when

the United States imposed 25% tariffs on semiconductors imported from China. A core issue involved allegations that unfair trade practices by China hurt a variety of US-headquartered companies including in the semiconductor industry. Tit-for-tat government actions resulted in new tariffs covering over $450 billion or more than half of bilateral trade between the two countries by the end of 2019[.]

That led to a 12% decline in global semiconductor revenue between 2018 and 2019. But shortly thereafter a second and

arguably more economically destructive line of conflict for the industry began in 2019 with a series of US export controls targeting the global semiconductor supply chain. Initially US policy was motivated by national security concerns. Limiting US semiconductor sales was aimed at keeping Huawei‚Äìa Chinese‚Ä¶Fortune global 500 company whose 5G equipment the US government viewed as threatening critical network infrastructure‚Äìfrom accessing inputs it needed to manufacture base stations. The initial US export controls didn‚Äôt work: Huawei purchased semiconductors from companies in Taiwan and South Korea instead. The United States responded with new export controls and threatened to cut off the niche equipment and software provided by smaller American firms to those foreign companies if [they] did not stop selling to Huawei.

As lockdowns and indoor occupancy limits were imposed with the spread of Covid-19 many semiconductor manufacturing facilities came to be operated with skeleton crews at lower capacity. The already tariff-slowed pace of chip production began to decline more precipitously.

The Stimulative Factor

Only a few weeks into the widespread imposition of pandemic policies (lockdowns stay-at-home orders social distancing requirements compulsory masking and so on) the first stimulus checks were received by an estimated 162 million bank accounts which contributed some portion of the total $271 billion to a consumptive binge. Several additional stimulus payments have been made since then and on top of that the American Rescue Plan extended Federal unemployment bonuses through September 6th 2021. Furthermore under the Child Tax Credit revisions the

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will pay out $3600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Starting July 15 monthly payments will be issued through December of 2021 with the remainder to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit will not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. In other words qualifying families will receive the full amount regardless of how much ‚Äî or little ‚Äî they owe in taxes. Payments will start to phase out beyond a $75000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021 though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025.

Aside from the incredible folly of government policies which severely restrict the supply of demanded foreign goods via tariffs and shortly thereafter inundate under- and unemployed consumers with disposable income fiscal redistribution has broadly and undeniably played a major role in exacerbating the shortages observed over the past sixteen months.

The Remote Access Crunch

As early as January 2020 a mass exodus of employees from offices to work-from-home status began and with it a leap in demand for laptops and other business technology. Schools additionally closed nationwide requiring many parents to acquire or upgrade home computers. A Harvard Business School study found that nearly 80% of large companies and 45% of small companies shifted to some measure of remote work last year with 93% of households containing school-age kids involved in some form of remote learning. Another portion of the increase in demand owed to efforts to cope with boredom: semiconductor-driven smart televisions with digital streaming capacity tablets phones and other entertainment technologies.

Over 302 million computers were purchased in 2020: a 13% increase over 2019 and the most since 2014. But there was a snag: the burst of demand struck not as it typically does‚Äìthroughout the year with anticipated increases in the late summer (with the start of the academic year) and after Thanksgiving (for holiday gifts)‚Äìbut during March and April. And owing to this rush the chip shortage began to worsen with consumer goods prices rising. ‚ÄúA webcam that normally costs $50-$60 is now around $100 and a dock that should be about $180 is $320 on Amazon Prime‚Äù with many items rapidly going out of stock as NBC News reported in April 2020.

In several jurisdictions the sudden and profound spike in tech prices led to accusations of illegal price gouging. None however led to government legal action (charges or confiscation) as laptops tablets and other such products are not categorized as essential to helping check the spread of Covid-19. (Masks hand sanitizer disinfectants and the like are subject to gouging penalties under the Defense Production Act of 1950 invoked by the Trump Administration on 18 March 2020.)

Game consoles such as Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox and the Sony PS5 (Playstation 5) began disappearing from store shelves and online retailer inventories as well. Already popular gifts the prospects of longer lockdown periods (‚Äòjust two weeks‚Äô ad infinitum) made gaming systems particularly desirable goods. By Thanksgiving 2020 console prices were skyrocketing with PS5s listed on certain auction sites for up to $2000: several times the manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price.

Automotive Production & Sales

By mid-spring 2020 the full implications of the effect that shutdowns stay-at-home orders social distancing and the like would have on many businesses became starkly apparent. As car dealerships reported cancelled appointments and entire days without a single walk-on auto manufacturers began to cancel orders for new inventory. As expected sales of new cars plummeted initially. But within several weeks abetted by the introduction of 0% financing deals and a host of other incentives plus being awash in stimulus funds demand for new vehicles exploded. Both lot supply and production were caught flat-footed.

US Auto Sales Total Annualized SAAR (2010 ‚Äì present)

Dealer lots quickly emptied of the supply of the most desirable makes and models of autos. Yet in many cases they failed to refill as many vehicles in mid-production couldn‚Äôt be completed for want of chips to run battery management driving assistance connectivity and numerous other functions pivotal to the automotive advances of the past twenty years. A profound representation of the production shortfall is seen in Ford‚Äôs massive stockpile of vehicles awaiting semiconductors at the Kentucky Speedway. The thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of vehicles amassed there waiting for silicon chips is allegedly visible from space.

Toyota which owing to prescience or luck stockpiled semiconductor chips in advance was able to produce and sell enough cars to soak up some of the sudden demand. It beat GM as the number one seller of cars in the US for the first time ever in the second quarter of 2021. Ford reported a 27% fall in June new vehicle sales from one year ago (2020 to 2021) and analysts have predicted that a currently estimated 477000 planned but unproduced cars could number 1.1 million by the end of 2021.

As new cars disappeared from lots and weren‚Äôt replaced the prices of used cars jumped. The May 2021 CPI indicates that used car prices have increased by roughly 30% on a year-over-year basis.

Fire and Water

In July 2020 the first of a number of ‚Äòelemental‚Äô intrigues further hurled wrenches into the gearworks of global semiconductor supply chains: a fire broke out at a Nittobo plant in Fukushima Japan. With a pivotal role in producing fiberglass for printed circuit boards (PCBs) the damage from both fire and flame suppression caused output from that facility to fall by at least 20%. Three months later and eight hundred miles south of that another fire erupted at the Nobeoka City Asahi Kasei Microdevices (AKM) semiconductor factory. After raging for three days analysts described the conflagration as ‚Äúcreat[ing] supply chain interruptions for many end products[.]‚Äù

And in March of 2021 a conflagration at the Renesas Electronics building in Hitachinaka Japan completely destroyed 17 chip manufacturing machines and the location‚Äôs ‚Äúclean room.‚Äù The total damage at the time was estimated to take up to six months to recover from.

Meanwhile the uncommonly tranquil summer and fall of 2020 in the Pacific and Phillppine Sea which typically features three or four typhoons annually led to a drought in Taiwan. By some accounts this is the nation‚Äôs worst drought since 1964. And this might not arouse much concern except that Taiwan is the world‚Äôs foremost semiconductor foundry market and manufacturing chips is a particularly water-intensive procedure.

Taiwan‚Äôs leading semiconductor producer and the world‚Äôs largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (TSMC)‚Ä¶uses more than 150000 tons of water per day [volumes] approximating 80 standard swimming pools‚Ä¶Due to the drought TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers have been depending on water trucks to maintain production. It is estimated that TSMC will spend over 23.69 Euro [around $28M] on the water trucks this year exceeding its original budget planning. Global supply has been affected since‚Ä¶[and] microchips are likely to become rarer and rarer.

The impact of the water shortage has (as does much today) led to opportunistic demagoguery. These include assertions that the unsung agent of Taiwan‚Äôs chip manufacturing problems is climate change and calls for firms which depend heavily upon Taiwanese foundries (including Apple Qualcomm and Nvidia) to diversify their sources of supply.

As It Stands

Thumbing its nose at the Ricardian notion of comparative advantage in July 2020

the United States Senate approved the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which contains an amendment passed earlier this week with little floor debate and by a 96-4 margin that would provide billions of dollars in new federal support for the U.S. semiconductor industry most notably tax credits and grants for the construction of new domestic manufacturing facilities. The House passed a similar bill with a similar amendment earlier this week so the legislation now goes to conference where the subsidies are expected to survive.

The purpose of the jingo-ensconced CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America) Act is to ‚Äú[e]nsure [US] leadership in the future design manufacturing and assembly of cutting edge semiconductors‚Ä¶[a]s the Chinese Communist Party aims to dominate the entire semiconductor supply chain.‚Äù In May 2021 Congress was debating the form that such aid should take and in June 2021 some decisions were reached.

Interventionism has for time immemorial generated unintended consequences. Nevertheless it is likely that social distancing and capacity restrictions in the early phases of the pandemic would have led to decreased semiconductor chip output anyway. But with respect to national security concerns the age-old question regarding whether markets or government bureaucracies best accomplish such goals should be the initial conversation.

With respect to the silicon facet of the US-China trade war the Peterson Institute for International Economics asks rhetorically:

Would a more rational US strategy have been to keep China ‚Äòdependent‚Äô on American semiconductors? Suppose US firms had been permitted to sell all except the most sophisticated chips but the US government maintained its restrictions on sales to China of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and EDA [Electronic Design Automation] software. US semiconductor firms at least could have maintained the revenue and profits to continue to finance their own R&D without the need for federal subsidies. Without the foreign inputs Chinese manufacturers would have been unable to upgrade to the smaller and faster chips at the technological frontier than many using industries demand.

From the consumer‚Äôs perspective elevated tech prices due to ongoing shortages endure in many areas and will linger for some months. As has been reported in technology business and trade publications the price effects of the chip shortage are now beginning to manifest more broadly in personal computers. As of late June 2021

prices of popular models of some laptop consumers have crept up over the past two months among other electronics becoming expensive at retailers. A laptop geared toward videogamers‚Äìmade by Taiwanese manufacturer ASUSTek Computer Inc.‚Äìthat Amazon lists as its bestseller rose from $900 to $950 this month according to Keepa a site that tracks prices. The cost of a popular HP Inc. Chromebook rose to $250 from $220 at the beginning of June. HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and printer prices by more than 20% in a year.

Although one major retailer reported raising prices of goods with semiconductor-related components by 15% thus far in 2021 an executive commented ‚Äú[c]ertain components now cost as much as 40% more.‚Äù That even toasters now contain silicon chips is beginning to dawn on purchasers in some part due to sticker shock.

Back in the automobile markets profoundly unusual price aberrations have materialized. Recently the received wisdom that a new car immediately and irretrievably loses a chunk of its value when its rear tires leave the lot has been overthrown ‚Äì at least temporarily. Why?

[S]ome used cars and trucks are worth even more than they cost when they were new. What makes your Jeep Wrangler Subaru Ascent or Honda Civic worth more than it was when it was brand new a year ago is the simple fact that it exists. It is a car that has already been built at a time when there is enormous demand for cars and SUVs and not enough inventory to meet that demand [d]ue to disruptions in supplies of crucial computer chips.

Where traditionally a used car is priced on average 11% less than a comparable new car that average has now narrowed to about 3%. And in several cases used car prices eclipse those of new cars. As of last month a Kia Telluride sells for over 8% higher used than new. So too do GMC Sierras (over 6%) Toyota Tacomas (over 5%) and the Mercedes Benz G-Class (over 4%).

Other discomposing factors are lurking on the periphery threatening to compound existing semiconductor insufficiencies. Owing to the so-called Delta variant of Covid-19 lockdowns at several major Chinese shipping facilities (Shenzhen the third largest in the world and Guangzhou the fifth largest in the world) have resulted in waiting times for cargo ships to soar from twelve hours to sixteen days.

A highly technical discussion of how the dearth of chips may abate can be found here.

Inconclusive Conclusions

After carbon nitrogen oxygen and a handful of other elements upon which life itself is built silicon has been a particularly impactful element in human innovation. Tremendous bounds in productivity driven by incremental improvements in technology have driven inexorably higher levels of prosperity. In exquisitely engineered configurations it has made once inconceivable bounds in computation data analysis and management information transfer and a wide panoply of other advances not only possible but quotidian. Indeed it is sinfully easy to overlook the incredible union of physics engineering and economics that semiconductors contemplate and conflate their ubiquity with simplicity.

Early in 2020 predicting that the spread of a respiratory virus would lead to a scarcity of inputs that constitute the very backbone of all modern technology would have sounded ludicrous. But amid a hotchpotch of non-pharmaceutical state interventions geopolitical wrangling income redistribution sudden shifts in work patterns and the knock-on effects of those that has occurred and persists.

No one and certainly not I can accurately forecast when where or how the current array of price distortions and shortages will normalize. An appreciation of the sophistication of modern commerce requires recognizing the ease with which the commonplace can be derailed by seemingly innocuous policies. And relatedly the tendency for secondary and tertiary effects of political miscalculation to unexpectedly bubble up in odd corners and folds of the economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtMjAyMS1mb3JkLWYtMTUwLWJsYWNrLW9wcy1jb21lcy13aXRoLWJvZHktYXJtb3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 2021 Ford F-150 Black Ops Comes With Body Armor,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtMjAyMS1mb3JkLWYtMTUwLWJsYWNrLW9wcy1jb21lcy13aXRoLWJvZHktYXJtb3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Canada's Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes will leave their final event before the Tokyo Games with hard-fought bronze medals on the Beach Volleyball World Tour.

The reigning world champions defeated Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka of Latvia 21-13 13-21 17-15 in the third-place match on Sunday in Gstaad Switzerland. Pavan and Humana-Paredes won the event in 2018.

The teams traded lopsided set victories with the Canadians taking the opener before the Latvians rallied in the second to force a third and deciding set.

Canada and Latvia traded the lead in that final set before Pavan converted their third match point off a huge block.

Earlier in the day Pavan and Humana-Paredes had their eight-set win streak snapped in the semifinals by Brazilian duo Agatha Bednarczuk and Eduarda Santos ""Duda"" Lisboa.

The Brazilians took a 21-13 21-18 straight-sets victory for a spot in the gold-medal match which they won against compatriots Ana Patricia Sila Ramos and Rebecca Cavalcanti Barbosa Silva 23-21 21-18.

Humana-Paredes said the results in Gstaad will help them when they arrive in Tokyo at the Olympic Games which officially open July 23.

""This journey is not perfect and what I think is really important is that we grind together and we fight through those difficult moments she said. ""Perfection is impossible and if we can stay together and fight for every single point we will be successful.""

Wean Park which sits between Covelli Centre and the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre is the final piece of the transformation of the downtown riverfront which once was about as scuzzy as it gets. It was finished in 2018 but didn‚Äôt take shape until 2019.

Then came the pandemic which wiped out all of last year and the first half of this year.

So Wean Park is in its infancy. And it‚Äôs no ordinary park. It‚Äôs owned by the city. But like Covelli and The Amp it‚Äôs operated and managed by JAC Management.

Think of it as not so much a park as a venue for events staged by JAC or outside promoters.

JAC Management is exploring all options to see what works and how to proceed. For example there was a wedding at the privatized park a couple of weeks ago.

In the meantime Derrick McDowell the city‚Äôs community events liaison is working with local organizations who use the park for their own events. That includes the paved area underneath the Market Street Bridge known as Huntington Bank Community Alley.

But the first real event the shakedown cruise will be the Summer Festival of the Arts. The weekend-long cultural event that had been taking place on the campus of Youngstown State University for a few decades is moving to Wean this year. It will take place July 17 and 18.

The move was prompted by the university‚Äôs desire to embrace the community and it also gives the festival room to grow. JAC Management is partnering with YSU in staging the festival which typically draws up to 15000 people over its two days.

YSU‚Äôs Lori Factor has been the director of the Summer Festival of the Arts for years and still is. She‚Äôs tasked with picking up the event and moving it. She is working with JAC toward that end.

There are challenges at every location Factor says especially when it‚Äôs a new venue.

A festival requires electricity water toilets parking security and other logistics that few people even think about.

Those have been taken care of and the new layout of the festival has been determined.

The 70 or so artist booths will follow the paved paths through the park. The food vendors will be at Huntington Bank Community Alley because that‚Äôs where the connections to electricity and water are. The two performance stages will also be near Community Alley.

Picnic tables will be set up throughout the park where visitors can rest or eat.

There will be no need to bring in portable potties because the bathrooms at The Amp and Covelli Centre will be used.

Parking will be free and plentiful in the big lot behind Covelli Centre. There is also parking all over the downtown area.

Artists will load-in their booths and artwork from the Covelli lot where a fleet of golf carts manned by volunteers will help them.

Security will be hired to stand guard all weekend.

That‚Äôs the nuts and bolts. The other half of the equation is educating the public about the new location and also getting the artists and vendors up to speed on loading protocols.

The leafy and well-manicured YSU campus was an excellent place for an art festival. Centered on the campus quad it was compact and had a relaxed hustle-bustle to it.

Wean Park has different benefits. The spacious 20-acre green space is flat and wide open. It also is an equally impressive location separated from the city but using its skyline as a backdrop.

And the big ‚ÄúYoungstown‚Äù sculpture which is about 20 feet long is a natural for tourist-y photos.

During the festival weekend the much-anticipated George Shuba-Jackie Robinson statue area will also be open.

This year‚Äôs festival will be a bridge year for some participants who are rebuilding their brands after being forced to take a year off.

Joining the cultural groups in setting up booths at the festival will be the Youngstown Our Lady of Mount Carmel Festival and the Simply Slavic Festival. Both events had to cancel this year for the second year in a row. Their presence will at least keep them on people‚Äôs mind.

Running concurrently with Summer Festival of the Arts will again be the St. Nicholas Greekfest on Walnut Street near Choffin Career Center. All of the museums in the campus area ‚Äì The Butler The Arms and the Steel Museum ‚Äì will be open that weekend and remain just a short walk away.

Looking into the future what else will be coming to Wean Park?

It‚Äôs unlikely that the Greater Youngstown Italian Fest will move there. It takes place on downtown streets and have no plans to move ‚Äì and rightfully so. It is a street festival and the urban atmosphere is part of its charm. Simply Slavic another downtown street fest is taking a wait and see stance.

But JAC Management is looking at other events that would be a good fit for Wean Park.

Ken Bigley vice president of JAC says ideas being explored include a food truck festival or a ribs festival. Nontraditional sporting events could even be part of the mix. It‚Äôs a unique space that deserves a chance to grow into its potential he says.

Founded by a research team from IBM in January 2020 Lumiphase now has a foundry processing wafers on its behalf and three customers according to co-founder and co-CEO Lukas Czornomaz. Czornomaz declined to name either the customers or the foundry but said the technology represents a superior approach to silicon-based photonics with applications in optical communications and solid-state lidar.

When asked when whether the company was in production on 200mm- or 300mm-diameter wafers Czornomaz said the BTO processing was compatible with both wafer sizes.

In bulk BTO is a high value dielectric and piezoelectric material and it was a team at IBM looking at high-k materials for semiconductor gates that started the research path because in sufficiently thin films it can be used to perform electro-optic modulation.

Lumiphase has developed processes to include BTO modulators within silicon or silicon nitride waveguides allowing the construction of Mach-Zhender interferometer and other optical processing devices. The electro-optical effect is 10x greater in BTO than it is in silicon the company asserts. A lot of the company‚Äôs value comes in its ability to smoothly integrate BTO with silicon waveguides and control the crystal orientation with relation to the optical path and the electric field direction.

Traditionally some electro-optical conversion is done using germanium and or compound semiconductor materials because silicon is not a natural emitter of light or the most efficient detector. However the use of BTO brings multiple advantages including lower voltage operation beyond 70GHz and 10x lower optical loss and 1000x lower static power consumption.

Czornomaz explained the static power consumption is because silicon photonics chips traditionally require a lot of active tuning circuitry to compensate for variation in manufacturing temperature of operation and aging. In some applications this is done with hundreds or thousands of on-chip heaters that consume tens of milliwatts of power each. Only certain applications require hundreds or thousands such as AR/VR or LiDAR optical communication applications require tens of them Czornomaz added.

Because of the way BTO modulates the optical signal such tuning while still required does not consume static power Czornomaz said.

The technology also works across the optical spectrum at 1550nm 1310nm and 1600nm wavelengths.

Next: Business model

The company is working towards a product business model where it will provide silicon photonics chips allowing its customers to make optical modules for telecommunications and data communications applications.

The company has 15 staff and raised a seed round of funding soon after its formation with IBM providing a license to use the technology. ‚ÄúIBM is a partner but not a shareholder‚Äù said Czornomaz. A Series A round of funding is planned for later in 2021 or early 2022. This should enable first product releases to come in 2023 Czornomaz said.

In 2020 Windows had almost 83% market share by unit shipments while Google Chrome OS had 10% and Apple's Mac OS had 7% according to research firm Gartner.

From its iconic Start button to its startup sounds as well as support for corporate software and video games Windows changed the way we use computers. Windows 95 helped propel the company to dominate the market in personal computing. Microsoft has introduced many versions of Windows since its inception with some more well received than others. It's competed with IBM  Apple  and Google for market share. According to Microsoft there are more than 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10 worldwide on a monthly basis.

Today Windows only makes up 14% of Microsoft's total revenue but remains a critical part of the business. The company just announced the latest version Windows 11.

The $399 Intel Core i7-11700K processor slots into Intel's Rocket Lake product stack at a price point that squeezes between two of AMD's most popular Ryzen 5000 processors. The 11700K's pricing should make it an attractive chip if you want the most performance from a mainstream Intel platform that you can get without paying the flagship price but it faces stiff competition from the AMD chips that have dominated our list of Best CPUs (at least when they're available at retail).



Cypress Cove Intel's first new architecture for desktop PC chips in six years grants the Rocket Lake chips a 19% increase in IPC in most workloads. But the backported Cypress Cove (which was designed for 10nm) comes with a big tradeoff: Rocket Lake is still etched on the 14nm process and tops out at eight cores and sixteen threads. That's a step back from the previous-gen 10-core Comet Lake i9 models and pales in comparison to AMD's beastly 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X flagship.



Rocket Lake's 19% IPC gain largely offsets the performance hit from the reduced core count but it left Intel in a tough spot as it carved its product stack into Core i9 and Core i7 families ‚Äî both series top out at the same eight cores.



The $399 Core i7-11700K fits the definition of being a lower-end Core i9-11900K with the same eight cores and sixteen threads as the $539 flagship. And you could also save some cash by opting for the graphics-less Core i7-11700KF (it's identical in every other aspect) and score the chip for $374. That opens up a $75 gap between the 11700K and the Ryzen 7 5800X which also doesn't come with an integrated graphics engine.



To account for the vagaries of binning and to hamstring the 11700K to create artificial segmentation Intel dropped the 11700K's peak boost frequency by 300 MHz compared to the Core i9-11900K reduced the memory frequencies in low-latency mode and dropped its support for the new Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT). The ABT tech is effectively an auto-overclocking feature that doesn't void your warranty but the 11700K is a fully overclockable chip. That means that losing that feature or the extra 300 MHz of peak boost speed might not dissuade CPU overclockers looking to save $140 over the 11900K.

The 11700K drops into a gaping hole in AMD's product stack ‚Äî AMD has a $150 gap between the $449 Ryzen 7 5800X which also comes with eight cores and the $299 six-core Ryzen 5 5600X. The obvious pricing gap in AMD's stack should give the 11700K some breathing room for now though AMD says that its upcoming Ryzen 5000 G-series chips otherwise known as the 'Cezanne' APUs will plug that pricing gap when the $359 Ryzen 5 5700G comes to market in August 2021.



However the 5700G appears to target the downstream Core i7-11700 instead of the K series model giving the 11700K the opportunity to thrive as a less-expensive 11900K and/or Ryzen 7 5800X alternative. It just so happens that Intel's own strict segmentation impacts the 11700K's performance significantly reducing its appeal.



Lately though the winning chip is the chip that you can actually buy. As such the Core i7-11700K has benefited from one almost insurmountable advantage ‚Äî availability. AMD has been hamstrung by supply shortages spurred by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions coupled with unprecedented demand leading to price gouging on nearly its entire stack.



Supply is improving for AMD though and the Ryzen 7 5800X has been broadly available at or near its MSRP for roughly the past month. And supplies seem to be holding steady setting up a pitched battle with the Core i7-11700K.

Intel Core i7-11700K Specifications and Pricing

We've covered the Rocket Lake family in-depth in our launch-day review so head there for finer-grained details of the architecture and broader product family. Intel spreads the Rocket Lake (RKL-S) chips across the familiar Core i9 i7 and i5 families but Comet Lake Refresh (CML-R) chips step in for Core i3 and Pentium. Those chips feature the same architecture as other Comet Lake chips but come with slightly increased clock speeds. You can learn more about them here.



Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost many with both single- and multi-core ratios that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. You can find more information on Rocket Lake's boost tech and a more expansive listing of all the frequencies here.

The Core i7-11700K uses the same eight-core 16-thread silicon as the Core i9-11900K but there are a few key differentiators. The 11700K has a lower binning that results in lower peak clock frequencies of 5.0 GHz a 300 MHz reduction compared to the 11900K lower peak memory frequencies in low-latency Gear 1 mode (more on that shortly) and culled Thermal Boost Velocity (TVB) and Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) support. Here's a closer look at the disabled boost tech:

Single-Core Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB): Fastest active favored core can boost higher than Turbo Boost Max 3.0 if below a pre-defined temperature threshold (70C) and all other factors adhere to TB 3.0 conditions.

All-Core Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB): Increases all-core frequency when all cores are active and the chip is under 70C.

Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT): Allows dynamic adjustment of all-core turbo frequencies when four or more cores are active. This feature doesn't have a guaranteed boost threshold ‚Äî it will vary based on chip quality your cooler and power delivery.

TVB frequencies only activate if the processor is under a certain temperature limit but most motherboard makers ignore those limits. That means a chip with the tech will likely operate at the faster speeds regardless of chip temperature at least on higher-end motherboards. That also means that culling the feature from the 11700K doesn't have as much of an impact as the drastically reduced frequency ceiling ‚Äî TVB only offers an extra 100 MHz for both single- and all-core boost frequencies.



Think of Intel's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) much like a dynamic auto-overclocking feature that applies to all-core boosts but remains within warranty. ABT doesn't come with a guaranteed frequency ‚Äî peak frequencies will vary based upon the quality of your chip cooler and motherboard power delivery. Still because the chip stays within Intel's spec it is a supported feature that doesn't fall into the same classification as overclocking so it's fully within warranty.

Intel only offers ABT on Core i9 K and KF processors but the basic principle and functionality of the feature should be portable to any Intel chip. That means Intel removed this feature from the 11700K simply to make customers pay more for it by stepping up to its most expensive desktop chips.

Intel lists the Core i7-11700K with a 125W TDP the same as the previous-gen 10700K but this only encompasses the PL1 (Power Limit 1) level that occurs when the chip operates at its base frequency. The 11700K jumps to 251W when it operates at boost frequencies (PL2 - Power Limit 2). That's an increase over the 10700K's 224W PL2 but both chips have the same recommended Tau (boost duration) of 56 seconds. As with all other Intel chips motherboard vendors are free to ignore these limits if their motherboards have adequate power circuitry so these limits are rarely seen on higher-end boards unless you manually force your motherboard to adhere to them.

Finally the Core i9-11900K is the only Rocket Lake chip supporting DDR4-3200 memory in the optimal configuration at stock settings which is called 'Gear 1.' This setting allows the memory controller and memory frequency to operate at the same speed (1:1) thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work like gaming.

All other Rocket Lake chips like the Core i7-11700K only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates. This can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications ‚Äî particularly gaming. We have yet to see a situation where Gear 2 makes much sense for enthusiasts. Instead this setting is most useful for those chasing overclocking frequency records that don't directly equate to real-world performance boosts.

The Core i7-11700K's official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking which voids your warranty. Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty. We've found that Gear 1 provides the best all-around performance so that's all you'll see in our testing for this review. You can take a closer look at the performance deltas we've observed with the modes here.

Most of Chadley's Reports are self-explanatory and easily achieved in the course of a regular playthrough. Just make sure you have Assess and a variety of elemental attacks equipped. However some Battle Intel Reports are a bit more tricky. To help you get them more easily here are some specific tips:

Report 5: How to Defeat Shiva

You have to complete this simulated boss battle to get the Shiva Summoning Materia. Please see tips and loadouts on how to defeat Shiva here.

Report 10: How to Defeat Fat Chocobo.

To get the Fat Chocobo Summoning Materia complete this VR battle successfully. See this battle intel: how to beat Fat Chocobo.

Report 12: How to Complete The Stagger Effect Part 3

In order to achieve 200% (or even 300%) stagger bonus you'll need an opponent who is able to take a lot of damage and able to stay in sustained stagger. Your best bet is the Fat Chocobo VR mission but any major enemy will do.

First you need to build up your enemy's stagger meter. Many abilities increase stagger -- refer to the descriptions of the ones you've got unlocked/equipped and use them to good effect. When your opponent's stagger gage is almost full use Tifa's default ability Unbridled Strength to increase her chi. Get in close and use the Triangle Button to use her Whirling uppercut Omnistrike and Rise and Fall attacks which significantly increase bonus stagger damage. By repeatedly attacking you will quickly clear 200% (and more).

At this time they don't appear to be looking to forcing GuC by default for existing hardware but that may change for upcoming/future Intel graphics hardware. The open-source driver work around GuC has been ongoing for years. The GuC microcontroller has been around since Skylake for being able to offload some functionality from the kernel graphics driver to this microcontroller. The one area where GuC is being used currently within the kernel is around its ""HuC"" for HEVC/H.265 authentication with their media driver.With the GuC microcontroller being in better shape for Gen11+ and the possibility of requiring its usage for future Intel graphics there's been the context scheduling work noted in recent months and then on Friday marked the new patches around GuC power management that we haven't seen touched otherwise in several years. Of course some won't be happy about this with the GuC firmware being loaded at run-time and binary-only but both NVIDIA and AMD also require closed-source firmware for hardware initialization for their modern GPUs.These 15~16 patches wire up usage of the single loop power control feature in GuC for handling some power management work otherwise handled by their i915 kernel driver. ""With this series we will enable two PM features - GTPerf and GuCRC. These are the Turbo and RC6 equivalents of the host based version. GuC provides various interfaces via host-to-guc messaging which allows KMD to enable these features after GuC is loaded and GuC submission is enabled. We will specifically disable the IA/GT Balancer and Duty Cycle control features in SLPC.""GuC SLPC when fully utilized aims to offer better efficiency for power management tasks than being handled by the kernel graphics driver. It will be interesting to see how well it works in practice on Icelake graphics and newer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMC9pbnRlbC1hbGRlci1sYWtlLWh5YnJpZC1tb2JpbGUtcHJvY2Vzc29yLWZhbWlseS10by1yYW5nZS1mcm9tLTV3LXRvLTU1dy10ZHAv0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY254LXNvZnR3YXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2ludGVsLWFsZGVyLWxha2UtaHlicmlkLW1vYmlsZS1wcm9jZXNzb3ItZmFtaWx5LXRvLXJhbmdlLWZyb20tNXctdG8tNTV3LXRkcC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Alder Lake hybrid mobile processor family to range from 5W to 55W TDP (leak),"Intel‚Äôs first foray into hybrid processors using Foveros 3D stacking technology did not end well with the company just announcing the end of the life for Lakefield hybrid processors. But the company is not giving up on hybrid technology and a recent leak shows the Intel Alder Lake family comprised of more powerful mobile hybrid processors will be offered for a wide range of applications from tablets with 5-7W M5 processors and up to ‚Äúmuscle laptops‚Äù or mobile workstations (MWS) with H55 processor at 45-55W TDP.

Alder Lake hybrid processors will be comprised of high-performance CPU ‚ÄúGolden Cove‚Äù cores and energy-efficient Atom-based ‚ÄúGracemont‚Äù CPU cores in a way that‚Äôs similar to Arm‚Äôs Cortex-A7x big cores and Cortex-A5x LITTLE cores with big.LITTLE or DynamIQ processing with the goal of optimizing power consumption.

The Intel Alder Lake Mobile SKU stack includes processors for 6 market segments including three ‚Äúnew‚Äù segments/TDP ranges according to the slide:

Alder Lake-M family Intel M5 (New) ‚Äì 5W-7W Core i3/i7 processors for tablets with one big core four small cores and 48 or 64 EU graphics Intel U9 ‚Äì 9W- 15W Core i3/i5/i7 processors for ultra-thin laptops with two big cores four or eight small cores and 80 or 96 EU graphics. Not quite sure what the dotted lines mean but the table also shows an additional 1 big + 4 small + 48EU graphics Celeron/Pentium processor

Alder Lake-P family Intel U15 ‚Äì 12W/15W/20W Core i3/i5/i7 processors for mainstream laptops and tablets with the same configuration as U9 but likely higher clock speeds Intel U28 (New) ‚Äì 20W-28W Core-i5/i7/i9 SoCs for ‚Äúperformance‚Äù laptops and tablets in either 4 big + 8 small or 6 big + 8 small configuration with all equipped with 96EU graphics Intel H45 ‚Äì 35W‚Äì45W Core i5/i7/i9 chips for ‚Äúthin enthusiast‚Äù laptops using either 4 big + 8 small or 6 big + 8 small cluster configurations and again 96EU graphics

Alder Lake-S family (socketed BGA1964 package) Intel H55 (New) ‚Äì 45W-55W Core i7/i9 processors for ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù laptops and MWS with eight big cores eight small cores but only 32EU graphics possibly because a discrete card might also be used. A dotted box also shows a Core-i5 model with four big and 8 small cores.



Intel Alder Lake hybrid mobile processors are expected to become available later this year.

Investors seem to be walking on egg shells these days.

After a historic recovery from the fastest bear market in history ‚Äî the S&P 500 is up more than 90% since the March 2020 lows ‚Äî the tone on Wall Street appears to have suddenly shifted from unabashedly bullish to exceedingly cautious.

This has been accentuated by notoriously bearish investors ‚Äî perhaps most notably Michael Burry whose bet against the housing market ahead of the Global Financial Crisis was portrayed in the film ""The Big Short"" ‚Äî calling for a crash in stocks ahead.

As the bitcoin craze took off in 2017 a Long Island iced tea company sent its share price spiking as much as 380% merely by announcing a ‚Äúpivot‚Äù to blockchain technology. Long Island Iced Tea Corp. even changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp.

At the time the episode underscored the excessive hype around the crypto space. Now regulators say the name change was at the heart of an illegal insider trading scheme.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged three people Friday with insider trading in advance of the announcement that sent Long Island Iced Tea Corp.‚Äôs stock price to the moon.

Eric Watson Long Island Iced Tea‚Äôs leading shareholder tipped off a friend and broker Oliver Barret-Lindsay about the coming name change by sharing a draft of the company‚Äôs press release according to a complaint filed by the SEC in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The SEC said that Barret-Lindsay a Canadian citizen who owned a firm incorporated in the Cayman Islands then shared that material nonpublic information with a friend named Gannon Giguiere who owned and operated a stock promotion website.

‚ÄúWithin hours of receiving this confidential information Giguiere purchased 35000 shares of Long Blockchain stock‚Äù the SEC said.

The next day December 21 2017 Long Island Iced Tea Corp. until that point exclusively a soft drink maker announced its makeover describing the pivot to blockchain as a ‚Äúonce-in-a-generation opportunity.‚Äù

Even though the company had no actual business tied to blockchain at the time and no experience in the cryptocurrency space its Nasdaq-listed share price skyrocketed and trading volume spiked by 1000%.

‚ÄúWithin two hours of the announcement Giguiere sold his shares for over $160000 in illicit profits‚Äù the SEC said.

Confidential source and encrypted messaging

The agency charged all three with insider trading.

The complaint indicates the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and civil penalties against all three. The SEC also wants to bar Watson a New Zealand citizen who controlled 30% of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.‚Äôs stock from acting as an officer and director at any public company.

‚ÄúThe SEC remains committed to preventing all types of fraudulent conduct in connection with purported ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô companies including profiting from trading on material non-public information‚Äù Richard Best director of the SEC‚Äôs New York regional office said in a statement.

Neither the company nor the three individuals charged were available for comment on Saturday.

The SEC complaint cited messages sent on an unnamed encrypted messaging app as well as communications with ‚ÄúIndividual A‚Äù who allegedly participated in stock promotion schemes with Lindsay and Giguiere. The agency said ‚ÄúIndividual A‚Äù acted as a confidential source to law enforcement.

Both Barret-Lindsay and Giguiere were previously charged by the SEC for participating in a ‚Äúpump-and-dump‚Äù scheme. That case is currently in litigation.

The SEC said Long Blockchain was delisted by the Nasdaq in February for allegedly making a ‚Äúseries of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of the general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2xpZmUvc2NpZW5jZS9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1icmFuc29uLWZsaWVzLXdpdGgtb3duLXJvY2tldC10by1zcGFjZdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2xpZmUvc2NpZW5jZS9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1icmFuc29uLWZsaWVzLXdpdGgtb3duLXJvY2tldC10by1zcGFjZS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Branson flies with own rocket to space | Daily Sabah,"British Sir Richard Branson took off Sunday from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel becoming the first billionaire to leave Earth for space.

A massive carrier plane made a horizontal take-off from Space Port New Mexico at around 8:40 a.m. Mountain Time (1440 GMT) and will ascend for around an hour to an altitude of 50000 feet (15 kilometers) before dropping the spaceplane beneath it.

Branson beats the likes of rival mega-rich Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to the punch in the heated space race and promoting his burgeoning astro-tourism venture in the process.

Branson's attempt will come decades after burnishing his reputation as a wealthy daredevil mogul in a series of boating and hot-air balloon expeditions.

The billionaire's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. is due on Sunday to send the company's passenger rocket plane the VSS Unity on its first fully crewed test flight to the edge of space with the British billionaire founder among the six individuals strapping in for the ride.

The gleaming white spaceplane will be borne by a twin-fuselage carrier jet dubbed VMS Eve (named for Branson's mother) to an altitude of 15000 meters (nearly 50000 feet) where Unity will be released and soar by rocket power in an almost vertical climb through the outer fringe of Earth's atmosphere.

At the apex of its flight some 89 kilometers (55 miles) above the New Mexico desert the crew will experience a few minutes of weightlessness before making a gliding descent back to Earth.

If all goes according to plan the flight will last about 90 minutes and end where it began on a runway at Spaceport America near the aptly named town of Truth or Consequences.

Virgin's Unity 22 mission marks the 22nd test flight of the spacecraft and the company's fourth crewed mission beyond Earth's atmosphere.

But it will be the first to carry a full complement of space travelers ‚Äì two pilots and four ""mission specialists"" Branson among them.

Milestone and publicity

Although the mission is seen as a potential milestone in helping transform citizen rocket travel into a mainstream commercial venture spaceflight remains an inherently hazardous endeavor.

An earlier prototype of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane crashed during a test flight over California's Mojave Desert in 2014 killing one pilot and seriously injuring another.

If successful Sunday's flight will also give Branson bragging rights to besting rival Jeff Bezos and his space company Blue Origin in what has been popularized as a ""billionaire space race."" Bezos the founder of online retail giant Amazon.com is slated to fly aboard Blue Origin's suborbital rocket ship the New Shepard later this month.

Branson's official job on his flight is to ""evaluate the private astronaut experience"" and his observations will be used to ""enhance the journey for all future astronaut customers"" according to Virgin's press materials.

But Marco Caceres a senior space analyst for the Virginia-based consulting firm Teal Group said the Branson and Bezos ride-alongs were each ""a bit of a publicity stunt.""

Will see you there to wish you the best ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10 2021

""If they succeed their ventures will be taken more seriously"" Caceres said. ""There's plenty of multimillionaires in the world that would like to go up on an adventure so long as they see it as relatively safe.""

Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin along with fellow billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX are competing head-to-head in the emerging business of space tourism though Musk has a big head start.

In a Twitter exchange with Branson early on Saturday Musk said that he would attend the launch ""to wish you the best."" It was not immediately clear if Musk would be present at the launch site or join online.

SpaceX which plans to send its first all-civilian crew (without Musk) into orbit in September has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station.

Branson 70 insists there is plenty of demand from wealthy would-be citizen astronauts to go around and that he had no intention of trying to upstage Bezos.

""Not a race""

""It's honestly not a race"" Branson told Reuters in an interview earlier this week. ""If it's a race it's a race to produce wonderful spaceships that can make many more people be able to access space. And I think that's both of our aims.""

The spaceplane's two pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci will control the ignition and shutoff of the ship's rocket engine and activate the vehicle's ""feathered"" tail maneuver for re-entry.

The three other mission specialists are Beth Moses the company's chief astronaut instructor; Virgin Galactic's lead operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla a research operations and government affairs vice president.

The Virgin brand including Branson's airline and former record label has long been associated with exploits of derring-do by its flamboyant founder. Branson set a new record for the fastest boat crossing of the Atlantic in 1986 a year after his initial attempt ended with a Royal Air Force helicopter rescue when his vessel capsized.

In 1987 he made a record-breaking Atlantic crossing by hot-air balloon though again he had to be rescued from the sea. He went on to break at least two other air-balloon speed records but failed to complete any of three bids to circumnavigate the globe by balloon.

As for Sunday's flight Branson said this week that he is excited ""and I really don't think there‚Äôs anything there to be scared about.""

Assuming the mission goes well Virgin has said it plans two further test flights of the spaceplane before beginning commercial service next year.

The company has said it has received more than 600 flight reservations priced at around $250000 per ticket but hopes eventually to slash the cost of each seat to $40000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjYyNzI1LzIwMjEwNzExL3JpY2hhcmQtYnJhbnNvbi12aXJnaW4tZ2FsYWN0aWMtbWlzc2lvbi1kZWxheWVkLmh0bdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzLzI2MjcyNS8yMDIxMDcxMS9yaWNoYXJkLWJyYW5zb24tdmlyZ2luLWdhbGFjdGljLW1pc3Npb24tZGVsYXllZC5odG0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Mission Delayed Due to Weather,"Richard Branson's jaunt to space will have to wait a little longer.

The billionaire's flight on his Virgin Galactic spacecraft just experienced a slight delay. According to The Wall Street Journal Branson's departure is now set at 10:30 A.M. ET from the original launch of 9:00 A.M. ET. The reason is inclement weather at the launch facility in New Mexico.

When the time comes a plane will carry the VSS Unity spacecraft from the Spaceport America facility to the skies around 8.5 miles above the Earth's surface. And from there the VSS Unity spacecraft will turn on its engines and rocket to a maximum altitude of about 50 miles which is what the US considers the end of Earth's atmosphere and the start of outer space.

Richard Branson and five others aboard the Unity spacecraft will experience microgravity at those altitudes for a few minutes before descending in a typical runway landing style.

Space.com reports that Virgin Galactic is live-streaming the launch via a webcast by Stephen Colbert of The Late Show for those interested in seeing the mission unfold. It can also be watched on the company's official YouTube page (look for the blue checkmark beside the name) and their website.

Richard Branson: In The Face of Space Flight's Risks

Branson likely already knows about the potential risks of the mere act of trying to leave Earth's atmosphere in a rocket. But there's a good chance that the normal people won't.

The spacecraft carrying Branson and his companions also already got a favorable head start because it's taking off at a high enough altitude where gravity isn't as strong as it is on the ground. But that doesn't mean there's less danger involved.

For one the human body will go under an immense amount of stress as the rocket tries to escape Earth's gravity: as much as 17000 miles per hour's worth of orbital velocity. Mind you not even far younger astronauts with years of training find that easy. Furthermore Richard Branson might've established Virgin Galactic 17 years ago but the company's spacecraft are more or less unproven in crewed flights.

Mission Success Could Usher In A New Age

Should Branson's mission succeed then it would bring about the age of commercial space tourism. Sure it's got Virgin Galactic stock tripling according to a recent report by Barron's. But that's not the only positive thing to come from the mission.

What this means is that you won't need to be a professional astronaut to be able to go to space anymore. All you have to do is pay a fee (right now it's still far out of reach for the commoner) and you'll be able to be a lot closer to the stars than most folks will ever get. It could also mean the beginning of another multi-billion-dollar industry in the foreseeable future.

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

But for the man who through his investigations in the Guardian set off the events that brought down the UK‚Äôs biggest-selling Sunday newspaper it did not feel like a victory.

‚ÄúNobody at the Guardian wanted the News of the World to close down‚Äù said Nick Davies the reporter who exposed the phone hacking scandal. ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt even dreamed that the Murdochs would do such a horrible thing.‚Äù

Over the course of a few days in July 2011 the News of the World had gone from having tens of millions of readers who every weekend lapped up its agenda-setting mix of sex scandal and scoops to becoming a pariah publication considered beyond salvation.

It began on the Monday of that week when Davies and colleague Amelia Hill revealed that the News of the World‚Äôs reporters had illegally accessed the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. By Thursday owner Rupert Murdoch had concluded his 168-year-old tabloid had became politically toxic and threatened his takeover of broadcaster Sky. He abruptly shut the paper down and sacked most of the 200 staff.

‚ÄúUsually we made the news but at that point we‚Äôd become the news‚Äù said Tom Latchem the News of the World‚Äôs TV editor when it closed speaking a decade on. He began to realise the newspaper was doomed when the candidate fired by Alan Sugar on that week‚Äôs episode of The Apprentice cancelled an interview as a result of the Dowler story: ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôre really in trouble here. If these people who are desperate for fame at almost any cost are pulling out then that‚Äôs not a great sign.‚Äù

For years Murdoch‚Äôs company had falsely maintained that just ‚Äòone rogue reporter‚Äô ‚Äì former royal editor Clive Goodman ‚Äì had hacked voicemails while paying off other celebrity victims and playing down Davies‚Äô stories. But it was the Dowler revelation that caught the public‚Äôs attention.

Ten years on former News of the World staff ‚Äì and victims of its tactics ‚Äì have taken part in an episode of Radio 4‚Äôs Archive on 4 about the closure. They recall a pressurised newsroom where almost any method was justified to get a front page scoop with thousands of pounds kept in a safe in the office to buy up stories at the last minute.

‚ÄúIt got to the ridiculous stage sometimes where I‚Äôd be sending out someone on a story and the features department would also be sending a reporter and we‚Äôd be bidding against each other‚Äù said James Weatherup a former news editor who later pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

Paul McMullan a former News of the World reporter described a typical sting: ‚Äú[A celebrity] checked into a hotel room in Paris with a new girlfriend who wasn‚Äôt his wife. So what we did is we rang up the hotel pretending to be his accountant and said we need the entire bill please with all the phone calls so we can itemise it. And the hotel rather stupidly just faxed over his bill and we just rang all of the numbers until we found the home number of his girlfriend then sent some paparazzis to get a picture.‚Äù

McMullan who infamously told the subsequent Leveson inquiry into press ethics that ‚Äúprivacy is for paedos‚Äù also described leading the newspaper‚Äôs campaign against paedophiles which inadvertently led to a paediatrician‚Äôs home being vandalised in south Wales: ‚ÄúIt is amazing that you can just write something that took an afternoon and people were rioting in the streets.‚Äù

But it was the desire to scoop rivals using almost any method possible that would bring about the downfall of the paper. News editor Greg Miskiw helped introduce phone hacking to the newspaper after learning about it from a private investigator: ‚ÄúOne day during a conversation he said you do realise that I can listen to people‚Äôs voicemails? And I said wow that‚Äôs astonishing we might use that service. And so we did.‚Äù

The technique was simple. All it required was knowing an individual‚Äôs mobile phone number. The reporter would ring it hope it went to voicemail then guess the individual‚Äôs PIN ‚Äì usually still set to the default of ‚Äò0000‚Äô or ‚Äò1234‚Äô. They could immediately listen to all the voicemails left on that individual‚Äôs phone. In an era before smartphones made it easier to send lengthy text messages a typical set of voicemails could include everything from declarations of love to private medical information.

‚ÄúI would choose my targets very very carefully‚Äù said Miskiw. ‚ÄúBut by the time I left the London office the people put in charge were just hacking everybody. And that‚Äôs how it eventually unravelled.‚Äù

Thousands of people were targeted. Journalists listened in to hundreds of messages left by the then home secretary David Blunkett who was in charge of the police and security services.

Blunkett said the subsequent front page expose of his relationship with a married woman caused friendships to break down: ‚ÄúI was in the public eye. And I was responsible for my behaviour. But it‚Äôs always the family of people that gets hurt.‚Äù

Murdoch is said to have regretted the decision to shut the newspaper. At one point after its closure he informally suggested to BuzzFeed then a fast-growing online news outlet aimed at millennials that it could reuse the News of the World brand. They declined.

Instead he is still dealing with the clear-up bill. Fifteen years after the first phone hacking conviction tens of millions of pounds are still being spent by News UK every year settling claims from phone-hacking victims. The practice was also widespread at the Mirror and Sunday People all of which continue to deal with cases.

The biggest UK tabloid that never admitted hacking voicemails is the Sun the News of the World‚Äôs sister newspaper. Despite this only last month Murdoch‚Äôs company paid substantial damages to former MP Simon Hughes who specifically claimed he was illegally targeted by the Sun. The settlement ensured Hughes‚Äô claims were never heard in open court.

When pictures of Matt Hancock‚Äôs clinch with an aide were splashed on the front page of the Sun last month it was a rare throwback to the era where such exposes arrived almost every Sunday. Even then much-tightened privacy law meant it was the couple‚Äôs breach of social distancing rules ‚Äì as much as the affair ‚Äì which helped legally justify publication.

Looking back at the News of the World‚Äôs closure a decade on Davies said a chance for real change had been missed: ‚ÄúThere was an extraordinary period which only lasted a few weeks and it was like seeing the teacher chased out of the classroom. And just for a brief period we didn‚Äôt have to be frightened of Rupert Murdoch and his dreadful newspapers and politicians were free to say what they thought and advertisers were free to tell him to get stuffed.

‚ÄúBut you know power doesn‚Äôt relax its grip easily. And slowly and insidiously Murdoch got his bony fingers back around the throat of British public life and has kept them there.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlldmFsaXN0cy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNy9tZXRhZGF0YS1hbmQtYmFsaW5lc2UtcGFsbS1sZWFmLW1hbnVzY3JpcHRzLWRpZ2l0aXphdGlvbi1wcm9qZWN0cy1hbmQtb25saW5lLXJlcG9zaXRvcmllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metadata and Balinese Palm Leaf Manuscripts: Digitization Projects and Online Repositories,"Metadata and Balinese Palm Leaf Manuscripts: Digitization Projects and Online Repositories

Paper by Andrea Acri

Given at the International Workshop on Metadata Standards for Palm Leaf Manuscripts on July 9 2021

Excerpt: The small island of Bali is just next to the island of Java in what is now the archipelagic state of Indonesia. It‚Äôs a small territory but with a very rich tradition of manuscripts and it was part once of the pre-modern world ‚Äì of the so-called Indic world Sanskrit cosmopolis. It was deeply influenced by Indian culture Sanskrit language and so it has its own tradition of manuscripts. Basically both Java and Bali share the same tradition of India South Asia Nepal etc with their own local peculiarities of tradition ‚Äì basically that was exported in the early medieval period. We have basically several hundreds if not thousands of texts. Of course very little survived because of the climate so we had much less than what was available in the past. Written in several languages all Java ‚Äì modern Javanese Balinese and other regional languages in the period from the 7th to the 16th century. These palm leaf manuscripts are usually kept in collections both private or also state-sponsored collections that is libraries or museums.

The paper titled ‚ÄúGood Governance: Search for Accountability Mechanism‚Äù was published in the Indian Journal of Public Administration in October 2011.

Chauhan was the vice chancellor of Dharmashastra National Law University in Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs Jabalpur until mid-June this year. Chauhan‚Äôs co-author Mridul Srivastava is an assistant registrar at the Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University in Lucknow. The IJPA is a peer-reviewed journal of the Indian Institute of Public Administration which describes itself as an autonomous academic institution. Chauhan and Srivastava‚Äôs paper is a little over 4500 words long. Of these at least 3500 words had previously appeared in other publications written by other authors and only about a little over nine hundred words appear to be original.

The CRCL is a committee that the ministry of home affairs has constituted to review India‚Äôs criminal laws. On its website the committee says that it ‚Äúendeavours to recommend reforms‚Äù to India‚Äôs criminal laws ‚Äúin a principled effective and efficient manner.‚Äù However lawyers activists and academics criticised the constitution of the committee for not being representative of the country and not including members who are Dalits Adivasis or from other marginalised communities.

Chauhan‚Äôs paper reproduces large sections of a 1999 paper by Ngaire Woods an academic who was at the time a lecturer in international relations at Oxford University. Woods is presently the dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford. Her paper titled ‚ÄúGood Governance in International Organizations‚Äù was published in volume 5 of the journal ‚ÄúGlobal Governance‚Äù in its January‚ÄìMarch 1999 issue. Chauhan‚Äôs paper uses entire sections from Woods‚Äô paper without citing or crediting it.

In fact Chauhan‚Äôs paper does not contain any citations in the body of the paper. However Chauhan‚Äôs paper has a list at the end titled ‚ÄúA Select Reading‚Äù which mentions another paper by Woods. Chauhan‚Äôs paper says: ‚ÄúThe paper here draws on research completed for the Group of Twenty Four and published as Ngaire Woods Governance in International Organizations: The Case for Reform in the Bretton Woods Institutions¬∑ in UNCTAD/Group of Twenty-Four International Monetary and Financial Issues for the 1990s. Volume IX (Geneva; United Nations 1998).‚Äù This sentence also appears to be copied exactly from a citation at the end of Woods‚Äô 1999 paper which referred to her own past work.

In other instances too entire paragraphs in Chauhan‚Äôs paper have featured in previously published work without being cited. Chauhan‚Äôs paper features 760 words with minor variations from ‚ÄúBureaucracy and Public Administration‚Äù a book authored by Rajeshwar Trikha published in 2009 by Jaipur-based ABD Publishers.

I spoke to Debora Weber-Wulff the author of False Feathers: A Perspective on Academic Plagiarism and a professor at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin Germany. She looked at Chauhan‚Äôs paper and juxtaposed it with Woods‚Äô 1999 paper and Trikha‚Äôs book. Based on her review Weber-Wulff called this a case of ‚Äúextensive plagiarism‚Äù exclaiming at the similarity in the texts. ‚ÄúThe words are even being taken‚Äîit‚Äôs not just the ideas‚Äù she said.

Referring to Chauhan and Srivastava she said ‚ÄúIf you begin reading this you would think this is the two authors talking to you but actually it‚Äôs Woods talking to you and not these two authors. Because they have taken this on a very large scale an enormous amount of material.‚Äù Weber-Wulff further called the lack of citation ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù and did not think that Chauhan‚Äôs mention of Woods‚Äô 1998 paper was an appropriate form of academic crediting. Commenting on whether ‚ÄúA Select Reading list‚Äù was an acceptable form of citation she added ‚ÄúThose are not even references. There‚Äôs nothing in the text showing where it was taken from. Even if you put the reference in the reference section you absolutely must say where you got it from in the text.‚Äù

While comparing Woods‚Äô and Chauhan‚Äôs papers she further commented on the plagiarised sentences. In one instance Weber-Wulff pointed out that words in a particular sentence that Chauhan had used were just a rearrangement of the words Woods‚Äôs had used in a sentence‚Äîshe characterised such instances as plagiarism. In another instance she commented on how just the spelling of words had been changed from American English to British English. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not enough to make anything your own‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis you can see here is blatant plagiarism it‚Äôs blatant copying.‚Äù Weber-Wulff added ‚ÄúI would contact the publication and see whether they would consider rescinding it retracting the paper because it‚Äôs plagiarism.‚Äù

I contacted Chauhan multiple times for a comment. ‚ÄúI am not in a position to make any comment because it is an old thing and it is co [authored]‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHad it been my article I would have given you each and every detail.‚Äù Referring to Shrivastava and describing him as a junior Chauhan added ‚ÄúYou talk to him first.‚Äù When asked why there are no citations in the paper as per academic standard and only a reading list at the end Chauhan said ‚ÄúIt's a different style. It‚Äôs not a research paper it‚Äôs information. Our style was different 10‚Äì11 years ago.‚Äù

Shrivastava did not respond to queries seeking comment. When contacted again Chauhan said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt make any comment unless I am clear about the issue. Any article that was 10 years ago how one can remember what was going on in the mind?‚Äù Explaining why there are no ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù in the paper he reiterated that this was not a ‚Äúresearch‚Äù paper. ‚ÄúResearch articles are different‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is just a simple article written for informing the readers.‚Äù IIPA also did not respond to questions seeking comment.



The following screenshots are from the Chauhan‚Äôs paper listed chronologically. The description underneath each screenshot details where the sentences in the image were published before.

In June 2010 the African Journal of Political Science and International Relations published a research paper titled ‚ÄúDemocracy and good governance: Nigeria‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù authored by Ilufoye Sarafa Ogundiya. The research paper mentioned ‚ÄúAccording to Madhav (2007) good governance has much to do with the ethical grounding of governance and must be evaluated with reference to specific norms and objectives as may be laid down. It looks at the functioning of the given segment of the society from the point of view of its acknowledged stakeholders beneficiaries and customers. It must have firm moorings to certain moral values and principles.‚Äù

Ogundiya‚Äôs 2010 paper also included this segment citing Madhav again. ‚ÄúGood governance as a concept is applicable to all sections of society such as the government legislature judiciary media private sector corporate sector trade unions and lastly non-government organisations (NGOs). Public accountability and transparency are as relevant for the one as for the other. It is only when all these and various other sections of society conduct their affairs in a socially responsible manner that the objective of achieving larger good of the largest number of people in society can be achieved (Madhav 2007).‚Äù

The same paragraph appears in a 2009 paper titled ‚ÄúEspousing Effective Performance Audit For Good Governance in India‚Äù authored by Smita Shrivastava and published in the Indian Journal of Political Science. Shrivastava‚Äôs paper cites a 2002 speech by N Vittal a former central vigilance commissioner as a source for the paragraph. This paragraph also appears in Trikha‚Äôs ‚ÄúBureaucracy and Public Administration.‚Äù

Almost two pages of Chauhan‚Äôs paper figure in Trikha‚Äôs 2009 book ‚ÄúBureaucracy and Public Administration‚Äù with slight variations. Trikha writes in his book:

‚ÄúThe issues in the decentralised sectors such as those pertaining to the panchayat raj institutions and municipal bodies themselves call for a similar in-depth study. In the perception of a common person the government is seen to be exploitative. From the viewpoint of the citizens government epitomises corruption inordinate delays long- winded procedures lack of transparency and extreme rudeness and insensitivity often bordering on callousness. As the experience shows it is not easy to tame this wild animal. There are no shortcuts or easy answers. For any perceptible results to be achieved the exercise will call for political and administrative will of the highest order apart from all ingenuity innovativeness and persistence none of which have been particularly evident so far. As the term good governance implies it assumes that there is a government which would like to govern with a firm hand. Its writ must run and should be acknowledged and the people should not take the government for granted. In practical terms it would mean the government taking all actions to retain its firm hold over people their institutions and the situations arising from day to day. Looking around the country not many governments would pass this test.



The foremost test of good governance is the respect for rule of law. As the saying goes howsoever high a person may be the law is above him and has to be considered supreme. The governance must be based on rule of law. Every lawfully established government must govern according to the laws of the land. All its actions must uphold the rule of law and any effort to take the law in one‚Äôs own hand or to undermine the law by anyone howsoever high and mighty he may be must be dealt with speedily decisively and in an exemplary manner. It is unfortunate that even after fifty years of Independence one cannot say with confidence that the governance in most states is based on rule of law. In any discussion on good governance attention must be focussed on the primary responsibilities of the government. These must include the maintenance of law and order administration of justice and welfare of economically and socially weaker sections of society in terms of provision of safety net for them. Here again it is seen that in its anxiety to do thousand and one other things these primary responsibilities have been neglected over the years. It can truly be said that he who governs the least governs the best! If this principle had been followed in governance all these years India would not have presented a picture of such squalor filth illiteracy and poverty even fifty years after Independence. The main question is whether we are prepared to learn lessons for the future from our experience of the past. The principle of subsidiarity must become the guiding principle in the governance. This would imply doing things at the level at which they can be best done. Thus as much of legislative executive and administrative actions must be decentralised as possible. No decisions must be taken at levels higher than the level at which they ought to be appropriately taken. Decentralisation of powers and functions must be adjudged on the basis of this criterion.



As is evident we have a long way to go to reach anywhere near such an objective in spite of the 73rd and 74th amendments of the Constitution. It has to be admitted that the governance in India has not changed much though over half a century has elapsed since Independence. We have certainly made some gestures and ‚Äònoises‚Äô such as adoption of citizen's charter passing of laws on right to information mouthing the platitudes of downsizing of the government and promoting the mantra of public accountability and transparency. But the impact of these measures is hardly perceptible to the common person. There is a widespread disenchantment with the functioning of governments all over the country irrespective of which political party is in power. It is not therefore surprising to see the anti-incumbency factor in operation in practically all elections in the states as also the centre. People are clamouring for a clean open transparent accountable corruption free and sensitive administration. Thus it is necessary to underline that good governance can also be good politics. Finally it must be appreciated that the process of economic liberalisation and globalisation will not go far enough without adequate attention being bestowed on good governance. There has been a clamour of demand from foreign investors for transparency in decision-making in the government. Good governance can directly contribute to higher rate of economic growth.‚Äù

In June 2003 the ‚ÄúNew Academy of Business‚Äù submitted a report to the European Community‚Äôs Poverty Reduction Effectiveness Programme. In one paragraph the report described the stance of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.



Titled ‚ÄúConceptual stance on good governance‚Äù the section below reads exactly the same as the paragraph in Chauhan‚Äôs paper. The last two lines of this paragraph have also featured on the UNOHCHR website.

‚ÄúGovernance is the process whereby public institutions conduct public affairs manage public resources and guarantee the realization of human rights. Good governance accomplishes this in a manner essentially free of abuse and corruption and with due regard for the rule of law. The true test of ‚Äúgood‚Äù governance is the degree to which it delivers on the promise of human rights: civil cultural economic political and social rights. The key question is: are the institutions of governance effectively guaranteeing the right to health adequate housing sufficient food quality education fair justice and personal security?‚Äù

This section in Chauhan‚Äôs paper is almost exactly what was published in Woods‚Äô paper titled ‚ÄúGood Governance in International Organization.‚Äù The following is a section in Woods‚Äô paper also titled ‚ÄúThe Emergence of the Good Governance Agenda‚Äù:

‚ÄúScholars and practitioners of development expressed real concern at the end of the 1980s about the failure of structural adjustment and the failure of so many countries to reap the fruits of a decade of stringent reforms.3 By the early 1990s the answer widely agreed on was that countries taking on reforms simply did not have adequate institutional depth and capacity.4 This finding coincided with a renewed interest in institutions flourishing in the social sciences‚Äîfrom Nobel Prize-winning economists to international relations experts.5 Furthermore the concern with institutions and governance emerged amid increasing worldwide interest in democracy and democratization in the wake of the end of the Cold War.6 It is not surprising that scholars and practitioners started to see good governance not just as a necessary condition for effective reforms but also as fitting with a new rhetoric about democratic participation and accountability. Against this background a whole new literature and set of prescriptions about good governance were unleashed.



In some agencies the new idea of governance or good governance borrowing from U.S. corporate language came simply to mean good quality management.7 This narrow definition of governance envisages limiting the role of the state while ensuring it provides the necessary framework of policy and institutions for markets to flourish. Institutions in this view exist to iron out imperfections in the marketplace and to provide a limited range of what economists define as public goods. A slightly broader version of this definition emphasizes the need to strengthen the ‚Äúinstitutional capacity of the state‚Äù through the enhancement of autonomy efficiency rationality and training.8



An alternative understanding of good governance links institutions and society with a wider conception of government. Within this broader view governance is concerned as Oran Young defines it with the ‚Äúestablishment and operation of . . . the rules of the game that serve to define social practices assign roles and guide interactions.‚Äù9 In order to understand this broader notion of governance scholars are now drawing on political and sociological literature about the conditions and institutions needed to represent and mediate the vast and competing array of interests in any so ciety.10 At the same time international institutions such as the World Bank and agencies of the UN are deriving a checklist of factors that in their experience are useful indicators of good governance. These factors include key principles such as participation accountability and fairness (on which I elaborate below).11



Surprisingly few attempts have been made during the same period to link the emerging literature about good governance and institutions in a specific way to international organizations.12 Yet the time is ripe for such a linkage. International institutions are besieged with new problems arising from both globalization and the impact of the end of the Cold War. The recent financial crisis in East Asia the humanitarian and security cri sis around the Great Lakes of Africa and the problems of climate change and ozone depletion are but a few of these problems.



In dealing with new issues international organizations are being challenged in terms both of their legitimacy and their effectiveness. This challenge takes two forms. At the global level institutions are being challenged by nonstate actors and domestic lobbies‚Äîraising broad issues of global democracy. The good governance agenda translates into questions about the very foundations of world order and the place of sovereignty within it.13 At a more modest level the legitimacy of international institutions is being contested by states who feel inadequately consulted or represented within organizations. The old hierarchy of states within multilateral forums is being challenged and their effectiveness and legitimacy questioned by smaller or weaker states. Here the good governance agenda can be applied to prescribe greater participation accountability and fair ness among states within organizations. Applying good governance to arrangements among states in international organizations may seem a rather old-fashioned idea. Indeed in the 1980s and in the early 1990s scholars began a full-fledged assault on state-centered international politics based on sovereignty. Since that time new rationales for intervention and expanded conditionalities have been opened up14 the increased participation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has been encouraged and concepts of ‚Äúglobal civil society‚Äù have been developed.15 There has been a tendency in other words to move away from the older more state-centered views of international relations and toward a more global approach. This new approach has made an important contribution to thinking about democracy at the global level. As regards international organizations however the tendency to dismiss sovereignty as anachronistic and illegitimate needs a further rethinking.‚Äù

This part of Chauhan‚Äôs paper borrows from Justice as Fairness: A Restatement‚Äîa 2001 book authored by John Rawls and edited by Erin Kelly. Chauhan briefly refers to Rawls and attributes a section to him. However Chauhan then continues to reproduce Rawls‚Äô work without alerting the reader that he is copying almost verbatim from the book. The Editor‚Äôs Foreword of Rawls‚Äô book says:

‚ÄúIn A Theory of Justice (1971) John Rawls proposed a conception of justice that he called ‚Äújustice as fairness.‚Äù1 According to justice as fairness the most reasonable principles of justice are those that would be the object of mutual agreement by persons under fair conditions. Justice as fairness thus develops a theory of justice from the idea of a social contract. The princi¬≠ples it articulates affirm a broadly liberal conception of basic rights and lib¬≠erties and only permit inequalities in wealth and income that would be to the advantage of the least well off.‚Äù

Section 13 of the chapter ‚ÄúPrinciples of Justice‚Äù of Rawls‚Äô book begins with:

‚ÄúTo try to answer our question let us turn to a revised statement of the two principles of justice discussed in Theory ¬ß¬ß11-14. They should now read:2



(a) Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all; and



(b) Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first they are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle).3‚Äù

The second section of ‚ÄúFundamental Ideas‚Äù a chapter of Rawls‚Äô book states:

‚ÄúThe central organizing idea of social cooperation has at least three essential features:

(a) Social cooperation is distinct from merely socially coordinated ac¬≠tivity‚Äîfor example activity coordinated by orders issued by an ab¬≠solute central authority. Rather social cooperation is guided by publicly recognized rules and procedures which those cooperating accept as appropriate to regulate their conduct.



(b) The idea of cooperation includes the idea of fair terms of coopera¬≠tion: these are terms each participant may reasonably accept and sometimes should accept provided that everyone else likewise ac¬≠cepts them. Fair terms of cooperation specify an idea of reciprocity or mutuality: all who do their part as the recognized rules require are to benefit as specified by a public and agreed-upon standard.



(c) The idea of cooperation also includes the idea of each participant's rational advantage or good. The idea of rational advantage specifies what it is that those engaged in cooperation are seeking to advance from the standpoint of their own good.‚Äù

This section of Chauhan‚Äôs paper once again relies on NAB‚Äôs June 2003 report. The NAB report refers to a resolution by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. While borrowing from the NAB paper Chauhan‚Äôs paper used the word ‚Äúresolution‚Äù without clarifying which resolution is being spoken of. The relevant section of the NAB paper that appears in Chauhan‚Äôs reads as follows:

‚ÄúIn its Resolution 2000/64 the Commission identified the key attributes of good governance as: transparency responsibility accountability participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).



This Resolution expressly linked good governance to an enabling environment conducive to the enjoyment of human rights and ‚Äúprompting growth and sustainable human development.‚Äù In underscoring the importance of development cooperation for securing good governance in countries in need of external support the resolution recognized the value of partnership approaches to development cooperation and the inappropriateness of prescriptive approaches. By linking good governance to sustainable human development emphasising principles such as accountability participation and the enjoyment of human rights and rejecting prescriptive approaches to development assistance the resolution stands as an implicit endorsement of the rights-based approach to development.‚Äù

These paragraphs from Chauhan‚Äôs paper appeared before in Woods‚Äô paper which also has a section titled ‚ÄúState Centered Organizations and Good Governance.‚Äù It reads:

‚ÄúThe effectiveness of international organizations has for a long time been presumed to derive from the commitment and actions of their most powerful members. In other words institutions are effective so long as they reflect the hierarchy of power among states.16 This assumption underpinned the organization of both the League of Nations (in which the most powerful took up permanent seats in the executive‚Äîthe Council) and the UN Security Council (in which the Permanent Five members enjoy what amounts to a veto on all substantive issues). Likewise in earlier international organizations voting power was determined purely by financial contributions ensuring that the most economically powerful members would prevail. This was the case in the International Telegraphic Union established in 1865 and subsequently in the Universal Postal Union the International Wine Office and the International Institute of Agriculture all of which were created by 1914.



In the second half of the twentieth century however questions of legitimacy began more strongly to influence the core structure of international organizations. In the first place equality among states has developed as an important principle that borrows from ideas about equality and the ""rights of man.""17 By analogy individual states should be treated as equal members of international society. And further bolstering this argument is the view that we should respect the sovereign equality of states because each is a unit within which humans can express political rights and consent to be governed. The principle of equality has been applied in many organizations that have accorded every state an equal vote such as the GATT its successor the WTO and the UN General Assembly. The principle has also underpinned the allocation of an equal number of basic votes to otherwise unequal members in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.18



However for most of this century equality among states has been recognized only in formal rights of representation. In reality in the name of effectiveness these formal rights have given way to structures that reflect the hierarchy of power among states. Yet today for practical reasons this top down hierarchical vision of management is being reevaluated.19 Certainly in the short term effectiveness requires that an institution be able to make the relevant or necessary decisions to muster the necessary resources and capabilities and to apply resources to implementing and enforcing decisions. And these qualities can all be met by the most powerful states running an organization. However effectiveness in the longer term requires more.



The long-term effectiveness of an institution requires agreement among members about rules identity and decision-making. Scholars working on the effectiveness of institutions point out that an institution must be able to show that it can fulfill its allotted role and thereby prove to its members that it is necessary. It needs an ongoing raison d'etre that is recognized by the membership. It needs a coherent underlying system of ideas for defining problems and their solutions a system that members perceive as valid. And it needs a capacity to absorb new systems of ideas when its own are seen to be failing.20 An effective institution must also be able to retain its identity while adapting to change so that it can plan overall strategic directions and policy choices in conditions of stress and change yet at the same time ensure through rigid transformation rules that it retains its character and status.21 Furthermore organizations need procedures to determine policies that the membership can and will implement.



More profoundly it has been argued that for an institution to be effective a symmetry of power must exist within the institution because it is unlikely to endure over time if powerful states or groups of states can sim ply flout the rules. As one academic argues ""the more symmetrical the distribution of power the harder it is to establish institutional arrangements initially but the more effective they are once formed.""22 These longer-term considerations of effectiveness require a more active and participatory membership than the traditional hierarchical vision and herein lies a powerful reason for applying lessons of good governance to international institutions. The core lessons of good governance as de fined by multilateral organizations include three often overlapping principles: participation accountability and fairness. Below I discuss each principle in turn.‚Äù

These paragraphs with slight variations feature in the next section of Woods‚Äô paper titled ‚ÄúCore Principles of Good Governance.‚Äù In it Woods‚Äôs writes:

‚ÄúIn the sections below problems of accountability will be examined in the context of particular structures and decision-making processes within organizations. It will be seen that accountability needs to reflect not just in formal representation but equally in decision-making procedures and rules and also in the implementation of decisions. Surprisingly where consensus decision-making has been adopted in organizations often on the grounds that it would ensure greater participation of all parties in practice it has often reduced accountability. By contrast carefully constructed voting requirements might enhance accountability. Finally a third principle of good governance is fairness which has two aspects: procedural and substantive. Procedural fairness is a legalistic notion requiring that rules and standards be created and enforced in an impartial and predictable way. In other words procedural fairness requires the processes of representation decision-making and enforcement in an institution to be clearly specified nondiscretionary and internally consistent. All members should be able to understand and predict the processes by which an institution will take decisions and apply them. Such requirements bolster those of transparency and accountability discussed above. Yet as will be seen below in existing international organizations procedural fairness is often circumvented by procedures that privilege informal meetings and decision-making. A more stringent requirement of fairness is substantive fairness which concerns a more contested terrain. Here fairness refers both to how equitable the outcomes of an institution are and to general equality and the distribution of power influence and resources within an organization. Al though during the 1970s debates about the structure of international organizations drew heavily on arguments about fairness and equality in the 1990s many aspects of substantive fairness lie beyond the ambit of good governance.29 However some elements are in fact implicit in the principles of participation and accountability already discussed. That is to say for reasons of effectiveness and democracy more equality of treatment wider participation and greater access to decision-making are all now on the agenda of international organizations.‚Äù

The next section of Woods‚Äô paper also titled ‚ÄúConsensus and Problems of Accountability‚Äù says:

‚ÄúParticipation and accountability within institutions are not affected only by action (and inaction) within the overall structure of voting and ownership. Equally important the decision-making procedures operating within an institution determine how members participate and who is responsible for different kinds of decisions. Formal decision-making rules also offer a rough guide to accountability within an institution. In an interstate organization the most straightforward way to ensure that all states have a voice in decisions is to enforce a rule of unanimity‚Äîsince unanimity gives every state a veto. However this approach can greatly impede the effectiveness of an organization. Even the smallest state can hold the others to ransom. Consensus decision making by contrast is often held out as a more workable requirement. Unanimity requires every member of an institution to vote affirmatively (or to abstain in instances where this is defined as a positive vote). But consensus decision making avoids voting and thus requires a less formal expression of agreement among the parties to a decision.



It is often assumed that consensus gives more voice to those with less voting power and that it ensures a peaceable and constructive atmosphere within institutions. For these reasons it is often simply asserted that consensus decision making contributes unproblematically to good governance.‚Äù

The advanced robotic system will be used in conducting surgeries of critical patients.Besides SNMC the robotic surgery system will be set up at GSVM Medical College in Kanpur LLRM Medical College in Meerut and King George‚Äôs Medical University in Lucknow.Robotic technology will allow surgeons to operate with extreme precision.Areas of the body that may be difficult or even impossible to reach with the human hand will be accessible with use of the robotic system -- its ‚Äúarms‚Äù can rotate full 360 degrees.According to the hospital administration the proposal for establishing a robotic surgery system has been approved by the state health department. After cabinet approval ‚Äúda Vinci surgical system‚Äù costing Rs 35 crore will be commissioned at the super-specialty wing of the hospital. A team of experts will be training doctors to operate the advanced set-up.Dr Sanjay Kala SNMC principal said ‚ÄúRobotic surgery is a form of laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery in which a computer-controlled robot assists the surgeon during the procedure. The robot provides the surgeon with an increased level of dexterity and allows him to operate in small spaces inside the body that would otherwise require open surgery. Compared to traditional open surgery robotic surgery results in smaller incisions which reduce pain and scarring less time is spent in the hospital and recovery is faster.‚ÄùNot only does robotic surgery benefit the patient it enables the surgeon to gain enhanced precision flexibility control and vision. It also allows the surgeon to perform very delicate or complex surgical procedures that may have been very difficult or even impossible without the aid of the robot added Kala.Dr Mridul Chaturvedi SNMC spokesperson said ‚ÄúThe health department has approved a plan to set up the da Vinci robotic surgical system made by an American company Intuitive Surgical. It is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach and is controlled by a surgeon from a console.

This week: Pilot gifts throwback Peterbilt to driver after 40 years of safe driving AIT Worldwide Logistics stays committed to St. Jude Children‚Äôs Hospital and J.B. Hunt gives additional $5 million to Arkansas Children‚Äôs health care initiatives.

Pilot gifts custom Peterbilt to 40-year driver

In 1971 Daniel Abshire‚Äôs father Jim was the second driver to be hired by the trucking firm Pilot Co. Nine years later Abshire joined his father as a driver for the company.

After his father became Pilot‚Äôs first lead driver and eventually retired from the company after 42 years Daniel continued the Abshire legacy by taking his father‚Äôs place as lead driver in 2013.

This week 40 years after Abshire started driving for the company Pilot gifted him his dream truck: a Peterbilt Model 389 inspired by a photo with his father and his Pilot truck from the 1970s.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still in shock‚Äù said Daniel Abshire in a release. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting to be recognized let alone get a new truck to drive that also celebrates my dad‚Äôs time with Pilot. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve always been part of the Pilot family and the team here especially the other drivers always have been part of the Abshire family. That‚Äôs not lip service; it‚Äôs how we operate. This just illustrates how true it is. We are family.‚Äù

Dedication to Pilot was not the only reason the company rewarded Abshire. It was his outstanding safety record as well. Abshire has used a total of 200 million gallons of fuel over 2.5 million miles and racked up 9800 Safety Days which is equivalent to 26 years of safe driving.

‚ÄúDaniel is the best. And that‚Äôs because he learned from the best ‚Äî his father Jim‚Äù said Pilot founder and Chairman Emeritus Jim Haslam.





‚ÄúThis job requires patience endurance and a deep regard for everyone on the road. We are very proud of these two long and legendary careers and it‚Äôs an honor to recognize Daniel for his 40 years at Pilot with this specially designed Peterbilt truck.‚Äù

At the Pilot luncheon Peterbilt executives were excited to share in the celebration of a driver dedicated to doing the essential work in its company‚Äôs vehicle.

‚ÄúEveryone at Peterbilt would like to congratulate Daniel Abshire and the whole Abshire family for the millions of miles they have spent on the road delivering fuel for the Pilot Company. To be a part of this celebration is a privilege and we look forward to seeing Daniel on the road behind the wheel of his Peterbilt Model 389 outfitted with a throwback design honoring the legacy of his father‚Äù said Peterbilt General Manager and PACCAR Vice President Jason Skoog.

AIT Worldwide Logistics gives back through St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital

In 2017 the global supply chain company AIT Worldwide Logistics decided to take steps to define its company culture. After a voting process among AIT teammates the company selected St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital as its flagship charitable partner.

Matt Sanders public relations manager at AIT Worldwide Logistics explained the reasoning behind the partnership which announced this week it would enter into its fifth year.

‚ÄúSt. Jude has a global presence with programs in the same regions where AIT teammates live and work including Asia Europe and North America‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe opportunity for teammates to support the families that depend on St. Jude is a substantial rewarding way to give back to the community.‚Äù

To help support the cause AIT employees attend over 80 of the St. Jude Walk/Run events that take place across the country mostly in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness month when the company‚Äôs employees aim to raise $30000 to be matched by AIT as well.





Individual AIT stations or offices often hold their own events too including bake sales pizza lunches and 50/50 raffles to raise funds for the organization‚Äôs programs. Since its initial partnership in 2017 AIT has been able to raise over $225000 for St. Jude.

Sanders explained that not only has this partnership been rewarding for employees who participate in the events but it has attracted recruits looking for a company that seeks to actively engage in its community.

‚ÄúWe are continuously seeing job applicants who cite the importance of giving back to the community‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn researching AIT candidates frequently notice and ask us about our community programs. ‚Ä¶ Giving back and demonstrating care for the communities where we live and work is an important aspect of the culture and one we hope is important to any new teammate joining the AIT family.‚Äù

J.B. Hunt commits additional $5M to support children‚Äôs health care in Arkansas

More than 700000 children who reside in Arkansas depend on the only child-focused health care system Arkansas Children‚Äôs Inc. With two pediatric hospitals a U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition center statewide clinics and educational programs the group aims to provide top-of-the-line care to adolescents.

On Thursday J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) announced its continued support for the organization with a commitment of a $1 million annual gift for the next five years to help fund the expansion of Arkansas Children‚Äôs Northwest. The company has supported Arkansas Children‚Äôs initiatives for over four decades.

‚ÄúThe J.B. Hunt team has long been committed to Arkansas Children‚Äôs. There is a history of investing in community and health care. This new $5 million five-year gift helps ensure Arkansas Children‚Äôs Northwest is right-sized to meet the community‚Äôs needs‚Äù said Fred Scarborough president of Arkansas Children‚Äôs Foundation. ‚ÄúNorthwest Arkansas continues to grow at a rate that outpaces the rest of the state and Arkansas Children‚Äôs Northwest is an integral part of our work to make Arkansas the safest healthiest place to be a child.‚Äù

The gift is part of an overall $250 million campaign to support the future of children‚Äôs health care in Arkansas called Campaign for a Healthier Tomorrow. In total the trucking and logistics company has raised $10 million toward the campaign since 2016.

‚ÄúJ.B. Hunt is proud to extend our support for Arkansas Children‚Äôs as it continues advancing pediatric health care in this region‚Äù said President and CEO John Roberts. ‚ÄúThe hope that these extremely talented driven professionals bring to our community is very special and helping Arkansas Children‚Äôs expand its services and capabilities will benefit the diverse needs of the Northwest Arkansas community.‚Äù

In Jabil‚Äôs 2020 Smart Home Technology Trends Survey top challenges included the complexity of supply chains; lack of reference architecture referencing both hardware and software; and consumer expectations on delivery times.

Jabil



Connectivity has changed how we think about everyday technologies in our home. It has also made these smart home devices more disposable. The lifecycles of major home appliances have been cut in half down from over 20 years. But major appliances are not the only devices experiencing a transformation; vacuum cleaners coffee makers doorbells and more are in on it too.

As people start to incorporate more of these connected devices and appliances into their everyday lives the correlative spike in the smart home market will require a well-established IoT supply chain to support it. And managing this supply chain requires specialized knowledge tools and strategies.

In an industry where OEMs must be able to support their devices for upwards of 10 years legacy components present unique challenges. Supplier business models aren't typically designed to support components for more than a few years -- they follow the trending world of the mobility market. Those legacy components lead to shortages.

When supply shortages impacted the smart home and appliance industry just a few years ago it forced some OEMs to look at product designs. It emphasized miniaturization as the strategy to ensure a steady supply of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) caps and resistors. As this trend will continue well into the future OEMs need to be mindful to redesign for smaller case sizes to avoid disruptions caused by component shortages.

Succeeding in this industry requires a delicate balance of managing costs keeping up with technology trends and developing a strong supplier relationship management strategy. Otherwise there is no easy way to navigate the treacherous waters of events like supply shortages.

How COVID-19 impacted IoT supply chain management

Lasting growth and development come from the hard stuff -- the challenges obstacles and disruptions that force us to pause and reassess how and why we're doing things. It's fair to say 2020 had its share of the hard stuff. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was the leading disruption for the year.

The smart home and appliances industry immediately felt the impact of the pandemic. Although many smart home OEMs experienced production delays due to government lockdowns there was also a downturn in sales due to lower demand.

With COVID-19 further amplifying existing challenges in IoT supply chain management OEMs had a lot to juggle. Supply chain leaders had to continuously update their demand forecasts based on the status of the pandemic then balance out their inventory with current and upcoming demand. In fact inventory management became a key performance indicator during the first few months of COVID-19.

In addition logistics became a challenge as countries went through waves and phases of lockdown in trying to manage the outbreak. Transportation became unreliable and some key geographies were shut down completely complicating sourcing production and delivery.

Although these obstacles were difficult they were not insurmountable. Supply chain challenges are nothing new. In fact past challenges are responsible for encouraging companies to build resilience and longevity into their supply chain management processes. Prior to 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic the global supply chain was already in a state of uncertainty.

IoT supply chain processes are evolving as smart home OEMs prepare for disasters and interruptions. For your company that may mean building redundancy to prepare for labor shortages moving to regionalized strategies to lessen the impacts of localized shutdowns and trade barriers or incorporating a disaster recovery and business continuity focus to every aspect of the supply chain. But there is no single answer.

In fact as a result of 2020‚Äôs challenges manufacturers across all industries are responding and recalibrating their supply chains. With 58% of smart home manufacturers and 54% of all manufacturers making investments in supply chain network optimization and visualization applications we can see how companies are adapting and growing.

Jabil



Furthermore COVID-19 has pushed decision-makers in IoT supply chain management to make changes to their logistics strategies. Most notably smart home OEMs moved to identify new international shipping options implement transportation management systems or identify additional options for ‚Äúlast-mile‚Äù deliveries to consumers. These changes will help companies resume ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù and get their products to their destinations even in the face of extremely unusual circumstances.

Jabil



The silver lining to operating within a market ripe with obstacles and challenges is the forced maturity and acceptance that change is required. After all necessity is the mother of invention.

If supply chain managers take anything away from the pandemic it should be the deep importance of having a reliable supply chain designed to be flexible responsive and proactive. While no one wants a replay of the questions fears and uncertainty of 2020 the best way to prepare for the unexpected is to remember the lessons we learned in 2020.

A responsive and resilient smart home supply chain

The smart home solutions market is continuously punctuated by consumer demand. While in other industries companies may be able to drive consumer demand to a specific feature or design this is not the case for smart home solutions.

With a new consumer demographic looking for smart home products and appliances manufacturers are forced to move away from legacy designs form factors and features. Connectivity human machine interfaces (HMI) ease-of-use cost and tangible benefits top the list of consumer expectations for their smart home technology.

The good news is smart home manufacturers are listening and paying attention to consumer demand supply chain challenges and market forces. Even more encouraging is that while there are numerous market forces impacting connected home solutions half of our survey respondents say they are listening to customer demand when developing their strategies and products.

Jabil



Paramount to the success of these approaches to strategy and product development is remembering previous lessons with the electronics component shortage during the IoT boom. It's critical that manufacturers look to developing partnerships with supply chain management solutions providers that have the people processes and technology to turn disruption into opportunity for their IoT ecosystem.

COVID-19 IoT supply chain management and the future

The impacts of COVID-19 will not be fully realized for years to come. What we do have and need to remember are our everyday firsthand experiences of a global pandemic. Lives were lost businesses were shuttered global and national disparity in responses to the pandemic were a constant and a growing concern for when normal life will return are just some of the themes of life in 2021. The pandemic has been a turning point for supply chains across all industries and regions.

The pandemic has forced companies to rethink logistics partnerships supplier relationships and the importance of supply chain resilience. When done right these three cornerstones of a successful supply chain give companies the tools network and confidence to remain flexible and responsive to whatever disruption occurs whether that's a pandemic a component shortage labor slowdowns or shifts in consumer demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For the complete transcript of the earnings call please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY Financial) reported a strong quarter with a 6% increase in total revenue and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

The company experienced robust growth in its core business segment with revenue up 7% for the quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) achieved significant sales success including 11 competitive core takeaways and strong interest in new solutions like the Financial Crimes Defender.

The company's Banno Digital banking platform continues to grow now serving over 11.6 million users with approximately 200000 new users added per month.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) maintains a strong sales pipeline keeping it near an all-time high which supports ongoing optimism for future performance.

Negative Points

Despite strong sales the actual revenue recognition from these sales is expected in future years indicating a lag between sales success and financial impact.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) faces increasing competition in the financial technology space with new entrants continuously emerging.

The company noted a decrease in deconversion revenue by approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation among clients.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the banking sector could pose challenges to client operations and affect their technology spending.

Operational costs have risen including higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees which could impact profit margins if not managed effectively.

Q: Mimi can you discuss the factors contributing to the margin performance this year and the outlook for future margin progression?

A: Mimi L. Carsley - Jack Henry & Associates Inc. - CFO & Treasurer: This year's margin performance was driven by strong execution operational focus and product mix.

Being born with cerebral palsy and several additional physical impairments Mark made the most of the hand that was presented to him. People with ""special needs"" require a significant amount of time patience love understanding and acceptance. As time moved on it became crystal clear that Mark gave far more than he ever needed. Everyone needs unconditional love. Mark provided this to all that knew him and interacted with him. This special quality will be cherished and greatly missed. As society evolves it is comforting to know that we are making significant inroads for people with special needs. Mark enhanced our lives and his memories will endure.

He is preceded in death by his parents Gilbert and Gladys Jacobs of Quinter KS. Surviving are his brothers and their wives: Jim and Sandy Jacobs of Phillipsburg KS Doug and Carole Jacobs of Garden City KS Mike and Stacia Jacobs of Belvidere KS and Matt and Terra Jacobs of Burlington KY.

(KY3) - A Springfield woman took on the challenge of opening a business during the pandemic creating a safe space for patient-centered end-of-life care.

Jacob‚Äôs Ladder a nonprofit end-of-life care center opened in Springfield last fall. Since September of 2020 the organization has served more 40 families through donations.

‚ÄúI have been a caregiver in this community for 17 years and I realized we do not have a home for dying and that is something we needed. I did my research on how to get here‚Äù said Founder and President of Jacob‚Äôs Ladder Camelia Jacob.

Jacob‚Äôs Ladder is different from any other hospice care center in Southwest Missouri because they offer an at-home stay with overnight accommodations for family members.

‚ÄúWe help people who lack the resources that would prevent a peaceful death at home and we provide a haven of loving patient-centered end-of-life care‚Äù said Jacob.

The space is enough for two hospice patients along with overnight accommodations for family members.

‚ÄúIt was in the middle of the pandemic and it was hard but we decided to open because we have seen a lot of families struggle not being by their loved one‚Äôs side‚Äù said founder Camelia Jacob.

Jacob has always had a passion for care giving and previously worked in the industry for 17 years.

Her family previously owned Jacob‚Äôs Care Center sixteen years ago. A patient at that center inspired the Jacob to build a guest home to help care for them during their final days.

According to their website the Jacobs wanted to educate others about the concept and need for social model end-of-life care and build support for their mission.

‚ÄúI believe that every person is a value and that everyone should die with dignity and respect and to be cared for‚Äù said Jacob.

Jacob‚Äôs Ladder treats the hospice patient and family like they are guests in their own home according to the founder. They cook let family member stay overnight and make sure they are taken care of.

‚ÄúWe have had 65 guests since we opened and seeing all 65 families go through this is hard but being a support for them is truly a blessing for me‚Äù said Jacob.

The center has touched many families since its opening and one local man shared how grateful he was.

‚ÄúIn the last few weeks I have been taking care of my wife at home. As her condition got worse I was not able to do so anymore. People here have a commitment and they are dedicated to what they do and it takes a special type of person to do that‚Äù said Butch Garredt.

A story told by basketball author Ben Kaplan this week as the future of the show is up in the air speaks to the impact Johnson has made when the cameras aren‚Äôt rolling.

Kaplan took to X and detailed the story of Johnson doing two good deeds that were full-circle between Kaplan‚Äôs bar mitzvah and the death of his father.

When Kaplan was turning 13 years old his father surprised him with a video featuring Johnson Kenny Smith and former co-hosts Peter Vecsey and George Karl.

And here‚Äôs the second half. I still to this day have no idea how @PeterVecsey1 did this with a straight face. He knows he‚Äôs talking about a 13-yr-old on the biggest day of that kid‚Äôs life with friends and family watching! Incredible incredible performance. (7/X) pic.twitter.com/OduQqlz5gw ‚Äî Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Kaplan‚Äôs father was able to get the segment for Kaplan by calling TNT and got a call back from Johnson as the TNT crew produced the segment during the 2000 NBA Playoffs.

Ben Kaplan and Johnson reconnected in 2022 when Kaplan‚Äôs father was battling cancer. Ben got in touch via email and Johnson sent his father a personalized video for his 72nd birthday. Johnson shared his number with Kaplan‚Äôs father and they kept in touch during his cancer treatments.

A few months later Kaplan and Johnson appeared on Meredith Shiner‚Äôs podcast to discuss the story.

So Meredith ended up having Ernie and I both on her pod to discuss the full circle moment together. We talked about faith and fathers and sports how those three things weaved together in our lives. It turned out wonderfully. Here‚Äôs the link:https://t.co/MHq2jvY3TF ‚Äî Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Shortly after the episode‚Äôs release Kaplan‚Äôs father passed away.

Kaplan dedicated his upcoming book ‚ÄòPipeline to the Pros: How D3 Small-College Nobodies Rose to Rule the NBA‚Äô to his father and thanks Johnson for the gift.

I think about my dad a lot especially when I‚Äôm with my own boys and ESPECIALLY especially when we‚Äôre watching hoops. Every time I see Ernie on that TNT desk I think of his generosity about how he allowed me to repay the best gift I ever received. (18/x) ‚Äî Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Johnson responded on X to Kaplan‚Äôs story thanking Kaplan for sharing it and sending well wishes to him and his family.

Ben my friend. You think you do but you have no idea what this series of events meant to me. My only explanation for the opportunity and the timing is as @petermayermusic writes in his song ‚ÄúLoose in the World‚Äù is that this was all ‚Äúthe hand of the Divine.‚Äù Blessings on you‚Ä¶ https://t.co/kyoUxM6S7T ‚Äî Ernie Johnson (@TurnerSportsEJ) May 8 2024",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZXNzd2R1bi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0LzUvMTI0MTUxNi9zdGF0ZS10aXRsZS1nYW1lLWpvaG5zb24tYm95cy1zb2NjZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,STATE FINALS: Johnson streaks come to an end in loss to Westminster,"DULUTH Ga. ‚Äî All good streaks eventually come to an end. Johnson found that out in heartbreaking fashion on Wednesday in the Class 4A state championship match at Duluth High School.

The Knights fell 2-0 to Westminster in a rematch of the 2023 title match snapping several impressive streaks in the process. They had their 14 straight postseason game win streak going back to 2021 snapped; saw their 15 match win streak in 2024 come to end; and had their state title run end at two as they were looking to defend their Class 4A state title.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs soccer. You win some you lose some‚Äù Johnson coach Frank Zamora said in a rainy interview afterwards. ‚ÄúThis is still a young group. They now see what it‚Äôs like to lose at this stage and I'm sure they‚Äôll learn from this and come back stronger and motivated next year.‚Äù

The Wildcats (17-4-2) dominated much of the first half against the defending champions. They produced a solid scoring chance just two minutes in and Benjamin Villatoro was forced to make a diving save on another shot in the 9th minute.

The Knights' usually consistent ball-control offense sputtered for the first 19 minutes with six midfield turnovers. As a result the Wildcats were able to generate 7 shots many within 20 yards.

Johnson‚Äôs 6th turnover would contribute mightily. The Wildcats would take advantage as Will Stewart found himself alone on the left side for a 10-yard blast. Villatoro was able to make a diving save but that left Aditya Kaul wide open for an easy goal on the rebound for a 1-0 lead with 21:16 left in the first half.

The Knights (18-2-1) would get a huge break two minutes later however as Westminsters‚Äôs Tristen Lewis received a red card when he upended Vazquez who was on a breakaway just outside of the box.

Johnson turned that into their first two shots of the game moments later but Andres Galacia‚Äôs blast from 20-yards sailed wide left.

From there the Johnson offense awakened. They created three corners and outshot the Wildcats 4-1 over the final 20 minutes. But it would still go to the half 1-0 Westminster despite two huge opportunities for the Knights in the final two minutes..

A 15-yard blast by Vazquez after a beautiful long ball into the box sailed just over the crossbar in the 38th minute. Another Galacia shot from 22-yards out sailed just wide of the left crossbar in the final 30 seconds.

Westminster outshot the Knights 9-4 in the opening 40 minutes but generated just one shot after the red card to Lewis.

Johnson took the man-advantage into the second half but it was quickly erased on a questionable call against Jalil Chavez who got a red card of his own in the 42nd minute.

With the match back to even strength the Knights were able to generate a 6-2 shot advantage midway into the second half. But they could not cash in for the equalizer.

The Wildcats added a huge insurance goal with 14 minutes left to essentially seal it on a header from Alex Na off a corner in the 66th minute.

‚ÄúWestminster came out with a lot of intensity and we did not match it‚Äù Zamora said. ‚ÄúWe definitely picked it up when we had the man advantage but we missed some really good opportunities that would have changed the momentum. Then we got the red card and changed the momentum back a little bit.

‚ÄúWe had chances. We just couldn‚Äôt finish and find the net. But I think there were a lot of people that did not think we could get back to this point and the younger guys showed that they can play. I‚Äôm very proud of the season they had.‚Äù"

Last year it was in Vermont news as the firm the Vermont Department of Labor turned to in the early days of the pandemic to build a new unemployment insurance claim system.

The company was on the Waterbury Select Board‚Äôs July 6 agenda with a request to town officials for a letter of support as it seeks state economic development incentives for its potential plans to locate a regional office in the state. MTX is in the process of applying to the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive program run by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.

The program is geared to encourage new or existing companies to make investments that result in new full-time permanent Vermont jobs. The financial award is paid out over several years and the amount is based on a formula using the company‚Äôs own performance goals and the resulting revenue the business development creates for the state.

Applications for what‚Äôs referred to in short as the VEGI program are reviewed by the Vermont Economic Progress Council which meets monthly. The MTX request will be considered at the council‚Äôs July 29 meeting said Megan Sullivan the council‚Äôs executive director.

A promising fit for Waterbury

Municipal Manager Bill Shepeluk in introducing the item to the select board this week said the MTX proposal would involve 100 employees to start with the potential to more than double that to 250 over a 7-to-10-year period. The company is considering space in the Pilgrim Park commercial complex in downtown Waterbury left vacant after Keurig Dr. Pepper dramatically scaled back its presence here in recent years.

For its part the select board authorized Shepeluk to send the town government‚Äôs support for the MTX request. His draft letter says that the proposal is worthy of the maximum award from the program and that the town would look forward to working with the state and the company to make the project happen.

Shepeluk frames the interest of a potential new large employer as a step toward returning lost economic activity to the community. ‚ÄúWaterbury and our surrounding community have been working to recover first from Tropical Storm Irene‚Äôs impacts and subsequent loss of State employees and secondly from the closure of the Keurig Dr. Pepper manufacturing facility. The loss of jobs in our downtown had a significant impact on the viability and health of many of our small businesses‚Äù Shepeluk writes. ‚ÄúMTX‚Äôs plan to locate close to the downtown will provide a major boost to the local economy and provide quality jobs for area residents.‚Äù

Local officials familiar with MTX‚Äôs interest in Vermont cite the company‚Äôs high-paying jobs as a positive. An online search for job openings with the company turns up positions in numerous locations including software engineers and business intelligence analysts earning $85000 to $100000 a year; project manager positions paying $100-$200000; and data officers earning around $200000.





Lunch coffee and a haircut

James Stewart executive director of the Central Vermont Regional Economic Development Corporation cautioned that the proposal for Waterbury represents one option that MTX is considering. The company is looking at the entire region and Vermont ‚Äì with Waterbury as its preferred spot ‚Äì is just one of several potential locations for offices that would serve New England and New York he said.

‚ÄúThey are very much being recruited by several other states‚Äù Stewart said. ‚ÄúThis is somewhat of a competition.‚Äù

He said he understands the company‚Äôs timeline is to make a choice soon after it has details of Vermont‚Äôs incentive offer as other states have already weighed in. Stewart added that he believes other factors that don‚Äôt have a dollar value will also be important to MTX decision-makers. ‚ÄúQuality of life lifestyle. They‚Äôd like their people to be in a downtown where they can walk to get lunch coffee their hair cut or their car fixed‚Äù Stewart said pointing out that Waterbury village can check those boxes.

Echoing Shepeluk‚Äôs mention of state and manufacturing jobs lost locally in the last decade he added ‚ÄúThis could be an opportunity in one shot to get a lot of that back.‚Äù

Among the criteria used for the VEGI program is community support hence the request to the select board. Stewart said that both the Central Vermont Regional Economic Development Corp. and the Central Vermont Regional Planning Commission were expected to offer letters of support as well.

The fact that the firm already is on retainer with the state of Vermont could work in Waterbury‚Äôs favor. According to documents online with state government MTX had a $2 million contract for a myriad of information technology services prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. That was revised upward twice and now stands at $10 million through June 14 2022.

Those factors are set aside however when state officials review the VEGI application. The determination on an award must meet specific criteria pertaining to job growth and financial impact the business will have. Companies need to carefully craft their proposal to not over- or under-sell their potential. Both Stewart and Sullivan stressed that the VEGI program will not pay out more than the state receives from a project and if it falls short of its projections it doesn‚Äôt get paid.

Sullivan said that specifics of the MTX application are not public at this time. The Economic Progress Council meets in executive session to review VEGI proposals given the proprietary and preliminary nature of the information companies share. The council takes its action in public and the terms of the VEGI agreements are made public she said.

‚ÄòHappiness health and the economy‚Äô

MTX was co-founded in 2008 by Das Nobel now the chief executive and his wife Nipa Nobel the company‚Äôs chief marketing officer.

In its corporate communications MTX describes itself as a global technology consulting firm powered by the Maverick Quantum Artificial Intelligence platform. ‚ÄúWith data as the new currency MTX helps organizations transform their long-term strategy with outcomes in mind around happiness health and the economy‚Äù it states.

Its systems designs rely on cloud technology from other companies such as Amazon Web Services Google Cloud and Salesforce. Before COVID-19 its projects covered a wide range of online government service delivery. Much of its work in 2020 and this year has had some connection to the pandemic including creating systems for symptom monitoring contact tracing vaccination management as well as non-medical applications such as emergency housing assistance and child care information management systems. Now as the pandemic recedes in many places MTX has rolled out a ""Safe at Work‚Äù app designed to assist large offices stadiums and public gatherings as they reopen

An inquiry from Waterbury Roundabout to the company for more details about its operations and Northeast expansion plans was referred to the MTX media relations staff. More information is expected ahead of the VEGI application review.

Answering government‚Äôs call for fast expertise

MTX lists numerous governmental business and academic clients on its website including state governments from Maine to Georgia to New Mexico; cities include Washington D.C. Chicago and New York City; others include industry and Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Brown.

Vermont state government offices listed as clients in addition to the Labor Department include state agencies of Digital Services Human Services Transportation Education the Secretary of State and the Health Care Quality Control office.

Last week the company announced it had hired a new chief revenue officer Mike Baraiolo who noted that the company has worked with more than 30 states through the pandemic.

In its corporate blog MTX touts its experience working with the Vermont Department of Labor in 2020 among its success stories. It notes how the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program made many Americans eligible for unemployment insurance early in the pandemic but how in Vermont ‚Äúthe paper-based application process was not making the cut.‚Äù

It then goes on to describe how MTX stepped in to modernize the process creating an online application for individuals to apply for benefits and for state workers to review and process the claims. The new setup communicated with the Department of Motor Vehicles and banks for verification purposes. ‚ÄúThis new system established a streamlined process in which the Vermont Department of Labor could process this sudden influx of unemployment claims more quickly and efficiently than ever allowing them to serve their constituency to the best of their ability‚Äù writes MTX account executive Jill Brabender in a particularly rosy recap of the project.

In Texas last year a government contract had a rockier rollout. The Dallas Morning News reported that MTX edged out a number of larger better-known companies such as IBM and AT&T to win a $295 million state contract to build a COVID-19 contact tracing system last year. That award came under fire from state lawmakers there for its size the speed with which it was decided and the choice of a relatively new player.

The contract was renegotiated in January according to the newspaper and it now will likely end up at $65 million. An audit of the project turned up no major issues and a Texas state health services spokesman summed it up: ‚ÄúThe bottom line is they did what they said they were going to do.‚Äù

MTX co-founder Das Nobel took the criticism in stride telling the Dallas Morning News: ‚ÄúWe expect scrutiny. It‚Äôs taxpayers‚Äô money.‚Äù

Exponential growth during COVID

In 2019 when Das Nobel was named CEO he leaned into innovation growth and a goal of making MTX a billion-dollar business. ""MTX's DNA is culture-based and everything we do to innovate keeps culture at the top. Having such an amazing culture allows us to focus on intentional innovation during hyper-growth‚Äù he said in a company news release. ""I have several ideas to fuel explosive growth in all aspects of the organization in 2019 and 2020 to ensure our broader 2025Billion vision is realized.""

According to its latest Dun & Bradstreet business profile MTX had approximately 45 employees at its New York and Texas locations and sales of just under $25 million. Those figures however likely do not account for its 2020-21 business that mushroomed during the pandemic.

‚ÄúWe grew exponentially. Innovation enabled us to hire hundreds of MTX family members at a time when the unemployment rate was greater than it was during the Great Depression‚Äù MTX Chief Financial Officer Christina Bailey says in a video on the company website. ‚ÄúCreating jobs was one way for us to help the economy recover and we‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù

So far Nobel‚Äôs plans for ‚Äúhyper-growth‚Äù appear to be on track. In March MTX opened 20000 square-foot offices in a complex called The Offices Two at Frisco Station. In a news release Nobel said: ‚ÄúCreating high paying tech-jobs in Texas is one of the top priorities.‚Äù

Just last month MTX announced expansion to Australia with plans to add 500 jobs within the next five years focused on Asia-Pacific clients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Founded in 2014 Dovetail‚Äôs success stories include Afterpay the Melbourne-headquartered unicorn that is one of the highest-profile players in the buy now play later space along with Klarna and Affirm.

‚ÄúPeople can think of us as the technical co-founder responsible for driving and executing product strategy design and the development of scalable products‚Äù Dovetail co-founder Nick Frandsen told TechCrunch.

Dovetail is currently raising a $10 million AUD (about $7.5 million USD) fund that will be used for seed Series A and Series B rounds in 15 of the most promising companies that have gone through its venture studio program. As an investor Dovetail has written check sizes ranging from $150000 to $1 million AUD.

One of Dovetail‚Äôs goals is prepare startups to seek funding from other VCs; firms that have invested in Dovetail‚Äôs portfolio companies include Blackbird Qantas and Wavemaker.

‚ÄúBy the time we need to make an investment decision we would have worked collaboratively on a day-to-day basis with them for at least three months prior to a seed round and 12 months for a Series A. This means we‚Äôre essentially investing with the informational edge of a co-founder‚Äù said Frandsen. ‚ÄúAnother trait that makes Dovetail unique is that we share our ownership in our portfolio companies with the entire team. This further drives unity dedication and a desire to succeed from our team.‚Äù

Dovetail began working with Afterpay in 2017 when the company had less than 40 employees. Frandsen said Afterpay‚Äôs founders Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen were looking for a digital product development partner to build and scale their mobile and web apps. While both had deep experience in financial services they came from non-technical backgrounds. That‚Äôs where Dovetail came into play building out Afterpay‚Äôs tech platforms and helping launch its consumer-facing products.

Before they started Dovetail Frandsen and co-founder Ash Fogelberg‚Äôs startup ticketing and payments platform 1-Night was acquired by TicketDirect in 2013.

Dovetail‚Äôs venture studio is sector-agnostic (though it has strong experience in fintech SaaS and marketplaces) and works with startups that may not have a product yet but have founders who ‚Äúare ambitious commercially-savvy and bring industry expertise from the field in which they are trying to solve a problem‚Äù said Frandsen.

When deciding what founders to work with Dovetail considers at the viability and growth potential of their idea.This includes looking at how well-suited founders are to the issue if there is enough market potential for the startup to grow into a large company and how much competition there is.

Dovetail has a product agency that serves mostly U.S. companies but its venture studio is currently focused on Australasian startups with plans to expand into North America in the future.

‚ÄúWe are actively seeking industries that are large yet underappreciated by the startup community‚Äù Frandsen said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for ideas. that require hard-earned industry experience and can‚Äôt easily be replicated by teams of young aspiring entrepreneurs.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZHVzdHJ5LmZhc2hpb24va2xhcm5hLWFjcXVpcmVzLXVrLWZvdW5kZWQtc29jaWFsLXNob3BwaW5nLXBsYXRmb3JtLWhlcm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Klarna acquires UK-founded social shopping platform HERO,"Klarna the global payments giant has acquired UK-founded social shopping platform Hero which connects in-store teams directly with online consumers.

Click here for updates on this story

TORONTO Ontario (CTV Network) ‚Äî Heinz has launched an online campaign calling on companies to sell hot dog buns and wieners in equivalent quantities. However industry insiders say there is a reason why they‚Äôre sold in mismatched numbers.

The company known for its ketchup announced its new Heinz Hot Dog Pact on Tuesday saying that it is time ‚Äúbig bun and big wiener companies to finally sell buns and wieners in even packs.‚Äù

Daniel Gotlib associate director of brand building and innovation at Kraft Heinz told CTVNews.ca that the mismatched packaging has been a ‚Äúpain point‚Äù of consumers for years.

While Heinz doesn‚Äôt produce hot dog wieners or buns Gotlib says the goals of the petition is to drive ‚Äúmeaningful change‚Äù on the ‚Äúgrave hot-dog-to-bun-ratio issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe hope with enough signatures on our petition we can prove to bun and wiener companies that the time for change is now‚Äù Gotlib said in an email on Thursday.

As of Friday afternoon the petition has garnered more than 17000 signatures.

However experts say there is a reason for the unequal packaging between wieners and buns.

Janet Riley vice-president of communications and public affairs at Maple Leaf Foods told CTVNews.ca that hot dogs were actually consumed alone long before a bun even existed.

‚ÄúHot dogs were made in natural casings that remained on the hot dog when you ate them and they were commonly eaten with a knife and fork‚Äù she explained in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Riley who previously was the president of the U.S. National Hot Dog and Sausage Council (NHDSC) explained that people used to go to the deli and order the specific number of hot dogs they wanted. She says it wasn‚Äôt until the early 1940s when hot dog wieners began being produced uniformly in cellulose casings to help ensure every dog was the same size.

At this time Riley said hot dog buns were introduced and were made using baking pans that held four buns.

‚ÄúThese skinless wieners were sold in packages that were typically 10 to the pack but baking pans baked four buns at a time so two sets of four buns were sold in an eight bun package‚Äù Riley explained.

Despite this Riley says the quantities of hot dogs and buns have since changed.

She said brands at Maple Leaf Foods offer a variety of hot dog choices for consumers. Riley says the company makes 34 different hot dog products sold in eight 10 and 12 packs.

Bimbo Canada a producer and distributor of packaged fresh bread and bakery products including Dempster‚Äôs Villaggio POM Bon Matin and Stonemill among others said it also offers a variety of hot dog bun options for consumers.

Bimbo Canada spokesperson Sylvia Sicuso told CTVNews.ca that the Heinz petition doesn‚Äôt provide ‚Äúan accurate representation‚Äù of the wiener-bun situation in Canada.

Sicuso said in a telephone interview on Thursday that its brands offer six eight 12 and 24 pack hot dog buns.

‚ÄúThe number changes depending on where you live in Canada and what retailer you go to‚Äù she said.

While product offerings can vary depending on brand Sicuso said Bimbo Canada has sold hot dog buns in these numbers for as long as she has been with the company which is over 10 years.

If having leftover hot dog buns isn‚Äôt ideal the U.S. National Hot Dog and Sausage Council recommends some simple math to solve the problem.

‚ÄúTo save you from the bread aisle arithmetic anxiety you need to purchase five bags of eight-to-the-pack buns and four 10-to-the-pack hot dogs to break even‚Äù according to its website.

However a spokesperson for NHDSC acknowledged that this may be too many hot dogs if you‚Äôre not throwing a family BBQ.

Given the dilemma the NHDSC told CTVNews.ca in an email that the Heinz petition is a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù way to get companies and hot dog lovers all on the same page.

‚ÄúWe relish any partnerships to ketchup on hot dog and bun offerings so they cut the mustard for hot dog lovers everywhere‚Äù the organization said.

KR,Kroger,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbmVpZ2hib3Job29kbmV3c29ubGluZS5uZXQvbmV3LWdyb2Nlcnktc3RvcmUtYXQtdGhlLWdyb3ZlLXN0aXJzLW9ubGluZS1kZWJhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Grocery Store At The Grove Stirs Online Debate ‚Äî Neighborhood News,"The social media team at The Grove put out a Facebook teaser that a national coffee chain and national grocery store were coming to their ever-expanding property this year.

As far as a national coffee chain well we‚Äôd be shocked if it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶.Starbucks.

But a new national grocer?

Now that is intriguing.

So naturally because this is Wesley Chapel and everyone seems to go ga-ga for anything new coming to town the Facebook post exploded with people using ALL CAPS and multiple exclamation points to demand that their choice be the one ordering The Grove to make it so and seemingly ready to fight anyone who disagreed.

And that (of course) were just the Trader Joe‚Äôs fans!

Some cast their votes/begged for their favorite and made predictions while others ‚Äî transplants from other states we‚Äôre guessing ‚Äî clamored for their favorite grocers from their hometowns in the Midwest and Northeast.

More than 350 comments rolled in and we read every one of them and the winner ‚Äî if the locals were allowed to make the choice ‚Äî was Trader Joe‚Äôs.

Uhhh we mean TRADER JOE‚ÄôS OR BUST!!!!!!

That‚Äôs no surprise of course. When we ran a similar poll on our Facebook page asking what should replace the old Sweetbay on Bruce B. Downs Blvd. in New Tampa Trader Joe‚Äôs trounced the field ‚Äî although ahem we don‚Äôt recall anyone threatening to move away if it wasn‚Äôt a Trader Joe‚Äôs.

The Grove post was a mishmash of grocery store debate which led us to wonder what could be coming.

PUBLIX: The obvious predictable choice even though the Publix on the corner of S.R. 54 and BBD is just down the road. But since when has having a nearby location mattered to Publix? Heck in New Tampa you can throw a BOGO bag of lettuce from the Cross Creek Blvd. location at Morris Bridge Rd. and hit the New Tampa Blvd. at BBD store.

Besides the Hollybrook Plaza Publix is going to relocate to the east one of these days back (near the Walmart) creating some additional distance from the new store in The Grove.

Here‚Äôs the thing though ‚Äî while we all love Publix it‚Äôs still just Publix. And it‚Äôs literally everywhere.

Does it really fit the fresh hip new energy coming from The Grove even though one could argue that a Publix chicken tender sub trumps fresh hip new energy any day and we wouldn‚Äôt necessarily disagree?

However you know what‚Äôs hipper than Publix? A new Publix like the prototype store that opened in December on Gandy Blvd. in South Tampa.

The 48000-sq.-ft. store has two floors with a large dining area on the second floor. It has a fresh cleaner design that seeks to modernize the usual Publix.

There are self check-out lanes lots of grab-and-go fresh foods a free-standing deli two grocery pickup spots and drive-through service at the pharmacy according to progressivegrocer.com.

There‚Äôs also a Publix Aprons Cooking School kiosk located in the center of the new store.

While the Gandy location is a prototype landing the first actual ‚Äúnew‚Äù Publix would give off lots of that exciting energy The Grove developer Mark Gold prides himself on generating.

WHOLE FOODS: The popular and pricey organic grocery chain headquartered in Austin TX and now owned by Amazon was mentioned by more than a dozen Facebook commentors.

Whole Foods would certainly fill a void left by Earth Fare Wesley Chapel‚Äôs first albeit ill-fated organic grocer which shut down after less than a year in existence in 2019 and is now a Total Wine & More (see pg. 34).

Today there are no large organic grocers in the area ‚Äî although Nutrition Smart on BBD is a nice smaller option ‚Äî and Whole Foods would no doubt be a perfect fit in an area that still clamors for family-friendly fresh organic offerings. It also fits The Grove‚Äôs vibe better than just about any other option.

TRADER JOE‚ÄôS: This would be a home run for Gold although also a tough get but as made clear by the Facebook comments of more than 50 posters by far the most popular one.

Wesley Chapel New Tampa and Carrollwood wanted a Trader Joe‚Äôs so badly a few years back that there was a campaign to petition the store online in the hopes of landing a location. Hillsborough County commissioners even got involved in the Tampa efforts.

But alas nothing. New Tampa has since added a Sprouts an Aldi and it appears a Lotte Super Market is coming as well. Trader Joe‚Äôs still has just its location on Swann Ave. in South Tampa.

Could Wesley Chapel break through and succeed where New Tampa didn‚Äôt?

IT BETTER OR WE‚ÄôRE MOVING!!!

(Kidding‚Ä¶.kind of).

WEGMANS: You think we have a lot of Northeasterners living here in Wesley Chapel? Consider this: Wegmans received more online interest than Publix Aldi and Sprouts combined.

In fact the Wegmans discussion spun off into its own little debate. We half expected someone on the thread to start a Wegmans podcast.

Wegmans based in Gates NY has a large organic food selection a hot food bar and really really happy employees making some transplants downright misty-eyed in the comments talking about the store.

Wegmans has a pretty impressive resume being named the best or favorite grocery store in the country by Food Network Consumer Reports subscribers and marketforce.com.

Apparently new openings draw thousands willing to wait in lines.

Janette Vazquez Driesslein used many exclamation points in pleading for a Wegmans and commented that when she moved to Florida in 2004 she reached out to Wegmans about moving stores here. ‚ÄúHere we are almost 20 years later and nope. So sadly I think it‚Äôs pretty unlikely.‚Äù

Janette we agree. Wegmans stores generally only come as far south as North Carolina and don‚Äôt appear to have any plans to expand here.

Road trip?

KROGER: Some transplanted Midwesterners have a soft spot for Kroger and while the chain has no Florida locations a May announcement that the chain is beginning deliveries from a new fulfillment center in Tampa at least gives reason for hope right?

If you love Kroger that much for a $9.95 fee you can order your groceries right off the company‚Äôs website or app.

As for Kroger coming to The Grove? Probably not. But stores in Florida could be in the future.

THE OTHERS: Judging by some of the passionate responses everyone has their favorite grocery store. Thank goodness the Piggly Wiggly folks didn‚Äôt show up en masse or there might have been an actual online brawl.

Some others that were mentioned more than once in the grocery thread include the three-location family-owned Detwiler‚Äôs Farm Market based in Sarasota Texas-based H-E-B which has a cult-like following Sprouts Fresh Market and yes even another Aldi which would be ironic because the location on S.R. 56 was originally approved to be built near The Grove.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9kZWFkbHktZXhwbG9zaW9uLWF0LW9oaW8taG9tZS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvcGl0dHNidXJnaC9uZXdzL2RlYWRseS1leHBsb3Npb24tYXQtb2hpby1ob21lLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explosion At Ohio Home Kills 1 Injures 1; Cause Sought,"NEW HOLLAND Ohio (AP) ‚Äî An explosion at a house in Ohio killed one person and injured another over the weekend authorities said.

The Fayette County sheriff told WBNS-TV that the blast in New Holland was reported at about 7:30 a.m. Saturday.

Cheese Pizza Now Available at Grocery Stores,"‚úñ

If you've ever wanted Chuck E. Cheese pizza without having to actually go to a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant - and without having to order ""Pasqually's Pizza and Wings"" on delivery platforms - your moment has arrived. Chuck E. Cheese has launched two of its handcrafted pizza varieties for home enjoyment with frozen pepperoni and cheese pizzas now popping up in grocery stores. This discovery was noted by @i_need_a_snack_ on Instagram who spotted them at their grocery store and shared them with followers.

""Chuck E. has officially brought his handcrafted pizzas from the arcade to your house!"" the caption reads. ""So now with this newest take home creation your house can be a place ""Where A Kid Can Be A Kid!"" Or just a middle aged adult with all the nostalgia ahah! I present Chuck E. Cheese Pizza!""

The post goes on to explain that the pizzas are available in pepperoni and cheese varieties and comes with 250 e-tickets. The post notes that they found the pizzas at Kroger for $6.99 for an 18.5 oz box and we were able to find a listing on the Kroger website for the cheese variety. It's not clear if it is available nationwide or at all Kroger locations or if other stores carry it as well.

Interestingly enough the arrival of frozen Chuck E. Cheese pizzas isn't the only Chuck E. Cheese news this week. The restaurant recently announced the return of Chuck E. LIVE! in its restaurant after more than a year of the show being on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""For more than a year kids and parents have eagerly awaited Chuck E.'s return to the dance floor ‚Äî and Chuck E.'s been looking forward to this day too"" CEC Entertainment Chief Marketing Officer Sherri Landry said in a statement. ""Chuck E. loves celebrating birthday parties sharing his favorite new music and dance moves and creating special memories every day at Chuck E. Cheese. He's never been more excited to report to the 'office' and we're all ready to once again feel the special energy that he offers our guests when they visit our venues for their first or 100th visit.""

It turns out Tarek El Moussa learned about his ex-wife Christina Haack‚Äôs new romance with Joshua Hall along with the rest of the world! The Flip or Flop star told People:

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know their situation. We‚Äôre kind of just finding out too and just learning.‚Äù

Related: Christina Haack Spotted With Hunky New BF!

Don‚Äôt worry Tarek we bet she also didn‚Äôt warn ex Ant Anstead either! Granted the 42-year-old television host probably doesn‚Äôt care too much since he is hooking up with Ren√©e Zellweger now. But details‚Ä¶

In case you missed it the 38-year-old momma confirmed the secret relationship with the Austin-based realtor on Instagram this week and explained how it was all thanks to psychedelic toad venom that they got together:

‚ÄúWhen we met this past spring the synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore. ‚Ä¶ I felt immediately crazy protective over him and wanted to keep him for myself and get to know each other before the tornado (media attention) hit. We‚Äôve had a few solid months of just us getting to know each other and I‚Äôve loved every second of it.‚Äù

As they say you have to kiss a few frogs to find the right person!

While El Moussa may not have known Christina and Joshua were dating her new man apparently has a surprising connection to the California native. As it turns out his fianc√©e Heather Rae Young previously hosted a podcast with Joshua‚Äôs younger sister Jessica Hall. Talk about a small world right!

According to Us Weekly Young worked with her best friend from March 2020 until earlier this year when former Bachelorette DeAnna Pappas took over as the host of their Flashbacks podcast. The Selling Sunset star explained to People of their tie together:

‚ÄúIt is true. My girlfriend Jessica we‚Äôve been friends for like over 10 years and it‚Äôs just a fluke. You know it was nothing that was planned. It just happened.‚Äù

Crazy coincidence but we guess everyone knows each other in the real estate business! Young also mentioned that she and Tarek have only interacted with Joshua ‚Äúa few times‚Äù but he ‚Äúseems like‚Äù a good guy for Haack. Her beau also added that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúreally know him but I sure hope so.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs hoping it all goes smoothly for the duo! And perhaps Christina will finally introduce her boyfriend to Tarek along with their two children soon. You know so he can get a better read on the guy!

And it‚Äôs poised to be not just the state‚Äôs biggest gathering since the COVID-19 pandemic hit but one of the first major festivals to return nationwide.

Faster Horses which traditionally has drawn 40000-plus daily will hit Michigan International Speedway next weekend for three days of camping country tunes and red-white-and-blue partying as the July tradition notches its eighth installment.

Headliners Luke Combs (Friday) Thomas Rhett (Saturday) and Jason Aldean (Sunday) lead a lineup that‚Äôs unchanged from the bill originally set for last year before Faster Horses and the rest of the concert industry got sidelined by the pandemic.

Faster Horses has typically loaded up on hot hitmakers of the moment with a few veteran acts sprinkled in and this edition is the same: Other main-stage acts include Kelsea Ballerini Chris Lane Jon Pardi and Tracey Lawrence while the Next From Nashville tent will introduce fans to budding acts.

In a nod to Aldean‚Äôs hit of the same name ‚ÄúWe Back‚Äù has been the running tagline for Faster Horses since Live Nation announced in June that the fest was a go just days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outlined the state‚Äôs reopening plans.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

For Brian O‚ÄôConnell ‚Äî the Live Nation president of country touring who's familiar to Faster Horses fans as ‚ÄúB.O.C.‚Äù ‚Äî there‚Äôs a sense of excitement amid the urgency as he and his team get ‚Äúback to work full-tilt boogie with a relatively short runway.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most important things we‚Äôre looking forward to are the obvious ones ‚Äî like the first fan that gets there the first artist that plays the first headliner the first magical festival moment‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut right now we‚Äôre building a city in a hurry. We know that the payoff is coming but we‚Äôre so busy right now we‚Äôre not thinking much in the abstract.‚Äù

More:Jamey Johnson 5000 fans in fine form at first major Detroit concert since pandemic

Attendance won‚Äôt be announced until the festival concludes but officials say they expect crowd numbers to approach those of previous years. If so Faster Horses will be the biggest event in Michigan since Garth Brooks played for 70000 at Ford Field in late February 2020. (At Comerica Park which returned to full capacity in June the largest crowd for a Detroit Tigers game so far has been 34484 on July 5.)

One group that will be missing is the corps of Canadian fans who have trekked across the border for the annual party. Travel between the U.S. and Canada restricted since the early COVID-19 days won‚Äôt be loosened until July 21 three days after the festival wraps up.

O‚ÄôConnell said those ticketholders have been accommodated either with refunds or arrangements to honor their passes and camping packages in 2022.

Faster Horses is the first in Live Nation‚Äôs stable of country festivals to reboot and for more than a year O‚ÄôConnell has been literally counting the days. Speaking Thursday from a Luke Bryan date in Syracuse ‚Äî the executive‚Äôs first concert since the pandemic ‚Äî O‚ÄôConnell was quick to note it had been 487 days since his last show.

He‚Äôs not the only one who has been champing at the bit: For artists and crews Faster Horses is a welcome sign of the return to action as the touring industry gets set to kick back into high gear in coming weeks.

Keeping the fest lineup intact from 2020 turned out to be easier than it might have seemed.

‚ÄúThankfully it was not a stumbling block. We had artist buy-in across the board and that goes to the reputation I believe we‚Äôve built as a festival‚Äù O‚ÄôConnell said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just another festival. It‚Äôs Faster Horses. We‚Äôve worked really really hard on that and the artist buy-in is humbling and speaks to what the team has created in southeastern Michigan.‚Äù

O‚ÄôConnell said his phone lights up every day with texts from artists happy to be hitting the road again ‚Äî and just as happy to get their touring crews working. Those crucial behind-the-scenes folks were among the most financially embattled these past 16 months as live music suffered one of the longest most complete shutdowns of any industry during the pandemic.

Crew Nation a fund launched by Live Nation and supported by a host of top-name artists ultimately generated more than $18 million to sustain those workers during the downtime.

‚ÄúThe artists are grateful for the opportunity to perform their music in front of their fans and roll out their buses with the guys and girls on their crews‚Äù O‚ÄôConnell said. ‚ÄúThey can finally exhale. It‚Äôs obviously been stressful for everybody.‚Äù

Since Faster Horses' debut in 2013 O'Connell and company have talked about fostering a sense of community among fans and the audience has been game for it. Eight festivals in MIS has become the scene of annual traditions and rituals among campers and concertgoers with new friendships romances and even marriages forged.

O'Connell said the big aim for this year ‚Äî after the long months of silent stages ‚Äî was to present a Faster Horses that would be familiar and comfortable to returning fans. Though the staff has made a few operational tweaks behind the scenes there won't be a lot of new bells and whistles out on the grounds.

""This is about delivering the festival fans expect. That's our only goal"" he said. ""We‚Äôve always tried to create a new experience. Our mission this year is just to create the experience. There was so much uncertainty over the last 16 months it was important to make this look as close to what they‚Äôre used to as humanly possible. So that‚Äôs the real achievement.""

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Trump has been suspended from the platforms since January when his followers violently stormed the Capitol building trying to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential win.

The companies cited concerns that Trump would incite further violence and have kept him locked out.

All three declined comment on Wednesday.

'We're asking the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies' illegal shameful censorship of the American people' Trump said of the filings.

'We're going to hold big tech very accountable.'

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

'There's a lot of assets out there that have good IP that will probably get new homes' he said.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

Attendees at the last conference in 2019 included Facebook bosses Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg; Disney's Bob Iger; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki; Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch who is the CEO of Fox Corporation; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman; Instagram COO Marne Levine; McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook and billionaire media executive Shari Redstone.

The conference began in 1982 and in its early days founder Herbert Allen - who co-founded Allen & Company with brother Charles - had to beg invitees to come.

Aircraft that hit supersonic speeds outrace the very air that they're pushing ahead of them and that leads to the sonic booms that everyone below the flight path can hear -- and complain about. But hush darling there may be a way around that.

NASA and Lockheed Martin are building a new incredibly sleek aircraft called the X-59 QueSST which aims to take a lot of the thunder out of supersonic travel. If they can get that plane to produce a milder ""sonic thump"" it's not just an engineering feat. It could bring about a new era of high-speed air travel for all of us who aren't fighter pilots. CNET's Claire Reilly got an exclusive look at the X-59 which you can find right here.

That story and the accompanying video are among the in-depth features and thought-provoking commentaries that appeared on CNET this week. So here you go. These are the stories you don't want to miss:

With the X-59 NASA and Lockheed Martin want to do the seemingly impossible -- build a jet that flies faster than the speed of sound without the explosive boom.

On Dec. 8 2012 members of the U.S. Navy‚Äôs vaunted Naval Special Warfare Development Group better known as SEAL Team 6 were deployed on an high-stakes nighttime raid with a simple goal: rescue a civilian doctor from the clutches of the Taliban.

As the rescue force led by 28-year-old Chief Petty Officer Nicolas Checque approached a building within the Taliban compound a nearby sentry identified the approaching American commandos and darted inside ostensibly to alert his fellow fighters to the coming assault. Realizing the Taliban guards knew they were there and would likely kill the hostage Checque engaged the guard and sprinted through the door to face the enemy according to military records. The mission was in some way a success: The hostage was rescued and flown to safety. But there were casualties‚ÄîChecque was killed by the barrage of close-range fire.

Checque‚Äôs sacrifice isn‚Äôt just another story of courage and valor from the annals of U.S. military history: Just one year later it would end up reigniting the U.S. military‚Äôs attempt to reimagine the warfighter of the future‚Äîone cloaked in the safety of a suit of robotic armor.

The military called this particular Checque-inspired suit the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit or TALOS for short. To the press it was known colloquially as the ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù suit. It was the hottest topic in defense circles‚Äîuntil in 2019 the project was abruptly shut down.

The history of TALOS along with the prototypes that came before it reveals not just the military‚Äôs long-standing fascination with mechanized warfare but also its inability to radically transform the standard tactical kit that‚Äôs been a staple of American troops for decades.

‚ÄúThe fact that personal protective equipment for operators has not significantly changed since WWII was certainly part of the impetus for SOCOM exploring how to provide operators with comprehensive ballistic protections‚Äù Navy Lt. Cmdr. Tim Hawkins a U.S. Special Operations Command spokesman. ‚ÄúNot only that but we wanted to do so while enhancing their tactical capabilities and strategic effectiveness.‚Äù

From Talos to TALOS

Standard combat gear may not have changed much since World War II but that doesn‚Äôt mean that TALOS didn‚Äôt have centuries of military imagination to draw on. According to Adrienne Mayor ‚Äî a Stanford University historian and the author of Gods and Robots: Machines Myths and Ancient Dreams of Technology ‚Äî the TALOS acronym is a tribute to Talos the giant bronze android of Greek myth who patrolled the shores of the island of Crete in epic poems stretching back as far as Homer‚Äôs writings in 700 BC. ‚ÄúExoskeletons and automatons for human enhancement have been in the human imagination for millenia as far back as 2700 years if you go back to the story of Talos‚Äù Mayor said.

‚ÄúThe entire history of technology and war whether it was the very first stone picked up that was more powerful than balling a fist to the first hobnail sandals that the Assyrians used to march further and faster is always about enhancing human performance‚Äù added Peter Singer a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of the novel Ghost Fleet.

Though tales of augmented soldiers are found stretching back through centuries of Western literature the modern idea of powered armor become a fixture of the military imagination when Robert Heinlein introduced the world to a quasi-fascist future of intergalactic warfare with 1959‚Äôs Starship Troopers now a fixture of virtually every official U.S. military reading list. The opening pages of Heinlein‚Äôs classic present the future soldier as a one-man army soaring above enemy forces jet-assisted leaps and bounds clad in an armored exoskeleton reminiscent of ‚Äúa big steel gorilla armed with gorilla-sized weapons.‚Äù Tanks and warships take unparalleled skill to pilot Heinlein wrote but the elegant allure of powered armor for the troops of the future is that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to control the suit; you just wear it like your clothes like skin.‚Äù

Faster stronger more durable and more deadly Heinlein‚Äôs vision of powered armor coincided with the growing engineering feasibility of incorporating robotics into modern combat. The Defense Department has been pursuing the dream of a powered exoskeleton since around the same time that Heinlein‚Äôs vision of future war introduced the concept to pop culture.

In 1961 just two years after the publication of Starship Troopers (and two years before Tony Stark‚Äôs Iron Man suit debuted in the pages of Marvel Comics) the Pentagon invited U.S. defense contractors to submit proposals for a ‚Äúservo soldier‚Äù that was billed as ‚Äúa human tank equipped with power steering and power brakes. The servo soldier ‚Äúwill wear a special suit which will have its own engine enabling him to run faster stop quicker and lift bigger loads than ordinary mortals‚Äù per Armor magazine. ‚ÄúWhat is more he will be immune to germ warfare poison gas and the heat and radiation from nuclear blasts.‚Äù It was the U.S. military‚Äôs first official vision for a robotic super-soldier wrapped in a cocoon of heavy armor the groundwork for the decades of attempts that followed.

That same year an Office of Naval Research grant enabled Cornell University engineer Neil Mizen to develop his so-called ‚ÄúMan Amplifier‚Äù exoskeleton. Built on a series of actuators manipulated through ‚Äúbilateral force feedback‚Äù according to Popular Science Mizen‚Äôs suit ‚Äî a skeletal ungainly patchwork of bulky gray motors ‚Äî could purportedly heft up to 1000 pounds making it ideal for handling heavy munitions and lugging cargo across inhospitable terrain. Indeed the Navy in particular expressed interest in the ‚Äúsuperman suit‚Äù as Popular Science called it ‚Äúto help sailors manhandle torpedoes bombs and machinery in the cramped quarters aboard ships and submarines.‚Äù

Then in 1965 a collaboration between Naval Air Systems Command the Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center and General Electric drew on Mizens‚Äô research to develop a ‚Äúman-augmentation‚Äù system dubbed the Hardiman: a massive hulking 30-joint exoskeletal system driven by hydromechanical servos in which man and machine ‚Äúcan be combined into an intimate symbiotic unit that will perform essentially as one wedded system‚Äù as GE project engineer Ralph S. Mosher wrote at the time.

These two early suits were more equivalent to the power loader from Aliens than Iron Man‚Äôs slick combat armor designed to help troops haul heavy loads over long distances. While GE unveiled the prototype in 1969 the Hardiman suit never came close to that ‚Äúintimate symbiotic‚Äù blend that Mosher envisioned: a 1971 report said the system could never advance above two miles an hour thanks to ‚Äúviolent and uncontrollable motion by the machine‚Äù rendering the apparatus useless in any potential combat application.

The first true combat application of the powered armor concept appeared in the 1980s. Developed by Jeff Moore of the Los Alamos National Laboratory‚Äôs Advanced Weapons Technology Group the ‚ÄúPitman suit‚Äù cocooned the operator in 500 pounds of fiberglass and ceramic armor to provide ‚Äúenhanced special forces capability for low intensity conflicts and counterterrorism‚Äù the exact sort of door-kicking that would lead to Checque‚Äôs death decades later. Operated by brain patterns rather than a physical mechanism the suit proved an engineering pipe dream its core functions unattainable by the technology of the time.

Indeed the Pitman ‚Äúsuit of armor‚Äù exoskeleton concept proved so technologically unfeasible that it fell out of favor with military planners after the Army quickly stood up and abandoned yet another powered armor attempt at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in the early 1990s. It wouldn‚Äôt be until Checque‚Äôs death that the Pentagon returned to the idea of a combat-ready suit in earnest. (And if it seems like these projects are overlapping that‚Äôs because they are: As the SOCOM spokesperson explained ‚ÄúSomeone comes along and picks up the research and adds to it and then it gets dropped for whatever reason until someone else comes along to pick it up.‚Äù)

Frustrated by the complexity of a full-body system the Pentagon shifted its focus to a more stripped-down concept in the mid-1990s with its so-called Battle Dress System an Army Special Operations Command-specific all-weather uniform that was designed to ‚Äúaccept the addition of emerging communications sensor and weapons technologies.‚Äù More akin to bad weather coveralls than a suit of armor Hawkins confirmed that the BDS was intended to function as a ‚Äústealth suit‚Äù with unique camouflage capabilities. Around the turn of the century the Army incorporated its past lessons into the Future Force Warrior concept a futuristic combat uniform more akin to something out of Demolition Man or Judge Dredd than a conventional personal protective system but that system though it yielded a handful of demonstrators in the early 2000s as part of the Army‚Äôs Future Combat System modernization program never matured into a kit effective enough for fielding.

This stripped-down approach persisted well into the 2000s when the sudden technological feasibility of powered exoskeletons induced the Pentagon to pivot back to its pursuit of Tony Stark technologies that were more focused on logistics rather than combat. In 2001 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) yet another military tech incubator awarded two $50 million grants for the development of exoskeleton prototypes: one to Lockheed Martin and another to Raytheon. Both projects consisted of exoskeletons focused on reducing strain on the lower legs and back. Though both failed at developing versions of the technology that were ready for the field they established that robotics had finally advanced to a point where exoskeletons could actually enhance the movement of future soldiers. Indeed exoskeletons the core of any futuristic powered armor had suddenly entered the realm of the possible though the focus had again shifted back to logistics.

‚ÄúThe weaponized sci-fi-sexy version is always going to get more attention but the logistics side has always had an actual commercial equivalent driving it forward‚Äù said Ghost Fleet author Singer. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always been that R&D work related to the construction field and other private-sector projects and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre still drawing on. We‚Äôll end up seeing this in non-combat applications first.‚Äù

With U.S. troops now regularly hauling upwards of 100 pounds of gear into combat a robotic assist to the legs is a welcome change ‚Äî though none of these exoskeletons on their own would make much of a difference to commandos like Checque who are first through the door during a firefight. Luckily these efforts weren‚Äôt for nothing: According to Hawkins DARPA provided researchers with details on past exoskeleton efforts to better inform the TALOS‚Äô construction. Even better SOCOM also spent a year conducting market research not just among the defense industry but ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù partners like research universities while developing a clear operational concept for the project.

Imagining the ‚ÄòIron Man suit‚Äô

SOCOM first announced the TALOS suit in 2013 with an ambitious vision for the final product depicted in a corny promotional video: an armor-plated soldier capable of withstanding direct fire from small arms like those that killed Checque in Afghanistan. But when Army Lt. Col. Alex MacCalman revealed the results of the five-year effort at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in Tampa Florida in May 2019 the final product was anything but.

MacCalman was the ideal man for the job. MacCalman had spent two years on U.S. Special Operations Command‚Äôs TALOS task force first as the chief engineer and then as program director. A former 7th Special Forces Group deployed analyst MacCalman was in Afghanistan with the Army‚Äôs elite Delta Force in 2012 when Checque burst through the door of that Taliban compound. (Hawkins the SOCOM spokesman confirmed that Checque‚Äôs death was the direct inspiration for the TALOS program. MacCalman declined to comment for this story).

SOCOM had a laundry list of capabilities in mind: increased survivability through enhanced ballistic protection and an exoskeleton that ‚Äúsupports near unconstrained movement‚Äù while managing heavy loads a ‚Äúbase layer‚Äù with integrated biomedical monitoring and thermoregulation a heads-up display that integrated intelligence and operational data and a boost in ‚Äúsurgical lethality‚Äù that involved creating ‚Äúoptions for novel weapons integration.‚Äù

The final product would be a vision from the future at least according to early designs included in MacCalman‚Äôs presentation in Tampa: a robotically-muscled warfighter clad in a suit of armor like something from a recent installment of the Halo franchise.

The engineering results of the five-year TALOS effort came closer to producing a suit of armor than any previous attempt in Pentagon history. The program had yielded roughly 10 ‚Äúmature‚Äù subsystems: among them advanced new body armor an augmented reality heads-up display and a lower-body exoskeleton that was designed to significantly reduce wear and tear on the legs and back. The result was by most measures a revolutionary step above standard-issue body armor.

But even with 50 years of research and the might of the U.S. military-industrial complex behind it the JATF-TALOS program fell short of its goal of true futuristic glory ripped from Heinlein‚Äôs pages. Though the program yielded a slew of advanced systems the Pentagon‚Äôs latest stab at a suit of unified powered armor ended up essentially dead in the water. In February 2019 a spokesman for the program confirmed that SOCOM had ‚Äúno intent to field the TALOS Mk 5 combat suit prototype‚Äù beyond a mere demonstration. By May MacCalman was delivering that super-suit‚Äôs eulogy to a crowded room at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in Tampa.

With the program disbanded people like MacCalman moved on to work in other armed forces acquisition programs. According to Hawkins the suit itself is now quite literally collecting dust in a box somewhere.

According to SOCOM the ghosts of past exoskeletons underpin the end of the TALOS program. The fatal flaw of the combat prototype as SOCOM spokesman Hawkins explained lies in the suit‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplex subsystem interdependencies‚Äù ‚Äî the inability for the subsystems from the exoskeleton to the suit‚Äôs helmet assembly power and communications to operate together as a cohesive whole. There‚Äôs a level of choreographed interconnectivity that comes with overlaying so many complex systems on top of one another and these individual systems must operate together seamlessly for the suit to actually achieve that man-machine fusion that Heinlein envisioned nearly a half-century ago. Even with advances in computing and miniaturization there were too many disparate parts for TALOS to function effectively.

That‚Äôs not to say the suit was a total failure: As Hawkins told me the program the mature subsystems yielded by JATF-TALOS will almost certainly see potential adoption elsewhere in the U.S. military. Indeed the body armor in particular is among its most promising mature subsystems: made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ‚Äî a substance lighter but more durable than standard armor plates ‚Äî it‚Äôs currently undergoing field testing by active-duty SOF units which means better protection for door-kickers like Checque just as the TALOS program intended in the first place. The unified ‚ÄòIron Man‚Äô suit may be dead but its spare parts will likely live on in other Pentagon programs of record ‚Äî and if fully matured in the coming years end up actually achieving the TALOS program‚Äôs original goal of better survivability albeit in a different form.

The end of the TALOS program doesn‚Äôt mean that the Pentagon has permanently abandoned some sort of exoskeleton for infantry troops. Lockheed Martin‚Äôs new exoskeleton currently the apple of the Army‚Äôs eye is essentially a robotic motorized knee brace designed to lessen fatigue on hostile terrain; and the Marine Corps is on the verge of testing out a full-body exoskeleton that could haul pallets full of gear so the average grunt doesn‚Äôt blow out his back doing the task.

More importantly just as the Hardiman Man Amplifier and the Pitman suit helped inform TALOS so might SOCOM‚Äôs supersuit one day inform yet another attempt at powered combat armor. As Hawkins put it the research is ‚Äúlaying around‚Äù for Pentagon engineers to examine at any time. And that day could come sooner than you think: As Singer pointed out China is currently testing a powered exoskeleton designed to help infantry members carry roughly 100 pounds of gear with ease and with the Pentagon hyping a pivot to ‚Äúgreat power competition‚Äù military planners have an incentive to track Beijing‚Äôs progress and adapt accordingly.

After more than 50 years of research the Pentagon‚Äôs vision of a machine-powered ‚Äúservo soldier‚Äù remains no closer to becoming a reality than it once was. But as TALOS goes to show the dream of powered combat armor persists in wayward laboratories and annexes of the U.S. military ‚Äî and while the vaunted combat suit may be hidden away in storage somewhere it lies in wait for the next innovative researcher to take a stab at making the Pentagon‚Äôs vision of a mechanized super soldier a reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL2EzNjk0NTUxMi9mLTE2LWhpc3Rvcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the F-16 Is Such a Badass Plane | F-16 History,"When U.S. Air Force Captain Gary ‚ÄúNordo‚Äù North took off as leader of a flight of four F-16s on a December morning in 1992 the Fighting Falcon was already a globally respected‚Äîand feared‚Äîfighter. By then more than 2500 F-16s had been delivered worldwide amassing nearly 5 million flight hours.

But that Sunday morning North cared only about the two-seat F-16D he was flying and the three others from his ‚ÄúTop Hats‚Äù 310th Fighter Squadron. They were aloft on the border of southern Iraq as part of Operation Southern Watch patrolling the no-fly zone that the U.S. U.K. and France had established following the Gulf War.

As the flight met up with a KC-135 tanker North and his backseater in ‚ÄúBenji 41‚Äù (the F-16D‚Äôs call sign) heard intense communications between another flight of four F-15 Eagles and an E-3 AWACS airborne control aircraft. An Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) MiG-25 Foxbat had crossed into the no-fly zone baited the Americans and hustled back north at supersonic speed with the F-15s in chase.

In full afterburner the Eagles quickly exhausted their fuel and were forced to leave. That left Nordo‚Äôs F-16s as the go-to American fighters in the area. As described in Craig Brown‚Äôs Debrief: A Complete History of U.S. Aerial Engagements  North and his wingman cut their refueling short taking on only enough gas to cover their assigned patrol time and leaving the two remaining Top Hats to fully refuel.

‚ÄúSomeone was going to die within the next two minutes‚Ä¶and it wasn‚Äôt going to be me or my wingman.‚Äù

Almost immediately AWACS controllers vectored the pair of F-16s toward another Iraqi MiG heading for the no-fly zone which quickly turned back north. In quick succession the E-3 picked up two more Iraqi fighters. Each time North‚Äôs F-16s turned toward them they turned away from the no-fly zone. But a third entering the zone 30 miles west at 30000 feet kept flying east‚Äîstraight toward Benji 41.

While the other two F-16s scrambled to the area from the tanker Nordo lit his afterburner turning his jet and his wingman north to trap the MiG south of them in the no-fly zone. The IQAF fighter couldn‚Äôt flee back to Iraqi territory without a fight.

‚ÄúSomeone was going to die within the next two minutes‚Äù North recalled ‚Äúand it wasn‚Äôt going to be me or my wingman.‚Äù

In addition to two short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles Benji 41 was carrying a pair of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) on its wingtips. North visually picked up the MiG-25 eight miles off his nose. Calling the E-3 for clearance to fire he also told his wingman to go active with his electronic jamming pod. A long 15 seconds later North heard ‚ÄúCleared to kill cleared to kill Bandit Bandit!‚Äù from the AWACS controller .

Nordo fired an AIM-120 calling ‚ÄúFox!‚Äù as it came off his wingtip. The AMRAAM closed on the MiG-25 at Mach 4 shattering it into three large pieces and a fireball in seconds. Diving in afterburner North and his wingman scooted south at top speed.

Despite almost two decades of service North‚Äôs was the first aerial kill for an American F-16.

The Lightweight

Read the Story Popular Mechanics / Ed Valigursky An illustration of the YF-16 published in the November 1975 issue of Popular Mechanics.

As with every fourth-generation U.S. fighter the F-16 was defined by the Air Force‚Äôs experience in Vietnam. In the late 1960s former Air Force fighter pilot Colonel John Boyd and a group of fighter technology analysts known as ‚Äúthe Fighter Mafia‚Äù called for development of a highly maneuverable lightweight fighter aircraft that would be an alternative to heavy complex fighters like the F-4 Phantom F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle‚Äîsome of which were still in design stages.

This idea gained funding and quickly evolved into the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program. In February 1972 six manufacturers submitted design proposals all based on two prime considerations: turning radius and acceleration.

Two months later the General Dynamics Model 401-16B and the Northrop P-600 were chosen for development and a 300-hour fly-off at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Known as YF-16 and YF-17 the prototypes both weighed in at about 20000 pounds empty which was relatively light compared with the 28000-pound F-15 and the 40000-pound F-14.

A team including General Dynamics chief designer Harry Hillaker rolled the YF-16 out in December 1973 just 21 months after the development contract was placed. The diminutive largely aluminum single-engine design incorporated a cropped delta wing blended with the fuselage body. Forward wing strakes an underslung intake and aft underbody ventral fins contributed to a dynamically unstable configuration controlled by the world‚Äôs first fly-by-wire production flight control system.

Combined with a 23840-pound-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-100 afterburning turbofan the purposely unstable design offered a 1.4-to-1 thrust-to-weight ratio eyeball-popping 9G maneuver capability and exceptional pilot visibility under a frameless bubble canopy.

But the YF-16 still needed to provide itself against Northrop‚Äôs competition. After 10 months of testing it was clear that the YF-16 had significantly better maneuverability a longer range and a lower cost than the YF-17. In January 1975 the Air Force pronounced it the winner of the competition and said Uncle Sam would buy at least 650 of them. But the YF-17 didn‚Äôt disappear into obscurity; it would go on to form the bones for the U.S. Navy‚Äôs future F/A-18 Hornet.

The F-16 Reaches Fighter Fame

Despite its initial lightweight day-fighter emphasis the F-16 would immediately develop into a multi-role fighter-bomber. As the LWF was underway NATO allies Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Norway were on the lookout for a replacement for their Lockheed F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers. The similarly sized single-engine YF-16 fit perfectly.

The USAF was also looking to cost-effectively replace the fighter-bomber capabilities of its F-105s and F-4s with an aircraft that could mix with the air-superiority-focused F-15. These imperatives drove changes to the first production F-16s which included a longer fuselage (by 10.6 inches) increased wing area larger ventral fins and two more underwing weapons stations. A larger nose radome also accommodated a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar. As a result weight was increased by 25 percent over the YF-16.

The U.S. Air Force accepted its first production F-16A in January 1979. The 34th Tactical Fighter Squadron became the first unit to fly the F-16 which was officially named ‚ÄúFighting Falcon‚Äù in July 1980. By that time two European production lines had been started and the Belgian Royal Netherlands and Norwegian air forces began receiving F-16As. So did the Israelis.

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) called the F-16 ‚ÄúNetz‚Äù (Hawk) and threw it into combat less than a year after taking delivery. In July 1981 the IAF launched Operation Opera which saw eight F-16As each carrying two unguided 2000-pound bombs boldly fly into Iraq escorted by six IAF F-15As where they struck a nuclear reactor.

The Fighting Falcon‚Äôs first aerial victories came courtesy of the IAF in April 1982 when a Netz shot down a Syrian Air Force MiG-23. That June Israeli F-16s took on more Syrian MiGs during the conflict in Lebanon ultimately being credited with 44 kills.

Its early success in combat combined with its relatively low cost and versatility made the F-16 a hot seller. By May 1982 Venezuela was already the 10th Fighting Falcon customer. In April 1983 the USAF Thunderbirds demonstration team flew its first public air show with F-16s.

From Turkey to Thailand the F-16 was in high demand. Today this fighter is or has been operated by 25 countries and 4588 have been built making the F-16 the second most produced American supersonic jet fighter after the F-4 Phantom. According to Lockheed Martin there have been 10 production blocks of the F-16 from Block 1 in 1979 to the latest Block 70/72 generically known as the F-16V. Between countries blocks and models a total of 139 versions of the jet have been produced over the past four decades.

The Viper and the Weasel

David Poole // Getty Images Illustration of F-16A fighter jets during Operation Desert Storm.

Over the decades the F-16 has unofficially been referred to as ‚Äúthe Viper.‚Äù The name was given it by early F-16 pilots at Hill Air Force Base in Utah reportedly referring to its look before takeoff or to spacecraft in the popular late-‚Äô70s sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica.

Retired USAF Lieutenant Colonel Dan Hampton remembers the first time he saw an F-16 up close. After graduating from flight school in 1987 Hampton went to Luke Air Force Base in Arizona to transition to the Viper. He showed up on a Saturday when things were slow.

‚ÄúI remember dropping my stuff off in the visiting officers‚Äô quarters and driving over to the squadron. Nobody was around. I got out on the flight line and walked up to an airplane. It was the first time I‚Äôd actually seen an F-16 up close. I couldn‚Äôt even get in it but I was thrilled.‚Äù

After training in the F-16A which Hampton and fellow pilots called ‚Äúcoal burners‚Äù because of their age and early F100 engines he went to his first operational unit at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany to learn the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) mission basically taking out enemy surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites using the F-16C. The Air Force called these missions and the aircraft that flew them ‚ÄúWild Weasels.‚Äù

Hampton would go on to fly 151 Wild Weasel sorties in the Viper during both Gulf Wars becoming one of the most decorated Air Force pilots since the Vietnam War. The F-16 he says was and is an ideal Wild Weasel platform owing to its small size (which makes it hard to spot on radar or visually) its modular design (making upgrades easy) and its agility.

‚ÄúThe great thing about the Viper‚Ä¶was that you could do the air-to-air fight on your way into and out of the target area‚Äù Hampton says. ‚ÄúIn the second Gulf War they sent all the [F-15C] Eagles home after the first 10 days. They weren‚Äôt needed because we were there.‚Äù

On one Wild Weasel sortie near Baghdad which Hampton describes in his book  he and his wingman were diverted from SAM killing to intercept Iraqi helicopters attempting to spirit Saddam Hussein away from U.S. forces. The two F-16s rolled in through a cloud break ‚Äúwith everything in Baghdad shooting at us‚Äù and dropping cluster bombs on nearby anti-aircraft sites.

‚ÄúWhen we found the helicopters we hit one with a Maverick [air-to-ground missile] strafed a couple more and my wingman put an AIM-9 [Sidewinder] into one‚Äù Hampton told Popular Mechanics. ‚ÄúThe helo was about to lift off and my wingman didn‚Äôt have any other ordnance left so he shot the Sidewinder at him. There were missions where we used everything we had.‚Äù

The Future of the F-16

ARIS MESSINIS // Getty Images A UAE Air Force F-16 takes off from Andravida Greece April 19 2021.

F-16 production is still going strong at the plant in Greenville South Carolina owned by Lockheed Martin which acquired General Dynamics‚Äô aircraft business in 1993. Right now there‚Äôs a 128-jet backlog for the latest Block 70/72 version ordered by five nations.

Among those nations is Taiwan which will put F-16Vs to vital use facing China across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan‚Äôs new Block 70 Vipers will leverage advanced scanned-array radars more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engines and AGM-158C long-range anti-ship missiles to dissuade China.

With the U.S. Air Force extending the lives of its older F-16s to 12000 flight hours the aircraft could possibly serve into the late 2030s. And the USAF‚Äôs recently muted desire for a non-stealthy Multi-Role Fighter (MR-X) to replace many of its Vipers could see it revisit the aborted delta-wing F-16XL  among other designs.

For the present F-16s around the world will add to the more than 19 million flight hours flown by the type to date. But with all its abilities its best feature is also its most important one‚Äîtaking care of its pilots.

But Who Is He Taking for a Ride? ‚Äì Mother Jones,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

Hours before he blasted into space on his own private rocket billionaire Richard Branson posted a goofy video of himself reveling in the moment: The 70-year old cheerfully pedals on a performance road bike across an airfield in the dawn flanked by immaculate matching Range Rovers and arrives at his very own spaceport to greet his fellow space traveling employees. There was real joy in the day‚Äôs main event‚Äîand space travel does represent literally the outer limits of what mankind can achieve‚Äîbut the trip wasn‚Äôt just a joyride or simply for the sake of science of course.

It‚Äôs a beautiful day to go to space. We‚Äôve arrived at @Spaceport_NM. Get ready to watch LIVE at 7:30 am PT | 10:30 am ET | 3:30 pm BST https://t.co/PcvGTmA661 #Unity22 pic.twitter.com/4KjGPpjz0M ‚Äî Richard Branson (@richardbranson) July 11 2021

Like fellow billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk who have recently captured headlines for their own privately financed space programs Branson runs a very big business. Branson has been trying for almost two decades to get a space tourism endeavor off the ground catering mainly to people like him‚Äîthe extremely wealthy who can afford to pay the $250000 ticket. Bezos and Musk are also shilling space tourism services although their plans have colossally higher price tags. To be fair the other two billionaires are offering to take clients much much farther than Branson whose flight only reached 60 miles above the earth. Musk will charge $55 million to take a passenger to the International Space Station while Bezos will charge a mere $28 million but will also sit next to the paying passenger himself.

All three billionaires are also pursuing loftier awards. This past April a subsidiary of Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic announced it had won a $35 million contract from the Space Force‚Äîthe newly created space wing of the US military‚Äîto transport satellites into low-earth orbit. For their part both Bezos and Musk seem to be aiming at a wholesale replacement of NASA. Musk‚Äôs SpaceX has contracts to deliver supplies to the International Space Station and Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin has won its own contracts to develop among other things a nuclear-powered spaceship.

Around the same time Branson won his satellite contract NASA awarded Musk‚Äôs SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract from NASA to send a man to the moon an outsourcing of what was once the US government‚Äôs most successful technical accomplishment. Musk beat out Bezos for the contract and a handful of defense contractors who for decades have been the primary recipient of government aerospace contracts.

For all of their iconoclasm derring-do and technical wizardy (SpaceX‚Äôs ability to land its used booster rockets on a floating barge is remarkable) Musk Bezos and Branson are accomplishing their takeover of a government space program the same way their rivals in the defense industry have always done it: lobbying. Bezos is challenging Musk‚Äôs big moon-landing contract with his own army of lobbyists and the aid of his local lawmaker US Senator Maria Cantwell who has introduced legislation to give NASA money to pay for Blue Origin to get its own moon-landing project.

SpaceX has spent at least $17.5 million on lobbying the federal government over the last ten years while Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin space company has spent a more modest $7 million since it started hiring K Street firms to push its interest in D.C. (but has also had the benefit of partnering with defense contractors like Lockheed Martin on some of its efforts). Virgin lobbied much more heavily in the early 2000s as it was cobbling its space program together (and trying to get a subsidiary of its airline into the American market) but Branson still dumped a quarter million dollars into wooing Washington last year.

Showy events like Branson‚Äôs edge-of-space flight on Sunday can perhaps also be seen in another light: This is an elite group of oligarchs seeking to brand themselves as heirs to the vaunted taxpayer-funded US space program‚Äîpotential profits and all‚Äîdespite that in recent years they have gotten billions in contracts and subsidies and some paid zero federal income taxes."

Rob Lowe recently made headlines when he spoke about being neighbors with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in his ""sleepy little town"" of Montecito California.

Lowe is one of the many celebrities who call Montecito home joining the likes of Oprah Winfrey Ariana Grande and Ellen DeGeneres.

But it was the Duke and Duchess of Sussex whom Lowe said had changed the small Santa Barbara County town with Lowe telling E News that they were the cause of longer lines at his local Starbucks.

Complete with a kitschy cosmic outlook Pet Shop Boys had a sound that connected with the glitterati‚Äôs appetite for slightly weird music. Ballads like ‚ÄúAlways On My Mind‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo West‚Äù stand with the great tentpole anthems of their age they won‚Äôt appear on my list. This is merely a selection that is theirs and theirs alone.

‚ÄúSuburbia‚Äù: This pounding samba number from the duo‚Äôs first album epitomizes the early hook-laden numbers that decorated Pet Shop Boys‚Äô eighties work. Splashing through the speakers with sophisticated patterns the song shimmies to the rhythms that originated on the Latin channels. More importantly Neil Tennant ‚Äì a former pop journalist turned pop star ‚Äì decorates the playful number with a levity that proved as instrumental to the band‚Äôs success as their impressive range of kaleidoscopic choruses.

‚ÄúOpportunities (Let‚Äôs Make Lots of Money)‚Äù: Before they‚Äôd properly found their feet the band hungry for chart success managed to nail the chorus from the get-go. ‚ÄúWest End Girls‚Äù won them their coveted No.1 but there was more to these boys than hairstyles and sharp suits. Take ‚ÄúOpportunities (Let‚Äôs Make Lots of Money)‚Äù Tennant‚Äôs biting reflection of the currency that swamped his life‚Äôs work. OK some of the chord changes are just showing off but any song that can rhyme ‚ÄúSorbonne‚Äù with that most coveted of ‚Äúdon‚Äù is already onto a winner. Chris Lowe‚Äôs solo is another career-high for the keyboardist.

‚ÄúWhat Have I Done To Deserve This?‚Äù: Pet Shop Boys threw themselves deep into the sonic fabric of the eighties on their second studio album. With its dazzling exhibition of synth hooks drum loops and soaring choruses Actually is every bit as good as you remember it as. Typical of an eighties release the album holds one foot in the contemporary decade while the other leads to the decade that gifted Phil Collins and Kim Wilde their signature Motown hits. Dusty Springfield was invited to join them delivering one of the smokiest vocals of her later days.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs A Sin‚Äù: Actually is the thinking person‚Äôs Pet Shop Boys album. This coruscation of the Catholic Church encourages repeat listens. Hitting the UK No.1 position the group‚Äôs most polemical statement was also their most bouncy most rewarding and ‚Äî for the lack of a better pun ‚Äî one of their more divine.

‚ÄúDomino Dancing‚Äù: Five songs in and keyboardist Chris Lowe finally gets his moment of glory! Plastered over the salsa drum beat Lowe‚Äôs slick keyboards splash in many circular directions. Zoning in on the lovers who waltz their way in and out of Tennant‚Äôs lamented tale Lowe accelerates the synths to the rhythms of the fight. More than anything else there is a wistful melody in the verses reflecting a gravitas seldom heard in a Latin Rock number.

‚ÄúLeft To My Own Devices‚Äù: To this writer‚Äôs ears this is the twosome‚Äôs lushest production and certainly their most detailed. Exceptionally well put together the song feels like a love letter to the days when progressive pop was king. No less a luminary than Yes vocalist Trevor Horn oversaw production of the track.

‚ÄúCan You Forgive Her?‚Äù: With Reagan and Thatcher making way for younger more colorful politicians the pop arena felt duty-bound to follow in their colossal footsteps. Never one to shy away from the public eye Tennant emerged from the sidelines as a gay pop star. ‚ÄúCan You Forgive Her?‚Äù is a gorgeous portrait of heterosexual disharmony.

‚ÄúNew York City Boy‚Äù: Typical of the Pet Shop Boys they end the 20th-century dancing (rather than crying) the night away. Complete with a bass-heavy backing and an infectious hook ‚ÄúNew York City Boy‚Äù is every bit the spiritual successor to the fan-favorite ‚ÄúGo West.‚Äù That this should come directly from the group‚Äôs pen and not the Village People‚Äôs only furthered the pioneering pair‚Äôs talents.

‚ÄúDid You See Me Coming?‚Äù: Neil Tennant friends with Johnny Marr since the electric eighties had sung back-up on Electronic‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Away With It‚Äù; here the seminal guitarist pops up to return the favor. This is the pair‚Äôs most overt exercise in country music its acoustic jangle and gravelly percussion the trademarks of a Willie Nelson single. And just as fans fear they‚Äôre becoming too ‚ÄúAmericanised‚Äù Tennant‚Äôs whimsical vocal returns the song to the music hall where it almost certainly hailed from.

‚ÄúDreamland‚Äù: In all respects a commercial recording ‚ÄúDreamland‚Äù is driven by a startling synth hook and artful vision. Aiding them on their journey to the top of the pop charts comes Years & Years‚Äô Olly Alexander the Harrogate singer‚Äôs mellifluous tones following Tennant‚Äôs yearningly romantic falsetto with shepherded ease. If unit sales were the measure by which the band based the song‚Äôs merit they must have been satisfied with the outcome. Released on September 11 2019 the song shot onto the Billboard Dance Charts. Even for someone with as impressive a falsetto as Tennant‚Äôs this was an enviable high!

Will there be fans at the Tokyo Olympics?

On July 82021 the Olympics organizers announced that all spectators would be banned from this year's games.

The move comes after Japan declared a state of emergency that's meant to curb a wave of new Covid-19 infections.

The state of emergency will begin on Monday July 12 2020 and run through to August 22.

The news is the latest setback for the Summer Olympics that has already been delayed for a year and racked up high costs because of the postponement.

Before the news organizers had already banned international fans from attending the games and set a cap on domestics crowds at 50 percent capacity or up to 10000 people.

More than 11000 competitors are expected to travel to Japan to compete and thousands of officials and staff are also set to attend.

According to Reuters because of the delays the games‚Äô budget has already jumped to an estimated $15.4billion and ticket revenue of about $815million will likely fall to near zero after barring spectators.

The Tokyo Olympics is scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 8.

The opening ceremony will take place on July 23.

The first two days will include the preliminary matches of football and softball one of the new sports to be introduced to the Olympics.

In total the Tokyo Games will feature 339 events across 33 sports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFjby10cmlidW5lLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIxLzA3L21pdGNoLWxvd2UtY28tZm91bmRlci1vZi1uZXRmbGl4LWFtZXJpY2FuLXNlcmllcy1hcmUtc28tcHJlZGljdGFibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mitch Lowe co-founder of Netflix: ‚ÄúAmerican series are so predictable‚Äù,"We talked to the co-founder of Netflix about European cinema the future of the industry and why he thinks the Monaco Streaming Festival is a sign of the times.

The industry had come a long way since Netflix was mailing DVDs to its clients. Yet twenty years later Mitch Lowe is still at the forefront of innovation. ‚ÄúI think this is a period of Renaissance for the arts‚Äù he says when we meet before the start of the Monaco Streaming Film Festival of which he is the co-director. The festival is dedicated entirely to streamed content ‚Äì a first for the industry. ‚ÄúBecause the tools to create art media literature are all so easily accessible.‚Äù

A high-school dropout after leaving Netflix Mitch Lowe continued his run as a film start-up founder developing the likes of Redbox and MoviePass a movie theatre subscription service.

I find it very surprising that no one has done this before.

Tell us about Monaco‚Äôs newest film festival. Do you think it‚Äôs been a long time coming?

I actually find it very surprising that no one has done this before that no one has understood this acceleration in the way we consume entertainment. So yes I do think that a festival like ours is something that is long overdue.

Would you say you are a rival to Cannes?

Not exactly. I do think the entertainment industry is slow to adapt. What we‚Äôre doing here in Monaco is really the future. Trying to get people to Cannes is a little bit outdated. But rather than a rival the Monaco Streaming Festival could be a complement to the Croisette. Our festival is conveniently hosted a week before Cannes so I think it will be a great supplement and leader for the future.

Personally I am more interested in foreign stories. I think they are much more original.

How do you think the film industry is going to change?

We must recognise that as our attention spans get shorter there are other ways to create stories than through a two-hour movie or even a series of 30-minute episodes. Stories can be told through a sequence of TikTok clips or YouTube clips. Snapchat is already doing 5-minute episodes. I also know that TikTok is interested in teaching their content creators how to tell stories. There is without a doubt a shift in the industry.

What will the stories of the future look like?

I think that overtime we will still build long stories that will make you fall in love with the characters but the stories will be told in bitesize segments ‚Äì almost like the clips you watch on Facebook. This is precisely why I was excited to work with Tony and Carmen (co-founders of the festival ed.). The Monaco Streaming Festival is a recognition that there is a whole range of streamed content which is going to dominate in the future.

We created a culture at Netflix that inspired people to be innovative and to be comfortable with failure which allowed people to experiment and to innovate the competition.

Now that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU European streaming platforms will have to adapt to European laws which require anywhere from 30 to 60 per cent of their content to be European. Do you think that we are witnessing a cultural shift away from English-speaking content?

Personally I am more interested in foreign stories. I think they are much more original. American series are so predictable. European stories I just find incredibly fascinating. As for streaming platforms I am not at Netflix any longer so I cannot speak for them. But there has been a huge trend at Netflix for diversity. There‚Äôs been a big change on the executive over the last years which is now focusing on having more local content as part of their service. They have been supporting filmmaking in Latin America Europe and Asia and are going to do much more. I don‚Äôt think they needed the new European rules to push them to do this. It is what they wanted to do anyway because having more locally made content is a way of serving the community better.

Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry the author of the Little Prince was believe or not an amazing business adviser. He said once: ‚ÄúIf you want your team to build a ship get them to yearn for the open sea‚Äù.

Getting in business can be very daunting. Why do you think you succeeded?

I think we created a culture at Netflix that inspired people to be innovative and to be comfortable with failure which allowed people to experiment and to innovate the competition. And focus is key. The co-CEO would always tell us to do the one thing that we did better than anyone else. Had we done three or four different things I do not think we would have been as successful. Take advertising. We had people offering us millions of dollars to advertise but we always refused because we wanted to keep our focus on the client and the product.

How do you foster that creativity?

You don‚Äôt tell people how to do something you tell them what you want to accomplish. Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry the author of the Little Prince was believe or not an amazing business adviser. He said once: ‚Äúif you want your team to build a ship get them to yearn for the open sea‚Äù. In other words inspire your team to do what you want to do rather than telling them how to do. Get them excited about the idea and they will figure how to build the most amazing ship. If you can inspire your team and never micro-manage them then they will produce amazing innovation.

ROTHESAY ‚Äì Before attending one of their classes visitors can now browse Yoga Haus‚Äô selection of lululemon products in the yoga studio‚Äôs boutique.

The co-founders of Yoga Haus Stephanie Downey and Jason MacLean say partnering with the popular athletic apparel brand is perfect for their business as they launch their ‚Äúnew beginning‚Äù following a difficult pandemic year.

‚ÄúThere is definitely a feeling of bluer skies ahead‚Äù said MacLean. ‚ÄúWe thought we‚Äôre not going anywhere let‚Äôs do everything we can in our power to make this an incredible business that people love to support and are excited to support and we‚Äôve heard nothing but positive feedback so far.‚Äù

MacLean and Downey have traveled the world practicing yoga and in their 20 years of experience they‚Äôve become big fans of lululemon‚Äôs products.

‚ÄúWe practice all over the world we‚Äôve experienced a lot of different yoga products and that‚Äôs one of the brands that we‚Äôve experienced and have had some incredible longevity with‚Äù said Downey.

Yoga Haus‚Äô boutique has products from lululemon‚Äôs categories of apparel and accessories. Downey says the product selection is expected to grow as lululemon releases new items.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs of course based on availability and accessibility to their new products and their new releases and each time that they do have a new release we‚Äôll be expanding our inventory and all of those categories‚Äù she said.

The yoga studio opened its doors in 2012 with yoga classes for all levels of ability with the goal of making yoga accessible to all. They offer classes for beginners and experts alike along with classes targeted to people with disabilities children and seniors.

In 2020 they began offering online classes in the wake of the pandemic and after finding more of an online client base Downey and MacLean plan on continuing to grow their digital presence moving forward.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in entrepreneurship you‚Äôre looking for how you navigate the challenges that you‚Äôre faced with and turn it into something else‚Äù said Downey. ‚ÄúWith the online platform we were able to kind of push ourselves into new realms with the business and expand on your business in that respect that we otherwise may not have taken on.‚Äù

With their boutique now featuring lululemon products they hope to bring more people to their studio in-person in addition to the online presence they‚Äôve built by offering the equipment to match the experience.

‚ÄúThe goal is to bring the benefits of yoga to the people in New Brunswick and abroad and to make it really accessible and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve always prided ourselves on‚Äù said MacLean. ‚ÄúPart of that is taking the equipment lending itself to the practices and making it a better experience. That‚Äôs one of the beautiful benefits of this project.‚Äù

This transaction follows Kraft‚Äôs recent acquisition of a new Manhattan residence close by at 220 Central Park South located on Billionaires‚Äô Row.

Records indicate that Kraft originally purchased the Plaza apartment for $14.74 million in 2007 during the hotel‚Äôs conversion into condominiums according to the Wall Street Journal which first reported Kraft‚Äôs sale.

Details regarding the Plaza unit are scarce as it was not publicly listed for sale. Situated at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 59th Street the French Renaissance-inspired property has a rich history dating back to the early 1900s.

Notable figures such as fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger and London developer Christian Candy have been among the buyers of Plaza condominiums in the past.

While Kraft could not be reached for immediate comment the identity of the buyer remains undisclosed.

Kraft‚Äôs sentimental attachment to the Plaza is documented in journalist Julie Satow‚Äôs 2019-published book ‚ÄúThe Plaza: The Secret Life of America‚Äôs Most Famous Hotel.‚Äù

According to the book Kraft reminisced about touring the building during its construction phase and expressed a ‚Äúnostalgic connection‚Äù to the hotel. Satow also revealed Kraft‚Äôs unique method of choosing his apartment drawing inspiration from the jersey numbers of his Patriots players.

Despite the Plaza‚Äôs storied past its allure has somewhat diminished in recent years with the rise of newer taller buildings in the vicinity of Central Park South.

Notably Kraft‚Äôs recent real estate endeavors include the purchase of two units at 220 Central Park South for a combined $34 million.

Designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects this contemporary building has attracted prominent buyers such as entertainer Sting and hedge funders Ken Griffin and Dan Och.

Kraft‚Äôs diverse portfolio of luxury residences includes a penthouse in Palm Beach Florida acquired for $23.75 million in December 2022 ‚Äî and a property on Meadow Lane in the Hamptons purchased for $43 million in 2021. Additionally records indicate he owns a home in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts.

Having acquired the Patriots in 1994 Kraft‚Äôs wealth stems from his role as chairman and CEO of the Kraft Group a privately held conglomerate with interests in manufacturing real estate and sports assets.

But despite thousands of trials in the United States each year only 3% to 5% of eligible patients enroll in investigations of new treatments.

Triomics a generative AI startup claims it can significantly reduce the time it takes doctors to match patients with trials.

Doctors‚Äô recommendations are often key to getting patients enrolled. However busy oncologists and nurses often lack the time to learn about all the clinical trials that may be right for their patients.

I am not a doctor so I don‚Äôt know about the day-to-day challenges of oncology medical staff. But I unfortunately know from personal experience how hard it is to find clinical trials for cancer patients. When my father was sick I spent countless hours poring over clinicaltrials.gov a website and database that lists thousands of ongoing trials. And just in March I spent half a Saturday trying to find a clinical trial for a friend who has stage IV cancer. Her doctor only offered one trial so she asked me if there were other options.

Since most clinical trials have complex criteria there are often dozens of factors such as stage of cancer mutations and previous treatments for eligibility. Medical staff often need hours to manually review a patient‚Äôs medical record to find a fitting clinical trial. But due to a shortage of oncology professionals many cancer patients aren‚Äôt offered to participate or they miss their eligibility window.

Triomics was founded by former MIT biotech researcher Sarim Khan and AI scientist at Adobe Hrituraj Singh. The pair who have been friends since college decided to build Triomics in 2021 after realizing that advances in generative AI and LLMs could help extract data from electronic health records (EHR) to help find appropriate clinical trials for cancer patients in minutes instead of hours.

Khan and Singh entered Y Combinator in the winter of 2021 and proceeded to work on an LLM built specifically for cancer centers and oncology departments in hospital systems.

Three years later Triomics says six cancer centers and hospitals are actively using or piloting its LLM and it plans to double that number by the end of the year. And now the company has raised a $15 million Series A from Lightspeed Nexus Venture Partners General Catalyst and Y Combinator to help it continue to develop its platform and roll it out to new customers.

While reducing how long it takes for patients to be matched with clinical trials may seem like the most immediately valuable application of Triomics software Khan says that Triomics is a lot more than a clinical trials company. ‚ÄúDoctors use it for several different use cases that I could just go on and on about‚Äù he said.

After Triomics‚Äô LLM which the company is calling OncoLLM ‚Äúreads‚Äù the patient‚Äôs medical record the data could be used to help prepare doctors and other medical staff for patient visits or to help submit cancer data with details of organs affected and stage of progressions to state regulatory agencies.

Of course Triomics isn‚Äôt alone in tackling this area. Other startups doing AI clinical trial matching include Deep 6 AI QuantHealth Trajectory among others.

But Khan believes that Triomics is one of the few startups processing large swaths of datasets specifically for cancer centers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9mdW5lcmFsLXNlcnZpY2VzLWJ5LWdhcnktcy1zaWx2YXQvZ2VvcmdlLW0tbWNrZWx2ZXktZ2lyYXJkLW9oaW8v0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tibi5jb20vbXktdmFsbGV5LXRyaWJ1dGVzL2Z1bmVyYWwtc2VydmljZXMtYnktZ2FyeS1zLXNpbHZhdC9nZW9yZ2UtbS1tY2tlbHZleS1naXJhcmQtb2hpby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George M.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor‚Äôs Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of ‚ÄúCruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.‚Äù The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN ‚Äî

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him ‚Äî the aisle seat ‚Äî was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn‚Äôt want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: ‚ÄúIf you put your seat back one more time I‚Äôm going to punch you in the face‚Äù said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl‚Äôs eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in my lap!‚Äù cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she‚Äôd understand: ‚ÄúUnfortunately he‚Äôs allowed to be in your lap.‚Äù

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn‚Äôt give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That‚Äôs a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out ‚Äî people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn‚Äôt true. At least not with US carriers even though it‚Äôs a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you‚Äôll be the one removed from the flight ‚Äî not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights ‚Ä¶ including seats that don‚Äôt recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anyone get worked up about it‚Äù he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It‚Äôs rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you‚Äôd think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn‚Äôt recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don‚Äôt recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren‚Äôt always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they‚Äôve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can‚Äôt kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they‚Äôd mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they‚Äôll do it.

If you‚Äôre a passenger who likes to recline it‚Äôs always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it‚Äôs Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there‚Äôs no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there‚Äôs barely room for a drink. So if you think you‚Äôre going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned flying the unfriendly skies it‚Äôs this: you can‚Äôt please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I‚Äôm going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there‚Äôs no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn‚Äôt a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you‚Äôre searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue."

The singer Gil Ofarim 39 said in an emotional video published Tuesday that two employees at the Westin hotel in Leipzig in eastern Germany had asked him to ""put away"" a Star of David pendant before he would be allowed to check in.

Two employees at the Westin were subsequently suspended while the accusations are investigated a spokeswoman for the Marriott International hotel group said on Wednesday.

""Prosecutors are currently examining the accusations made against the hotel employees"" said authorities in Leipzig. At the same time one of the accused filed for defamation describing the events ""very differently"" to the singer according to a spokeswoman for the police.

The same individual reported threats made against him via his Instagram account. Ofarim rejected the defamation allegation saying that it was ""exactly like how I described it in the video.""

""I find it shameful and sad that I still have to justify and explain myself after such an incident"" he told Spiegel Online. After the video was published on Tuesday thousands of people gathered outside the hotel to demonstrate in solidarity with the singer and against anti-Semitism.

Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was ""stunned"" by the incident warning that ""Leipzig is not a one-off"" and calling on Germans to stand together against anti-Semitism.

Meanwhile the German government's Commissioner for Jewish Life and the Fight against Anti-Semitism Felix Klein offered his ""sympathy and solidarity"" to Ofarim in an interview with the Funke media group. It was ""good and important"" that the incident had been made public Klein said and showed the need for more ""education"" on anti-Semitism in Germany.

""I am tired of the daily attacks on Jews whether verbal or non-verbal in real life or digitally"" the general secretary of the Conference of European Rabbis Gady Gronich said."

Most places accept Visa and Mastercard as well as local payments systems such as Giro in Germany or Carte Bancaire in France. When that same shopper goes online they have even more options including PayPal and sometimes Alipay the Chinese payments giant and perhaps options offered by new fintech startups such as Klarna‚Äôs buy-now-pay-later service.



Yet despite this surfeit of choices many of Europe‚Äôs largest banks are backing an effort to build a new European-wide payments network that could replace national payments networks and challenge the dominance of Visa and Mastercard across the continent.

Previous efforts to create such a pan-European payments network failed. Most recently one called the Monnet Project collapsed before it ever got off the ground in 2011. This time the project is likely to at least make it to launch. That‚Äôs because the new European Payments Initiative (EPI for short) is as much about politics as it is about business.

The nuclear option

The European Commission and European Central Bank began a concerted drive to pressure banks to build a Europe-specific cross-border card payment system in 2018. That‚Äôs when the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran often referred to in the U.S. as simply ‚Äúthe Iran nuclear deal.‚Äù The EU continued to abide by the agreement and did not want its policies vis-√†-vis Iran dictated by the U.S. and Trump. And yet it now faced the increasingly real threat that the U.S. could impose what are known as ‚Äúsecondary sanctions‚Äù that would force Mastercard and Visa which are both U.S. corporations to cut off access to any European financial institutions or companies that continued to do business with Iran. The vast majority of cross-border card transactions in Europe are handled by either Mastercard or Visa.



‚ÄúThe EU may be more exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is not used in its best interests or is even used against it‚Äù Benoit Coeure at the time of a member of the ECB board told a conference in Brussels in December 2019.



But some international payments executives say this fear was always overstated. The U.S. never actually moved to cut off European access to Mastercard and Visa.



The threat may indeed have come less from the U.S. government and more from powerful U.S. and Chinese technology companies. The ECB was alarmed that Facebook‚Äôs now defunct Libra project as well as Chinese payments solutions such as Alipay and WeChat Pay would leave Europe in the dust with the ECB having no ability to regulate the payments networks and Europe‚Äôs banks largely cut out of consumer payments.



‚ÄúFrom a European point of view it is important to establish a European payment scheme to remain independent‚Äù a Deutsche Bank spokesperson tells Fortune explaining why the bank Germany‚Äôs largest decided to join the EPI.

SEPA protocol

There were other reasons the ECB was pushing for the EPI too. Not only were European banks not at the cutting edge of innovation some were lagging an entire technological cycle behind. Cross-border bank-to-bank transfers in Europe can use something called the single euro payments area (SEPA) protocol. But banks some still using computer systems designed for the days of mainframes would process these SEPA transactions in batches once per day and it sometimes could take up to three business days for the transaction to be settled and the money to actually appear in the recipient‚Äôs account.



The ECB worried the lack of instant payments put European consumers and businesses at a disadvantage compared with those in other large markets like the U.S. and China. (The ECB has even broached the idea of creating its own wholly digital currency in an effort to catch up.)



The added friction of these cross-border transactions reinforces monetary borders between states that the ECB is dedicated to eradicating. So it has pushed Europe‚Äôs banks to move to a new transfer system where amounts up to ‚Ç¨100000 could be transferred within 10 seconds and it has said it would like card and credit payments to be handled through the same instant transfer protocol. But many of Europe‚Äôs banks don‚Äôt have the infrastructure to handle cross-border card transactions in this way and adoption of the new instant payment method has been slow.



The desire to meet the ECB‚Äôs demands led a group of 31 European banks from seven countries including some of the biggest banks in Germany and France to form the EPI. Two large payment processors have also joined as initial shareholders. (The project was initially known by the acronym PEPSI‚Äîfor Pan-European Payment System Initiative‚Äîbut the beverage company apparently objected forcing a name change to EPI.)

‚Ç¨6 billion project

Martina Weimert a former partner at financial consulting firm Oliver Wyman who has been appointed chief executive officer of the Brussels-based corporation in charge of implementing the project says that the EPI will start with peer-to-peer payments since those don‚Äôt require the EPI to have a large merchant network in place or have dedicated physical payments terminals. Those features will come later she says. She told the Financial Times earlier this year that the EPI will cost ‚Äúseveral billion euros‚Äù to get up and running. Private estimates range as high as ‚Ç¨6 billion.

The EPI says it plans to have a new payments network built on the new instant SEPA protocol up and running by sometime in 2022 with a full suite of features available by 2025. It‚Äôs a goal that even the association of German savings banks (known by the acronym DSGV)‚Äîa key backer of the EPI with its head Joachim Schmalzl serving as the EPI‚Äôs chairman‚Äîacknowledges is ‚Äúextremely ambitious‚Äù and will depend on a consensus among the consortium of participants that may prove difficult to achieve.



This is especially true because many European payments experts note that some Nordic countries including Sweden and Denmark have already built successful instant payments networks and that they are unlikely to want to switch to a pan-European system. And there‚Äôs already another rival instant payments clearinghouse called the EBA that is wholly owned by European banks.



Meeting the EPI‚Äôs timetable may be even more difficult given that the organization hasn‚Äôt even figured out exactly how it will make money yet.

In her FT interview Weimert insisted the EPI would offer ‚Äúa different business model‚Äù than Mastercard and Visa which make money by charging merchants what are known as ‚Äúinterchange fees‚Äù to cover the costs of processing payments as well as guarding against fraud. (The networks also charge other service fees to the banks that issue the cards). European politicians and regulators have long been opposed to interchange fees and in 2015 capped the amount card networks could charge. But Weimert was vague about exactly what that alternative model will be saying only that the EPI would charge merchants‚Äô banks for the instant payment processing service and that the banks could then pass some of this cost on to merchants.

This lack of clarity may be one reason a number of large European payments processors have not rushed to join the EPI and are instead taking a wait-and-see approach. A number of payments industry insiders said that the current cross-border payments system was working relatively well and that the EPI was ‚Äúa solution looking for a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄòBuilt for the digital age‚Äô

Gilles Grapinet the chairman and chief executive officer of Worldline which is Europe‚Äôs largest payments processor and which is taking part in the project says that he thinks there is value in creating a new payments network from the ground up rather than grafting new functionalities onto networks that date from the 1970s and 1980s and were originally designed just to process physical card payments. ‚ÄúWe think it is a great opportunity to design a new payment brand that is built for the digital age‚Äù he says. Grapinet says that the EPI would be designed from the start to be omnichannel‚Äîable to be used seamlessly for in-store and online purchases debit and credit payments as well as for instant peer-to-peer money transfers. None of Europe‚Äôs domestic card payments networks can do this presently.



That‚Äôs also the reason Nets a Danish payments processor that is poised to expand throughout Europe following its acquisition by Italy‚Äôs Nexi Group says it is participating in the EPI. Torsten Hagen Jorgensen Nets‚Äô chief executive officer of issuer and e-security services says the project should benefit Europe‚Äôs consumers who are increasingly demanding a single digital payments option that they can use wherever they shop online or in stores.



Worldline‚Äôs Grapinet says merchants should welcome the EPI too. Right now the lack of a unified debit card payments network means that large retailers with hundreds or thousands of stores across Europe have to connect to potentially dozens of local payment networks each of which has its own fees charges and payments terminals. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of extra cost to get connected to all these local schemes‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is in the interests of merchants to have a more unified payment landscape.‚Äù

Although the EPI is often positioned as a rival to Mastercard and Visa Jason Lane Mastercard‚Äôs executive vice president in charge of European market development says he doesn‚Äôt see the new payment network that way. In fact Lane says that the EPI will likely have to partner with Mastercard and Visa to handle cross-border payments outside of Europe. What‚Äôs more Mastercard is bidding to become a technology provider to the new payments system helping it with things like anti-fraud measures and contactless payments. ‚ÄúWe are adopting a collaborative mindset‚Äù Lane says. ‚ÄúWe think it makes sense to have this European entity.‚Äù



Visa would not comment on the record for fear of antagonizing the European banks who are members of its payments network.



Given the political pressure to make it happen it is almost certain the EPI will eventually launch. But European consumers would probably be wise to not take a scissors to their Mastercards and Visas just yet.

The partnership will enhance the travel experience with personalized contactless and secure digitized technologies.

Mastercard & LATAM Airlines Group

The initiative consists of two phases. The first expands the benefits of LATAM Pass credit cards in Chile Argentina Brazil and Ecuador. The second phase beginning later this year will include other related markets within Latin America.

For several years Mastercard and LATAM Pass the most widely recognized frequent flier program in Latin America have collaborated with issuing banks to introduce co-branded credit cards and benefits to customers.

‚ÄúMany industries including travel are accelerating their digital transformation to deliver innovations across consumer touch points‚Äù said Kiki del Valle executive vice president of market development for Latin America and the Caribbean for Mastercard. ‚ÄúWith our data analytics and ability to continuously adjust to consumer trends and market forces we are excited to innovate in the travel space together with the LATAM Airlines Group team.‚Äù

The LATAM group of airlines serves five domestic markets in Latin America ‚Äì Brazil Chile Colombia Ecuador and Peru ‚Äì with a network that reaches more than 115 destinations.

‚ÄúWe are sure that the partnership agreement with Mastercard will allow us to not only further accelerate our innovation but also to improve the travel experience of our customers‚Äù said LATAM Pass VP Ralph Piket. ‚ÄúAs we know the future of the airline industry is essentially being digital and seamless and LATAM is working in that regard. In this context the partnership with Mastercard is a very relevant step on that path and adds to the launch of our e-business unit last year.‚Äù

Details regarding the launch of the new Mastercard LATAM Pass programs offering more mileage accrual and redemption alternatives in both travel and partner merchants will be communicated as soon as they are available.

Left back Sam Vines did the damage with a first-half header from seven yards out scoring his first international goal in his first official competitive match.

Gyasi Zardes registered his 10th career assist on the goal becoming the second-fastest USMNT player to reach 10 goals and 10 assists behind only U.S. legend Landon Donovan.











Three players made their USMNT debuts: James Sands Eric Williamson and Sporting KC‚Äôs Gianluca Busio with Busio earning his first cap in his home club stadium to the delight of the fans in attendance.

Vines Sands Williamson and Busio were among the nine players who made their USMNT debuts in official competition tonight joining goalkeeper Matt Turner defenders Shaq Moore and Miles Robinson midfielder Nicholas Gioacchini and forward Daryl Dike. Turner Moore Giaocchini Dike and Busio are all now cap-tied to the USMNT.

The U.S. started on the front foot and nearly got on the board after six minutes when defender Walker Zimmerman put his attempt off the crossbar and a shot by Zardes off the rebound was saved. The winning goal came minutes later with Zardes setting up Vines on a play that started two passes earlier by Zimmerman.

Zimmerman nearly doubled the U.S. lead late in stoppage time of the first half when he jumped over two defenders at the far post to head down a Sebastian Lletget cross on goal from a tight angle. However Haiti goalkeeper Brian Sylvestre was well-positioned to make the save.

Haiti struggled to develop much of an attack in the first half with winger Derrick Etienne having a couple half chances that failed to test Turner in goal.

The teams made a number of changes throughout the second half and the U.S. had the better of the few clear chances either side developed. The two best chances came from substitutes with Gioacchini clanking a shot off the left post and Busio hitting a one-time strike from the top of the box that Sylvestre was able to rise and deflect.

Haiti threatened to find the equalizer with a last-minute scramble in front of Turner but the U.S. defense did well to hold on to the three points.

The USMNT will remain in Kanas City and face Martinique on Thursday July 15 (10 p.m. ET FS1 UniM√°s TUDN) before closing out Group play next Sunday against Canada.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA ‚Äì SAM VINES (GYASI ZARDES) 8th minute: USMNT center back Walker Zimmerman stepped forward and advanced a nice ball to Kellyn Acosta on the right edge of the box. Acosta quickly played the on-rushing Shaq Moore who hit a first-time cross. The ball took a slight deflection before Zardes - back to goal - flicked it over a defender across the six where Vines had run in from his left back spot to easily head the ball in for his first goal. USA 1 HAI 0



KEY DEFENSIVE PLAYS AND SAVES:

HAI ‚Äì BRIAN SYLVESTRE 6th minute: Sebastian Lletget sent a corner from the left side to the back post where Jackson Yueill knocked the ball back towards the middle. Amid a sea of bodies defender Walker Zimmerman‚Äôs half-volley from just outside the six clanked off the crossbar. The quick rebound fell to Zardes who was able to redirect the short-hop towards goal by Sylvester reacted quickly diving to his left on the line and parried the ball wide.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Defeat to Nigeria was not what Team USA had in mind when preparing for the Olympics

Nigeria pulled off one of the greatest upsets in international basketball history on Saturday night by stunning Team USA in an Olympic exhibition game in Las Vegas beating them 90-87.

It was Team USA's first-ever loss to an African nation. They had defeated Nigeria 156-73 in August 2012 at the London Olympics.

Nigeria featured six NBA players and are coached by former NBA head coach and current Golden State Warriors assistant Mike Brown.

The Nigerian side defeated a Team USA starting five of Damian Lillard Bradley Beal Jayson Tatum Kevin Durant and Bam Adebayo. Gabe Vincent who averaged 4.8 points in 13.1 minutes per game for the Miami Heat this past season led all scorers with 21 points and made six 3-pointers for Nigeria. Durant scored 17 points and Tatum had 15 for Team USA.

Jayson Tatum could not prevent Nigeria springing a major surprise

""It just goes to show that we have to play better"" Tatum said.

The other NBA players playing for Nigeria include Precious Achiuwa and KZ Okpala of the Miami Heat Chimezie Metu (Sacramento) Josh Okogie (Minnesota) and Miye Oni (Utah).

""I thought that the Nigerian team played very physically did a great job in that regard and knocked down a lot of 3s"" US coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Give them credit.""

The United States and Haiti square off at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City Kansas on Sunday July 11 at 9 p.m. ET (FS1 Univision and TUDN).



Here are Five Things to Know about Les Grenadiers:

FOOTBALLING HISTORY

Haiti which won the 1973 Concacaf Championship during its golden age became only the second Caribbean team to qualify for the World Cup. In the Haitians' first group-stage match at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany the legendary Manu Sanon gave the Haitians a 1-0 lead over Italy which rallied for a 3-1 win. That stunning score snapped iconic goalkeeper Dino Zoff's record run of 1143 minutes without conceding a goal. Sanon also tallied in a 4-1 defeat to Argentina.

The Caribbean side has not been able to duplicate that accomplishment in 12 consecutive qualifying attempts since then. The Haitians have achieved some success in their eight Gold Cup appearances. They most recently finished tied with Jamaica for third at the 2019 competition (there was no third-place match) after losing 1-0 to Mexico on an extra-time penalty kick in the semifinals. The Haitians won their group with a 3-0-0 mark besting Costa Rica 2-1 before edging Canada in the quarterfinals 2-1.

The team fell short of its goal of qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup losing twice to Canada in June.

Entering their eighth Gold Cup the Haitians have an 18-28-12 mark in the competition.

USMNT HISTORY VS. HAITI

Along with Mexico Haiti is one of two teams from Concacaf against which the USMNT doesn‚Äôt have a winning record (6-6-5). The two sides first tussled in back-to-back World Cup qualifiers in Port-au-Prince Haiti on April 3 and 4 1954. The visitors won both matches 3-2 and 3-0. National Soccer Hall of Famers Bill Looby and Efrain Chacurian and Cornelius Casey scored in the first game as Looby (twice) and two-time Olympian Ruben Mendoza found the net the next day. Members of the 1950 FIFA World Cup team the legendary Walter Bahr and Harry Keough also played in both contests.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick‚Äôs claims to his ‚Äúhome state‚Äù have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick‚Äôs ties to his ‚Äúhome state‚Äù are cloudy his ties to another state‚Äîthe ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù‚Äîseem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as ‚Äúthe deep state.‚Äù

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick‚Äôs firm‚Äîthe legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates‚Äîthat was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick‚Äôs most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get‚Äîsuch as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund‚Äôs president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater‚Äôs ‚Äúin-house inquisitor.‚Äù

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick‚Äôs ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel‚Äîquite literally the Central Intelligence Agency‚Äôs very own venture capital firm.

McCormick‚Äôs role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity‚Äôs name as ‚ÄúIQT.‚Äù Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he‚Äôs already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump‚Äôs endorsement‚Äîlosing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year‚Äîthough there weren‚Äôt any other viable Republicans running in the primary‚Äîthe dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick‚Äôs challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick‚Äôs at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was ‚Äúan honorable man‚Äù a ‚Äústand-up guy‚Äù and an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù and ‚Äúbrilliant leader.‚Äù But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a ‚Äúsad reality‚Äù that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

‚ÄúHe knows that if he wins he won‚Äôt get to do what he thinks is right‚Äù the person said. ‚ÄúHe has his own money and he won‚Äôt be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he‚Äôs still going to have to kiss the ring and that‚Äôs unfortunate.‚Äù

McCormick‚Äôs campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It‚Äôs not clear if Trump knew about McCormick‚Äôs work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick‚Äôs 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010‚Äîthe year after McCormick left George W. Bush‚Äôs Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater‚Äôs president‚ÄîBridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump‚Äôs paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey‚Äôs role more closely resembled that of an ‚Äúin-house inquisitor‚Äù over the first iteration of the firm‚Äôs oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called ‚ÄúThe Politburo.‚Äù

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called ‚Äúradical transparency.‚Äù Those efforts included constant surveillance‚Äîincluding recorded meetings and videotaped internal ‚Äútrials‚Äù of employees‚Äîwith Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was ‚Äúlike a godfather adjudicating it all.‚Äù

The taped meetings were ‚Äújust the tip of the surveillance ecosystem‚Äù at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey‚Äôs time with the firm.

‚ÄúA slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver‚Äù Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey‚Äôs security posse only turned up ‚Äúlittle evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own‚Äù according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive‚Äôs binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio‚Äôs extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his ‚Äúradical transparency‚Äù dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP‚Äôs own ‚ÄúPolitburo‚Äù and compared it favorably to ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater‚Äôs internal culture ‚Äúreflects aspects of Chinese political ideology‚Äù and invested heavily in the region‚Äîafter McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund‚Äôs Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The ‚ÄúPolitburo‚Äù staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù and ‚Äúhumiliating‚Äù and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like ‚Äúauditors‚Äù and ‚Äúoverseers‚Äù and recording practically every moment of activity‚Äîall in pursuit of Dalio‚Äôs core ‚Äúradical transparency‚Äù philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees‚Äîincluding Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio‚ÄîMcCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio‚Äôs ‚Äúradical transparency.‚Äù

Rubinstein quit after a ‚Äúfiring squad‚Äù meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio‚Äôs increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a ‚Äúclimate of fear.‚Äù When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein‚Äôs take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program‚Äî‚Äúradical transparency‚Äù within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny‚Äîhe replied that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inconsistent at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúRay has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we‚Äôre not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example‚Äù McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs ‚Äúalmost all investment decisions‚Äù by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy‚Äîand whose fate was ‚Äúrescued‚Äù by IQT‚Äôs investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund‚Äôs pursuit of Dalio‚Äôs ‚Äúradical transparency.‚Äù

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick‚Äôs 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT‚Äôs current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money‚Äîmore than $150000‚Äîbehind McCormick‚Äôs candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it‚Äôs true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn‚Äôt stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick‚Äôs political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

For Tom Locke his tipping point on staff wages came back in March during a conversation with a tired store manager Heidi in Coventry Township just outside Akron Ohio. Earlier that week the McDonald's location she managed for his family business TomTreyCo had seen a record-breaking $18000 in sales in a single day but as he sat talking with her at a booth Locke realized that despite her decade-long dedication to his business staffing shortages at the tail-end of the Covid-19 pandemic were really taking a toll. She described working a 12-hour shift sleeping three hours in her car rather than driving the half hour home followed by a further full day on her feet. ""I could see the stress in Heidi's face"" Locke recalled recently. And so he decided to make a change at the 45 McDonald's locations that form part of his franchise business in towns and cities across Pennsylvania West Virginia and northeastern Ohio ‚Äî he raised workers' wages. The most junior staff would earn a minimum of $13 an hour and for managers that would move up to $20 an hour well above what other local competitors were offering. ""We were in a pretty strong financial position"" Locke said of the April decision made after consultations with his senior team and an extensive review of models examining the cost and margin implications. ""I felt if at any time we were able to do this increase all of our associates' pay it would be now."" he said.

Fast food pay under pressure

Pay levels for fast-food workers have come under significant scrutiny in the past decade with help from pro-labor policymakers and well-organized advocacy groups like 'Fight for 15' which argues for a $15 per hour minimum wage. McDonald's perhaps more than any brand has been caught in the center of that criticism and controversy even though its franchise model means the vast majority of restaurant locations are actually operated by independent franchisees like Locke's TomTreyCo rather than the franchisor ‚Äî McDonald's itself. But thanks to the intensely interwoven nature of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee a decision to raise wages on either side of the franchise equation can have complex implications. In May McDonald's just months after other fractious disputes with franchisees over tuition programs and technology fee payments announced that workers at McDonald's 650 company-owned locations will see pay raises of an average of 10% by the end of June ‚Äî entry-level employees will make $11 to $17 per hour and shift managers will make $15 to $20 an hour based on location. The company says that means the average wage for employees at company-owned restaurants will be $15 per hour by 2024. While the wage increases only take effect at the locations that McDonald's corporation owns and operates the company encouraged franchisees that manage the 13000 or so other restaurants to do the same for their roughly 800000 employees provoking anger and consternation among some franchise owners. The fast-food giant franchises 95% of its U.S. restaurants.

What McDonald's CEO says about wages

McDonald's is among restaurant chains to emerge from the pandemic in a strong financial position similar to Chipotle which recently raised wages ‚Äî as well as in its case menu prices by 4%. And it has been trying to send a message of financial support to independent restaurant operators. In a recent interview at the CNBC Evolve Global Summit McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company's decision to inject roughly $1 billion of liquidity into its system earlier this year after the worst of the pandemic had passed ‚Äî and on top of several years of balance sheet growth in the U.S. ‚Äî was part of an effort to move the franchisee mindset away from worrying about ""am I going to be able to pay you know my mortgage or pay my loan that's due this month? ... it's this mindset switch from being you know one of defensive to really being much more aggressive."" While he didn't want to comment on a raised federal minimum wage the McDonald's CEO said ""there's no doubt that $7.25 in this day and age is not what you should be paying or need to be paying to be competitive in the marketplace. ... wages are going up because the economy is strong.""

watch now

Labor experts say McDonald's move will pressure its franchisees. ""This will create a lot of public pressure on on franchisees to do the same thing"" said Laura Padin a senior staff attorney at labor advocacy group the National Employment Law Project. ""When that campaign started in 2011 or 2012"" said Padin in reference to ""Fight for 15"" a $15 minimum wage was ""considered this 'pie in the sky' type of goal."" The recent McDonald's announcement is Padin insists proof of its efficacy. ""That companies themselves are taking that initiative just shows you how much the movement has changed the narrative around what an acceptable minimum wage should be"" she said.

Franchise industry pushes back

The franchise industry has made its position clear ‚Äî wage floors and ceilings should be set by individual restaurant operators. ""Franchisees are best situated to make wage decisions in their local communities"" said Matt Haller senior vice president of government relations at the International Franchise Association. He highlighted the cost differentials between high-priced metropolitan zip codes and more rural locations. The current focus on wage levels he says comes courtesy of a ""union-driven campaign"" to achieve specific organizational or political outcomes by persuading the public that the franchise business model is in fact a corporate one. In terms of public perception he says this is designed to ""turn a company like McDonald's or Dunkin Donuts or Hilton Hotels into one company rather than a collection of lots of small businesses doing business under a common brand.""

The McDonald's corporate view catches franchisees in the crosshairs of a battle being fought with massive competitors on a broader low-wage worker landscape. ""I think what's happening is that you're seeing that a great economy is very helpful to growing employee wages. And I think many of the changes that are happening from a wage standpoint are happening because of companies like McDonald's needing to compete for the best talent"" Kempczinski said. ""When you have Walmart and Amazon Target ... all moving to $15 certainly that's a talent pool that we're competing with.""

How McDonald's workers feel

Among the workers arguing for higher wages a distinction between McDonald's corporate or franchisee can feel semantic. ""We don't care about whether or not we work at a franchise or a corporate store"" says Cristian Cardona a 21-year-old who began working at a McDonald's-operated restaurant in Orlando three years ago. ""We all wear the McDonald's uniform and we all deserve a living wage."" Cardona was first employed at $9.25 an hour only a dollar more than the minimum wage in Florida at the time. Then after a year he became a manager and moved up to $11 before McDonald's recently moved him to $13. ""If McDonald's corporate can control how franchises make their Big Macs and how they market I know that they can figure out how to pay every single worker a living wage of at least $15."" he said. For Locke the franchise operator in Ohio the introduction of higher wages was ultimately a business decision more than a moral one. ""I'll be honest with you"" he said during a recent phone interview. ""If there wasn't a huge shortage of labor we might not have taken the action.""

But if you do end up getting the news that your doctor will be installing an active transmitter inside your body you might as well crack out the software defined radio (SDR) and see if you can‚Äôt decode its transmission like [James Wu] recently did.

Before the Medtronic Bravo Reflux Capsule was attached to his lower esophagus [James] got a good look at a demo unit of the pencil-width gadget. Despite the medical technician telling him the device used a ‚ÄúBluetooth-like‚Äù communications protocol to transmit his esophageal pH to a wearable receiver the big 433 emblazoned on the hardware made him think it was worth taking a closer look at the documentation. Sure enough its entry in the FCC database not only confirmed the radio transmitted a 433.92 MHz OOK-PWM encoded signal but it even broke down the contents of each packet. If only it was always that easy right?

Of course he still had to put this information into practice so the next step was to craft a configuration file for the popular rtl_433 program which split each packet into its principle parts. This part of the write-up is particularly interesting for those who might be looking to pull data in from their own 433 MHz sensors medical or otherwise

Unfortunately there was still one piece of the puzzle missing. [James] knew which field was the pH value from the FCC database but the 16-bit integer he was receiving didn‚Äôt make any sense. After some more research into the hardware which uncovered another attempt at decoding the transmissions from the early days of the RTL-SDR project he realized what he was actually seeing was the combination of two 8-bit pH measurements that are sent out simultaneously.

We were pleasantly surprised to see how much public information [James] was able to find about the Medtronic Bravo Reflux Capsule but in a perfect world this would be the norm. You deserve to know everything there is to know about a piece of electronics that‚Äôs going to be placed inside your body but so far the movement towards open hardware medical devices has struggled to gain much traction.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy‚Äîwith or without radiotherapy‚Äîfailed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck‚Äôs late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial‚Äôs other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it‚Äôs continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

‚ÄúWhile these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications‚Äù Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations‚Äîplus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)‚Äîin endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that‚Äôs not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck‚Äôs Keytruda has been sparring with GSK‚Äôs PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds‚Äô late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients‚Äîa key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company‚Äôs Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai‚Äôs Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma‚Äîthe most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients‚Äô life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItMTA1NjU5NjE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Rahway New Jersey New Jersey

(Reuters) - Merck said on Thursday its therapy being tested in certain patients with a type of cancer in the uterus lining failed a late-stage trial.

The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in about 1095 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.

The trial did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival which is the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or its symptoms.

The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.

Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to detect and fight tumor cells.

Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in endometrial cancer one of which is treated using it as a combination therapy with partner Eisai's drug Lenvima.

Endometrial cancer leads to more than 13000 deaths in a year in the U.S. according to government data.

May 09 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK) known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B21 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA Merck‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery with curative intent.

At a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy did not meet the study‚Äôs pre-specified statistical criteria for DFS compared to placebo plus adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The study‚Äôs other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since superiority was not reached for DFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing. Merck will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community.

""While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of KEYTRUDA in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications while rapidly progressing clinical research evaluating KEYTRUDA-based combinations and other investigational candidates including antibody-drug conjugates in endometrial and other types of gynecologic malignancies"" said Dr. Gursel Aktan vice president global clinical development Merck Research Laboratories. ""We would like to thank all the patients the investigators and our study collaborators for their participation in this trial.""

In the U.S. KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in endometrial cancer. One indication based on KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 is in combination with LENVIMA¬Æ (lenvatinib) in collaboration with Eisai for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. The second indication based on KEYNOTE-158 is as a single agent for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

Story continues

Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program in endometrial carcinoma including the NRG-GY018/KEYNOTE-868 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) followed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. As previously announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for Merck‚Äôs supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) based on this study and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) or target action date of June 21 2024.

The program also includes the KEYNOTE-C93 study evaluating KEYTRUDA versus chemotherapy in dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma as well as the MK-2870-005 study evaluating sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being developed in collaboration with Kelun-Biotech compared to a treatment of physicians‚Äô choice in patients with endometrial carcinoma who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

KEYNOTE-B21 also known as ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053 is a randomized double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04634877) sponsored by Merck and conducted in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecologic Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation Inc. (GOG) investigating adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy compared to adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery with curative intent. The primary endpoints are DFS and OS and secondary endpoints include safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 1095 patients who were randomized to receive:

KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles) followed by KEYTRUDA (400 mg every six weeks for an additional six cycles) with or without radiotherapy or

Placebo (every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles) followed by placebo (every six weeks for an additional six cycles) with or without radiotherapy.

About endometrial carcinoma

Endometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus which is known as the endometrium and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. In the U.S. it is estimated there will be approximately 67880 patients diagnosed with uterine body cancer and approximately 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024. Globally endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the 15th most common cancer overall. Following primary treatment patients face a risk of their cancer returning often as distant metastasis which is associated with poorer outcomes.

About Merck‚Äôs research in breast and gynecologic cancers

Merck is advancing research aimed at improving outcomes for patients affected by breast and gynecologic (ovarian cervical and endometrial) cancers. Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program across these cancers comprised of more than 20 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA currently has two approved indications for triple-negative breast cancer including one for high-risk early-stage disease and five approved indications across certain types of cervical and endometrial cancers (see indications below). Among Merck‚Äôs research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.

About Merck‚Äôs early-stage cancer clinical program

Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.

About KEYTRUDA¬Æ (pembrolizumab) injection 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body‚Äôs immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD- L1 and PD-L2 thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry‚Äôs largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected KEYTRUDA¬Æ (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thereby removing inhibition of the immune response potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue can affect more than one body system simultaneously and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes creatinine and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting monitor blood cortisol at baseline prior to surgery and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies including infection. Institute medical management promptly including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including fatal (0.1%) Grade 4 (0.3%) Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 77% had resolution.

Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC including fatal (0.2%) Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 71% had resolution.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis which may present with diarrhea.

KEYTRUDA With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ‚â•3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4 n=116) ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55) recurrence of ALT ‚â•3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA 16 patients receiving axitinib and 24 patients receiving both.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) acute and chronic GVHD hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

About LENVIMA¬Æ (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules

LENVIMA discovered and developed by Eisai is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1) VEGFR2 (KDR) and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis tumor growth and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4 the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRŒ±) KIT and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages increased activated cytotoxic T cells and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.

Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC RCC and HCC grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials.

Among patients receiving LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%).

Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.

In RCC QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%.

Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome congestive heart failure bradyarrhythmias or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.

Hypocalcemia. In DTC grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus‚Äìtreated patients. In HCC grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.

Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC RCC and HCC clinical trials hemorrhagic events of any grade occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus‚Äìtreated patients including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds including fatal hemorrhagic events occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ‚â§0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus‚Äìtreated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus‚Äìtreated patients in RCC.

Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.

Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors such as bisphosphonates denosumab dental disease or invasive dental procedures may increase the risk of ONJ.

Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.

Avoid invasive dental procedures if possible while on LENVIMA treatment particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.

Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.

Embryo‚ÄêFetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity fetotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

At least. The buffets at Wynn and Excalibur reopened last week and Bellagio‚Äôs reopens Friday.

They join South Point Cosmopolitan Caesars Palace MGM Grand and Circus Circus. All are using the standard self-serve format though most aren‚Äôt serving breakfast lunch and dinner.

Who‚Äôs next? Last month Boyd Gaming joined Station in stating that it won‚Äôt bring back its buffets. Caesars Entertainment has indicated the same despite the strong response to the Bacchanal. It‚Äôs looking more and more like the lower-end buffets will be last to return if they do at all.

Dollar dogs: The Slots A Fun casino located next door to Circus Circus is selling $1 hot dogs and $1 draft beer at the bar. They‚Äôre not what you‚Äôd call top-of-the-line dogs but it‚Äôs a good deal for the Strip. The bar is usually open from 4 p.m. to midnight on weekdays and also most of the day on weekends.

Poker room closes: The poker room at Planet Hollywood has closed. The closing of the mid-size 11-table room follows a decadelong trend in which poker tables at casinos are becoming an endangered species. However a new (and bigger) poker room has opened at Resorts World Las ¬≠Vegas.

Pinball play: The Pinball Hall of Fame has reopened in its new location at 4925 Las Vegas Blvd. South a stone‚Äôs throw south of the ‚ÄúWelcome to Las Vegas‚Äù sign. It‚Äôs open 11 a.m to 11 p.m. daily and admission is free but you have to drop some quarters to play the games.

Question: What are the two towers at CityCenter that are tilted at an angle?

Answer: They‚Äôre collectively called Veer Towers and draw a lot of attention for their bright colors and because the two towers lean in different directions. Both are high-end condos that aren‚Äôt open to the public. Veer opened as part of the original CityCenter complex in 2010.

Before this season comparing Shohei Ohtani to Babe Ruth was akin to baseball blasphemy.

But the Los Angeles Angels‚Äô two-way sensation has made those comparisons valid this year when he became the first pitcher to start a game while leading the majors in home runs since Ruth did it 100 years ago.

‚ÄúWe have to go back to Mr. Ruth to draw any comparisons‚Äù Angels manager Joe Maddon said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not been one name mentioned other than his to compare Shohei to. I think that just screams what this is all about.‚Äù

Ohtani‚Äôs incredible season ‚Äî in which he has crushed a 470-foot home run and fired a 101 mph fastball ‚Äî could result in a seven-figure loss for Las Vegas sportsbooks where he‚Äôs the largest liability to win the American League MVP award.

‚ÄúBy a mile‚Äù William Hill sportsbook director Nick Bogdanovich said.

William Hill alone would lose about $1 million largely because of a $30000 wager to win $900000 it took on Ohtani at 30-1 in the preseason.

‚ÄúThat Ohtani bet is rarefied air. We‚Äôll never see that again‚Äù Bogdanovich said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard of anyone betting $30000 at 30-1.‚Äù

The Japanese designated hitter/pitcher is now the -300 favorite at William Hill to win the AL MVP after he opened at 60-1. He‚Äôs -275 at Station Casinos and -320 at BetMGM.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been such an odds-on favorite in July to win the MVP‚Äù MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said.

Ohtani entered Sunday atop the majors in homers (33) extra-base hits (55) and WAR (5.5) while batting .276 with 70 RBIs and 12 steals. The fourth-year player who turned 27 on July 5 also is 4-1 with a 3.49 ERA in 13 starts and has 87 strikeouts in 67 innings.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen anything like this before. It‚Äôs just been amazing what he‚Äôs been able to do‚Äù Westgate sportsbook manager Randy Blum said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the first to admit that we didn‚Äôt think he would ever be able to hit like this in the majors when he came over from Japan.

‚ÄúWe thought he eventually would transition to a full-time pitcher. We were dead wrong. He can hit.‚Äù

The quest for the AL MVP has essentially turned into a two-man race between Ohtani and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. In fact the only wagering options on the award at Station are Ohtani Guerrero (+210) and any other AL player (11-1).

‚ÄúIf Ohtani doesn‚Äôt get hurt I don‚Äôt see how he can lose‚Äù Blum said. ‚ÄúThe hype is so crazy for Ohtani right now.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing that Guerrero could actually win the Triple Crown and he probably won‚Äôt be the MVP.‚Äù

Ohtani also is the 3-1 favorite at the Westgate to win the Home Run Derby on Monday at Coors Field in Denver. Former 51s player Pete Alonso is the 4-1 second choice and Bishop Gorman product Joey Gallo is the +450 third pick.

Gallo is the 3-1 favorite at Station to hit the longest homer in the contest and Ohtani is the +325 second choice.

Ohtani is the +125 favorite at the Westgate to win the regular-season home run title. Guerrero and Fernando Tatis Jr. ‚Äî tied for second in the majors in homers with 28 each ‚Äî are tied for the 6-1 second pick to be crowned home run king. Every other player is 16-1 or higher.

The Westgate opened Ohtani at 200-1 to win the home run title but will actually win money on that prop if he prevails.

‚ÄúWe were pretty proactive with him‚Äù Blum said. ‚ÄúThe home run race should be pretty interesting. But unless he gets hurt I can‚Äôt see him not winning MVP.‚Äù

In Jabil‚Äôs 2020 Smart Home Technology Trends Survey top challenges included the complexity of supply chains; lack of reference architecture referencing both hardware and software; and consumer expectations on delivery times.

Connectivity has changed how we think about everyday technologies in our home. It has also made these smart home devices more disposable. The lifecycles of major home appliances have been cut in half down from over 20 years. But major appliances are not the only devices experiencing a transformation; vacuum cleaners coffee makers doorbells and more are in on it too.

As people start to incorporate more of these connected devices and appliances into their everyday lives the correlative spike in the smart home market will require a well-established IoT supply chain to support it. And managing this supply chain requires specialized knowledge tools and strategies.

In an industry where OEMs must be able to support their devices for upwards of 10 years legacy components present unique challenges. Supplier business models aren't typically designed to support components for more than a few years -- they follow the trending world of the mobility market. Those legacy components lead to shortages.

When supply shortages impacted the smart home and appliance industry just a few years ago it forced some OEMs to look at product designs. It emphasized miniaturization as the strategy to ensure a steady supply of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) caps and resistors. As this trend will continue well into the future OEMs need to be mindful to redesign for smaller case sizes to avoid disruptions caused by component shortages.

Succeeding in this industry requires a delicate balance of managing costs keeping up with technology trends and developing a strong supplier relationship management strategy. Otherwise there is no easy way to navigate the treacherous waters of events like supply shortages.

How COVID-19 impacted IoT supply chain management

Lasting growth and development come from the hard stuff -- the challenges obstacles and disruptions that force us to pause and reassess how and why we're doing things. It's fair to say 2020 had its share of the hard stuff. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was the leading disruption for the year.

The smart home and appliances industry immediately felt the impact of the pandemic. Although many smart home OEMs experienced production delays due to government lockdowns there was also a downturn in sales due to lower demand.

With COVID-19 further amplifying existing challenges in IoT supply chain management OEMs had a lot to juggle. Supply chain leaders had to continuously update their demand forecasts based on the status of the pandemic then balance out their inventory with current and upcoming demand. In fact inventory management became a key performance indicator during the first few months of COVID-19.

In addition logistics became a challenge as countries went through waves and phases of lockdown in trying to manage the outbreak. Transportation became unreliable and some key geographies were shut down completely complicating sourcing production and delivery.

Although these obstacles were difficult they were not insurmountable. Supply chain challenges are nothing new. In fact past challenges are responsible for encouraging companies to build resilience and longevity into their supply chain management processes. Prior to 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic the global supply chain was already in a state of uncertainty.

IoT supply chain processes are evolving as smart home OEMs prepare for disasters and interruptions. For your company that may mean building redundancy to prepare for labor shortages moving to regionalized strategies to lessen the impacts of localized shutdowns and trade barriers or incorporating a disaster recovery and business continuity focus to every aspect of the supply chain. But there is no single answer.

In fact as a result of 2020‚Äôs challenges manufacturers across all industries are responding and recalibrating their supply chains. With 58% of smart home manufacturers and 54% of all manufacturers making investments in supply chain network optimization and visualization applications we can see how companies are adapting and growing.

Jabil



Furthermore COVID-19 has pushed decision-makers in IoT supply chain management to make changes to their logistics strategies. Most notably smart home OEMs moved to identify new international shipping options implement transportation management systems or identify additional options for ‚Äúlast-mile‚Äù deliveries to consumers. These changes will help companies resume ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù and get their products to their destinations even in the face of extremely unusual circumstances.

Jabil



The silver lining to operating within a market ripe with obstacles and challenges is the forced maturity and acceptance that change is required. After all necessity is the mother of invention.

If supply chain managers take anything away from the pandemic it should be the deep importance of having a reliable supply chain designed to be flexible responsive and proactive. While no one wants a replay of the questions fears and uncertainty of 2020 the best way to prepare for the unexpected is to remember the lessons we learned in 2020.

A responsive and resilient smart home supply chain

The smart home solutions market is continuously punctuated by consumer demand. While in other industries companies may be able to drive consumer demand to a specific feature or design this is not the case for smart home solutions.

With a new consumer demographic looking for smart home products and appliances manufacturers are forced to move away from legacy designs form factors and features. Connectivity human machine interfaces (HMI) ease-of-use cost and tangible benefits top the list of consumer expectations for their smart home technology.

The good news is smart home manufacturers are listening and paying attention to consumer demand supply chain challenges and market forces. Even more encouraging is that while there are numerous market forces impacting connected home solutions half of our survey respondents say they are listening to customer demand when developing their strategies and products.

Jabil



Paramount to the success of these approaches to strategy and product development is remembering previous lessons with the electronics component shortage during the IoT boom. It's critical that manufacturers look to developing partnerships with supply chain management solutions providers that have the people processes and technology to turn disruption into opportunity for their IoT ecosystem.

COVID-19 IoT supply chain management and the future

The impacts of COVID-19 will not be fully realized for years to come. What we do have and need to remember are our everyday firsthand experiences of a global pandemic. Lives were lost businesses were shuttered global and national disparity in responses to the pandemic were a constant and a growing concern for when normal life will return are just some of the themes of life in 2021. The pandemic has been a turning point for supply chains across all industries and regions.

The pandemic has forced companies to rethink logistics partnerships supplier relationships and the importance of supply chain resilience. When done right these three cornerstones of a successful supply chain give companies the tools network and confidence to remain flexible and responsive to whatever disruption occurs whether that's a pandemic a component shortage labor slowdowns or shifts in consumer demand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvY2hpbmEtbWljcm9jaGlwLWZhY3RvcnktYm9yaXMtam9obnNvbi1oaS10ZWNoLWRpbGVtbWEtMzJrOGdjOTJ20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China and the chip factory ‚Äî Boris Johnson's hi-tech dilemma,"Chinese premier Xi Jinping needed something to stir the nation earlier this month on the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) forced organizations to accelerate investments in technology as they sought to keep remote teams connected and automate workflows while moving further along in their digital transformation journeys.

Because cash flow is the lifeblood of all businesses companies were forced to rapidly determine how to optimize their accounts payable (AP) and procure-to-pay (P2P) functions to ensure operations could continue humming along when teams started working from home overnight.

During this transition shrewd organizations made investments in powerful AP/P2P automation technology that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to transform AP from a tactical business function into a strategic one.

Here are few of the reasons why supply chain managers are increasingly embracing P2P and AP automation to build smarter systems that increase efficiency lower costs and put their organization in a position to thrive while they scale.

1. Eliminating invoice exceptions

Traditionally even the best AP teams spend more than 50% of their time on invoice exceptions or discrepancies on invoices that require manual intervention to resolve.

P2P and AP automation enables a business to eliminate invoice exceptions altogether and help AP teams achieve 100% straight-through invoice processing.

For example if an invoice field such as a purchase order line number is left off an invoice AI and ML technology can intelligently and automatically predict it and enable two and three-way matches freeing colleagues from doing laborious research to resolve the otherwise inevitable invoice exception.

With no more invoice exceptions to manage businesses can process more transactions with less human involvement enabling AP and other internal stakeholders to focus on other mission-critical areas of operations.

2. Optimizing cash flow

Every supply chain manager worries about cash flow.

On one hand managers want to take advantage of every early payment discount available to them. On the other when suppliers don‚Äôt offer discounts managers want to pay them exactly when payment is due and not a day earlier.

Conducting these cash flow exercises by hand is a time-absorbing endeavor. Thanks to fast invoice processing cycle times and insightful analytics AP and P2P automation gives supply chain managers the peace of mind that comes with knowing suppliers will automatically be paid at the appropriate times.

Making one smart investment can mean leaving behind the days of worrying about paying vendors on time.

3. Preventing supply chain disruptions

Many businesses fail to see one benefit of automation because they don‚Äôt take time to put themselves in their suppliers‚Äô shoes. It should be obvious why a supplier wouldn‚Äôt want to keep doing business with an organization that didn‚Äôt pay them on time or worse an organization that sent their calls to voicemail and never called back.

Leading AP and P2P automation platforms let an organization establish a direct connection between itself and each of its suppliers. As a result suppliers have at-a-glance access to payment status and in turn are able to clearly see when they can expect cash to hit their accounts.

In addition to helping suppliers manage their own finances more effectively automation also frees AP teams from answering calls or responding to emails from vendors trying to track down money they‚Äôre owed.

4. Detecting fraud automatically

It is not uncommon for supply chain managers to deal with a seemingly endless number of invoices every month. With so many invoices coming in at all hours of the day and in all conceivable kinds of formats it is impossible to manage all of it effectively when processing invoices by hand.

Unfortunately these factors add up to increase the chances that a fraudulent invoice will slip through the cracks and end up being paid.

Using AI and ML in AP automation organizations can detect fraud automatically drastically reducing the likelihood that someone will get paid more than they‚Äôre owed.

How? The technology analyzes invoices based on patterns in the past.

For example imagine a vendor sends $10000 invoices every month for three years. Then all of a sudden the same vendor sends a $1 million invoice. The right AP/P2P automation solution will automatically flag such an event allowing the payer to intervene and decide whether the invoice is valid.

Similarly the technology can flag new sender names abnormal rates and unrecognized products or services among other things.

5. Bringing suppliers onto the network faster at great scale

The right AP and P2P automation solution makes supplier onboarding quick and easy. Regardless of the format of the file the supplier sends the technology can automatically remap it into the format needed by the enterprise resource planning system and organization preferences.

Not only does this make things convenient for suppliers but it also gives the company faster return on investment for AP automation.

As an added bonus the solution serves as a central hub of information for the organization enabling it to increase its operational agility and further enhance business intelligence. When someone needs W9 banking or other important supplier information they‚Äôll know exactly where to look.

Ready to bring AI and ML to your AP/P2P processes?

If your organization is still approaching AP/P2P the old-fashioned way you‚Äôre not operating as efficiently as you could be.

When you invest in modern AP automation solutions that leverage AI and ML to streamline your accounting process your suppliers will be happier your team will be able to get more done and your supply chain will be stronger because of it.",,,

SK Hynix said on Monday it began production of its 10-nm 8GB LPPDR4 mobile DRAM this month with the South Korean memory giant adding it was applying the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) process in its production of the latest chip.

The latest chip marks the first time that SK Hynix has applied EUV in its DRAM production. Samsung began applying the advanced process in its memory production last year and Micron has said it plans to apply EUV in 2024.

EUV equipment is used in the lithography process during chip production where the circuit patterns are transferred onto the wafer. By using EUV companies can transfer more precise patterns allowing chips to be designed smaller and for more of them to be drawn on the wafer.

Besides memory in logic chips the process is being widely adopted by Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung for their advanced processor productions.

According to SK Hynix application of EUV has allowed it to secure 25% more units of DRAM in a single wafer for the latest 10nm LPPDR4 than its predecessor. The company also said its latest DRAM would also likely help alleviate the supply and demand conditions currently seen in global markets.

All of SK Hynix's new DRAM products with the latest 10nm process will be made using EUV going forward the South Korean company said.

Specs-wise the new LPDDR4 mobile DRAM runs at 4266Mbps and consumes 20% less power than its predecessor SK Hynix said.

The chip will be supplied to smartphone manufacturers in the second half of the year. The company will also begin applying its latest 10nm process to its DDR5 production starting in 2022 it added.

A revolution in the auto industry is underway and the hardware that is driving it has an appetite for memory bandwidth. High-performance compute functions that run algorithms for perception planning and control in autonomous driving systems require faster higher-capacity memory subsystems. In addition the consumer‚Äôs digital world has been extended to the automobile.

In-vehicle infotainment systems are more immersive with features like speech recognition and 4K displays. The lines between infotainment and ADAS are increasingly blurred from a hardware perspective as these emerging functions share resources making functional safety of these systems paramount.

But the role of memory in meeting system functional safety objectives is key and not well understood by much of the industry. It is important that those designing safety-critical systems understand the fail modes associated with the Dynamic random-access memory or DRAM what DRAM offers with respect to diagnostic coverage and how to achieve system safety objectives with the chosen memory technology.

It is necessary to have a high-level understanding of how components used in safety-critical systems are evaluated for compliance to the standard ISO 26262 (Road Vehicles ‚Äì Functional Safety). First what is functional safety?

Related:How to Build a Better Buck Converter for Power Conversion Circuits

Functional safety is the avoidance of unnecessary risk of personal injury due to hazards caused by failure of E/E systems during the operation of the automobile. Fault risk analysis is defined by two categories systematic and random hardware faults. While this article focuses primarily on random hardware faults it is good to understand how systematic fault analysis plays a role in functional safety.

Systematic fault analysis is focused on the attempt towards fault avoidance. Examples of systematic faults are faults that occur during specification design manufacturing etc. These types of faults could affect an entire fleet of automobiles. By adhering to a certified ISO 26262 process during the design and manufacturing of a device an acceptable level of risk to systematic faults can be achieved.

Random hardware faults are inherent to semiconductor products and occur during the operation of the system. These are typically caused by some physical defect on a device but could occur as a result of other intervening factors. For DRAM wear-out thermal stress package defects and soft errors due to neutron flux are all examples of mechanisms that cause random hardware faults. To achieve acceptable levels of risk automotive system designers need to put the focus on the detection of the random hardware fault.

Figure 1 depicts how the key hardware metrics are computed through the functional safety analysis. Each Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) has a different set of requirements for the residual failure rate Single Point Fault Metric (SPFM) and Latent Fault Metric (LFM). The SPFM is a hardware architectural metric that reveals whether or not the coverage by the safety mechanisms to prevent risk from single point faults in the hardware architecture is sufficient. Similarly the LFM shows whether or not the coverage by the safety mechanisms to prevent risk from latent faults is sufficient.

The residual failure rate is the rate of the errors that are undetected and is expressed in Failures in Time (FIT) which equates to failures in 109 hours. The residual failure rate requirement is for the entire system and typically the DRAM subsystem would be budgeted 4% of the total. The resultant DRAM FIT budget would be 4 for ASIL B and 0.4 for ASIL D. As you can imagine with the high-capacity memories that are being deployed in today‚Äôs systems meeting these FIT requirements is challenging.

The foundation of the DRAM safety analysis is the Failure Modes Effects and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA). This is a bottom-up approach to breaking down all the DRAM functional blocks and determining possible fail mechanisms and the resulting fail modes. Using the information from the FMEDA the system can determine the best ways to provide the diagnostic coverage required by ISO 26262.

Traditionally the focus of DRAM memory error detection and correction has been single-bit errors (SBE) in other words SBE are corrected by the Error Correction Circuit (ECC). In reality there are other ways that the DRAM can fail that require much more thought towards error detection and correction especially in a functional safety environment. Figure 2 shows a high-level block diagram of a modern DRAM.

You can see that there are many blocks of logic that make up the periphery of the device not to mention the power distribution network. The diagram is not to scale as in practice the Mbit array does make up most of the chip silicon area but it is meant to show other blocks exist that must be considered in the safety analysis.

There are many fail modes on the DRAM that can be mapped to a finite number of Top-Level Failure Modes (TLFM) as seen by the Host. As an example there may be a fault in a row address decoder that produces a DRAM failure mode of ‚Äúcorrupted page of data‚Äù. This fail mode would map to TLFM-03 Corrupt data: Multi-bit error as shown in Table 1.

A brief description of the TLFM is helpful in understanding the system impacts and how to achieve the necessary diagnostic coverage. TLFM-01 through TLFM-03 are self-explanatory so I will focus on the remaining five. TLFM-04 is a repeated multiple-bit error (MBE) that occurs on every read cycle regardless of address. An example of this would be an open I/O (DQ) pin on the DRAM package. TLFM-05 is data read from the wrong address.

An example would be if the controller issues a read command to address A and through some fail mode on the DRAM data from address B is returned to the Host. These types of failure modes are very difficult to detect as the retrieved ECC code word will still be valid. TLFM-06 is lost or old data. This occurs when there is a failure on the write operation on a previous cycle to the same address. On the subsequent read of the address it will retrieve ‚Äúold‚Äù data that was never overwritten by the failed write.

Again this is difficult to detect as the ECC codeword will be valid. TLFM-07 is a no-drive condition on a read. In the case of Low-Power Double Data Rate 4/5 or LPDDR4/5 DRAM the DQ bus is terminated low and a no-drive condition will lead to all zeros captured by the Host. LPDDR is a type of double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory that consumes less power and is targeted for mobile computers.

This condition may or may not be an issue depending on whether the Host ECC implementation has the all-zero condition as a valid codeword. Lastly TLFM-08 is a disturbance on the DQ bus that corrupts data during transmission across the physical link. This occurs in multi-rank systems where both ranks share the physical DQ bus and contention on the bus due to a fault on the memory causes corrupted data.

Let‚Äôs discuss the traditional approach to diagnostic coverage for the DRAM subsystem in automotive applications. Figure 3 shows a System on Chip (SoC) and DRAM subsystem (in this case LPDDR4). On a read cycle at a byte level (8 DQ) 128 bits of data and 8 parity bits are fetched from the array (1) and run through the on-die SEC ECC engine.

SBE are detected and corrected and the 128b data packet is transmitted to the Host (2). Something of importance to note is that the corrections of DRAM array single bits are done at the internal I/O level. The cell that stores the bad bit is not overwritten as part of the correction process. This has implications with respect to dual point latent faults and affects the LFM metric shown in Figure 1.

The SoC in this example is running a 64 +8 single error correction double error detection (SECDED) on the end-to-end data path. SECDED is an extended Hamming code that is popular in computer memory systems. These 8 parity bits are written and read like any other data by the DRAM. At the Host side the data and parity bits are reconstructed into an ECC codeword and evaluated (4). 64 bits of corrected data are passed to the core (5). The table below the figure depicts the overall diagnostic coverage of this system. As you can see this provides excellent coverage for single bit errors.

Data words with double-bit errors (DBE) are either passed to the Host uncorrected or in roughly 50 percent of the cases a miscorrect happens that turns the DBE into a triple bit error. This is inherent to the SEC ECC engine internal to the DRAM. The effect of this miscorrect is that the DBE from the DRAM get put into the MBE column at the Host as it is now a triple bit error. Depending on the implementation of the Host SECDED 30%-50% of the multiple bit errors will go undetected.

Now let‚Äôs go back to Table 1. Most of the FIT coming from the DRAM resides in TLFM-01 (single bit errors). Diagnostic coverage for these errors is relatively straightforward. But there is a significant percentage of the total critical FIT that resides in the multiple bit error bucket (TLFM-02 through TLFM-08). Some of these can be detected with common use SECDED schemes while others will go undetected. With the traditional approach as shown in Figure 3 the amount of undetected FIT from DRAM multiple bit errors prohibits the system from reaching the key hardware metrics for each ASIL shown in Figure 1.

Where does this leave us? Obviously there are gaps to closing the safety solution with traditional approaches. Luckily Micron has been working on products that address these issues at both the DRAM and system levels. While the responsibility of assessing and meeting the system safety goals lies with the integrator the memory supplier can help support the process.

As a system integrator focused on functional safety what should you ask your memory supplier? Make sure the systematic memory faults are covered through ideally an ISO 26262 certified process. Request the FMEDA analysis done on the product of interest. This analysis should include package and transient events. Ask about safety mechanisms deployed on the DRAM that address multiple bit errors latent dual-point faults and any other functionality that helps achieve the key hardware metrics as defined by the desired ASIL.

These are exciting times in the automotive industry. Advances in compute hardware are transforming the driving experience into something that resembles a scene from a science fiction movie. As cool as that is functional safety must remain the priority for this movement to continue. That‚Äôs why industry players must remain focused on functional safety in memory and making safe technologies possible. Today I write this article in my office. Tomorrow? Maybe I am writing it in my car on my commute to work as the hardware does the driving.

Aaron Boehm has served in various architecture roles in Micron with strong industry influence in the definition of DDR4 DDR5 and Wide IO2 DRAM technologies. Currently Aaron is focused on memory innovation for meeting the high-performance and functional safety requirements in automotive. He has more than 132 issued or pending U.S. and international patents on areas ranging from DRAM architecture and circuits to memory security in automotive to V2X hardware sharing and smart roadway/city infrastructure. Prior to his focus on architecture Aaron worked in product engineering at Micron.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vY2lvbmV3cy5jby5pbi9yYW5zb20td2FyZS1hdHRhY2stY29tcGFyaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ransom-ware attack: Comparis files a criminal complaint about IT systems being blocked,"Comparis did not comment on whether the incident was linked to a ransom-ware attack centred on the Florida information technology firm Kaseya that scrambled the data of hundreds of small businesses worldwide

Swiss online consumer outlet Comparis on Wednesday has filed a criminal complaint about its information technology (IT) systems being blocked by a ransom-ware attack it said on Friday.

‚ÄúAs far as we know most databases do not seem to be affected by the incident. Unfortunately first detailed analysis suggest that the perpetrators had access to certain customer-relevant data of sister company Credaris whose systems are partly operated in the same server environment‚Äù it said. Credaris is a financial brokerage.

Comparis said its website which lets consumers compare prices for goods and services was working normally again but access via e-mail and customer hotline may still be limited as it works with cyber-security specialists on a complete recovery.

Comparis did not comment on whether the incident was linked to a ransom-ware attack centred on the Florida information technology firm Kaseya that scrambled the data of hundreds of small businesses worldwide. REvil a prolific Russia-linked cybercrime syndicate took credit for the breach.

A spokesperson said Comparis did not pay a ransom to regain functionality.

In 2020 Windows had almost 83% market share by unit shipments while Google Chrome OS had 10% and Apple's Mac OS had 7% according to research firm Gartner.

From its iconic Start button to its startup sounds as well as support for corporate software and video games Windows changed the way we use computers. Windows 95 helped propel the company to dominate the market in personal computing. Microsoft has introduced many versions of Windows since its inception with some more well received than others. It's competed with IBM  Apple  and Google for market share. According to Microsoft there are more than 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10 worldwide on a monthly basis.

Today Windows only makes up 14% of Microsoft's total revenue but remains a critical part of the business. The company just announced the latest version Windows 11.

CNBC spoke with former Microsoft employees including Terry Myerson Michael Cherry Brad Silverberg and Tandy Trower to get a look back at over three decades of Windows.

When Satya Nadella became Microsoft's (MSFT 0.35%) third CEO seven years ago the tech giant was worth $300 billion. Today it's worth over $2 trillion. Microsoft will likely keep growing over the next decade but it could struggle to repeat its near-sevenfold growth since 2014.

So investors should consider a some smaller tech companies that have a shot at replicating Microsoft's massive gains. One potential candidate is salesforce.com (CRM -1.58%) a cloud enterprise software company that is currently worth about $230 billion. Let's examine Salesforce's growth rates and see if it could join the trillion-dollar club and either match or even surpass Microsoft by 2030.

The past 10 years

Between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2021 which ended this January Salesforce's annual revenue rose from $1.66 billion to $21.25 billion representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.1%.

Salesforce's sales skyrocketed as more companies adopted its cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services. It leveraged that strength to launch additional cloud sales marketing and analytics tools -- and gobbled up smaller companies to continuously expand that ecosystem.

Between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2020 which ended last June Microsoft's annual revenue rose from $62.48 billion to $143.02 billion which equals a much lower CAGR of 8.6%.

Most of that growth occurred after Nadella took the helm and aggressively expanded Microsoft's ""commercial cloud"" business which includes Office 365 (now Microsoft 365) Dynamics CRM and Azure. Between fiscal 2014 and 2020 the segment's revenue jumped from $2.8 billion to $51.7 billion.

How the next decade might go

Last December Salesforce estimated it could more than double its annual revenue to $50 billion by fiscal 2026. That would represent a CAGR of 18.7% between 2021 and 2026.

Salesforce expects the total addressable market for its entire portfolio of services (sales service marketing and commerce platform and analytics and integration) to grow at a CAGR of 11% between fiscal 2021 and 2025. It expects its own growth to outpace the broader market.

Salesforce didn't provide any forecasts beyond 2026 but it would only need to generate a CAGR of 14.9% for the following five years to hit $100 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2031.

Microsoft hasn't offered any comparable long-term forecasts but analysts expect its revenue to rise 16% this year and 12% next year. If Microsoft subsequently grows its revenue at an average rate of 10% per year or at a CAGR of 10.8% it could generate $400 billion in revenue by fiscal 2030.

Assuming that Salesforce and Microsoft's price-to-sales ratios remain roughly the same as today Salesforce could be worth about $1 trillion by the end of 2030 while Microsoft's market cap could climb over $5 trillion.

But market caps don't matter all that much

So Salesforce could join the trillion-dollar club by 2030 but it probably won't be worth more than Microsoft.

However Salesforce will likely grow faster than Microsoft during the 2020s. Companies will increasingly rely on its services to reduce their dependence on human employees automate their operations and crunch data to make business decisions. It will continue to gobble up smaller companies -- like MuleSoft Tableau and Slack -- to expand its ecosystem beyond its market-leading CRM platform.

Meanwhile Microsoft will keep growing as Azure expands its reach in the cloud infrastructure market Windows continues its evolution into a service and it launches new hardware and gaming devices.

It's impossible to tell which stock will perform better over the next decade and it's naive to assume both companies will generate unfettered growth free from competition disruption or macroeconomic shocks. However both of these tech titans should continue to expand -- so it really doesn't matter which one ends up with the bigger market cap by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1yZW1vdmVzLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtaGFjay10by1lbmFibGUtd2luZG93cy0xMC1zdGFydC1tZW51L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1yZW1vdmVzLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtaGFjay10by1lbmFibGUtd2luZG93cy0xMC1zdGFydC1tZW51L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft removes Windows 11 hack to enable Windows 10 Start Menu,"Microsoft removed a registry hack in the latest preview build that allowed Windows 11 users to revert to the ""Classic"" Windows 10 Start Menu.

When the Windows 11 preview build was leaked in June one of the most significant and most controversial changes was a new floating Start Menu centered in the middle of the Taskbar.

This new Start Menu was taken from the now-shelved Windows 10X and includes a redesigned interface with the removal of app groups and Live Tiles.

Windows 11 Start Menu

For those who did not like the new Start Menu it was possible to use a Registry hack to revert to a ""Classic Mode"" the Windows 10 Start Menu.

To switch to the Windows 10 Start Menu users could create the 'Start_ShowClassicMode' value and set it to 1 under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced registry key.

Once you created the registry value and restarted the Windows Explorer process the old Start Menu would be available again as shown below.

Windows 10 Start Menu in Windows 11

On Thursday Microsoft released Windows 11 build 22000.65 to Insiders on the 'Dev' channel. Unfortunately after installing the new cumulative update users could no longer use the Registry hack to bring back the old Start Menu.

@JenMsft I've noticed that with 22000.65 the option to bring back the old start menu (Start_ShowClassicMode) doesn't work anymore. Is there any minor chance at all that you guys revert that change so people who REALLY want it back can use it? ‚Äî Tourniquet (@wenti_man) July 8 2021

BleepingComputer has also independently confirmed that the Registry hack no longer works but it is unclear whether Microsoft will enable it again in the future.

BleepingComputer has reached out to Microsoft to learn more about this change but has not heard back at this time.

The company will continue providing its ‚ÄúQuality Updates"" during the year which includes monthly updates that bring new bugs and security patches. Feature updates are the ones that change the consumer‚Äôs user experience or add big new features that may affect how the platform grows going forward.

This could also mean that Windows 11 will have an even longer lifetime than Windows 10 did. Windows 10 used to follow a bi-yearly feature update cycle for that platform. Switching to a single big feature update could mean that Microsoft doesn‚Äôt see too many new things to add to the platform in the near future and hence may have to delay the rollout of a totally new version even more.

Companies such as Microsoft Google and Apple have also been preparing for an ambient computing future so a delay in platform updates isn‚Äôt really surprising. Ambient computing envisions computers built into surfaces and devices around us with voice and gestures as the key medium for input instead of touch keyboards mice and touchpads. Companies such as Facebook have shown prototypes of what they think such systems will look like once augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (AR) products really take off.

For instance Facebook had showcased a wrist-based AR controlled in March which could read a gesture directly off the signal our brains send to through the neurons and relay the same to an ambient computing device. Assuming Microsoft will let Windows 11 stay on the market for at least five years such devices may just start coming to the mainstream once the next version of the platform rolls out.

Myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - and pericarditis - inflammation of the lining around the heart - have been observed in a small number of people who had the vaccines.

Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) say that younger men were most likely to see the complication especially after their second jab.

The EMA and MHRA are recommending that healthcare professionals and the public be on the lookout for symptoms of heart inflammation in people who have had the two vaccines.

This includes chest pain shortness of breath palpitations and an irregular heartbeat.

Anyone with these symptoms who has been vaccinated should seek ""immediate medical attention"" the MHRA said.

But most cases were ""mild"" and people who reported the symptoms tended to recover with normal treatment and rest.

The Pfizer and Moderna jabs are mRNA vaccines which work by training your body to recognise and destroy a particular part of the coronavirus called the spike protein should you get infected with the real thing.

The MHRA says it has received 102 reports of inflammation following doses of the Pfizer jab and seven cases following administration of the Moderna jab.

Roughly 18 million first and 11 million second doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given out in the UK while around 880000 Moderna first doses have been given.

The EMA says after 177 million total Pfizer doses were given out 283 inflammation cases were reported.

And after 20 million Moderna doses 38 inflammation cases were reported.

While five of the European cases saw someone die the EMA says these were all in older people or those with other conditions.

The cases were most commonly found in men under 40 and within 10 days of a second dose.

The majority of those recovered quickly with the normal treatments for myocarditis and pericarditis as well as rest.

The EMA is also making updates to list myocarditis and pericarditis as side effects of the jabs.

The MHRA said: ""The COVID-19 vaccines remain highly effective in protecting people from COVID-19 and have already saved thousands of lives.

""These events are extremely rare and tend to be mild when they do occur.

""Our advice remains that the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks in the majority of people.

""It is still vitally important that people come forward for their first and second vaccination when invited to do so unless advised otherwise.""

No causal link has been found between the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson shots and heart inflammation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8va3VlbnNlbG9ubGluZS5jb20vdXMtc2VuZHMtNTAwMDAwLWRvc2VzLW9mLW1vZGVybmEtdmFjY2luZS10by1iaHV0YW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US sends 500000 doses of Moderna vaccine to Bhutan,"Three vaccines for consideration for the second dose

Younten Tshedup

The United States of America government yesterday announced that it has dispatched 500000 doses of Moderna vaccine to Bhutan.

The White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced this during a press briefing yesterday.

According to the Press Secretary the US also shipped three million doses to Indonesia 1.5 million (M) doses to Nepal.

This is a part of the US government‚Äôs pledge to share an initial batch of 80M US-made vaccines globally amid concerns about the wide disparity in vaccination rates between advanced and developing countries.

With this shipment besides the AstraZeneca vaccine which all eligible people in Bhutan received for their first dose two more vaccine types ‚Äî Pfizer and Moderna ‚Äî have been added to the list of vaccines to be used for the second dose in Bhutan.

The country has already received 5850 doses of Pfizer vaccines from the COVAX Facility on May 25. There are some 60000 additional Covishield (AstraZeneca) vaccines left over from the first round.

Lyonchhen recently said that the government has secured some 550000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines which includes 250000 doses from Denmark.

With the US government shipping 500000 doses of Moderna vaccines yesterday this puts Bhutan in a very good position to vaccinate its entire population including children below 18 years.

Kuensel learnt that the government had also secured about 200000 doses of Pfizer vaccine from the US.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki makes the announcement during a briefing yesterday

The government for now has not specified as to which vaccine would be rolled out for the second dose which is tentatively scheduled in the third week of this month.

The concern now according to health officials is to vaccinate all Bhutanese and those living in the country with the second dose as the 16-week period after the first dose is coming to an end.

Prime Minister Dr Lotay Tshering said that although it was likely that people in the country would get second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine should the national immunization technical advisory group (NI-TAG) recommend a heterologous (mix-and-match) method of the vaccination the government has access to both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.

‚ÄúWho will get what kind of vaccine is being worked out currently. In the next one or two days NI-TAG should be ready with their recommendation‚Äù Lyonchhen said yesterday. ‚ÄúThere is no reason for us to hide this information from the public. All our decisions will be based on science and recommendation from the experts.‚Äù

Developed countries like Spain Canada and Germany have already started vaccinating their population with the mix-and-match mode of vaccination where the initial dose of AstraZeneca has been boosted with a mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccine in the second. Germany‚Äôs Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are some of the world leaders to mix their Covid-19 vaccines recently.

The NI-TAG has also recommended a mix-and-match mode of vaccination given the successful outcome globally.

Herd Immunity

Besides the adequate number of vaccines secured for now the most critical part would be achieving an adequate level of vaccination coverage to achieve herd immunity.

Lyonchhen said that the more contagious the disease the higher the population coverage is required to achieve herd immunity. ‚ÄúIn the pre-Delta variant period during our first vaccination campaign we required at least 70 percent of our population to be vaccinated. We could manage only about 65 percent then.‚Äù

He said that for the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus the required vaccine coverage was a minimum of 80 percent. ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt cover our children below 18 years it would be really difficult for us to achieve herd immunity.‚Äù

Officials said that close to 30 percent of the country‚Äôs population were aged 18 years and below. ‚ÄúSo to achieve the 80 percent coverage every single individual above the age of 18 has to be vaccinated‚Äù said Lyonchhen adding that it was critical to vaccinate children to achieve herd immunity.

According to the 2017 population and housing census of Bhutan the projected population of Bhutan in 2021 is 756129. This would mean that there are about 226000 people below 18 years.

Currently the only Covid-19 vaccine certified for children below 18 years is the US‚Äôs Pfizer vaccine. However studies have also shown that the Moderna vaccine was safe and effective among children aged 12-17 years. The company has sought approval from the United States‚Äô Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use their vaccines in children above the age of 12 years.

Given the urgency Lyonchhen urged all eligible individuals to come forward and get vaccinated this time. He said that the vaccines had two definite benefits ‚Äî to prevent people from being infected and from developing serious disease once infected.

However he cautioned that the vaccines would be effective against only those variants of the virus which are in circulation now.

‚ÄúWith the rate at which new variants of concern are emerging we are all worried. Following our second dose if we hurry to relax the protocols and if a new variant of concern emerges it would overwhelm all of us‚Äù he said.

In the meantime some 400 Bhutanese had already received their second dose of the vaccine. The recipients are those who had travelled outside the country.

Sowai Lyonpo (health minister) Dechen Wangmo said that the majority of the recipients were students returning to their schools outside. ‚ÄúThere were also those who work and live aboard. We started giving the second dose after they completed eight weeks following the first dose.‚Äù

Lyonchhen said that none who are still in the country has received the second dose of the vaccine.

Vaccination Taskforce Head Doctor Rachel Devi says this has been made possible through the support of the United States of America under the COVAX Facility vaccine dose sharing mechanism.

This is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance CEPI WHO and UNICEF.

‚ÄúThe benefit of Moderna is that you get fully immunized within the 28days rather than having to wait for another month. We have other strategies that we are planning right now and we will release it soon as to how and where we will roll this out across the country.‚Äù



Doctor Devi says the age limit will remain the same as the AstraZeneca vaccine however pregnant women will be able to receive the Moderna vaccine to protect themselves against the risk of severe illness hospitalization and other consequences of COVID-19.

‚ÄúThis will definitely boost the campaign especially right now we were not vaccinating pregnant women with AstraZeneca unless individuals consented. But I know there is quite a lot of build-up in that area now and there is a lot of evidence on the safety as well.‚Äù



An individual requires two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for full protection with the second dose to be administered 28 days after the first dose.

The Ministry of Health recommends people receive the same type of COVID-19 vaccine for both first and second doses without mixing them.

Like the AstraZeneca vaccines two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can protect individuals from severe illness hospitalization and death from COVID-19.",,,,,,

But with a constant demand for workers that will only grow with approaching retirements current trade workers are trying to change that narrative.

A 2020 Buildforce study found that more than 257000 construction workers are anticipated to retire by 2029 while the industry is only expected to grow by just over 50000 workers. Anticipating a job shortage Ontario recently announced more than $1 million would go toward the Christian Labour Association of Canada to cover the costs of 300 construction workers who want to take online training for leadership roles.

Dale McGavin director of training at UA Local 67 which represents the plumbing steam fitting and welding trades says the industry is always booming. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a shortage and we‚Äôre always looking for people.‚Äù

The key to filling that gap in the industries is not just finding bodies to fill the field he continues but finding people who have the ‚Äúright mentality‚Äù about the job and understand that it‚Äôs a real career path.

‚ÄúPeople look at the trades as a fallback and there‚Äôs stigma that it‚Äôs not an academic field‚Äù he says.

There is intensive post-secondary training even within apprenticeships for these trades and the industry requires a different type of learning such as learning the language necessary for understanding blueprints.

McGavin says it‚Äôs common for people to come from an academic background into the trades when they realize they have a passion for it. ‚ÄúFor some the end all goal isn‚Äôt to be a qualified tradesperson; they‚Äôll move on they‚Äôll get into management they‚Äôll get into estimates‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúPeople can create their own businesses.‚Äù

Why become a trade worker?

Rachel Hesketh who now works as an apprentice plumber after trying out a few different trades through a pre-apprenticeship via UA Local 67 was working as an early childhood educator before changing career paths.

She says the stigma around the profession is what originally stopped her from considering that career path acknowledging that it‚Äôs something she never thought she could go into. But the pre-apprenticeship program was specifically geared towards bringing more women into the trades so she felt more encouraged to give it a try. ‚ÄúIt was just so different than what I had ever done before‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI loved it it helped satisfy that need for learning.‚Äù

Hesketh enjoys the practicality of plumbing because plumbing issues are a ‚Äúconstant‚Äù so there‚Äôs always something new to learn. ‚ÄúI love how different every day can be and how much problem solving and adaptability is needed just to get through a day or even a task. It definitely keeps things interesting‚Äù she says.

Trades are a ‚Äúhumbling‚Äù profession she adds because of the challenge of something new every day.

‚ÄúYou realize how much you don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs that constant opportunity to learn that I love‚Äù she says.

What are the drawbacks?

Hesketh says that while things are changing it‚Äôs still tough being one of only a few women on the workforce. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been the only woman on the job site before and I find that challenging‚Äù she explains.

Only around three per cent of the on-site construction workforce in Ontario are women. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs changing‚Äù Hesketh says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trailblazers anymore there have already been those women working in the field.‚Äù

McGavin adds there‚Äôs a misconception around safety concerns when it comes to job sites for construction trades but he says unions commit to rigorous training for workers.

How do I become a trade worker in Ontario?

For those interested in working in the construction trades there are options even during high school to get your start in the field. Students can start an apprenticeship or co-op if they‚Äôre at least 16 years old in Ontario. You can also take free pre-apprenticeship courses if you‚Äôre in your last two years of high school about to go into college or in college or even if you‚Äôre not in school at all.

Once you complete your apprenticeship you can go on to get your certificate of qualification and further qualifications depending on the trade. Hesketh says there are extensive financial support options and incentives for those looking to pursue a trade so that you can be virtually debt-free by the time you finish your education. Entry-level positions could start at around $40000 with plenty of room for advancement.

Hesketh says that women ‚Äì or anybody who has felt like this industry has not been marketed for them ‚Äì should give the trades a try if they have even the slightest bit of interest.

‚ÄúIf you happen to have an opportunity to do a pre-apprenticeship program or anything that gets you into it even if it‚Äôs learning how to use power tools ‚Äì these kinds of things that are stopping you from feeling like you can do it ‚Äì just go for it. It‚Äôs not as overwhelming as it might seem‚Äù she says.

BBJ: Hard seltzer is a relatively new type of alcoholic drink which has earned considerable popularity in the United States over the past decade. What lies behind the decision to expand Borsodi‚Äôs portfolio beyond beers?

Gy√∂rgy Spiegel: Before launching a brand-new beverage category in Hungary we were thoroughly monitoring the market developments locally in the CEE region and globally. We could see that hard seltzers have become one of the most popular alcoholic drink categories for Americans in the global beverage market. Molson Coors the parent company of Borsodi Brewery has recently begun to introduce the hard seltzer to its portfolio with great success in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. It is now time to present it in the CEE after a thorough assessment of the local specifics of the market. In Hungary we could see the forming of a new wave of consumers with an experimental attitude who enthusiastically discover new products. So we have decided to go beyond beer and introduce this new category. Hard seltzer is a type of alcoholic beverage containing carbonated water alcohol and often a fruit aroma. The alcohol volume is 4- 6% and the calorie content is about 100 kcal per can. Our WAI Moment is under 99 kcal per can has exceptional quality and natural delicious flavors.

BBJ: What are Borsodi's sales expectations and who is the target audience?

GyS: In markets where the products have already been introduced the hard seltzer has generated 200% growth in the last two years. We hope that the category will expand similarly in CEE in the coming years. Hard seltzer is a fresh new lifestyle drink for a new generation of urban working adult folk who love to stay in shape and look for exciting beverages that fit their busy yet fun-loving lifestyle.

BBJ: What is the feedback regarding WAI Moment so far? Do consumers have a favorite flavor?

GyS: We launched three really different flavors of WAI Moment in May which satisfy different tastes called ‚ÄúMinty Lime Time‚Äù ‚ÄúTropical Crew‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrazy Berries.‚Äù Although only two months have passed since its introduction we can say that all three products seem to be popular so far.

BBJ: In terms of your more traditional beer category the brewery has been going through a large-scale portfolio expansion in the last few years. To what extent did these new products help introduce Borsodi to new audiences and revamp the brand‚Äôs image?

GyS: The experiences of recent years have shown that our consumers are more and more open to new tastes and willing to experiment. Based on this feedback we decided to launch the first two members of our new ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù craft portfolio last year Borsodi Hoppy and Borsodi IPA. Our first experiences have been positive and consumer and professional feedback have been appreciative. As a result we decided to expand the portfolio further with ale-type beers thus strengthening and even introducing the Borsodi brand to new audiences as well as serving the ever-changing needs of our existing customers.

BBJ: Can we expect the debut of a new addition to the beer portfolio or a limited edition this summer?

GyS: In time for the summer sports events we have launched a limited edition of our Borsodi lager beer with diverse limited edition promotional packages presenting different superstitions of sports fans. Consumers can find them while stocks last. Also we have been preparing for the reopening of terraces and bars across the country and hope that more people will have the chance to enjoy a nice time with their friends accompanied by a pint of Borsodi. We have launched the newest member of the Borsodi Friss portfolio a 0.0% non-alcoholic beer in pear and apple flavor.

Borsodi Box

Borsodi S√∂rgy√°r Rt. began brewing beer in 1973 in the village of B≈ëcs near Miskolc (187 km northeast of Budapest by road). Privatized after the collapse of communism it was purchased in 1993 by Belgium‚Äôs Interbrew (today Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV). In mid-October 2009 private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser‚ÄìBusch InBev‚Äôs holdings in Central Europe including Borsodi for EUR 2.23 billion and renamed the operation StarBev. In 2012 the StarBev Group was taken over by its current owners Molson Coors Beverage Company the American-Canadian firm which is the fifth-biggest brewer globally.

Maybe your body needs more vitamins so fruits and vegetables are the right choices. Maybe you need something filling to help tide you over until dinner which means you'll want a snack that contains protein healthy fats and fiber such as peanut butter on whole-wheat toast or cheese and nuts.

As it turns out there may be one type of snack that could not only keep you satiated throughout the day but could also lend your gut some support. In part this could potentially even help you prevent cardiovascular disease. According to new research snacks fortified with a range of different plant fibers could be able to change your gut microbiome for the better and as a result keep your heart healthy.

15 Prebiotic Foods for Your Probiotic Efforts

The study published in the journal Nature looked at how adding various combinations of four different kinds of plant fibers can affect gut microbiota aka the hundreds of species of microscopic organisms that live in the digestive tract. First the researchers explored this effect on mice.

In the second phase of the study researchers asked 12 human participants who were overweight or obese to eat a strictly controlled diet that was high in saturated fat and low in fiber. Then they were asked to include snack bars that were rich in pea fiber for a two-week period.

In the final phase of the study researchers had a different group of 14 subjects eat a snack that featured a combination of two types of fiber: pea fiber and inulin‚Äîa prebiotic fiber that can be found in chicory root and bananas among other plant-based foods. Then after a washout period they began eating snacks that contained pea finer and inulin as well as two other types of fiber: orange fiber and barley bran.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

What did they discover? Participants' gut health responded well to all fiber-supplemented snacks but the snacks that featured all four kinds of fiber had the most positive effects on participants' ability to metabolize the fiber.

This finding is important especially for those of us who tend to follow the typical Western diet. The researchers note that the kinds of processed foods common in this diet tend to be fairly low in fiber which poses a number of risks since the nutrient is linked with fighting heart disease and type 2 diabetes. But keep in mind volunteers in this study ate tightly controlled diets. In reality this wouldn't be the case.

Another important thing to address about this study is that three of the researchers are employees of Mondelƒìz International‚Äîand it was partially funded by the company (all of the snacks used in this study were also designed by Mondelƒìz). If you're not familiar Mondelƒìz is a snack food company that brought in roughly $27 billion in net revenues last year. The company produces Oreos Ritz crackers Sour Patch Kids and a bunch of other popular brands including some targeted at more health-conscious shoppers.

As you can imagine the company has a lot to gain from being able to show off a new kind of snack food's health benefits. That doesn't mean that the research isn't legit‚Äîit's just worth keeping in mind especially if we see Mondelƒìz advertising a new nutrition bar featuring the four different types of fiber sometime soon.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: JPMORGAN PEPSICO GOLDMAN SACHS

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr.

Toy robots industrial robots in production lines household robots (such as vacuum cleaners and pool cleaners) medical robots and also security robots most often used in the police and military For bomb disposal and suspected IEDs. These robots have saved and will continue saving lives on a daily basis and as they grow smarter and more accurate human life can be preserved. Currently there are still ""mines"" that need to be removed to make way for life- saving robots with perfect capabilities. One of the most challenging technological gaps that employ security systems around the world is the need to be able to perform tasks inside structures without a person present on the ground using remote-operated technological means.

""The Defense Ministry is constantly looking for advanced technologies in order to bring an operational advantage to the field. Over the past two years the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure has focused its efforts on developing autonomous robotic technologies for domestic and foreign missions "" says Lt. Col. Ryan Gity head of the Autonomous Systems Department at the Directorate of Research and Development in Technology Research and Infrastructure.

Now in order to locate technologies and products relevant to this challenge the MoSAIC Challenge has been launched a $600000 reward challenge that will be given to innovative companies/researchers/technologies aimed at enabling the operation of robotic within buildings. The challenge is led by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) the Director of Technical Support for Irregular Warfare (IWTSD) the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD) the Research Administration and development of drones and technological infrastructures from the DDR&D and the Merage Institute established by the philanthropists Paul and Lilly Merage together with a goal to create and locate new technologies in the field and promoting their development.

""The U.S. Department of Defense realized many years ago that groundbreaking innovations are taking place outside government labs and traditional defense contractors"" explains International Program Manager IWTSD Adam Tarsi. ""We are sponsoring the MoSAIC challenge together with our partners at the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure to ensure that we locate and identify all relevant technologies that can provide our military‚Äôs tactical operators and law enforcement agencies with every technological advantage when operating in challenging and high-risk internal environments.""

Any company that presents its candidacy will enter an e-book which will be widely distributed to American and Israeli government officials in order to enable direct contact by government officials to companies with the relevant technology and products. The challenge‚Äôs team of judges is made of government content experts. Candidates selected by the judges to participate in advanced stages of the challenge will have access to workshops knowledge sessions network events mentoring and media advertising. The winners of each of the five mini challenges will be announced at the final event held in Tel Aviv in spring of 2022 and will have the chance to meet clients and sponsors from the Israeli and U.S. governments as well as investors and other international partners and will receive financial awards and free participation in the Leadership Program for Start-Up Managers of the Merage Institute in California.

The potential of the challenge for first time contestants can be measured by the success rate of similar collaborations from previous years. The MoSAIC challenge Offers companies and researchers Many advantages mainly this is an opportunity that doesn‚Äôt come around often to present their technological solutions to government officials from The U.S. and Israel.

IWTSD's Liaison Officer to Israel Shana Yakobi mentions that ""There are many success stories of companies that have resulted from their participation in past challenges of the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure and IWTSD. For example RoboTiCan and Third Eye are two companies with active R&D programs with the US and Israeli governments that were initially brought to our attention when they participated in similar challenges in the past. We wouldn't know about these companies if it wasn't for the challenge. I believe that everyone who enters the challenge gets opportunities for exposure and connections even thanks to their presentation in the eBook of the challenge.

The challenge will be divided into five mini challenges with each challenge focusing on a different capability two of which are physical: discovering human presence through walls; tactical robotic systems for movement within structures while overcoming obstacles; and three of the mini-challenges that will be virtual: navigating within a structure; mapping structure; tagging people and objects. Each of the mini-challenges is of considerable importance as told by Gity head of the Department of Autonomous Systems at the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure: ""With the understanding that the progress of the development of technological solutions for internal robotics is much more mature in non-military industries we have decided together with the American IWTSD and with the help of the Technological Division of the IDF's Ground Forces to initiate a challenge that will help us locate and identify the technologies. By integrating these five challenges into MOSAIC we will be able to develop the next generation of internal robotics"" says Gity emphasizing ""By integrating these five challenges into the MoSAIC framework we will be able to develop the next generation of internal robotics.""

Paul Merage founder and CEO of the Merage Institute is looking forward to seeing the participants in the challenge and mentions other benefits that will emerge from taking part in it: ""The MoSAIC Challenge is a rare opportunity for entrepreneurs researchers and companies to present the technology they are developing to the U.S. and Israeli governments create international collaborations and identify new opportunities in the field that present a growing demand for technologies that enable autonomous maneuver in closed spaces. ""The Merage Institute is glad to use its capabilities as a leading center for the development of Israeli entrepreneurs and startups in developing cooperation with the American market.

The physical demonstration phase of the challenge is scheduled to take place in spring 2022 in the city of Yeruham. Tal Ohana head of the Yeruham regional Council said: ""As part of an entire ecosystem in the field of unmanned aerial tools including a test field an academic campus and an accelerator for companies in the near future we are proud to host the MoSAIC International Challenge in Yeruham which will be attended by companies from all over the world. The choice of Yeruham as a site for the competition reflects the technological revolution that the city has undergon in recent years. The ecosystem in the field of unmanned aerial tools is one of the main growth engines in the city. The challenge is a way for us to show the companies the existing infrastructures in the city of Yeruham that can support their business development processes. We thank our friends at the IWTSD and the Merage Institute for having faith in Yeruham.""

Being a competition it is permissible to mention ‚Äì there are prizes for the big winners. With a cash prize of $600000 that will be distributed to winners in each of the five challenges. And the really big prize the one that doesn't necessarily have an exact ""amount"" or ""date"" but gives the greatest value and meaning to the project is called: Saving Lives. So it may not be the year when robots change babies‚Äô diapers or take your dog for a walk at 6 am but when it‚Äôll be a year that brings robots to complex security missions with high end technology we'll all have a reason to smile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvZGlnaXRhbC1wYXltZW50cy1zdGFydC11cC1tb2Jpa3dpay1uZWFycy1maWxpbmctZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLWlwby0xMjEwNzEwMDAwMDVfMS5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvZGlnaXRhbC1wYXltZW50cy1zdGFydC11cC1tb2Jpa3dpay1uZWFycy1maWxpbmctZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLWlwby0xMjEwNzEwMDAwMDVfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital payments start-up Mobikwik nears filing for $300-million IPO,"One MobiKwik Systems the digital wallet and payments start-up is preparing to file a draft prospectus for a Mumbai initial public offering that could raise about $300 million people familiar with the matter said.

Apple and Amazon crossed that milestone in 2018 Microsoft followed suit in 2019 and Facebook joined the club earlier this year.

Many other tech stocks could join that elite group within the next decade -- and investors who hop on board today could reap massive multibagger gains. Could one of those stocks be Roblox the gaming company which gained millions of new users during the pandemic?

How much is Roblox worth today?

Roblox went public via a direct listing this March with a reference price of $45. The stock opened at $64.50 and currently trades in the high $80s -- which gives it a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion. For Roblox to become a $1 trillion company by 2030 the stock would need to rise about 20 times.

No pure-play video game company has crossed the $1 trillion mark yet. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts two of the world's largest video game publishers are currently worth about $70 billion and $40 billion respectively. Unity which indirectly competes against Roblox in the game engine and development space is worth roughly $30 billion.

If we compare these four companies' price-to-sales ratios we'll notice the market is paying a much higher premium for game creation engines like Roblox and Unity than traditional video game publishers.

But is Roblox a fad or a new content platform?

However there are some key differences between Roblox and Unity.

Roblox is a platform that enables younger users many of whom don't have any coding experience to build simple block-based games and share them with other players. Unity is an advanced game development engine that powers over half of the world's mobile PC and console games.

Roblox encourages users to monetize their games with an in-app currency called Robux within its walled garden. Unity offers developers more flexible tools for integrating in-app ads in-app purchases and other features into their games.

The bulls claim Roblox's self-sustaining cycle of content creation self-promotion and monetization will fuel its long-term growth. The bears will point out that half of the platform's daily active users (DAUs) are under the age of 13 and they might eventually grow out of Roblox's simple experiences or graduate to a more advanced game development engine like Unity.

The bulls will point to Roblox's growth rates. Between the first quarters of 2018 and 2021 Roblox's DAUs more than quadrupled from 10.3 million to 42.1 million its total hours engaged surged from 2.1 billion to 9.7 billion and its average bookings per DAU jumped from $11.62 to $15.48.

Roblox's revenue rose 56% in 2019 soared 82% in 2020 and analysts expect 167% growth this year. But next year they expect its revenue to rise just 26% after the pandemic ends and more students return to school.

The bears will point out Roblox isn't profitable and it probably can't achieve profitability without reducing its exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Robux for developers. However doing so could alienate its developers and throttle the platform's output of new content.

Why Roblox probably can't hit $1 trillion by 2030

Even if Roblox maintains a premium price-to-sales ratio of 20 through 2030 it would need to generate $50 billion in annual sales to hit the $1 trillion mark. Roblox generated just $933 million in revenues in 2020 so it would need to generate a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 50% to hit $50 billion by 2030.

If Roblox's valuations cool off as they'll likely do over the years it will need to generate an ever higher CAGR to become a $1 trillion company. By comparison Amazon grew its revenues at a CAGR of 27.4% over the past decade -- and it currently trades at just four times this year's sales. Therefore it seems highly unlikely Roblox will become a $1 trillion company within the next decade.

But that doesn't mean Roblox won't generate multibagger gains over the next decade. It could remain popular long after the pandemic passes attract a new generation of younger users and launch more powerful tools for advanced users. As it continues to expand economies of scale should kick in and strengthen its earnings growth. Therefore Roblox could still have plenty of room to run -- just don't expect it to join the 12-zero club anytime soon.

This is heavy Doc. The Back to the Future trilogy is no longer available on Netflix. The beloved movie trilogy left the streaming platform again on Wednesday June 30. This means fans of the series can only relive the adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown by renting them on VOD platforms. Universal Pictures has also released the films countless times on home video most recently on 4K UHD in October 2020. The Back to the Future movies also often return to Netflix so they could be back soon.

All three Back to the Future movies star Michael J. Fox as Marty and Christopher Lloyd as Doc. In the original 1985 film Marty accidentally goes back to 1955 where he ruins his parents' first meeting and puts his very existence in danger. In Back to the Future Part II (1989) Marty makes a critical error during a trip to 2015 that changes the timeline. In Back to the Future Part III (1990) Marty goes back to the Old West to save Doc. All three films were directed by Robert Zemeckis who wrote the scripts with Bob Gale. Steven Spielberg was a producer on the trilogy.

The three films returned to Netflix on May 1. The films were also available for a few months in 2020. When they joined Netflix that time some eagle-eyed fans noticed that there was a very sloppy edit in Back to the Future Part II but it was quickly resolved. During one scene in the movie Marty thought he got the sports almanac back from Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) only to find out that Biff used the dust jacket to cover his copy of Ooh La La magazine. This shot vital to the climax of the movie was briefly missing. It was eventually reinstated.

Although the original Back to the Future celebrated its 36th anniversary in 2021 it still remains one of the most beloved movie franchises ever made. Lloyd who played Doc Brown even starred in a Discovery+ series called Expedition: Back to the Future in which he joined Expedition Unknown host Josh Gates to find a screen-used DeLorean DMC-12. The series was released in March and featured guest appearances from Fox Lea Thompson and James Tolkan.

When promoting the new show Lloyd said one reason the films still connect with audiences has nothing to do with time traveling. At the heart of the film Gale and Zemeckis crafted a relateable family story. ""Back to the Future it's Michael J. Fox his mom and dad"" Lloyd told TooFab. ""It's a family picture and they go through some surprising times themselves. All families have that in one way or another. You know everyone relates to that. Everybody relates to Michael J. Fox as a teenager going through school.""

It's also worth noting that the Back to the Future franchise is one of the few that will never see a reboot or another sequel. In an October 2020 interview with Collider Gale said they told a ""complete story"" in the original trilogy and also said there is no way to make a BTTF movie without Fox as Marty. Gale also explained that he and Zemeckis have a deal with producer Steven Spielberg that makes it impossible to make another movie without their involvement.

""We didn't want to be those guys who did a movie that was basically a money grab"" Gale said. ""Universal says to us 'You'd guys would make a whole lot of money' but we're like 'Well we've already made a whole lot of money with these movies and we like them just the way they are. And as proud parents we're not going to sell our kids into prostitution.'"""

But for the man who through his investigations in the Guardian set off the events that brought down the UK‚Äôs biggest-selling Sunday newspaper it did not feel like a victory.

‚ÄúNobody at the Guardian wanted the News of the World to close down‚Äù said Nick Davies the reporter who exposed the phone hacking scandal. ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt even dreamed that the Murdochs would do such a horrible thing.‚Äù

Over the course of a few days in July 2011 the News of the World had gone from having tens of millions of readers who every weekend lapped up its agenda-setting mix of sex scandal and scoops to becoming a pariah publication considered beyond salvation.

It began on the Monday of that week when Davies and colleague Amelia Hill revealed that the News of the World‚Äôs reporters had illegally accessed the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. By Thursday owner Rupert Murdoch had concluded his 168-year-old tabloid had became politically toxic and threatened his takeover of broadcaster Sky. He abruptly shut the paper down and sacked most of the 200 staff.

‚ÄúUsually we made the news but at that point we‚Äôd become the news‚Äù said Tom Latchem the News of the World‚Äôs TV editor when it closed speaking a decade on. He began to realise the newspaper was doomed when the candidate fired by Alan Sugar on that week‚Äôs episode of The Apprentice cancelled an interview as a result of the Dowler story: ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôre really in trouble here. If these people who are desperate for fame at almost any cost are pulling out then that‚Äôs not a great sign.‚Äù

For years Murdoch‚Äôs company had falsely maintained that just ‚Äòone rogue reporter‚Äô ‚Äì former royal editor Clive Goodman ‚Äì had hacked voicemails while paying off other celebrity victims and playing down Davies‚Äô stories. But it was the Dowler revelation that caught the public‚Äôs attention.

Ten years on former News of the World staff ‚Äì and victims of its tactics ‚Äì have taken part in an episode of Radio 4‚Äôs Archive on 4 about the closure. They recall a pressurised newsroom where almost any method was justified to get a front page scoop with thousands of pounds kept in a safe in the office to buy up stories at the last minute.

‚ÄúIt got to the ridiculous stage sometimes where I‚Äôd be sending out someone on a story and the features department would also be sending a reporter and we‚Äôd be bidding against each other‚Äù said James Weatherup a former news editor who later pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

Paul McMullan a former News of the World reporter described a typical sting: ‚Äú[A celebrity] checked into a hotel room in Paris with a new girlfriend who wasn‚Äôt his wife. So what we did is we rang up the hotel pretending to be his accountant and said we need the entire bill please with all the phone calls so we can itemise it. And the hotel rather stupidly just faxed over his bill and we just rang all of the numbers until we found the home number of his girlfriend then sent some paparazzis to get a picture.‚Äù

McMullan who infamously told the subsequent Leveson inquiry into press ethics that ‚Äúprivacy is for paedos‚Äù also described leading the newspaper‚Äôs campaign against paedophiles which inadvertently led to a paediatrician‚Äôs home being vandalised in south Wales: ‚ÄúIt is amazing that you can just write something that took an afternoon and people were rioting in the streets.‚Äù

But it was the desire to scoop rivals using almost any method possible that would bring about the downfall of the paper. News editor Greg Miskiw helped introduce phone hacking to the newspaper after learning about it from a private investigator: ‚ÄúOne day during a conversation he said you do realise that I can listen to people‚Äôs voicemails? And I said wow that‚Äôs astonishing we might use that service. And so we did.‚Äù

The technique was simple. All it required was knowing an individual‚Äôs mobile phone number. The reporter would ring it hope it went to voicemail then guess the individual‚Äôs PIN ‚Äì usually still set to the default of ‚Äò0000‚Äô or ‚Äò1234‚Äô. They could immediately listen to all the voicemails left on that individual‚Äôs phone. In an era before smartphones made it easier to send lengthy text messages a typical set of voicemails could include everything from declarations of love to private medical information.

‚ÄúI would choose my targets very very carefully‚Äù said Miskiw. ‚ÄúBut by the time I left the London office the people put in charge were just hacking everybody. And that‚Äôs how it eventually unravelled.‚Äù

Thousands of people were targeted. Journalists listened in to hundreds of messages left by the then home secretary David Blunkett who was in charge of the police and security services.

Blunkett said the subsequent front page expose of his relationship with a married woman caused friendships to break down: ‚ÄúI was in the public eye. And I was responsible for my behaviour. But it‚Äôs always the family of people that gets hurt.‚Äù

Murdoch is said to have regretted the decision to shut the newspaper. At one point after its closure he informally suggested to BuzzFeed then a fast-growing online news outlet aimed at millennials that it could reuse the News of the World brand. They declined.

Instead he is still dealing with the clear-up bill. Fifteen years after the first phone hacking conviction tens of millions of pounds are still being spent by News UK every year settling claims from phone-hacking victims. The practice was also widespread at the Mirror and Sunday People all of which continue to deal with cases.

The biggest UK tabloid that never admitted hacking voicemails is the Sun the News of the World‚Äôs sister newspaper. Despite this only last month Murdoch‚Äôs company paid substantial damages to former MP Simon Hughes who specifically claimed he was illegally targeted by the Sun. The settlement ensured Hughes‚Äô claims were never heard in open court.

When pictures of Matt Hancock‚Äôs clinch with an aide were splashed on the front page of the Sun last month it was a rare throwback to the era where such exposes arrived almost every Sunday. Even then much-tightened privacy law meant it was the couple‚Äôs breach of social distancing rules ‚Äì as much as the affair ‚Äì which helped legally justify publication.

Looking back at the News of the World‚Äôs closure a decade on Davies said a chance for real change had been missed: ‚ÄúThere was an extraordinary period which only lasted a few weeks and it was like seeing the teacher chased out of the classroom. And just for a brief period we didn‚Äôt have to be frightened of Rupert Murdoch and his dreadful newspapers and politicians were free to say what they thought and advertisers were free to tell him to get stuffed.

‚ÄúBut you know power doesn‚Äôt relax its grip easily. And slowly and insidiously Murdoch got his bony fingers back around the throat of British public life and has kept them there.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA3L2phbWVzdG93bi1hZHZhbmNlZC1wcm9kdWN0cy1jb3JwLWV4cGVyaWVuY2luZy1yZWNvcmQtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWdyb3d0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamestown Advanced Products Corp. Experiencing Record Expansion Growth,"Since October 2020 I have been communicating with the public through this monthly article about all of the great things going on throughout Chautauqua County as they relate to economic development. These commentaries may include discussions about specific projects of public interest that are underway or have been completed where they are at and if completed how they are performing. They may also include discussions about initiatives being undertaken at various agencies or at the County level including but not limited to the County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency the Chautauqua Region Economic Development Corporation the Chautauqua County Partnership for Economic Growth the Chautauqua County Department of Planning & Development the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation the Workforce Development Board the Chautauqua County Visitors Bureau educational institutions foundations or at any one of the many agencies whose mission makes them a critical partner in economic development initiatives throughout the County.

This month I am featuring Jamestown Advanced Products Corporation a Jamestown-based company that continues to innovate prosper and create jobs.

As Jamestown Advanced Products Corporation approaches nearly four decades in business as an American metal manufacturer the family-owned company is experiencing record growth and expansion. Known primarily as a premier manufacturer of campground products and industrial-grade site furnishings throughout North America Jamestown Advanced Products‚Äô development is due to the growth of camping and the propensity of the public to covet being outdoors as well as the recent success of two additional divisions ‚Äì the newly formed Homestead Implements and SevereClean Ultrasonics.

Despite still feeling the impact of the global pandemic Jamestown Advanced Products launched the brand-new division Homestead Implements re-invigorated the existing SevereClean Ultrasonics and saw record-breaking sales for 2020 in their campground division. Led by an ever-growing sales team Jamestown Advanced Products capitalized on the nationwide rush to find socially distanced vacation opportunities. That opportunity presented itself in the form of thousands of campgrounds throughout North America.

The company‚Äôs foundation Jamestown Advanced Products is known throughout the country as a premier manufacturer of commercial-grade site furnishings and campground products. With the recent travel boom to campgrounds Jamestown Advanced Products is well-poised to see continued year-over-year growth. Campers and travelers can find their products throughout National Parks KOA campgrounds and cities including locally in downtown Jamestown.

As the company progresses new product lines are in development that will continue to push Jamestown Advanced Products forward in the site furnishing market. This spring marked the release of their brand-new Empire Collection a modern slim-profile set of furnishings finished with ipe a Brazilian hardwood known for its durability and beautiful natural hue. The company has also recently joined forces with Recycling Across America to offer a standardized set of labels to their trash receptacles to boost recycling efficiency throughout the country.

Originally planned to launch in February 2020 Homestead Implements delayed the unveiling due to the emergence of COVID-19. Finally launched in July Homestead Implements experienced an immediate interest that grew throughout the last nine months to reach unexpected heights. The new division which required a boost of employees and unique processing technology is on pace for record sales in their first year alone with no end in sight. Co-owner Lee Lodestro stated ‚ÄúWe are continuing to research the market and design new attachments that can improve the impact a tractor can have.‚Äù Homestead Implements offers a complete lineup of attachments including box blades land planes landscape rakes post-hole diggers brush cutters and rotary tillers. Still the best-selling item by far is their set of grapples a versatile front-end hydraulic attachment taking the tractor world by storm. ‚ÄúGrapples are still fairly new in the tractor scene and we are proud to offer several variations that combine American labor unique design traits and heavy-duty materials‚Äù said Lodestro. ‚ÄúA grapple goes beyond a standard tractor bucket and completely changes the way a tractor owner utilizes their machine around their homestead.‚Äù

Lodestro is a lifelong tractor owner and enthusiast that wanted to manufacture and develop a line of heavy-duty tractor attachments for the small-scale farmer and homesteader. With industry giants like Kubota and John Deere experiencing significant lead time delays and supply chain interruptions the market was ripe for a new player in compact tractor attachments. Homestead Implements attachments are already available at two Chautauqua County equipment suppliers 3 Seas Recreation in Mayville and Larry Romance & Son in Sheridan. With several other dealer orders placed and plenty of additional inquiries Homestead Implements is excited at the chance to supply homesteaders throughout the country with high-quality American-made attachments.

Homestead Implements also offers a 10% Military Appreciation Discount to active-duty and retired members of the United States Military. Additionally they have partnered with the nationwide non-for-profit Farmer Veteran Coalition organization and their 2021 Farmer Fellowship Fund to donate implements to veterans looking to further their post-military agricultural endeavors. When asked Lee stated ‚ÄúAs a Navy veteran myself I was adamant about being able to provide our implements at a discount to other service members. We‚Äôve seen a tremendous influx of orders that are taking advantage of the discount and the work we are doing with the Farmer Veteran Coalition is just another way we can help support an important cause.‚Äù

The Eagle Gold Mine has been fined for spilling cyanide and instructed to refurbish a newly-constructed creek crossing.

The mine operated by Victoria Gold was inspected by the Yukon government on May 20.

Investigation found a cyanide solution spill took place on March 15. Sodium cyanide is used in heap leach mining to dissolve gold out of ore.

According to the inspectors‚Äô comments the 70-litre spill originated from the mine‚Äôs heap leach facility. The inspector found that the spill could have been prevented if the company had followed the approved protocols and practices in their cyanide management plan and standard practices and procedures relating to heap leach facilities.

The mining company was issued a summary convictions fine under the Environment Act for the release of contaminants and failure to handle a hazardous substance in a way that prevents contamination. According to major mines inspector Matthew Jenner two $230 fines were issued under section 112 and section 122 of the environment act.

John McConnell Victoria Gold‚Äôs CEO said in an interview that cleanup from the spill took place in March shortly after it was found on an access road.

Contaminated material from the site of the spill was dug up and put back into the heap leach facility he explained. When further samples found traces of cyanide he said the area was excavated again and one more test found no cyanide.

McConnell added that design modifications have been made for the heap leach facility with the goal of preventing future spills.

The inspectors who visited the mine on May 20 also issued an immediate request for corrective action to the construction of a culvert allowing for the crossing of a creek on the mine property in order to protect water quality.

‚ÄúI understand corrective actions to remove overburden and recontour have been undertaken. It is also my understanding VGCX placed seed on the culvert banks (prior to the May Inspection) in attempts to promote revegetation this summer season and this area will be targeted in VGCX‚Äôs fall September revegetation program‚Äù the inspection report signed by Jenner states.

‚ÄúI understand that the culvert crossing is scheduled for additional work this summer as it requires extension. VGCX has informed me that when the extension is performed on the crossing VGCX has plans to place armor stone to finalize the design of the Eagle crossing.‚Äù

The placement of a gate on a road accessing the mine property is a point of contention between Victoria Gold and the Yukon government. The report on the May 20 inspection states that a gate installed by the mine company on the Haggart Creek public access road is not authorized under the company‚Äôs Quartz Mining License. It goes on the say that the company has been asked to move the placement of the gate allowing public access to nearby placer mines hiking trails and other natural resources.

McConnell says the placement of the gate is in the interest of public safety as the access road runs through the mine site where heavy machinery is in use. Despite this he said they are looking into a reconfiguration of the gate. He added that the company has good relations with placer miners in the area and allows them access through the gate.

The inspection also found the handling of waste at the Eagle gold site in compliance with Victoria Gold‚Äôs permits but a new landfill site should be chosen as the current one is nearing capacity. It found that the mine‚Äôs fuelling centres were clean tidy and in good order.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Trump has been suspended from the platforms since January when his followers violently stormed the Capitol building trying to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential win.

The companies cited concerns that Trump would incite further violence and have kept him locked out.

All three declined comment on Wednesday.

'We're asking the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies' illegal shameful censorship of the American people' Trump said of the filings.

'We're going to hold big tech very accountable.'

Over the holiday weekend private jets belonging to business leaders began arriving at the local airport and taking up space on the tarmac at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey as they parked up for the week.

From there guests were chauffeured through 15 miles of lush rolling hills to the lodge where the conference takes place.

Rival chief executives including Amazon's Jeff Bezos along with his successor Andy Jassy Comcast Corp.'s Brian Roberts are all said to be on the guest list.

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

'There's a lot of assets out there that have good IP that will probably get new homes' he said.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

Attendees at the last conference in 2019 included Facebook bosses Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg; Disney's Bob Iger; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki; Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch who is the CEO of Fox Corporation; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman; Instagram COO Marne Levine; McDonald's chief Steve Easterbrook and billionaire media executive Shari Redstone.

But for the man who through his investigations in the Guardian set off the events that brought down the UK‚Äôs biggest-selling Sunday newspaper it did not feel like a victory.

‚ÄúNobody at the Guardian wanted the News of the World to close down‚Äù said Nick Davies the reporter who exposed the phone hacking scandal. ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt even dreamed that the Murdochs would do such a horrible thing.‚Äù

Over the course of a few days in July 2011 the News of the World had gone from having tens of millions of readers who every weekend lapped up its agenda-setting mix of sex scandal and scoops to becoming a pariah publication considered beyond salvation.

It began on the Monday of that week when Davies and colleague Amelia Hill revealed that the News of the World‚Äôs reporters had illegally accessed the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. By Thursday owner Rupert Murdoch had concluded his 168-year-old tabloid had became politically toxic and threatened his takeover of broadcaster Sky. He abruptly shut the paper down and sacked most of the 200 staff.

‚ÄúUsually we made the news but at that point we‚Äôd become the news‚Äù said Tom Latchem the News of the World‚Äôs TV editor when it closed speaking a decade on. He began to realise the newspaper was doomed when the candidate fired by Alan Sugar on that week‚Äôs episode of The Apprentice cancelled an interview as a result of the Dowler story: ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôre really in trouble here. If these people who are desperate for fame at almost any cost are pulling out then that‚Äôs not a great sign.‚Äù

For years Murdoch‚Äôs company had falsely maintained that just ‚Äòone rogue reporter‚Äô ‚Äì former royal editor Clive Goodman ‚Äì had hacked voicemails while paying off other celebrity victims and playing down Davies‚Äô stories. But it was the Dowler revelation that caught the public‚Äôs attention.

Ten years on former News of the World staff ‚Äì and victims of its tactics ‚Äì have taken part in an episode of Radio 4‚Äôs Archive on 4 about the closure. They recall a pressurised newsroom where almost any method was justified to get a front page scoop with thousands of pounds kept in a safe in the office to buy up stories at the last minute.

‚ÄúIt got to the ridiculous stage sometimes where I‚Äôd be sending out someone on a story and the features department would also be sending a reporter and we‚Äôd be bidding against each other‚Äù said James Weatherup a former news editor who later pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

Paul McMullan a former News of the World reporter described a typical sting: ‚Äú[A celebrity] checked into a hotel room in Paris with a new girlfriend who wasn‚Äôt his wife. So what we did is we rang up the hotel pretending to be his accountant and said we need the entire bill please with all the phone calls so we can itemise it. And the hotel rather stupidly just faxed over his bill and we just rang all of the numbers until we found the home number of his girlfriend then sent some paparazzis to get a picture.‚Äù

McMullan who infamously told the subsequent Leveson inquiry into press ethics that ‚Äúprivacy is for paedos‚Äù also described leading the newspaper‚Äôs campaign against paedophiles which inadvertently led to a paediatrician‚Äôs home being vandalised in south Wales: ‚ÄúIt is amazing that you can just write something that took an afternoon and people were rioting in the streets.‚Äù

But it was the desire to scoop rivals using almost any method possible that would bring about the downfall of the paper. News editor Greg Miskiw helped introduce phone hacking to the newspaper after learning about it from a private investigator: ‚ÄúOne day during a conversation he said you do realise that I can listen to people‚Äôs voicemails? And I said wow that‚Äôs astonishing we might use that service. And so we did.‚Äù

The technique was simple. All it required was knowing an individual‚Äôs mobile phone number. The reporter would ring it hope it went to voicemail then guess the individual‚Äôs PIN ‚Äì usually still set to the default of ‚Äò0000‚Äô or ‚Äò1234‚Äô. They could immediately listen to all the voicemails left on that individual‚Äôs phone. In an era before smartphones made it easier to send lengthy text messages a typical set of voicemails could include everything from declarations of love to private medical information.

‚ÄúI would choose my targets very very carefully‚Äù said Miskiw. ‚ÄúBut by the time I left the London office the people put in charge were just hacking everybody. And that‚Äôs how it eventually unravelled.‚Äù

Thousands of people were targeted. Journalists listened in to hundreds of messages left by the then home secretary David Blunkett who was in charge of the police and security services.

Blunkett said the subsequent front page expose of his relationship with a married woman caused friendships to break down: ‚ÄúI was in the public eye. And I was responsible for my behaviour. But it‚Äôs always the family of people that gets hurt.‚Äù

Murdoch is said to have regretted the decision to shut the newspaper. At one point after its closure he informally suggested to BuzzFeed then a fast-growing online news outlet aimed at millennials that it could reuse the News of the World brand. They declined.

Instead he is still dealing with the clear-up bill. Fifteen years after the first phone hacking conviction tens of millions of pounds are still being spent by News UK every year settling claims from phone-hacking victims. The practice was also widespread at the Mirror and Sunday People all of which continue to deal with cases.

The biggest UK tabloid that never admitted hacking voicemails is the Sun the News of the World‚Äôs sister newspaper. Despite this only last month Murdoch‚Äôs company paid substantial damages to former MP Simon Hughes who specifically claimed he was illegally targeted by the Sun. The settlement ensured Hughes‚Äô claims were never heard in open court.

When pictures of Matt Hancock‚Äôs clinch with an aide were splashed on the front page of the Sun last month it was a rare throwback to the era where such exposes arrived almost every Sunday. Even then much-tightened privacy law meant it was the couple‚Äôs breach of social distancing rules ‚Äì as much as the affair ‚Äì which helped legally justify publication.

Looking back at the News of the World‚Äôs closure a decade on Davies said a chance for real change had been missed: ‚ÄúThere was an extraordinary period which only lasted a few weeks and it was like seeing the teacher chased out of the classroom. And just for a brief period we didn‚Äôt have to be frightened of Rupert Murdoch and his dreadful newspapers and politicians were free to say what they thought and advertisers were free to tell him to get stuffed.

‚ÄúBut you know power doesn‚Äôt relax its grip easily. And slowly and insidiously Murdoch got his bony fingers back around the throat of British public life and has kept them there.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA3L2phbWVzdG93bi1hZHZhbmNlZC1wcm9kdWN0cy1jb3JwLWV4cGVyaWVuY2luZy1yZWNvcmQtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWdyb3d0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamestown Advanced Products Corp. Experiencing Record Expansion Growth,"Since October 2020 I have been communicating with the public through this monthly article about all of the great things going on throughout Chautauqua County as they relate to economic development. These commentaries may include discussions about specific projects of public interest that are underway or have been completed where they are at and if completed how they are performing. They may also include discussions about initiatives being undertaken at various agencies or at the County level including but not limited to the County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency the Chautauqua Region Economic Development Corporation the Chautauqua County Partnership for Economic Growth the Chautauqua County Department of Planning & Development the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation the Workforce Development Board the Chautauqua County Visitors Bureau educational institutions foundations or at any one of the many agencies whose mission makes them a critical partner in economic development initiatives throughout the County.

This month I am featuring Jamestown Advanced Products Corporation a Jamestown-based company that continues to innovate prosper and create jobs.

As Jamestown Advanced Products Corporation approaches nearly four decades in business as an American metal manufacturer the family-owned company is experiencing record growth and expansion. Known primarily as a premier manufacturer of campground products and industrial-grade site furnishings throughout North America Jamestown Advanced Products‚Äô development is due to the growth of camping and the propensity of the public to covet being outdoors as well as the recent success of two additional divisions ‚Äì the newly formed Homestead Implements and SevereClean Ultrasonics.

Despite still feeling the impact of the global pandemic Jamestown Advanced Products launched the brand-new division Homestead Implements re-invigorated the existing SevereClean Ultrasonics and saw record-breaking sales for 2020 in their campground division. Led by an ever-growing sales team Jamestown Advanced Products capitalized on the nationwide rush to find socially distanced vacation opportunities. That opportunity presented itself in the form of thousands of campgrounds throughout North America.

The company‚Äôs foundation Jamestown Advanced Products is known throughout the country as a premier manufacturer of commercial-grade site furnishings and campground products. With the recent travel boom to campgrounds Jamestown Advanced Products is well-poised to see continued year-over-year growth. Campers and travelers can find their products throughout National Parks KOA campgrounds and cities including locally in downtown Jamestown.

As the company progresses new product lines are in development that will continue to push Jamestown Advanced Products forward in the site furnishing market. This spring marked the release of their brand-new Empire Collection a modern slim-profile set of furnishings finished with ipe a Brazilian hardwood known for its durability and beautiful natural hue. The company has also recently joined forces with Recycling Across America to offer a standardized set of labels to their trash receptacles to boost recycling efficiency throughout the country.

Originally planned to launch in February 2020 Homestead Implements delayed the unveiling due to the emergence of COVID-19. Finally launched in July Homestead Implements experienced an immediate interest that grew throughout the last nine months to reach unexpected heights. The new division which required a boost of employees and unique processing technology is on pace for record sales in their first year alone with no end in sight. Co-owner Lee Lodestro stated ‚ÄúWe are continuing to research the market and design new attachments that can improve the impact a tractor can have.‚Äù Homestead Implements offers a complete lineup of attachments including box blades land planes landscape rakes post-hole diggers brush cutters and rotary tillers. Still the best-selling item by far is their set of grapples a versatile front-end hydraulic attachment taking the tractor world by storm. ‚ÄúGrapples are still fairly new in the tractor scene and we are proud to offer several variations that combine American labor unique design traits and heavy-duty materials‚Äù said Lodestro. ‚ÄúA grapple goes beyond a standard tractor bucket and completely changes the way a tractor owner utilizes their machine around their homestead.‚Äù

Lodestro is a lifelong tractor owner and enthusiast that wanted to manufacture and develop a line of heavy-duty tractor attachments for the small-scale farmer and homesteader. With industry giants like Kubota and John Deere experiencing significant lead time delays and supply chain interruptions the market was ripe for a new player in compact tractor attachments. Homestead Implements attachments are already available at two Chautauqua County equipment suppliers 3 Seas Recreation in Mayville and Larry Romance & Son in Sheridan. With several other dealer orders placed and plenty of additional inquiries Homestead Implements is excited at the chance to supply homesteaders throughout the country with high-quality American-made attachments.

Homestead Implements also offers a 10% Military Appreciation Discount to active-duty and retired members of the United States Military. Additionally they have partnered with the nationwide non-for-profit Farmer Veteran Coalition organization and their 2021 Farmer Fellowship Fund to donate implements to veterans looking to further their post-military agricultural endeavors. When asked Lee stated ‚ÄúAs a Navy veteran myself I was adamant about being able to provide our implements at a discount to other service members. We‚Äôve seen a tremendous influx of orders that are taking advantage of the discount and the work we are doing with the Farmer Veteran Coalition is just another way we can help support an important cause.‚Äù

Another division of the Jamestown Advanced Products‚Äô umbrella SevereClean Ultrasonics specializes in designing customized ultrasonic cleaning solutions for an endless array of industrial applications. Still relatively new technology for mainstream manufacturing awareness ultrasonic cleaning systems replace the harsh chemicals and labor-intensive processing practices of the past in an environmentally friendly package. Led by an experienced sales staff and a creative design team SevereClean Ultrasonics is excited to begin expanding its product lineup and introducing this powerful technology to companies that can truly benefit.

Ultrasonic cleaning equipment‚Äôs primary function is to clean away the endless debris dust oils chemicals and other residues from the manufacturing process in a far more effective manner than the previous methods. When combined with SevereClean‚Äôs proprietary blend of environmentally friendly cleaning agents companies will immediately notice an impact in their throughput of parts reduced labor cost and substantial cost savings. SevereClean has worked with countless industries through the years to provide impeccable results when cleaning materials as small as medical instruments and as large as transmissions and engine parts for airplanes and select military applications.

Located near the Jamestown Airport Jamestown Advanced Products Corp. is excited to continue decades of tradition and usher in a new generation of high-quality products. The company was also recently featured on the long-running Fox Business Network segment Manufacturing Marvels highlighting the company‚Äôs expansive facility and hard-working team. You can view the video on the Jamestown Advanced YouTube channel and their website. With over 140 employees and growing they remain well-positioned to remain a manufacturing mainstay in Chautauqua County for another forty years.

Mark Geise is Chautauqua‚Äôs Deputy County Executive for Economic Development and CEO of the CCIDA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1a29uLW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdmljdG9yaWEtZ29sZC1jb3JwLWZpbmVkLWZvci1jeWFuaWRlLXNwaWxsLTcwMDEzMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victoria Gold Corp fined for cyanide spill,"CEO says cleanup was done immediately following the March 2021 spill.

The Eagle Gold Mine has been fined for spilling cyanide and instructed to refurbish a newly-constructed creek crossing.

The mine operated by Victoria Gold was inspected by the Yukon government on May 20.

Investigation found a cyanide solution spill took place on March 15. Sodium cyanide is used in heap leach mining to dissolve gold out of ore.

According to the inspectors‚Äô comments the 70-litre spill originated from the mine‚Äôs heap leach facility. The inspector found that the spill could have been prevented if the company had followed the approved protocols and practices in their cyanide management plan and standard practices and procedures relating to heap leach facilities.

The mining company was issued a summary convictions fine under the Environment Act for the release of contaminants and failure to handle a hazardous substance in a way that prevents contamination. According to major mines inspector Matthew Jenner two $230 fines were issued under section 112 and section 122 of the environment act.

John McConnell Victoria Gold‚Äôs CEO said in an interview that cleanup from the spill took place in March shortly after it was found on an access road.

Contaminated material from the site of the spill was dug up and put back into the heap leach facility he explained. When further samples found traces of cyanide he said the area was excavated again and one more test found no cyanide.

McConnell added that design modifications have been made for the heap leach facility with the goal of preventing future spills.

The inspectors who visited the mine on May 20 also issued an immediate request for corrective action to the construction of a culvert allowing for the crossing of a creek on the mine property in order to protect water quality.

‚ÄúI understand corrective actions to remove overburden and recontour have been undertaken. It is also my understanding VGCX placed seed on the culvert banks (prior to the May Inspection) in attempts to promote revegetation this summer season and this area will be targeted in VGCX‚Äôs fall September revegetation program‚Äù the inspection report signed by Jenner states.

‚ÄúI understand that the culvert crossing is scheduled for additional work this summer as it requires extension. VGCX has informed me that when the extension is performed on the crossing VGCX has plans to place armor stone to finalize the design of the Eagle crossing.‚Äù

The placement of a gate on a road accessing the mine property is a point of contention between Victoria Gold and the Yukon government. The report on the May 20 inspection states that a gate installed by the mine company on the Haggart Creek public access road is not authorized under the company‚Äôs Quartz Mining License. It goes on the say that the company has been asked to move the placement of the gate allowing public access to nearby placer mines hiking trails and other natural resources.

McConnell says the placement of the gate is in the interest of public safety as the access road runs through the mine site where heavy machinery is in use. Despite this he said they are looking into a reconfiguration of the gate. He added that the company has good relations with placer miners in the area and allows them access through the gate.

The inspection also found the handling of waste at the Eagle gold site in compliance with Victoria Gold‚Äôs permits but a new landfill site should be chosen as the current one is nearing capacity. It found that the mine‚Äôs fuelling centres were clean tidy and in good order.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arrving at the annual Sun Valley conference in Idaho dubbed the 'billionaire summer camp'.

Bezos 57 was spotted at the relaxed gathering of titans from industry media sport and technology dressed down in a polo shirt and light blue pants with white sneakers.

Sanchez 51 looked summery in a flowing skirt and a sun hat in a video captured on Thursday by FOX Business Network. The two were spotted walking hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces.

Reporters shouted questions at Bezos about his impending trip to space but the Amazon founder ignored them and carried on walking into the venue.

Bezos has announced that he will become the first passenger to fly into space with his space tourism company Blue Origin on July 20.

Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were spotted on Thursday arriving in Idaho

Bezos a lifelong space enthusiast has been racing against fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere before making the trip back.

Branson is set to blast into space on July 11 - nine days ahead of Bezos.

The billionaire space race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as well as Musk's SpaceX have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities.

Blue Origin named the New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard who was the first American to fly into space exactly 60 years ago.

A mystery bidder has paid $28million at auction for a seat onboard the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin.

The person will fly on July 20 with Bezos and his brother Mark.

Bezos and Sanchez who began dating in 2019 attended that year's Sun Valley conference together.

The meeting has been useful for Bezos: it is reportedly where in 2013 he sealed his deal to buy The Washington Post.

Bezos already the world's wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping $211 billion.

Bezos 57 gained $8.4 billion in net worth on Tuesday alone according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as Amazon stock soared 4.7 per cent on the Pentagon's announcement that it is canceling the $10 billion JEDI contract with Microsoft.

It vaulted Bezos above the previous record of $210 billion held briefly in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere $181 billion putting him in distance second after Bezos.

While Tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year Amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15.4 percent since January 1.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

Bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at Amazon. He still owns about 51 million shares of Amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth.

Philanthropist Bill Gates Apple CEO Tim Cook Walt Disney Company chair Bob Iger and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg also made their appearances on the third day of the annual 'billionaire summer camp' in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho on Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder cut a casual figure as he conferred with Facebook COO Sandberg.

The two were photographed on the same day that a bombshell New York Times report claimed that their relationship has been strained due to disagreements that arose during Donald Trump's presidency.

According to the Times Zuckerberg usurped some of Sandberg's duties as she lost influence in Washington DC after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.

Sandberg who is active in Democratic Party politics and fundraising saw her influence within the company diminish as Facebook felt pressure to prove to conservatives that it did not have a liberal bias according to the Times.

Amazon's soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of Bezos who on Monday stepped down as chief executive of Amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant Andy Jassy.

The tech executives did not appear all too concerned on Thursday just a day after former President Trump announced a class action lawsuit against the social network and other platforms including Twitter and YouTube which is owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Trump revealed the action against Facebook Twitter and Google's YouTube along with the companies' Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai at a press conference Wednesday in New Jersey where he demanded that his accounts be reinstated.

Already Discovery's David Zaslav teased some potential business deals saying that more might follow after the announcement in May of Discovery's $43billion merger deal with AT&T's entertainment arm WarnerMedia.

'We're not done yet' he told the New York Post as he entered the conference saying he'll continue to search for more viable mergers once the deal is closed in eight months.

Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley are also expected to attend.

Robert Thomson chief executive of News Corp is also among the invitees as is Fox Corp. Chief Operating Officer John Nallen.

They will have a lot to discuss given the massive shift to streaming during the pandemic and consumers moving to Netflix and Disney+ over the last 16 months and cutting the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

In May AT&T said it was spinning off WarnerMedia which is made up from HBO the Warner Bros. film and TV studio along with the cable networks of TNT and TBS into a new venture being formed with Discovery.

The following week Amazon announced its intention to acquire MGM studios.

Such consolidation within the media industry has reduced the number of potential targets available but fresh deals are not off the table.

The real action for many onlookers will happen in corridors restaurants and golf courses rather than conference rooms.

'It would be wise for these companies to collaborate and rethink the ecosystem and figure out their future' said analyst Neil Begley to the Wall Street Journal. 'There are still a few players out there that can be easily absorbed.'

Analysts believe the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger could be the first of many deals which are made as the traditional media companies look to compete better in streaming by bulking up on content.

Previous deals that have their roots at Sun Valley include the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC by Disney Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2009 the purchase of AOL by Verizon in 2015 and Jeff Bezos' purchase of The Washington Post in 2013.

NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzEwLzMtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWxvYWQtdXAtb24td2hlbi10aGUtc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks to Load Up on When the Stock Market Crashes,"These stocks are historically good buys when the market hits a rough patch.

Stock market crashes often occur without warning. For that reason investors should remain prepared for the next one. One of the best ways to do that is have a list of stocks to buy when the market starts melting down.

We asked three of our Motley Fool contributors what stocks they think investors should load up on during a market crash. They chose NextEra Energy (NEE 1.26%) Brookfield Infrastructure (BIP 0.17%) (BIPC 0.88%) and Caterpillar (CAT 2.15%). Here's why these topped their market-crash shopping list.

Buying opportunities don't come often

Reuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): There's one big problem with giant U.S. utility NextEra Energy: Its stock is rarely cheap. There are good reasons for this but if the market gets irrational and the company's stock dives investors should prepare ahead of time to jump aboard this dividend-growth investor's dream stock. Why?

For starters the company owns Florida Power & Light which operates the largest electric utility in its namesake state. Florida has been benefiting for years from people moving to its warm climate and low taxes. This business isn't a growth machine but it is a very solid foundation on which NextEra has built one of the world's largest wind and solar power businesses. And it has plans to keep expanding these green businesses with as much as 30 gigawatts of clean-energy construction on the drawing board to add to its current 26 gigawatts of capacity.

But the dividend is the real proof of how great a company NextEra is. The utility has increased its dividend annually for over 25 years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The annualized rate of increase over the past decade was a huge 10% a rate that NextEra believes it can match until at least 2022 (if not longer). That's a massive figure for a utility and helps explain why the dividend yield is a miserly 2.1% since income investors are generally willing to pay up for consistent dividend growth. However if the stock should tank with the market even those with a focus on yield over growth could end up with a buying opportunity.

Built for turbulent times

Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Infrastructure): Brookfield Infrastructure has a knack for taking advantage of market-related opportunities. For example when stocks crashed during the early days of the pandemic last year Brookfield went on a buying binge. It invested $450 million into shares of a handful of publicly traded infrastructure companies in hopes that this would lead to a larger-scale investment. The company would exit several of those investments a few months later realizing $40 million in profits.

Meanwhile it held on to its position in Canadian pipeline company Inter Pipeline (IPL) in hopes of striking a deal. While it's currently engaged in a bidding war with another suitor that fight has boosted the value of Brookfield's holdings. If it ends up losing Brookfield can still cash in on another highly successful investment.

Brookfield's ability to go on the offensive when others are shifting to defense has enabled it to make several needle-moving acquisitions over the years. Those deals have helped fuel accelerated growth as market conditions rebounded allowing the company to generate market-crushing returns over the long term.

While Brookfield's business thrives during crashes its stock price tends to follow the market lower. Because of that market meltdowns are a great time to load up on shares of Brookfield. That positions investors to cash in on the subsequent recovery as Brookfield's business accelerates usually driven in part by deals it secured during the downturn.

An offbeat Dividend Aristocrat to buy on dips

Neha Chamaria (Caterpillar): When the stock market crashes cyclical stocks almost always take deep dives as they typically reflect the health of economy. Opportunistic investors though would be smart to scoop up shares when the time is ripe because cyclical stocks are also quick to bounce back when the markets recover. This is especially true if the underlying companies have a timely growth opportunity ahead. Consider Caterpillar for instance.

As the world's largest construction and mining-equipment manufacturer and an important player in the energy and transportation sectors Caterpillar is a top economic bellwether. That explains why Caterpillar shares have almost always been battered during stock market crashes but have also outperformed once things turned around. If the market crashes any time in the near future there are two big reasons why you'd want to buy shares of Caterpillar.

First Caterpillar operates in a sector that's red-hot right now in terms of potential opportunities ahead and that sector is infrastructure. Caterpillar could be a big beneficiary from President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill. The amount of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts significantly impacts demand for Caterpillar's equipment so any uptick in infrastructure spending bodes well for the company regardless of what the stock market does.

Second Caterpillar's resilience even in torrid times is evident from its dividend history: Caterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat that recently increased its dividend for the 27th consecutive year meaning it rewarded shareholders with a higher payout even during historical stock market crashes like the one in 2008. So next time the stock market and Caterpillar shares tumble you'd still receive dividend checks in your mail and enjoy a high dividend yield while you await a recovery. Here are some statistics for you to ponder: Caterpillar's dividend yield -- which is hovering around 2% currently -- shot up to nearly 4% last year and topped 5% in mid-2016 when the markets tanked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL25ld3NtZC81LXRoaW5ncy10by1rbm93LXRvZGF5LXdhcmQtc3lzdGVtLWNvbW1vbi1ncm91bmQtZmluYW5jaWFsLXdvZXMtaG9tZXRvd24taGVyby1jb2xkLWNhc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 things to know today: Ward system Common ground Financial woes Hometown hero Cold case,"1.

A year of tension between North Dakota wind and coal power found brief reprieve this week as leaders in one coal country county laid out plans to bring the two sides together to hash out their differences over local wind development provisions.

We all know Michael Jordan but who is Tinker Hatfield?

In an interview with CBS Sports Tinker Hatfield was promoting a new designer bottle. The Championship Bottle a hybrid design incorporating the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy and a basketball net (yes that does sound strange when writing it out loud) goes to the locker room of this year‚Äôs NBA champion.

Hatfield has been one of the biggest names in sneakers for 40 years as a designer at Nike. And it was Hatfield that managed to keep Michael Jordan with Nike. Part of that came from his basic philosophy that his responsibility as a sneaker designer is to the player.

‚ÄúOur process at Nike and Jordan is to serve athletes help them perform better and to be safer so they can avoid injury as much as possible. Those things are kind of No. 1 on the list of what we need to do. Players will want lighter-weight shoes but they still want to be safe and protected. So there‚Äôs a lot of alchemy going on when doing that.‚Äù Tinker Hatfield

When Hatfield made his biggest save Michael Jordan was coming off the one significant injury of his career and had concerns about the future with Nike.

The Jordan 3 comes to the rescue

Nike‚Äôs Air Jordans are far and away the biggest brand among NBA players. But the iconic mix between Michael Jordan and the Nike brand almost ended shortly after it began | Jonathan Daniel/Allsport

Hatfield began working with Michael Jordan‚Äôs signature line of shoes at Nike and he inherited a fraying relationship. Nike was working on the Jordan 3. But Hatfield had a more pressing matter than simply designing a shoe.

‚ÄúI got the project really really late in the normal process. I jumped on a plane; I really didn‚Äôt have time to think. ‚Ä¶ I needed to meet with Michael and develop a relationship. And in the case of that time period really convince him to stay at Nike. We all felt that if the design was fantastic he would be more apt to re-sign with us.‚Äù Tinker Hatfield

The problem stemmed from an early-season game between the Chicago Bulls and Golden State Warriors in October 1985. In his second season Jordan sustained a broken foot in that game and missed Chicago‚Äôs next 64 games. Jordan had concerns about his future with Nike. Hatfield remembered being under the gun.

‚ÄúIt was crazy short timelines and yet I was trying to make a huge statement in design using Michael as the muse and also hoping to help him play the game better. He had broken his foot the year before and I think he was a little tentative about how shoes would come together to help him be safe healthy and perform better. So I was more focused on that than really this other anxiety that some people were feeling about him leaving.‚Äù Tinker Hatfield

Hatfield delivered with the Jordan 3 and Michael Jordan stayed with Nike. The rest is history very lucrative history.

The Michael Jordan legacy and brand are intertwined

A 2019 Forbes article claimed almost 75% of NBA players in 2018‚Äì19 played in Nike or Jordan shoes. Nike had the bulk of the share at 62.6% with Air Jordan worn by 9.4% of the league. A distant second went to adidas at just 15.8%.

According to Spotrac Michael Jordan earned almost $93.8 million during his 16 NBA seasons with nearly $63.3 million of that coming in his final two years with the Bulls.

That means Jordan earns more in endorsement money from Nike in a year than he did in his entire career. It also explains why Jordan purchased the Charlotte Hornets (then the Bobcats) for $275 million back in 2010.

Mars Blackmon was right all those years ago. It‚Äôs gotta be the shoes.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it goes when art‚Äôs in your genes‚Äù he said.

Born in Pleasant Grove to artist parents Moton became one of the early pioneers of the city‚Äôs graffiti scene in the 1990s before going on to work on projects with brands like LIDS Playboy and the Dallas Mavericks.

What was more unlikely was that the Dallas native would take on one of the world‚Äôs most powerful brands in the U.S. Supreme Court ‚Äî and live to tell the tale.

Moton is the founder and designer of YUMS an Arlington-based streetwear brand first launched in 2007. YUMS ‚Äî an acronym for You Understand My Style ‚Äî recently relaunched its signature combinations of hats and shoes after an eight-year recovery from a legal battle with Nike that went all the way to the highest court in the land leaving the brand nearly broke.

From graffiti to sneakers

As a teenager growing up in Pleasant Grove in the early 1990s Moton found himself drawn to graffiti art and the community of other young artists working in Dallas. The pre-internet age meant that Moton and his fellow artists didn‚Äôt have many references or resources leading to the development of a style that was unlike the tags that adorned New York City subway cars or walls in Los Angeles ‚Äî it was a style Moton describes as uniquely Dallas.

‚ÄúWe were just smart kids‚Äù Moton said. ‚ÄúWe found our way through it and eventually got pretty good.‚Äù

Soon the art was good enough to transform the kids‚Äô weekend entertainment into a series of more serious projects leading to the formation of Infinity Crew one of Dallas‚Äôs first graffiti crews. Combining clean lines and bright colors art by Tex and the rest of Infinity Crew became well-known both in the Dallas street art community and beyond.

In his work with Infinity Crew Moton continually reimagined what graffiti could be. Why not do the same for shoes?

A self-described foodie Moton remembers Dallas institutions like Gonzales Tex-Mex in Pleasant Grove and Elaine‚Äôs Jamaican Kitchen in South Dallas bringing a smile to his face with their delicious food. Moton wanted to connect the initial excitement of receiving a new pair of sneakers to the thrill of opening a favorite snack or seeing a delicious meal arrive at the table.

Instead of focusing on traditional colorways Moton‚Äôs line would be centered around different flavors combining fashion and food to create a new way for fans to relate to sneakers.

In 2007 Moton launched YUMS with its Sweet Series collection which quickly became a hit in the streetwear world. Each YUMS flavor has the brand‚Äôs signature clear sole which displays graffiti-inspired art designed by Tex that celebrates the flavor‚Äôs inspiration.

How does a flavor get from the pantry shelf to the sole of a YUMS sneaker? Moton deconstructs all the elements of a snack ‚Äî including flavor texture and color ‚Äî and puts them back together again thinking about how the elements of the food translate to the elements of a shoe.

‚ÄúIt really embodies that item that we‚Äôre expressing in that moment from rainbow sherbet to a classic cupcake to a mixed berry tart ‚Äî all of that is really represented in the shoe itself‚Äù Moton said.

Moton reaches to pick up the brand‚Äôs unreleased chicken and waffles flavor displaying a red and white pattern on the sole of the shoe reminiscent of classic checkered tablecloths at chicken shacks. On the top of the shoe yellow represents a crisp buttery waffle and tan suede calls to mind the texture of crunchy fried chicken. (Moton‚Äôs Dallas go-to for chicken and waffles? Jonathon‚Äôs in Oak Cliff.)

Moton saw the marriage of fashion and food as a natural one. ‚ÄúI just have always found pleasure happiness and comfort in certain foods and I think a lot of people really relate to and can connect with food‚Äù he said.

Nike battle

Despite the early success of YUMS things haven‚Äôt always been sweet for the brand.

In July 2009 Nike sued Already LLC YUMS‚Äôs parent company alleging that the silhouette of YUMS shoes violated the trademark for Nike‚Äôs popular Air Force 1 sneaker. Later that year Already filed a counterclaim against Nike arguing that Nike‚Äôs trademark negatively affected YUMS‚Äô ability to sell its shoes and attract investors. The counterclaim sought to invalidate Nike‚Äôs trademark for the shoe and move the trademark for the Air Force 1 into the public domain.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard‚Äù Moton said of the lawsuit. ‚ÄúNike is a giant in that industry.‚Äù

Moton had been a fan of Nike‚Äôs classic styles when he was growing up but he said the lawsuit was a devastating blow for him as well as for Already and YUMS. ‚ÄúIt sucks to get attacked and told to burn all your shoes by someone you admire so much‚Äù he said.

Fortunately Nike backed down. While the suit was pending Nike sent a March 2010 letter to Already that promised a covenant not to sue meaning that Nike would not attempt to bring any further trademark claims against YUMS for any of its products. Nike moved to dismiss both its original claim and Already‚Äôs counterclaim but Already appealed the dismissal of its claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and continued to press for the dismissal of Nike‚Äôs trademark.

Both the district court and the appeals court held that the counterclaim was invalid because no ‚Äúsubstantial controversy‚Äù remained given that Nike had promised that it would not bring any further claims against Already and YUMS under the covenant not to sue.

In January 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the rulings of the lower courts unanimously finding in favor of Nike and determining the case was moot. In the court‚Äôs opinion Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that it would be unlikely that YUMS could produce designs that would infringe upon Nike‚Äôs trademark and were not already protected under the covenant.

‚ÄúIf such a shoe exists the parties have not pointed to it there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it and we cannot conceive of it‚Äù Roberts wrote. ‚ÄúIt sits as far as we can tell on a shelf between Dorothy‚Äôs ruby slippers and Perseus‚Äôs winged sandals.‚Äù

Although the ruling was in favor of Nike Moton and the YUMS team don‚Äôt view the outcome as a loss.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just happy to be able to make our shoes again without being threatened by Nike‚Äù Moton said.

YUMS isn‚Äôt the first streetwear brand to get caught in Nike‚Äôs crosshairs. In March of this year Nike sued Brooklyn-based MSCHF over its ‚ÄúSatan Shoes‚Äù modified Nike Air Max 97s that featured a drop of human blood and a pentagram charm and were promoted by rapper Lil Nas X. As part of a settlement agreement with Nike MSCHF agreed to offer refunds and accept returns of the 666 pairs of limited-edition shoes which sold out online less than a minute after their launch.

Looking forward

While the extensive legal battle meant that YUMS needed time to recover financially Moton never stopped creating. In the years between the court‚Äôs ruling and the relaunch of YUMS Moton continued his work as chief creative officer of Arlington-based Already Design Co. which designs apparel accessories and digital media for high-profile clients including LIDS Playboy Gas Monkey Garage and Discovery Channel. Moton also continued to stay involved in the Dallas graffiti scene and worked on projects with local institutions like Dallas Love Field and the Dallas Mavericks.

Moton designed the Mavs‚Äô 2019-20 City Edition jersey celebrating Deep Ellum and the artistic culture that originally nurtured his talent. While graffiti may not be typically connected with Dallas Moton says it‚Äôs a special recognition for those who have been a part of the city‚Äôs street art culture.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so rich for people who are here and grow up seeing it and being a part of it‚Äù he said.

As the YUMS relaunch continues Moton is looking forward to a delicious ‚Äî and hopefully lucrative ‚Äî holiday season with new flavors inspired by the familiar comfort foods of Thanksgiving and Christmas. He credits the survival of YUMS to the perseverance and commitment of his team members. Although he views himself as the underdog Moton‚Äôs lifetime of innovation has prepared him well to persevere through tough times.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to still be standing after taking some blows‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you stay in something long enough and if you believe in it wholeheartedly and just keep pushing forward you‚Äôll see the other side of things.‚Äù

Where to find YUMS

YUMS products can be purchased from the brand‚Äôs website at yumslife.com. Shoes from YUMS Collection 1 are $125 and hats are $30.

Members-only



Nike‚Äòs Air Force 1 and Harlem are a quintessential duo. The Bruce Killgore-designed sneaker and the bustling neighborhood in Upper Manhattan go way back ‚Äî almost four decades to be specific ‚Äî and the Air Force 1 is still one of Nike Sportswear‚Äòs best-selling shoes to this day thanks in no small part to Harlem‚Äôs influence on global pop culture.

Harlem native and Coral Studios co-founder Ismaila ‚ÄúIsh‚Äù Traor√© is fully aware of the Air Force 1‚Äôs legacy in his home neighborhood. Splitting his childhood between Harlem and Florida Traor√© saw the Air Force 1 from both an insider‚Äôs and an outsiders perspective. This duality gave him an extra-keen appreciation for the AF1‚Äôs cultural cachet as well as a healthy appetite for some of its most notable makeups from the ‚Äô00s like the ‚ÄúInvisible Woman‚Äù ‚ÄúSavage Beast‚Äù and various Rasheed Wallace PEs.

Traor√© may now be a tenured leader of a creative studio with an ultra-rare Air Max 95 collaboration under his belt (the first iteration of Coral Studios‚Äô Air Max 95 can go for four figures on aftermarket sites) but he‚Äôs never lost his affinity for the Air Force 1. In the latest installment of HYPEBEAST‚Äòs Sole Mates series Ismaila ‚ÄúIsh‚Äù Traor√© talks growing up as a sneaker-loving kid who swiped shoes from his older sisters what he learned about culture from splitting time between New York and Florida why the Air Force 1 has been able to sustain such a high level of popularity over so many years and more.

1 of 2 2 of 2

HYPEBEAST: What got you into sneakers?

Ismaila ‚ÄúIsh‚Äù Traor√©: My older sisters. They were really big sneakerheads. The oldest had Air Max 95s Air Max 97s all the Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey Jr. shoes you could imagine. The second oldest was a hooper so she had shoes like the Air Foamposite Pro Kevin Garnett‚Äôs Air Garnett 3 and Tim Duncan‚Äôs Total Air Foamposite Max. I couldn‚Äôt believe how magical some of those shoes looked and by a stroke of luck I was able to fit their shoes when I got a little older. Eventually having nice shoes became a must for me a way to show my taste and creativity.

Was it always Nike for you or did you dabble in some other brands as well?

Mostly Nike but as a kid you‚Äôre going to wear whatever‚Äôs available to you. I learned early on that New Balance was always comfortable that Nike was a go-to for running around on the playground and that ASICS were great for going fast. I guess you could say I got the ABCs of sneaker culture [laughs].

When you were growing up you split time between New York and Florida. I‚Äôm assuming that your exposure to sneaker culture was vastly different in those two locales?

Night and day.

Did you grow to appreciate sneaker culture more when you had to leave New York and go to Florida? I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt as accessible there ‚Äî New York is a mecca of sneaker culture after all.

Being in Florida made me fight to stay involved [in sneaker culture]. I‚Äôd travel to Harlem whenever I could buy more magazines and try to open my mind up to the different dimensions of culture by learning more about skateboarding sports and other forms of pop culture. I really had to try and immerse myself in those things because they weren‚Äôt all readily available in Florida.

So when did the Air Force 1 enter the picture? Was it a part of your life when you were growing up?

Absolutely. It was a special shoe in Harlem. You had to be brave if you wore it because if you were rocking an all white pair you couldn‚Äôt let it get too dirty and if you were rocking a black pair you couldn‚Äôt let it get all creased up. If you wore the Air Force 1 High to play basketball you had to be a hooper because it was so chunky and bulky. Even with the Air Force 1 Mid you had to make sure that your straps didn‚Äôt dangle too much. I always had to have a pair no matter if I was in Florida or Harlem because I wanted to let people know what I represented.

‚ÄúThe Air Force 1 is like the hip-hop wingtip.You can dress it up you can dress it down wear it with almost anything.‚Äù

Based off that I‚Äôd assume that you prefer a crispy pair over a well-worn one?

Absolutely. The Air Force 1 is like the hip-hop wingtip. You can dress it up you can dress it down wear it with almost anything. Through collaborations and everything else you can watch the Force‚Äôs legacy grow in so many different ways. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. It still amazes me that it even was able to become a ‚Äúdirty shoe‚Äù ‚Äî one that people would wear to festivals wear into the ground ‚Äî but continue to hold its credence.

Do you tend to gravitate towards rare collaborations plain black and white pairs a bit of both?

For me it‚Äôs about eras. When Nike started doing waffle liners and those supreme metallic tags in the ‚Äò00 the synergy they created on that series of shoes was really vibrant and we were really spoiled at that time not knowing how special of an era that was. Honestly I feel like it was because they had to compete with BAPE and raise their game. Now the Air Force 1 is a bit more of a staple than a statement which is dope too.

1 of 6 2 of 6 3 of 6 4 of 6 5 of 6 6 of 6

Will we ever see a return to those days of wild colors and bold materials or has the Air Force 1 become too much of a staple to have another moment like that one?

It‚Äôs had thousands of colorways but its integrity has never really changed. Even when it got into a really exploratory collaborative stage with guys like ACRONYM and Riccardo Tisci and you began to see how it could be reinterpreted it still retained that authenticity. Because of that I feel like there‚Äôs still plenty of space for Nike to go back to the crazy styles like patent leathers bright colors and the like ‚Äî reintroduce that piece of brand history like they did by bringing back the Dunk.

How do you think the Air Force 1 has managed to remain so ubiquitous through all these periods perspectives and collaborations?

Honestly I think it‚Äôs the Swoosh. It‚Äôs been ingrained in people‚Äôs minds like the McDonalds logo. When you see the Swoosh you just trust it. Nike has leaned on that trust to reinterpret how the Air Force 1 can be presented to the market.

1 of 2 2 of 2

I‚Äôve talked to a couple of folks from Harlem and the Bronx about the Air Force 1. What‚Äôs really interesting is that both places are so full of flash and bravado this desire to be unique and stand out but everyone seems to gravitate towards the same shoe. Why is that?

Because it‚Äôs the canvas that everyone wants to paint on. Even if everyone wants to be different and show their look feel or point of view in a unique way the Air Force 1 is the staging ground that they want to do it on. I think there‚Äôs also a competitive edge of wanting to outdo someone in a clearly defined contest.

You want to have the best Forces.

Exactly. I mean people have done all kinds of crazy custom Air Force 1s with Gucci and Louis Vuitton leathers and fabrics to name a few. There‚Äôs a lot of ways you can put your own unique spin on it [Editor‚Äôs Note: This interview was conducted before Virgil Abloh‚Äôs Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1s were revealed].

‚Äú[Coral Studios]‚Äò love of the Air Force 1 is specifically why we didn‚Äôt pick it for our collaboration. I thought it would be too taboo.‚Äù

So tell me this: Why didn‚Äôt Coral Studios select the Air Force 1 for its Nike collaboration? What led you guys to choose the Air Max 95 instead?

I‚Äôve never said this before but our love of the Air Force 1 is specifically why we didn‚Äôt pick it for our collaboration. I thought it would be too taboo. I‚Äôm an Uptown guy a Harlem guy and I felt like that story had already been told before in a good way of course. I also didn‚Äôt want to feel like I was limited to my direct environment and I wanted to tell a different story. Of course the Air Max 95 was another classic I grew up with as well.

Looking ahead how do you think the Air Force 1 will evolve over the rest of this decade?

I think there will be a moment when Nike has to re-educate a new generation of sneakerheads on what the Air Force 1 means and enable them to lead a renaissance of sorts. With that will hopefully come more space to create bring back classics and unearth some vibes that some of us may have forgotten about. I think a lot of the joints from the ‚Äò80s ‚Äò90s and early ‚Äò00s have been explored but some crazy hitters came out from 2006 to 2010 and it would be really great to see those come around again.

1 of 2 2 of 2

If you had to cut back your Air Force 1 collection to two pairs what would you keep?

Sadly I‚Äôm taking a pair of all whites even though I know I can buy ‚Äòem again [laughs]. I‚Äôd also have to take the ‚ÄúInvisible Woman‚Äù because of what it did for me growing up. The ‚ÄúInvisible Woman‚Äù was so influential to me when it released in 2006. Hype wasn‚Äôt too crazy at that time and blogs weren‚Äôt even that big the main players were NikeTalk and HYPEBEAST. Even the fact that there were Tier Zero accounts in Florida that had the ‚ÄúInvisible Woman‚Äù was unreal to me. It wasn‚Äôt even a collaboration but it had collaborative vibes because of that Marvel association and that great nickname. Man that shoe is a home run.

Why are sneakers important to you?

Sneakers have always been a way for me to teach people about who I am and share my story. From learning about shoes as a kid to modifying a classic as an adult to getting people to give back to their community to get a pair I created and then having that pair go for over $5000 on resale sites it‚Äôs been a wild journey. I‚Äôve learned time and time again how much shoes influence people how shoes can show who you are and how you see the world ‚Äî it‚Äôs a beautiful thing and I‚Äôm so happy to be a part of it and make history within it."

The Siemering family wanted to guarantee future generations could have the kind of lake experience they have cherished. So instead of selling their 116 acres of lakeshore forest for development they turned to the Northern Waters Land Trust. The family sold it to the conservation nonprofit which in turn conveyed it to Cass County ensuring the forest will never be altered or built on and will be open to the public to use.

The forest is thick with undisturbed birch aspen basswood balsam and spruce.

""Probably the greatest thing now is this place that we have cherished and brought so many memories ‚Ä¶ this one slice is now being protected"" said Cheryl Siemering 64 of Plymouth. ""It just continues to live on then.""

The sale is one piece in the puzzle of efforts to save the state's special cold-water lakes by protecting the forest around them. The lakes and their critical fish habitat are at serious risk under relentless pressure from the spread of row-crop farming farther north commercial development landowners clearing lakefront property nutrient runoff from farm and lawn chemicals and climate change's rising temperatures.

Most Minnesotans probably don't realize how unique their cold-water lakes are said Kathy DonCarlos land conservation lead for the Northern Waters Land Trust. They only exist in the northern tier states she said. Illinois for example doesn't have them.

The Wabedo Lake purchase is particularly exciting the trust said because it's a large parcel. Plus while people are still selling land for conservation land donations have slowed with the tax code changes under the Trump administration that reduced deductibility for all charitable contributions.

Trust conservation specialist Annie Knight called such land sales a ""concrete and permanent"" way private landowners can take charge of preserving nature for future generations.

""Restoration costs way more money than simply protecting it in the first place"" Knight said.

The focus of the Walker-based Northern Waters Land Trust is preserving forestland around strategic lakes in Cass Crow Wing Hubbard and Aitkin counties. Since the 1990s it has bought or received 1481 acres. Working with the Minnesota Land Trust it has arranged conservation easements on an additional 3197 acres. With such easements landowners agree not to further develop the land.

Wabedo Lake in Cass County is one of 620 official tullibee lakes in Minnesota that provide habitat for the fish also known as cisco whose populations have been crashing in the Midwest. The trust is focusing on protecting land on tullibee lakes and lakes with broader outstanding biological significance.

Tullibee are small silvery fish that thrive in well-oxygenated cold water. A type of herring they're a critical forage fish for prized game fish such as walleye and muskie so densely nutritious that they're called nature's Snickers for fish.

Fish-to-forest tipping point

The DNR relies on a calculated fish-to-forest tipping point ‚Äî if at least 75% of a lake's watershed is protected with forest cover the lakes there can sustain themselves ‚Äî and their cold-water fish. Forests are a perfect water conditioner a sponge that slows rain soaks it up prevents erosion filters water and cools it.

The Siemerings did not know all this at first of course. Cheryl Siemering and her brother John 73 who lives outside Pittsburgh just knew it was time to let go of the treasured lake home.

The Wabedo Lake property had been in the extended family since the 1940s. Their mother's cousin ran Blakemen's Resort there. Then their parents Robert and Alice bought it in the 1970s and changed the name to the Loon's Nest Resort which they ran for 20 years. They retired there taking down all but one of the five small cabins. Robert died while fishing on the lake in 2003. Alice died in February at 98.

""It was everything to her"" Cheryl Siemering said of the lake. ""She loved it so.""

But the family had scattered and the property was becoming too much to manage.

John Siemering said Pat Moran of Moran Realty in nearby Longville first told them about the Northern Waters Land Trust's preservation effort in 2017 after seeing the property.

""There were no docks. It was exactly the way it was made by God or whoever"" Moran said. ""It was a big beautiful chunk on the lake.""

Moran said his father worked for years as a DNR forestry supervisor and coached him about seeing the highest and best use for land.

""That rules"" Moran said. ""I've seen these pieces that I just think: 'You know I don't need to develop that.' ""

They called Cass County Land Commissioner Kirk Titus who also drove out for a look. He said he saw more than 800 feet of undisturbed shoreline on land abutting 1800 acres of public forest land the county already maintains.

Titus said it fit perfectly with the county's goal of conserving land to protect wildlife habitat and public access for recreation: hunting fishing hiking berry picking and wildlife viewing. The conservation deal also had strong support from the Wabedo-Little Boy-Cooper-Rice Lakes Association which put money toward the purchase as did the Hugh C. Becker Foundation.

""I think I'm going to call it Siemering Woods"" Titus said.

Cheryl Siemering said that as they learned more about how conserving forest around a lake supports the lake's overall health ""we were [in] hook line and sinker.""

'Thrilled that we did it'

The Northern Waters Land Trust had the 116-acre parcel appraised and bought it for an undisclosed sum with grant money from the sales-tax-based Outdoor Heritage Fund. The fund is one created by the state's Clean Water Land and Legacy Amendment.

The Siemerings carved out a small parcel with their mother's house on it for a separate sale. A couple planning to retire there just bought that piece Cheryl said.

It is their first summer not being at the lake John said. But they know the conservation sale was the right move ‚Äî and they said they are grateful their mother lived to see it completed.

About 10 days before she passed John said she said out of the blue: "" 'You know John whatever happens I'm so happy we did what we did with the property.' ""

""She said the same thing to my sister"" he said. ""She was thrilled that we did it.""

A family that lived on Wabedo Lake in Cass County for decades decided to sell their more than 100 acres of undeveloped woods and shoreline to the Northern Waters Land Trust so it remains undeveloped.

""More people should know about this.""

This is excellent news! The approval of Kesimpta in Scotland increases the choices for people with relapsing MS. An expanding range of drugs working in different ways and with different benefits and risks means more people can find the treatment that is best for them. Kesimpta offers access to an effective treatment which doesn‚Äôt require regular hospital visits.

NICE recommended Kesimpta for the NHS in England and Wales earlier this year.

In Northern Ireland the Department of Health reviews NICE guidance for NHS use.

About Kesimpta

Kesimpta is self-injected under the skin once a month.

In clinical trials for relapsing MS Kesimpta reduced the risk of relapse by 50-59% compared to Aubagio reduced disability progression and the number of lesions seen on MRI scans.

Kesimpta binds to a marker (CD20) on the surface of B cells a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) which is thought to be involved when the immune system attacks the myelin coating of nerves. Targeted B cells are destroyed. Kesimpta works in similar way to Ocrevus (ocrelizumab).

In clinical trials the most frequent side effects were injection-related reactions. Most of these were mild to moderate cleared up the same or following day and were associated with the first Kesimpta injection; they were less frequent with subsequent injections. Other side effects that occurred in at least 10% of those taking Kesimpta were head colds headache chest infections and urinary tract infections.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbGx5bW9uZXlidWJibGUuY28udWsvbG9jYWwvb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWJsYXplLWJyZWFrcy1vdXQtYXQtYmFsbHltb25leXMtcm91dGUtY29tcGxleC8yMzQ1OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Overnight blaze breaks out at Ballymoney's Route Complex,"The NIFRS were called out to an early morning blaze at a Northern Trust base in Ballymoney.

Cllr Wallis who represents the Haughton and Springfield ward on Darlington Borough Council said: ‚ÄúI saw the charges myself at the hospital and it seems a lot of people are being caught out by it. No one seemed to know this was happening.

‚ÄúI was really worried to see that there was comment that said the charges apply at Bishop Auckland as well and that there may have been tickets issued.

‚ÄúWhat I would say to the trust is I would ask them to hold off on issuing tickets and fines for four weeks ‚Äì people aren‚Äôt aware of this and it would be good if they could do that.

‚ÄúMore generally car parking charges are frankly a tax on the sick not just for patients and their families but for hospital staff as well.

The characteristics dynamics and stability of this orbit will be tested later this year via the CAPSTONE mission. Image Credit: NASA

NASA and Northrop Grumman Corp. on Friday finalized contracts to develop the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO)‚Äîthe keystone pressurized element of the lunar-circling Gateway‚Äîand deliver it for launch atop SpaceX‚Äôs giant Falcon Heavy booster no sooner than November 2024. Under the terms of the $935 million contract the Dulles Va.-headquartered Northrop Grumman will assume responsibility for integrating and testing the HALO module with the Maxar-built Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) leading the turnover of the spacecraft with SpaceX and supporting its activation and checkout during the transit from Earth out to lunar orbit in three years‚Äô time.

‚ÄúNASA is building the infrastructure to expand human exploration further out into the Solar System than ever before including Gateway the lunar station that will help us make inspirational scientific discoveries at and around the Moon‚Äù said NASA Administrator and former shuttle veteran Bill Nelson.

‚ÄúJust as importantly these investments will help NASA carry out the United States‚Äô horizon goal: to further develop and test the technology and science needed for a human trip to Mars. The HALO is a critical component of Gateway and this exciting announcement today brings us one step closer to landing American boots on both the Moon and Mars.‚Äù

The HALO/PPE spacecraft marks one of the earliest uses of the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) a seven-day-long orbital period around the Moon in which the Gateway will approach the lunar north pole as closely as 1900 miles (3000 km) at ‚Äúperilune‚Äù and travel as far as 43000 miles (70000 km) over the south pole at ‚Äúapolune‚Äù. Later this year NASA‚Äôs Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) orbiter is slated to conduct the first demonstration of the stability characteristics of this as-yet-untried orbit.

The Gateway‚Äîa research complex and lunar staging-post about one-sixth as large as the International Space Station (ISS)‚Äîhas been in the works for several years. Its name has subtly changed on several occasions: initially known as the Deep Space Habitat (DSH) it later became the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) then the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) and today it answers simply to ‚ÄúGateway‚Äù.

As well as providing a jumping-off point for a sustained human presence on the surface of the Moon it will support many investigations in planetary science astrophysics Earth observations heliophysics fundamental biology and human health and performance.

These include a pair of miniature ‚Äúweather stations‚Äù‚ÄîNASA‚Äôs Heliophysics Environment and Radiation Measurement Experiment Suite (HERMES) and the European Radiation Sensors Array (ESRA) provided by the European Space Agency (ESA)‚Äîto investigate solar activity and the space weather environment at lunar distance.

All told the 4400-cubic-foot (125-cubic-meter) Gateway boasts a strong international flavor with Canada having committed to build its robotic assets Japan contributing several critical elements of its Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) batteries thermal control and imaging systems and ESA providing habitation refueling and communications capabilities.

Two years ago in May 2019 NASA selected Maxar Technologies‚Äîformerly Space Systems/Loral (SS/L)‚Äîto build the Gateway‚Äôs Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) which then-Administrator Jim Bridenstine called ‚Äúthe cornerstone‚Äù of the effort to create a sustainable and reusable human presence ‚Äúon and around the Moon‚Äù. A System Requirements Review (SRR) in October 2019 enabled its technical risks and functional and performance needs to be formally baselined.

The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) is the most powerful Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft ever flown. Image Credit: NASA

The 19000-pound (8600 kg) PPE is equipped with communications and maneuvering capabilities together with high-powered 50-kilowatt Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) functionalities. Those SEP functionalities underwent an end-to-end series of hot-fire tests earlier this spring to validate subsystem performance and Maxar and NASA also wrapped up the Delta System Requirements Review (DSRR) and Tailored System Definition Review (TSDR) for PPE to ensure that its development remains on track.

In June of 2020 NASA announced that the PPE would be pre-integrated and flown together with HALO atop a commercial booster with launch initially moving from 2022 to no earlier than November 2023. This was expected to save NASA the expense of two rocket launches as well as reducing the risks of sending a pair of spacecraft under their own steam to NRHO then autonomously docking them together.

‚ÄúThe PPE and HALO module will be joined together by what is called an Inter-Element Adapter (IEA)‚Äù Northrop Grumman told AmericaSpace. ‚ÄúThis structure provides the mechanical support for PPE for launch loads and provides for fluid and data-transfer across HALO/PPE interface.

The integration of the two modules will occur at the launch site.‚Äù Last February SpaceX won the $331.8 million contract to deliver HALO/PPE on the outward leg of its voyage to lunar orbit with launch atop a triple-barreled Falcon Heavy from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida initially targeted for No Earlier Than (NET) May 2024. This has now moved six months to the right.

As the PPE work progressed Northrop Grumman was contracted last summer to guide HALO through its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The module carries radial docking ports Body-Mounted Radiators (BMRs) batteries and communication hardware and will furnish early Artemis crews with a functional pressurized volume capable of sustaining four people in NRHO for up to a month.

Northrop Grumman announced the successful conclusion of the PDR last November with HALO expected to utilize mature technologies from its in-service Cygnus cargo ship in its design. Between September 2013 and last month Cygnus has supported 15 fully successful missions to the ISS with the recent NG-15 ‚ÄúKatherine Johnson‚Äù spacecraft remaining berthed at the sprawling orbital outpost for more than three months.

‚ÄúLeveraging our success with our Cygnus spacecraft Northrop Grumman is perfectly positioned to deliver the HALO module a critical piece for NASA‚Äôs Artemis program and our journey to the Moon and beyond‚Äù said Frank DeMauro vice president and general manager for tactical space systems at Northrop Grumman.

‚ÄúAfter recently completing a successful preliminary design review we now look forward to completing the detailed design efforts and eventually bringing HALO to life in our Gilbert Ariz. facility while also providing integration services for the final combined vehicle before launch.‚Äù

That said HALO is expected to remain in its exceptionally harsh location for many times longer than any Cygnus. ‚ÄúThe HALO module is being designed for at least a 15-year life in the cislunar environment‚Äù Northrop Grumman told us.

‚ÄúTo ensure the long-term operation of the module in this radiation environment [it] incorporates redundancy in critical areas or systems and is designed to be maintained through the use of equipment spares and replacement parts available to the visiting crew. Some electronic components are being qualified and tested to ensure adequate radiation hardening is in place. There is no special shielding required for crews visiting the HALO module due to the short visit durations of 30 days or less in this hostile environment.‚Äù

Northrop Grumman‚Äôs design for the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) is heavily influenced by its highly successful fleet of Cygnus cargo ships. These have supported 15 fully successful missions to the International Space Station (ISS) between September 2013 and June of this year. Photo Credit: NASA

‚ÄúBy leveraging our active Cygnus production line Northrop Grumman can uniquely provide an affordable and reliable HALO module in the timeframe needed to support NASA‚Äôs Artemis Program‚Äù said Steve Krein vice president of civil and commercial satellites at Northrop Grumman. ‚ÄúOur team looks forward to continuing our collaboration with NASA in order to overcome the technical challenges associated with the harsh radiation and thermal environment of lunar space as well as the unique challenge of hosting visiting crews for extended durations in this environment.‚Äù

Under the terms of the $935 million contract signed Friday the company and its industrial partners will work towards the Critical Design Review (CDR) phase early next year and delivery of HALO to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida for launch. According to comments provided by Northrop Grumman to AmericaSpace earlier this year Thales Alenia Space Italy (TAS-I) expects to complete manufacturing of the welded primary-structure pressure shell of HALO by the end of 2021.

The HALO/PPE stack will launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy booster which has seen service three times between February 2018 and June 2019. Video Credit: AmericaSpace

‚ÄúOverall length of the pressure shell alone is about 23 feet (7 meters) while the complete HALO with interfacing structures and docking system is almost 29.5 feet (9 meters)‚Äù Northrop Grumman told us. ‚ÄúThe diameter of the pressure shell is the same as Cygnus: about 10 feet (3 meters). Overall HALO mass is dependent on the final internal layout configuration and launch vehicle lift capability and is expected to be in the range of 17600 pounds (8000 kg) to 22000 pounds (10000 kg).‚Äù

Current plans are for Northrop Grumman to take delivery of HALO‚Äôs primary structure from TAS-I in the fall of 2022. ‚ÄúOur integration and verification work will include the final Go/No-Go checks prior to launch as well as the support of the initialization of systems required to bring the module online once in orbit‚Äù Northrop Grumman told us. ‚ÄúOnce the module is fully online the real work to establish the evolution of the Gateway station can begin with NASA‚Äôs partners for lunar exploration.‚Äù

NASA and its commercial and international partners are building Gateway to support science investigations and enable surface landings at the Moon which will help prepare astronauts for future missions to Mars.

The firm fixed-price contract is valued at $935 million. Under the contract Northrop Grumman will be responsible for attaching and testing the integrated HALO with the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) being built by Maxar Technologies. Northrop Grumman will also lead the integrated PPE and HALO spacecraft turnover and launch preparation with SpaceX and support activation and checkout of HALO during the flight to lunar orbit. NASA is targeting November 2024 to launch the integrated spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

‚ÄúNASA is building the infrastructure to expand human exploration further out into the solar system than ever before including Gateway the lunar space station that will help us make inspirational scientific discoveries at and around the Moon.

HALO is where astronauts will live and conduct research while visiting the Gateway. The pressurized living quarters will provide command and control systems for the lunar outpost and docking ports for visiting spacecraft such as NASA‚Äôs Orion spacecraft lunar landers and logistics resupply craft. The HALO module will serve as the backbone for command and control and power distribution across Gateway and will perform other core functions including hosting science investigations via internal and external payload accommodations and communicating with lunar surface expeditions. HALO also will enable the aggregation of additional habitable elements to expand Gateway capabilities. Immediately after launch the Heliophysics Environmental and Radiation Measurement Experiment Suite built by NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland will begin conducting research outside of the integrated spacecraft.

‚ÄúThis is a major step on the path for Artemis not just for NASA but for the combined team including our commercial and international partners‚Äù said Kathy Lueders NASA associate administrator for Human Explorations and Operations. ‚ÄúGateway will provide unprecedented access to the Moon and symbolizes the expansion of our partnerships into deep space.‚Äù

The integrated PPE and HALO will be the Gateway‚Äôs foundation enabling humanity‚Äôs first permanent outpost in orbit around the Moon. Located tens of thousands of miles from the lunar surface at its farthest point and within easy range of lunar landers at its closest the Gateway will be in a near-rectilinear halo orbit. This orbit will allow NASA and its international and commercial partners to conduct unprecedented deep space science and technology investigations and conduct sustainable lunar exploration.

‚ÄúThis action puts in place the final contract component of a diverse multi-faceted team ‚Äìdistributed across the country and within some international partner facilities ‚Äì working together to create and implement the initial Gateway capability. We are excited to work with Northrop Grumman and all the partners to deliver the cornerstone of sustainable human exploration in cis-lunar space‚Äù said Dr. Jon Olansen NASA‚Äôs manager of the HALO project.

HALO leverages contributions from the Gateway international partners for robust capabilities. Batteries provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will power HALO until PPE solar arrays can be deployed and during eclipse periods. Robotic interfaces provided by the Canadian Space Agency will host payloads and provide base points for Canadarm3 robotic operations. ESA (European Space Agency) will provide a lunar communications system to enable high-data-rate communications between the lunar surface and Gateway. With three docking ports HALO will be the hub for international Gateway expansion in the future including an international habitat that ESA and JAXA will provide and an ESA-provided refueling module. The docking ports also will host a human landing system for lunar surface expeditions and logistics resupply spacecraft. As the Gateway hub HALO will provide power data airflow to each of these ports as well as thermal conditioning to assist future elements and spacecraft in controlling the temperature of their equipment and habitable environment.

HALO‚Äôs design is based on Northrop Grumman‚Äôs Cygnus spacecraft which has completed 15 resupply missions to the International Space Station to date. A previous contract for HALO awarded in June 2020 funded work through preliminary design review one of a series of checkpoints for the complex engineering project. The review process for the module completed in May assessed all of the spacecraft‚Äôs design to ensure the overall system is safe and reliable for flight and meets NASA‚Äôs mission requirements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTAvc3BhY2V4LWNhcmdvLWNhcHN1bGUtc3BsYXNoZXMtZG93bi1pbi1ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX cargo capsule splashes down in Gulf of Mexico ‚Äì Spaceflight Now,"Wrapping up a 36-day mission to the International Space Station a SpaceX Cargo Dragon capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico Friday night with biomedical experiments spacewalk equipment and other hardware returning from orbit.

The unpiloted spacecraft made a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico south of Tallahassee Florida at 11:29 p.m. EDT Friday (0329 GMT Saturday).

SpaceX confirmed the capsule‚Äôs splashdown in a tweet as recovery teams converged on the Dragon spacecraft in the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX‚Äôs ‚ÄúGo Navigator‚Äù recovery ship was on station near the splashdown zone to pull the capsule out of the sea.

Once the Dragon capsule is on the deck of the recovery ship teams will open the hatch and retrieve time-sensitive research specimens for delivery by helicopter to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where scientists will begin analyzing the experiments.

The recovery ship will bring the capsule back to Cape Canaveral for refurbishment and reuse on a future cargo mission.

The Cargo Dragon spacecraft undocked from the space station at 10:45 a.m. EDT (1445 GMT) Thursday two days later than originally planned. Managers ordered the delay to wait for Tropical Storm Elsa to move away from Florida.

The unpiloted supply ship spent 33 days at the space station since docking there June 5 two days after launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mission was SpaceX‚Äôs 22nd round-trip cargo delivery flight to the space station since 2012. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Northrop Grumman to fly commercial resupply missions to the station.

On the trip up to the space station the Dragon capsule delivered more than 7300 pounds (3300 kilograms) of cargo including experiments and upgraded solar arrays. Astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet installed and unfurled the roll-out solar arrays on three spacewalks last month.

After unpacking the ship‚Äôs pressurized cargo cabin the station astronauts loaded some 5300 pounds (2400 kilograms) of research specimens experiments and other equipment for return to Earth according to a NASA spokesperson.

Experiments returned to Earth included a pharmaceutical investigation from Eli Lilly and Company looking at how gravity affects freeze-dried materials. On Earth freeze-drying medications for long-term storage results in layers with structural differences and scientists want to know whether specimens freeze-dried in microgravity on the space station have a different structure.

The Dragon capsule also returned an experiment evaluating how gravity affects the structure composition and activity of oral bacteria. The data could help design treatments to combat oral diseases on long-term space missions to the moon and Mars according to NASA.

Leah Cheshier a NASA spokesperson said the Dragon capsule was also loaded wih with spacewalk equipment including a pistol grip tool torque wrench cooling garments water sampling kits and spacesuit components such as gloves.

‚ÄúI want to say thanks to all the SpaceX and NASA teams and all the scientists engineers and researchers who have equipment on this vehicle‚Äù Kimbrough said after the Dragon spacecraft departed the station Thursday. ‚ÄúIt was a great vehicle. It kept us busy for this past month doing a bunch of great science.‚Äù

The Dragon spacecraft jettisoned its disposable trunk section at 10:41 p.m. EDT Friday (0241 GMT Saturday). The unpressurized trunk hosts the ship‚Äôs power-generating solar arrays.

The capsule next fired its Draco thrusters at 10:45 p.m. EDT (0245 GMT) for a nine-minute deorbit burn to slow the craft‚Äôs velocity enough to drop back into the atmosphere.

After plunging through the atmosphere with a heat shield to protect against scorching temperatures the Dragon capsule deployed its parachutes a few minutes before splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.

This mission was SpaceX‚Äôs second resupply flight to use the company‚Äôs upgraded Cargo Dragon spacecraft which is based on the design of the human-rated crew Dragon spaceship. The new version of the Dragon spacecraft is designed to be flown at least five times up from three missions on the earlier configuration.

That product is the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100. The basic concept is combining a BlueField-2 DPU that includes an Arm-based CPU Mellanox NIC and associated memory and storage along with a NVIDIA A100 GPU. We reached out to NVIDIA about the product and did not get much back. Still this is an early product that demonstrates the reason NVIDIA acquired Mellanox and also the power of a DPU so we wanted to highlight it.

NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100

NVIDIA has discussed a few concepts for adding Mellanox IP plus GPUs in the past. Specifically we focused on the NVIDIA EGX A100 previously. We also heard about the NVIDIA BlueField-2X which looks similar but with a major difference. The NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 is a bit different. Here is the photo of the EGX A100 again:

The EGX A100 is using a ConnectX-6 NIC with a NVIDIA A100 GPU but this is not the DPU version. The PCB has a cutout at the end for a fan and the top of the PCB has NVLink connectors. We can contrast this with the BlueField-2 A100:

As you can see we have what appears to be the higher-end NVIDIA BlueField-2 ports on the faceplate. Here is the 100GbE/ IB BlueField-2 DPU as an example:

We can see that the out-of-band management port and the data ports are flipped on the A100 version. This is similar to what we saw with the BlueField-2X:

At first one may think that this looks very similar to the BlueField-2 A100. There is a significant difference though. If we look at the top portion of the BlueField-2X the edge of the PCB is flat.

When we zoom into the BlueField-2 A100 one can see that we have top edge connectors as we saw on the EGX A100 and also A100 PCIe GPUs.

NVIDIA has three sets of top connectors on standard A100 PCIe cards that are used for NVLink bridges. Here are two A100‚Äôs with the NVLink bridges attached:

It seems like the BlueField-2 A100 is similar to the BlueField-2X except perhaps that it is using the A100 (BlueField-2X GPU was not listed) and has these edge connectors.

Why this is an exciting card is that the BlueField-2 A100 has the capability to put a NVIDIA A100 directly on network fabric without going through a traditional x86 server. Unlike with the EGX A100 the BlueField-2 A100 has CPU cores memory and storage and runs its own OS. Here is a BlueField-2 Ubuntu shot from our piece A Quick Look at Logging Into a Mellanox NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU.

There are of course trade-offs with the BlueField-2 A100. One of them will need to be power and cooling. The BlueField-2 DPU uses enough power that going above 2.0GHz on its eight Arm cores means an auxiliary power connector is needed for the x16 card. Having a DPU that takes 60-75W from a PCIe power budget of 250W (or 300W with the new NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe) is a fairly huge percentage.

Our best guess is that this may not be seen as a training product in this generation. Instead as we highlighted in our ASUS RS720A-E11-RS24U review each A100 can be split into up to seven Multi-Instance GPU (or MIG) instances.

MIG works extremely well with AI inference as we saw with MLPerf Inference v1.0 and inference is often a lower-power workload on the A100. That effectively would allow a BlueField-2 A100 to be attached to a network and provide an AI inference node.

Final Words

All of this is fun but we have yet to see this in the field. Still it shows the vision of where this is headed and one can see the early precursor to the Arm-azing Grace in the future.

Hopefully we will see these products in the wild instead of just renderings. NVIDIA did not confirm exact specs for us but we were told this is an A100 with a BlueField-2 DPU on a single PCIe card. We can update this if we get more specs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzExL2lzLWl0LXRvby1sYXRlLXRvLWJ1eS1udmlkaWEtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is It Too Late to Buy NVIDIA Stock?,"The chipmaking giant has posted some serious share price gains over the past year.

NVIDIA (NVDA -1.50%) shareholders have been benefiting mightily from the ongoing chip shortage as well as from the popularity of the company's offerings for GPU-based applications. The chip stock has rallied by nearly 240% since January 2020.

The magnitude of that surge has plenty of investors questioning whether there's still a chance to buy in or if they have essentially missed out on their opportunity to profit from this particular rally. Let's take a closer look at NVIDIA and attempt to provide an answer.

The state of the stock

NVIDIA's share price has increased by just over 100% in the last 12 months and its scheduled four-for-one stock split is less than two weeks away.

That stock price surge has taken NVIDIA's P/E ratio to almost 95. The stock has not seen such high valuations since the early 2000s. Moreover when NVIDIA rallied in late 2016 and early 2018 P/E multiples above 50 amounted to sell signals -- the stock plummeted soon after hitting those levels.

Additionally it has become expensive compared to its peers. Archrival AMD sells for under 40 times earnings Qualcomm trades at 20 times earnings and Intel sports a P/E ratio of less than 13.

Competitive advantages

On the positive side NVIDIA possessives competitive edges in a number of tech niches. It has gained traction in the cryptocurrency space with a popular and powerful GPU specifically designed for mining digital tokens. It has built a presence in the realm of supercomputers -- its Cambridge-1 supercomputer will be used by businesses and academics to accelerate research in healthcare and genomics. Furthermore assuming its proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings goes through it could further widen its competitive moat as many manufacturers use Arm's chips in devices such as digital TVs and smartphones.

And its longtime core products -- GPUs for video gaming -- are helping it foster innovations in the growing market for artificial intelligence systems. Its chips will power key applications in self-driving cars data centers and cloud computing among others. Additionally its AI-on-5G platform will also aid in deploying AI-based applications across 5G networks.

Financials and outlook

Given these innovations investors can easily understand how NVIDIA's successes have boosted its financials. In its fiscal 2022 first quarter which ended May 2 revenue rose 84% year over year to $5.66 billion. This included a 106% increase in gaming revenue and a 79% surge in data center revenue.

That lifted its GAAP net income by 109% to over $1.9 billion. Slower growth in operating expenses along with a boost in earnings from unrealized gains contributed to the bottom-line gains.

That performance for the most recently reported quarter also outpaced NVIDIA's results for its full fiscal 2021 when revenue rose 53% and GAAP net income increased 55%.

The company saw nearly $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the latest quarter and close to $4.7 billion in fiscal 2021.

Nonetheless its outlook may give investors pause. For its fiscal Q2 the company expects revenue to be within 2 percentage points of $6.3 billion a massive increase from the $3.9 billion it reported in the same quarter last year. However the company declined to offer an outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. This could reflect management's uncertainty about macro conditions as global economies attempt to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic.

Should I still consider NVIDIA?

Although the company's long-term growth story could easily continue investors may want to avoid NVIDIA stock for now. Management's decision not to provide an outlook beyond Q2 indicates it could hit a rough patch ahead. Moreover it doesn't appear wise to pay almost 95 times earnings for this chipmaker under current conditions especially when the stock rarely traded at a P/E ratio above 50 before 2021. While it may not be too late to buy NVIDIA stock investors should probably assume that they have missed out on the chance to benefit from this rally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL29uZGEtcmV2ZWFscy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWFlZ2lzLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vb25kYS1yZXZlYWxzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNjAtYWVnaXMtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ONDA Reveals GeForce RTX 3060 Aegis Graphics Card,"Chinese manufacturer Onda Electronics recently launched an Ampere designed graphics card based on GA106 GPU named NVIDIA RTX 3060 Aegis. Onda Electronics has not released any graphics card or other computer components as far back as the latter part of last year. With the lack of any website and product updates users were unsure if the company had halted manufacturing completely.

The Onda NVIDIA RTX 3060 Aegis does not have a lot of information about the specifications of the GPU from the company. However sources at VideoCardz suggests that this is the LHR or low hash rate model to keep in competition with other GPU manufacturers.

2 of 9

The RTX 3060 Aegis graphics card features a boost clock of 1780 megahertz but the overclock speed is only three MHz. If this information is correct that would be the lowest overclocking on any of the ONDA GPUs to date. The graphics card features a 2.5 slots and three 90 mm fans a 2.5 slot style and a plastic casing. The back of the card is not completely shown but from one of the profile angle shots of the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Aegis it appears that the backplate is possibly a lightweight metal backplate.

ONDA's new graphics card appears to be geared for a more budget friendly consumer base with the information we have at this time. Or this may be another graphics processing unit to be utilized for cryptomining with Onda Electronics history of bitcoin mining. Hopefully before Onda Electronic's graphics card releases we will have more solid information.

Nearly a year later the GPU brand launched a follow-up to it the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.

Now a little more than a month after its grand launch with the RTX 3070 Ti the card has finally arrived in our hands for testing. So without wasting any more time let‚Äôs get started.

Specifications

In comparison to the RTX 3080 NVIDIA is clearly giving the RTX 3080 Ti a lot of love. As I mentioned in initial reports prior to this review the majority of this card is almost akin to the RTX 3090 having nearly as many CUDA cores RT Cores and Tensor Cores as the card itself.

Even its memory bandwidth is similar at just 24GB/s shy of the full monty as is the card‚Äôs TDP of 350W and 384-bit memory bus. That said the RTX 3080 Ti does have only half the amount of graphics memory at 12GB GDDR6X but that is still 2GB more than the RTX 3080.

Design

As it is with all Founders Edition (FE) cards the aesthetics and cooler design of the RTX 3080 Ti is no different than the RTX 3080 FE or RTX 3090 FE. That means you still get the same Dual Axial Flow Through technology the same ultra-compact PCB beneath it and the wickedly cool multi-fin heatsink and cross-pattern look that also serves as the bulk of the card.

In fact the only difference that would allow me to tell the RTX 3080 Ti from its non-Ti sibling is its slightly brighter outlook literally. Side by side the edges and outline of the card actually bear a more polished sheen. At the same time the plates inside these aesthetic boundaries also seem darker in colour.

As is the standard with all graphics cards the RTX 3080 Ti has three DisplayPort 1.4 ports and an HDMI 2.1 port the latter capable of supporting resolutions up to 8K.

Aside from its design though one of the card‚Äôs massive drawbacks would have to be its starting price tag of RM5680. Mind you that‚Äôs just the price of the Founders Edition model so you can imagine just how much AiB partners are marking up the price of their cards.

Testbench

To test the RTX 3080 Ti the other components in my testbed remains the same. This includes the same Ryzen 9 5950X CPU MSI motherboard and 16GB of RAM. For comparison sake I am obviously benching the card against the RTX 3080 FE but also the RTX 3070 Ti FE and AMD Radeon RX 6800XT.

Benchmarks

So the question is: just how much more powerful is the RTX 3080 Ti FE compared to the RTX 3080? The short answer would be not by a whole lot. The longer version of that answer though is that it actually varies from title to title.

On the synthetic benchmark portion of this review you can see the RTX 3080 Ti FE maintaining a decent lead ahead of the other three cards in most scenarios while screaming past in one or two of them.

Suffice to say gaming is when the RTX 3080 Ti FE obviously really begins to come into its own. In the five titles that I use ‚Äì Control Deus Ex: Mankind Divided DOOM Eternal Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Watch Dogs Legion ‚Äì the card is more than able to maintain more than 60 fps in most of them especially in titles without DXR switched on.

For DOOM Eternal I will point out that the average framerate seen here are reflective of the game being run without ray-tracing and DLSS turned on. On average the RTX 3080 Ti FE runs approximately 30 fps faster at 4K and close to 80 fps at 1440p. With ray-tracing and DLSS set to Balanced those numbers obviously drop but to my surprise it was still above the 100 fps mark at 4K.

As for the other two RTX-capable titles it is equally surprising to see the RTX 3080 Ti actually blow the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark out of water and by a significantly wide margin for that matter. With RTX turned on and DLSS disabled the card isn‚Äôt breaking past the 60 fps threshold but it is leaving the other cards in the dust. Likewise the same applies to the other two resolutions.

Watch Dogs Legion seems to be the exception to the rule with the card performing just slightly worse than its non-Ti sibling. What is a little odd is that the card‚Äôs performance in the other two resolutions was identical especially when the framerates should theoretically be higher in Full HD.

Temperature and Power Consumption

In regards to overall temperature the RTX 3080 Ti FE‚Äôs runs only mildly hotter than the RTX 3080 when I tested it at 74.6¬∞C on a full load. Now it should be reiterated that I use an open testbench and the ambient temperature of my lab is always a cool 19¬∞C at all times which are quite likely contributing factors to the obtained temperature. In a closed and encased system the RTX 3080 Ti‚Äôs temperature shoots up and can stay within the 80¬∞C range.

In terms of power consumption the RTX 3080 Ti clearly consumes its stated TGP never going beyond the 350W line.

Conclusion

There is little doubt that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is an absolute unit and like its predecessor continues to push the limits of what NVIDIA‚Äôs Ampere-powered lineup is capable of achieving. That said while we are looking at an average increment of 20 frames across the board for all titles I genuinely do not believe that its starting asking price of RM5680 is entirely justified.

Remember when the RTX 3080 launched NVIDIA had priced it at least half the price of its last generation flagship the RTX 2080 Ti which was sold at an average of RM7000 at the time. If you‚Äôre planning on bumping up from an RTX 3080 I highly recommend that you don‚Äôt. Barring the fact that supply for the card is scarce this really is a graphics card that would better serve those wanting an upgrade from their Turing-power RTX 20 Series cards or older.

Granger a 5-11 165-pounder played multiple positions including quarterback during his junior season. He is rated a three-star recruit at wide receiver by rivals.com and 247Sports and 247Sports ranks him 27th in the state in the Class of 2022.

Granger picked the Monarchs after also receiving scholarship offers from N.C. State Pitt Nebraska Arkansas East Carolina and Liberty.

Granger was a first-team All-Tidewater selection this past season as a junior after accounting for 1264 yards and 15 touchdowns at wide receiver and quarterback. He also played defensive back.

The Commodores (6-2) fell to Highland Springs in the Class 5 semifinals.

Granger joins an ODU recruiting class already with three commitments from South Hampton Roads: Oscar Smith quarterback Ethan Vasko Deep Creek lineman Ryan Nolan and Kempsville defensive end Jaylon White.

Vasko is the first Abe Goldblatt All-Tidewater Player of the Year to commit to Old Dominion out of high school.

Here you go:

I have forgotten more about race than most people have ever known.

Apologies if that sounds like braggadocio but there‚Äôs a point that needs making. I‚Äôve spent the better part of 40 years researching and writing about the history and dynamics of race in America ‚Äî and 63 years living them. I know this terrain well.

Yet until maybe six months ago I had never heard of ‚Äúcritical race theory.‚Äù

It has since become inescapable of course ‚Äî panicked Republicans marching in the streets under signs demanding ‚ÄúStop Critical Race Theory Now!‚Äù while states like Oklahoma Texas Florida and Tennessee rush to pass laws protecting children from its depredations. Nikki Haley believes critical race theory ‚Äúis going to hold back generations of young people.‚Äù Author Mark Levin says it‚Äôs about ‚Äúdestroying the existing society.‚Äù Tucker Carlson calls it a ‚Äúpoison‚Äù that will end civilization as we know it.

One almost expects critical race theory to come lumbering over the horizon like Godzilla swatting away fighter jets like gnats as grim-faced generals ponder the advisability of using nukes.

And yet ‚Äî it bears repeating ‚Äî as recently as January this avowed expert in racial dynamics had never heard of it. Nor am I the only one. Last week I surveyed a handful of people like me: African-American journalists with long experience in the field of race. Only one claimed detailed prior knowledge of critical race theory. As to the rest?

‚ÄúHeard the phrase for the first time this year‚Äù said one.

‚ÄúI had heard the term vaguely‚Äù said another.

‚ÄúNEVER‚Äù said yet another.

Small wonder. A search of the Nexis database finds that the term ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù appeared in U.S. newspapers 1361 times in the 21 years between January 2000 and New Year‚Äôs Day 2021. It has appeared 6000 times in the six months since.

For the record: critical race theory originated over 30 years ago among legal scholars; it holds that race is a social ‚Äî not a scientific ‚Äî construct and offers a framework for understanding the role of systemic racism in the law and in legal institutions. It is taught if at all in law school ‚Äî not high school.

So how did it become this sudden four-alarm fire in the house of democracy? The answer is depressingly simple. It is this year‚Äôs War on Christmas. It‚Äôs sharia law gay wedding cake and New Black Panthers. Which is to say it is this year‚Äôs spur by which the white right more easily stampeded than a herd of cattle by a lightning strike is prodded to feel resentful frightened and besieged ‚Äî and vote accordingly.

There are no words ‚Äî nice ones anyway ‚Äî for the cynicism of those who employ these crude manipulations. Or for the gullibility and stupidity of those who let them get away with it who fall for the same tired okey-doke season after season year after year generation after generation.

Harsh words? Yes. But what other words are appropriate to people who as the planet burns as the pandemic decimates as the rich get richer and as the random bullets fly think their children‚Äôs greatest threat arises from an obscure academic doctrine?

Today it‚Äôs critical race theory. Tomorrow ‚Äî mark my words ‚Äî it will be something else some other pithy term to serve as a repository of all that the white right fears. There are many things for which they should be afraid ‚Äî life health future. But sadly they fear nothing quite so much as the loss of whiteness and its privileges. As I said I know this terrain well.

Yet I keep hoping it will surprise me someday.

If Old Dominion University's baseball roster remains unchanged over the next few weeks the Monarchs would be overwhelming favorites to successfully defend their Conference USA title.



In fact they would also have a good shot at making their first trip to the College Baseball World Series in Omaha.



All but three players are eligible to return and outfielder Kyle Battle is the only starter among those who are definitely leaving. Everyone else technically could return from the team that won 44 games and advanced to the championship game of the Columbia Regional in South Carolina.



But if you're a baseball fan you know the roster will change and perhaps drastically over the next week or two. The Major League Baseball draft begins Sunday and goes 20 rounds over three days.



It's likely that three or four Monarchs will get drafted and perhaps has many as half a dozen.



Here's the good news: regardless of how many players ODU loses to the draft the Monarchs will be good next season. A lot of talent returns. Potentially this could be a championship team.



ODU was one of the nation's top offensive teams and that should not change. Pitching is a question mark but ODU has a ton of good prospects.



More on that later.





Tommy Bell



Two players will certainly go in the early rounds. Pitcher Hunter Gregory a hard-throwing 6-foot-3 righthander who was 8-2 and had a .295 ERA in 16 appearances will go in the first seven rounds predicts ODU Coach Chris Finwood. He already has Major League a major league fastball and is considered a top prospect.



So likely will Tommy Bell the sure-handed shortstop to who was second on the team with a .343 batting average hit eight home runs drove in 49 runs and had 134 assists. Bell made playing shortstop look easy and when ODU needed big plays in the clutch he provided.



Battle hopefully will also go high in the draft after a successful season in which he hit .319 led the team with 18 home runs was walked 56 times and seemed to make big plays at the plate and on the field when the Monarchs most needed them.



His tenth-inning home run led the Monarchs past Louisiana Tech in the Conference USA championship game.



An aside here: Battle is a good lesson in why it's sometimes good to stay in college for your senior season. He played well in the spring of 2020 when play was drastically shortened by the pandemic.



He might have signed a free-agent contract last season but elected to stay and it was the smart choice. In my opinion he was the MVP of a team seeded 11th in the NCAA tournament and definitely raised his stature among pro scouts.



Another player almost surely to go is outfielder Andy Garriola a 6-4 225-pound junior from Sierra Madre California who hit .318 and 14 home runs and led the nation with 72 RBIs. He belted three home runs in one game the semifinals of the Conference USA Tournament.



Finwood thinks right-handed pitched Ryne Moore should also be drafted but says for whatever reason the 6-4 junior from Limerick Pennsylvania isn't as high among pro scouts as he should be.





Kyle Battle after the game-winning home run in C-USA title game.



His stats speak for themselves: he was 9-1 with a 3.16 ERA and struck out 80 while walking just 22. He was 5-0 in his last five starts and while doing that had a relief appearance in ODU's victory over Louisiana Tech in the Conference USA championship game.



What more could you ask?



I'll never forget his masterful performance against South Carolina in the Columbia regional in which he struck out eight and allowed just one run in seven innings in ODU's 2-1 victory. That came with a crowd of more than 7000 Gamecock followers screaming their lungs out at him.



""It was awesome"" I remember him saying about the crowd that compared him to unsightly parts of the human anatomy.



Talk about performing under pressure.



He surely will get his chance in the pros though it may not come this spring.



The final player garnering a lot of attention is sophomore pitcher Aaron Holiday. After a rough start this season in which he had control problems he settled down and threw well late in the season.



Holiday had a 3.21 ERA and 4-2 record with a save but his 32 walks led the team. Yet his fastball is well really fast and some scouts drool when they think of his potential.



According to Major League Baseball rules players are eligible to be drafted they are seniors in high school or if in college 21 years or older and have completed three years of eligibility in college.



Finwood says he worries a little about both Holiday and Garriola in that essentially they played just two years with the COVID-shortened 2020 season counting as the third.





Andy Garriola



But he says he won't advise any player to sign or not to sign.



He said he will explain their options to them in a real-world fashion. As Finwood said MLB officials are trying to sign prospects as late in the draft as possible for the least amount of money.



""This is an exciting time for our kids"" he said. ""People are thinking about their dreams of playing professional baseball.



""But you also have to be careful. We have to remind them that playing in the minor leagues isn't the goal. The goal is to play in the Major Leagues. And that's hard.



""Don't devalue yourself or your experience here.""



He said if a player goes in the top 15 rounds that player likely should sign. If you go lower then perhaps not.



There's another issue that players are facing this season. MLB did away with 40 minor league baseball teams during the pandemic. It was a cruel blow to the 40 cities who lost their teams and I think in the long run it will damage the game.



It was also a blow to hundreds of players hoping to play minor league baseball.



There are 120 minor league teams to feed into the 30 MLB teams. Finwood says that means a lot of good players will have no place to play.





Ryne Moore



There will be 600 players drafted and MLB.com predicts about half will be high school players including five of the first ten prospects.



There are 299 Division I baseball programs which means an average of about one per school will be drafted.



""These kids are getting calls from scouts and they are talking about rounds and money"" Finwood said. ""Like I said this is the exciting part of the draft. But there tends to be a lot of disappointment on the other side of it.""



By this time next week we should know a lot more about who's coming back and who's hopefully moving on to a productive pro career.



Regardless there's plenty of talent left at ODU and the schedule is challenging ‚Äì home and home series with Virginia VCU and East Carolina highlight the non-conference schedule. All three played in the NCAA tournament and U.Va. knocked ODU off twice in the Columbia regional.



The team's best hitter second baseman Carter Trice returns after a standout freshman season. Trice hit .355 with 14 home runs and 54 RBIs and had a .426 on-base percentage. He's a consensus freshman All-American and is playing this summer for the USA Baseball team the first Monarch to do so in nearly three decades.



Three other freshmen started for ODU ‚Äì third baseman Kenny Levari (.298 eight home runs 36 RBIs) DH Robbie Petracci (.299 eight home runs) and Lincoln Ransom (.261 .552 slugging percentage and four home runs in just 69 at bats).



Catcher Brock Gagliardi (.316 nine home runs .561 slugging percentage) is back and he's not only a very good hitter he's good behind home plate.



First baseman Matt Coutney (.282 10 home runs) Thomas Wheeler (.271 15 stolen bases) and Ryan Teschko (.275 seven home runs) return as does second baseman Chris Dengler who appeared headed for great things before an injury knocked him out last season.





Aaron Holiday



Dengler's injury forced Trice to play second base ‚Äì he was a shortstop in high school. Dengler's return to could allow Trice to go to the outfield where he is playing this summer for USA Baseball.



""We've got a good group back"" Finwood said. ""I'm not worried about scoring runs. We just have to get the pitching shored up.""



Let's start with the bullpen where Jason Hartline (5-0 1.88 ERA three saves 60 strikeouts in 48 innings pitched) and Noah Dean (4.64 nine saves 44 strikeouts in 21 innings pitching) anchor a solid group of returnees.



If you recall Hartline and Dean combined with Jacob Gomez to shut out Jacksonville over the last eight innings of ODU's 4-3 victory in the first round of the NCAA tournament.



Gomez a freshman was 6-1 largely in relief and had a 4.75 ERA. ""He showed what he's capable of against Jacksonville"" Finwood said. Gomez will get a shot this fall to prove that he can start.



So will Levari the third baseman who was forced to play in the infield because of injuries. He threw 91 miles per hour plus in high school.



""He's going to pitch for us"" Finwood said. ""He may start once a week or could play third base and come in as a relief pitcher. But he's going to throw for us. He's a great pitcher.""



Nick Pantos (4-2 4.82 ERA 63 strikeouts in 11 starts) and Tommy Gertner (2-2 4.95 ERA) both return and will obviously compete to be starters.



Brad Dobzanski a transfer from Kentucky who was 2-0 with a 1.42 ERA in 12.2 innings pitched has potential as do a dozen or more other returnees.



I won't mention them all. Just know that Finwood and his coaches have recruited well.





Noah Dean



Ten freshmen are on campus already taking classes and one or two likely will step up and play next season. So likely will some junior college transfers.



I contend that baseball is the must underfunded of sports in college athletics. Coaches must split 11.7 scholarships between 27 players. In all teams can have 40 players on their roster.



That means that not even Carter Trice is on a full ride ‚Äì his parents are paying tuition fees and room and board. Because of the uncertainty of the draft Finwood was forced to tell some players that he may not have scholarship money for them or room on his roster next season.



Those were tough but necessary conversations. Depending on how many guys get drafted some and perhaps most will return after all.



Finwood is a traditional guy and he doesn't like going to the transfer portal. Philosophically he likes to recruit high school and junior college players.



But he has two players from the transfer portal committed to ODU one from a Power 5 school. ""We asked them to wait a week or so to see what happens in the draft"" he said.



More than 3000 players are in the baseball transfer portal and as with football and men's and women's basketball a lot of them will be forced either not to play or to transfer down to Division II or Division III.



""I'm not hugely in favor of the whole culture of the portal"" Finwood said ""But Charlotte completely turned their program around in one year getting kids from the transfer portal.



""They got Austin Knight from Tennessee. He wasn't playing as much at Tennessee as he wanted and he came into our league was the conference Player of the Year.



""We're looking at the portal. You have to these days.""



If all six Monarchs get drafted ""you have to say they all went out with a bang"" Finwood said.



But he mentioned pitcher Ryan Yarbrough who was drafted in the 20th round of his junior year and returned to ODU. ""He went in the fourth round as a senior"" Finwood said.



He's now a starter at Tampa Bay with a reported salary of $2.3 million.



""He was more ready after the additional year here. It's not just 'are you going to be drafted?' he said. ""It's also 'but are you ready?'



""And not every kid's ready.""

Battle knows that his life will rapidly change if he hears his name called in the draft and after getting advice from advisers and former ODU teammates he's ready to make the jump to the pro level.

""I kinda have an idea of what‚Äôs to come feel like I'm pretty prepared for it"" Battle said. ""I know the lifestyle is a grind if you want to make it to the big leagues so I‚Äôm just ready to go through that.""

Battle wants to make it to the Bigs and to hopefully one day experience what it's like to win a World Series trophy. Although it was actually a Stanley Cup trophy that first took up space in Battle's mind as a child.

Baseball was the last sport Battle picked up. Ice hockey came first when he started skating at four years old a few years before he gave baseball a try.

""Once sophomore year of high school hit it was kinda like alright let's wee out those other sports and really start focusing on baseball"" Battle said. ""I still miss hockey to this day. I watch the Stanley Cup Playoffs and it‚Äôs like wow that would be amazing to play in but also I know a World Series championship that would be my top dream ever.""

While Battle's ditched his hockey stick for a bat he views those days on the ice as being extremely beneficial to the way he developed as a baseball player.

""I think playing hockey actually helped with baseball because hockey‚Äôs a lot of rotational stuff"" Battle said. ""A lot of core strength and I think that translated over to baseball because when I was still playing hockey and baseball I was crushing balls. I was only what? 12 13 but I was hitting balls a lot farther than a lot of 12 13-year-olds.""

Battle's older now but his ability to hit bombs remains. He led the team in home runs this year with 18 a number that ranks 16th nationally and after many successful seasons at ODU he's received good feedback from pro teams.

""A lot of interest. They all said I'm a great player I had a great year Battle said. ""Regardless I'm gonna be happy with any place I'm at if my name's called.‚Äù

About eight million metric tons are mined every year in China Russia Norway the US and elsewhere some of which is used in the $500 billion global market for semiconductors. In turn the manufactured silicon chips wafers and integrated circuits power tens of trillions of dollars worth of hardware running personal and business software wired and wireless communication devices consumer electronics automotive components industrial technology and other critical processes worldwide.

Manufacturing semiconductors involves not only a network of highly specialized firms in an often multistage production process but a dependence upon firms which produce the ultra-high precision equipment for the fabrication procedure. Thus while silicon is a metalloid and accordingly a commodity the various chips employing it describe a spectrum of complexity that runs from basic microcontrollers to high performance processors: each of which rarely has substitutes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not rocket science‚Äîit‚Äôs much more difficult‚Äù goes one of the industry‚Äôs inside jokes‚Ä¶Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories dust-free rooms multi-million-dollar machines molten tin and lasers. The end goal is to transform wafers of silicon‚Äîan element extracted from plain sand‚Äîinto a network of billions of tiny switches called transistors that form the basis of the circuitry that will eventually give a phone computer car washing machine or satellite crucial capabilities.

Beginning in 2020 and accelerating into 2021 a chip shortage has to various extents plagued the estimated 169 industries which depend upon them. While a small number of firms stockpiled chips in anticipation of just such an occurrence the overwhelming majority of firms for which semiconductors are a key factor input have had to reduce their output. But like so much else the inadequate supply of semiconductors is at the center of a handful of causes with policy blunders front and center among them.

Neo-Mercantilist Beginnings

Two major policy actions of the Trump Administration laid the initial groundwork for the present paucity of chips. The first came in 2018 when

the United States imposed 25% tariffs on semiconductors imported from China. A core issue involved allegations that unfair trade practices by China hurt a variety of US-headquartered companies including in the semiconductor industry. Tit-for-tat government actions resulted in new tariffs covering over $450 billion or more than half of bilateral trade between the two countries by the end of 2019[.]

That led to a 12% decline in global semiconductor revenue between 2018 and 2019. But shortly thereafter a second and

arguably more economically destructive line of conflict for the industry began in 2019 with a series of US export controls targeting the global semiconductor supply chain. Initially US policy was motivated by national security concerns. Limiting US semiconductor sales was aimed at keeping Huawei‚Äìa Chinese‚Ä¶Fortune global 500 company whose 5G equipment the US government viewed as threatening critical network infrastructure‚Äìfrom accessing inputs it needed to manufacture base stations. The initial US export controls didn‚Äôt work: Huawei purchased semiconductors from companies in Taiwan and South Korea instead. The United States responded with new export controls and threatened to cut off the niche equipment and software provided by smaller American firms to those foreign companies if [they] did not stop selling to Huawei.

As lockdowns and indoor occupancy limits were imposed with the spread of Covid-19 many semiconductor manufacturing facilities came to be operated with skeleton crews at lower capacity. The already tariff-slowed pace of chip production began to decline more precipitously.

The Stimulative Factor

Only a few weeks into the widespread imposition of pandemic policies (lockdowns stay-at-home orders social distancing requirements compulsory masking and so on) the first stimulus checks were received by an estimated 162 million bank accounts which contributed some portion of the total $271 billion to a consumptive binge. Several additional stimulus payments have been made since then and on top of that the American Rescue Plan extended Federal unemployment bonuses through September 6th 2021. Furthermore under the Child Tax Credit revisions the

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will pay out $3600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Starting July 15 monthly payments will be issued through December of 2021 with the remainder to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit will not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. In other words qualifying families will receive the full amount regardless of how much ‚Äî or little ‚Äî they owe in taxes. Payments will start to phase out beyond a $75000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021 though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025.

Aside from the incredible folly of government policies which severely restrict the supply of demanded foreign goods via tariffs and shortly thereafter inundate under- and unemployed consumers with disposable income fiscal redistribution has broadly and undeniably played a major role in exacerbating the shortages observed over the past sixteen months.

The Remote Access Crunch

As early as January 2020 a mass exodus of employees from offices to work-from-home status began and with it a leap in demand for laptops and other business technology. Schools additionally closed nationwide requiring many parents to acquire or upgrade home computers. A Harvard Business School study found that nearly 80% of large companies and 45% of small companies shifted to some measure of remote work last year with 93% of households containing school-age kids involved in some form of remote learning. Another portion of the increase in demand owed to efforts to cope with boredom: semiconductor-driven smart televisions with digital streaming capacity tablets phones and other entertainment technologies.

Over 302 million computers were purchased in 2020: a 13% increase over 2019 and the most since 2014. But there was a snag: the burst of demand struck not as it typically does‚Äìthroughout the year with anticipated increases in the late summer (with the start of the academic year) and after Thanksgiving (for holiday gifts)‚Äìbut during March and April. And owing to this rush the chip shortage began to worsen with consumer goods prices rising. ‚ÄúA webcam that normally costs $50-$60 is now around $100 and a dock that should be about $180 is $320 on Amazon Prime‚Äù with many items rapidly going out of stock as NBC News reported in April 2020.

In several jurisdictions the sudden and profound spike in tech prices led to accusations of illegal price gouging. None however led to government legal action (charges or confiscation) as laptops tablets and other such products are not categorized as essential to helping check the spread of Covid-19. (Masks hand sanitizer disinfectants and the like are subject to gouging penalties under the Defense Production Act of 1950 invoked by the Trump Administration on 18 March 2020.)

Game consoles such as Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox and the Sony PS5 (Playstation 5) began disappearing from store shelves and online retailer inventories as well. Already popular gifts the prospects of longer lockdown periods (‚Äòjust two weeks‚Äô ad infinitum) made gaming systems particularly desirable goods. By Thanksgiving 2020 console prices were skyrocketing with PS5s listed on certain auction sites for up to $2000: several times the manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price.

Automotive Production & Sales

By mid-spring 2020 the full implications of the effect that shutdowns stay-at-home orders social distancing and the like would have on many businesses became starkly apparent. As car dealerships reported cancelled appointments and entire days without a single walk-on auto manufacturers began to cancel orders for new inventory. As expected sales of new cars plummeted initially. But within several weeks abetted by the introduction of 0% financing deals and a host of other incentives plus being awash in stimulus funds demand for new vehicles exploded. Both lot supply and production were caught flat-footed.

Dealer lots quickly emptied of the supply of the most desirable makes and models of autos. Yet in many cases they failed to refill as many vehicles in mid-production couldn‚Äôt be completed for want of chips to run battery management driving assistance connectivity and numerous other functions pivotal to the automotive advances of the past twenty years. A profound representation of the production shortfall is seen in Ford‚Äôs massive stockpile of vehicles awaiting semiconductors at the Kentucky Speedway. The thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of vehicles amassed there waiting for silicon chips is allegedly visible from space.

Toyota which owing to prescience or luck stockpiled semiconductor chips in advance was able to produce and sell enough cars to soak up some of the sudden demand. It beat GM as the number one seller of cars in the US for the first time ever in the second quarter of 2021. Ford reported a 27% fall in June new vehicle sales from one year ago (2020 to 2021) and analysts have predicted that a currently estimated 477000 planned but unproduced cars could number 1.1 million by the end of 2021.

As new cars disappeared from lots and weren‚Äôt replaced the prices of used cars jumped. The May 2021 CPI indicates that used car prices have increased by roughly 30% on a year-over-year basis.

Fire and Water

In July 2020 the first of a number of ‚Äòelemental‚Äô intrigues further hurled wrenches into the gearworks of global semiconductor supply chains: a fire broke out at a Nittobo plant in Fukushima Japan. With a pivotal role in producing fiberglass for printed circuit boards (PCBs) the damage from both fire and flame suppression caused output from that facility to fall by at least 20%. Three months later and eight hundred miles south of that another fire erupted at the Nobeoka City Asahi Kasei Microdevices (AKM) semiconductor factory. After raging for three days analysts described the conflagration as ‚Äúcreat[ing] supply chain interruptions for many end products[.]‚Äù

And in March of 2021 a conflagration at the Renesas Electronics building in Hitachinaka Japan completely destroyed 17 chip manufacturing machines and the location‚Äôs ‚Äúclean room.‚Äù The total damage at the time was estimated to take up to six months to recover from.

Meanwhile the uncommonly tranquil summer and fall of 2020 in the Pacific and Phillppine Sea which typically features three or four typhoons annually led to a drought in Taiwan. By some accounts this is the nation‚Äôs worst drought since 1964. And this might not arouse much concern except that Taiwan is the world‚Äôs foremost semiconductor foundry market and manufacturing chips is a particularly water-intensive procedure.

Taiwan‚Äôs leading semiconductor producer and the world‚Äôs largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (TSMC)‚Ä¶uses more than 150000 tons of water per day [volumes] approximating 80 standard swimming pools‚Ä¶Due to the drought TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers have been depending on water trucks to maintain production. It is estimated that TSMC will spend over 23.69 Euro [around $28M] on the water trucks this year exceeding its original budget planning. Global supply has been affected since‚Ä¶[and] microchips are likely to become rarer and rarer.

The impact of the water shortage has (as does much today) led to opportunistic demagoguery. These include assertions that the unsung agent of Taiwan‚Äôs chip manufacturing problems is climate change and calls for firms which depend heavily upon Taiwanese foundries (including Apple Qualcomm and Nvidia) to diversify their sources of supply.

As It Stands

Thumbing its nose at the Ricardian notion of comparative advantage in July 2020

the United States Senate approved the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which contains an amendment passed earlier this week with little floor debate and by a 96-4 margin that would provide billions of dollars in new federal support for the U.S. semiconductor industry most notably tax credits and grants for the construction of new domestic manufacturing facilities. The House passed a similar bill with a similar amendment earlier this week so the legislation now goes to conference where the subsidies are expected to survive.

The purpose of the jingo-ensconced CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America) Act is to ‚Äú[e]nsure [US] leadership in the future design manufacturing and assembly of cutting edge semiconductors‚Ä¶[a]s the Chinese Communist Party aims to dominate the entire semiconductor supply chain.‚Äù In May 2021 Congress was debating the form that such aid should take and in June 2021 some decisions were reached.

Interventionism has for time immemorial generated unintended consequences. Nevertheless it is likely that social distancing and capacity restrictions in the early phases of the pandemic would have led to decreased semiconductor chip output anyway. But with respect to national security concerns the age-old question regarding whether markets or government bureaucracies best accomplish such goals should be the initial conversation.

With respect to the silicon facet of the US-China trade war the Peterson Institute for International Economics asks rhetorically:

Would a more rational US strategy have been to keep China ‚Äòdependent‚Äô on American semiconductors? Suppose US firms had been permitted to sell all except the most sophisticated chips but the US government maintained its restrictions on sales to China of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and EDA [Electronic Design Automation] software. US semiconductor firms at least could have maintained the revenue and profits to continue to finance their own R&D without the need for federal subsidies. Without the foreign inputs Chinese manufacturers would have been unable to upgrade to the smaller and faster chips at the technological frontier than many using industries demand.

From the consumer‚Äôs perspective elevated tech prices due to ongoing shortages endure in many areas and will linger for some months. As has been reported in technology business and trade publications the price effects of the chip shortage are now beginning to manifest more broadly in personal computers. As of late June 2021

prices of popular models of some laptop consumers have crept up over the past two months among other electronics becoming expensive at retailers. A laptop geared toward videogamers‚Äìmade by Taiwanese manufacturer ASUSTek Computer Inc.‚Äìthat Amazon lists as its bestseller rose from $900 to $950 this month according to Keepa a site that tracks prices. The cost of a popular HP Inc. Chromebook rose to $250 from $220 at the beginning of June. HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and printer prices by more than 20% in a year.

Although one major retailer reported raising prices of goods with semiconductor-related components by 15% thus far in 2021 an executive commented ‚Äú[c]ertain components now cost as much as 40% more.‚Äù That even toasters now contain silicon chips is beginning to dawn on purchasers in some part due to sticker shock.

Back in the automobile markets profoundly unusual price aberrations have materialized. Recently the received wisdom that a new car immediately and irretrievably loses a chunk of its value when its rear tires leave the lot has been overthrown ‚Äì at least temporarily. Why?

[S]ome used cars and trucks are worth even more than they cost when they were new. What makes your Jeep Wrangler Subaru Ascent or Honda Civic worth more than it was when it was brand new a year ago is the simple fact that it exists. It is a car that has already been built at a time when there is enormous demand for cars and SUVs and not enough inventory to meet that demand [d]ue to disruptions in supplies of crucial computer chips.

Where traditionally a used car is priced on average 11% less than a comparable new car that average has now narrowed to about 3%. And in several cases used car prices eclipse those of new cars. As of last month a Kia Telluride sells for over 8% higher used than new. So too do GMC Sierras (over 6%) Toyota Tacomas (over 5%) and the Mercedes Benz G-Class (over 4%).

Other discomposing factors are lurking on the periphery threatening to compound existing semiconductor insufficiencies. Owing to the so-called Delta variant of Covid-19 lockdowns at several major Chinese shipping facilities (Shenzhen the third largest in the world and Guangzhou the fifth largest in the world) have resulted in waiting times for cargo ships to soar from twelve hours to sixteen days.

A highly technical discussion of how the dearth of chips may abate can be found here.

Inconclusive Conclusions

After carbon nitrogen oxygen and a handful of other elements upon which life itself is built silicon has been a particularly impactful element in human innovation. Tremendous bounds in productivity driven by incremental improvements in technology have driven inexorably higher levels of prosperity. In exquisitely engineered configurations it has made once inconceivable bounds in computation data analysis and management information transfer and a wide panoply of other advances not only possible but quotidian. Indeed it is sinfully easy to overlook the incredible union of physics engineering and economics that semiconductors contemplate and conflate their ubiquity with simplicity.

Early in 2020 predicting that the spread of a respiratory virus would lead to a scarcity of inputs that constitute the very backbone of all modern technology would have sounded ludicrous. But amid a hotchpotch of non-pharmaceutical state interventions geopolitical wrangling income redistribution sudden shifts in work patterns and the knock-on effects of those that has occurred and persists.

Fifty years ago this month Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor the 4004. Microprocessors are tiny general-purpose chips that use integrated circuits made up of transistors to process data; they are the core of a modern computer. Intel created the 12 mm2 chip for a printing calculator made by the Japanese company Busicom. The 4004 had 2300 transistors‚Äîa number dwarfed by the billions found in today‚Äôs chips. But the 4004 was leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors packing the computing power of the room-sized vacuum tube‚Äìbased first computers into a chip the size of a fingernail. In the past 50 years microprocessors have changed our culture and economy in unimaginable ways.

Here‚Äôs a look at the historic achievements in materials chemistry and electrical engineering that made the 4004 possible the subsequent advances that resulted in today‚Äôs computers and the cutting-edge technology that could lead to tomorrow‚Äôs devices.

Early days

Vacuum tubes

Early computers used vacuum tubes to serve as switches for digital logic calculations. These vacuum tubes consisted of metal electrodes inside a glass tube and could turn the current flowing through them on or off to create the necessary 1 and 0 states. Vacuum tubes were large power hungry and failure prone. The first electronic computer in the US the electronic numerical integrator and computer (ENIAC) booted up in 1945. The size of a room it used over 17000 vacuum tubes whose wiring had to be reconfigured for each new series of calculations.

Birth of the transistor

Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed an alternative to the vacuum tube in 1926: the transistor. He couldn‚Äôt build one at that time because researchers didn‚Äôt have access to the high-quality semiconductors that are the heart of the transistor. Transistors typically use three metal electrodes and a semiconducting channel. A gate electrode provides enough electrical energy to switch the channel between conducting and insulating states. When conducting current can flow between a source electrode and a drain. Like vacuum tubes these devices can switch between 1 and 0 by turning current on and off and they can amplify electrical signals. But they are more compact sturdy and energy efficient than vacuum tubes. The first transistor was made by a team at AT&T‚Äôs Bell Labs in 1947. It was a small slab of germanium addressed with two gold electrodes held in place by a plastic wedge. A voltage applied to one of the electrodes could modulate the current through the other.

The silicon transistor

Silicon transistors were more reliable and performed better than those made from germanium‚Äîparticularly at the high temperatures demanded in military applications which were some of the major early uses of computing. Texas Instruments announced in 1954 that it had come up with a way to work with silicon and by 1960 silicon had become the dominant transistor material. Like the Texas Instruments transistor shown here‚Äîthe first such silicon device sold commercially‚Äîearly transistors were individual components packed in metal cans with trailing wire connectors. Engineers built circuits from these individual digital switches.

Integrated circuits

The first integrated circuit which brought together multiple transistors on a single piece of germanium used so-called flying wires made of gold. Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments built the circuit in 1958. The industry would soon replace this design with flat integrated circuits that included electrical contacts within the same plane.

Metal-oxide semiconductor transistors

Another key ingredient to microprocessors as we know them today‚Äîand a crucial element of Intel‚Äôs first microprocessors‚Äîis the metal-oxide semiconductor transistor recipe. These transistors consist of layers of conductive metal contacts insulating oxides and semiconductors that use only one kind of charge carrier: either electrons or positively charged species called holes. Early transistors carried both kinds of charges and were faster. But metal-oxide semiconductor transistors used less energy and could be aggressively miniaturized.The microprocessor grows up

Moore‚Äôs law

In 1965 Intel cofounder Gordon Moore then at Fairchild Semiconductor predicted that the number of components on integrated circuits would double every year for 10 years. In 1975 he revised his law to state that components would double every 2 years. Continued innovations in semiconductor manufacturing over the ensuing decades have allowed the industry to match this prediction. In the 50 years since the Intel 4004 computer chips have become increasingly complex and densely packed with transistors and other components‚Äîwithout corresponding increases in size cost or energy use.

Widening wafers

To make integrated circuits today engineers start with thin slices of crystalline silicon called wafers and then repeatedly deposit materials and etch features onto them. They also add other elements to the silicon to change its electrical properties a process called doping. After those steps machines dice wafers into computer chips. One key way the semiconductor industry has kept costs down is by using larger and larger wafers to make more and more chips at once without adding process steps. Early wafers were just a few centimeters in size; chips now are mostly made on 300 mm discs. Wafers are sliced from pure single crystal ingots of silicon grown from molten solutions.

Copper interconnects

As important as transistors are to a microprocessor they‚Äôd be nothing without the minuscule metal wires that connect these switches. Circuits are faster and more efficient when these so-called interconnects are highly conductive and don‚Äôt heat up. Interconnects were initially made from aluminum. IBM introduced more-conductive copper wiring into its chips in 1997 after working out a fix to prevent copper ions from migrating into the surrounding silicon.

Strained silicon

The semiconductor industry made a lot of progress by cramming ever-greater numbers of ever-smaller transistors into circuits. But another way to boost chip performance is to make the individual switches faster. In 2002 Intel announced it could achieve this by putting the meat of its transistors‚Äîthe silicon channel through which electrical current flows when the transistor is on‚Äîunder mechanical strain. By adding materials adjacent to the channels that caused the silicon crystal to stretch apart or compress by about 1% Intel could boost current through the transistors and make the circuits faster.

FinFETs

As transistors got smaller chipmakers hit a wall. In smaller transistors it‚Äôs more challenging to fully turn off the flow of current so transistors that are supposed to be off can still leak current and waste power. This problem led the industry to switch to a new transistor design that wraps insulating material around three of four sides of a silicon channel sticking up from the wafer surface. Called FinFETs or Tri-gate transistors these devices were developed by researchers at the University of California Berkeley in the late 1990s; Intel was the first to adopt them commercially in 2011.

Gate-all-around transistors

One likely pathway for the semiconductor industry to continue miniaturizing chip components is the gate-all-around transistor which goes to the next logical step after the FinFET advance completely enveloping the silicon channel in an insulating material to further prevent leakage. This year IBM demonstrated highly miniaturized chips based on this technology.

Steve Ballmer the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. has a net worth of more than $100 billion making him the ninth person in the world to reach that lofty plateau. Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison fell just short of making it an even 10 ending Wednesday with a fortune of $98.6 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Ballmer 65 who stepped down as Microsoft‚Äôs CEO in 2014 and now owns the NBA‚Äôs Los Angeles Clippers has seen his wealth grow by $20.1 billion this year while Ellison has added $18.9 billion.

A rally in tech shares has fueled the latest surge in wealth with seven of those above the $100 billion mark deriving their fortunes from technology companies. Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs Jeff Bezos the world‚Äôs richest person has been among the biggest recipients of that rally and now has a record net worth of $212.1 billion.

Together the nine members of the club ‚Äî along with Ellison ‚Äî have added about $245 billion to their fortunes since the start of the year and are now collectively worth $1.36 trillion. In addition to being mostly technology chiefs the group is also largely American with French luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault the only exception.

While the stock rally has boosted the fortunes of the world‚Äôs richest it‚Äôs also renewed scrutiny of wealth inequality and taxes. Using leaked confidential tax return data news outlet ProPublica reported last month that Bezos Elon Musk and other top billionaires had paid little to no income tax in some years leading to calls from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat and others to reexamine the tax code.

President Joe Biden is pushing a broad of package of tax changes that aim to force the wealthy to hand over more of their money. He wants to double the capital gains tax to a top rate of 39.6% and toughen rules governing trusts estates and other vehicles often used by millionaires and billionaires to reduce their tax bills.

‚ÄúThe persistent lack of wealth for large shares of Americans is striking‚Äù said Kenan Fikri director of research at Economic Innovation Group a Washington-based think tank started by tech entrepreneurs including Napster Inc. co-founder Sean Parker. ‚ÄúMarkets are reaching historic highs but far too few people see any direct economic benefit from it.‚Äù

Ballmer‚Äôs taxes were cited in a ProPublica story Thursday that showed how billionaires use ownership of sports teams to lower their tax obligation. The Clippers owner made $656 million in 2018 and paid $78 million in taxes a federal income tax rate of 12% much lower than the team‚Äôs star players or arena workers.

Propublica which cited Internal Revenue Service documents said a spokesperson for Ballmer declined to answer specific questions. The spokesperson told the news outlet that the billionaire has always ‚Äúpaid the taxes he owes and has publicly noted that he would personally be fine with paying more.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRyYWRlbWFnLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXR3aW4tbWFya2V0LXRvcC1pbXBhY3RmdWwtdHJlbmRzLWZvc3RlcmluZy10aGUtaW5kdXN0cnktZ3Jvd3RoLXRocm91Z2gtMjAyNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Twin Market: Top Impactful Trends Fostering the Industry Growth through 2026,"Graphical Research

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.



Linsalata a Mayfield Heights Ohio-based private equity firm sold Paramount Global Surfaces out of its Miami-based portfolio company Happy Floors which serves more than 6000 independent dealer customers throughout the United States.



Paramount Global serves some of the fastest growing segments of the floor covering market as consumer preferences shift toward tile and luxury vinyl tile products according to a Platinum Equity statement. Other economic influences were also a factor in Platinum Equity‚Äôs decision to pursue the deal.



‚ÄúCovid and demographic trends are also driving a shift in consumer lifestyle that is stimulating increased new home construction and renovation activity and we anticipate the impact of these tailwinds will be felt for years to come‚Äù said Platinum Equity Partner Jacob Kotzubei.



Paramount Global is an importer and distributor of ceramic and porcelain tile used in residential and commercial flooring applications in higher-end tile segments.

The acquisition leverages Platinum Equity‚Äôs expertise in the building products sector where it has been an active player.

The study looks ahead at the years 2021‚Äì2025 forecasting global industry revenue to bounce back 6.5 percent this year ‚Äúas more territories emerge from lockdown‚Äù and a further 6.7 percent in 2022. ‚ÄúFrom 2020 to 2025 we project a healthy five-year compound annual growth rate of 5.0 percent taking revenues to $2.6 trillion‚Äù PwC finds.

The firm forecasts streaming or OTT video to reach $94 billion by the end of 2025 up 60 percent. That includes spending on subscription (more than $81 billion) and transactional (nearly $13 billion) video on demand. But with economies opening up again after the pandemic and competition for time and money some consumers may become more selective about their entertainment services including some streaming products PwC principal CJ Bangah tells The Hollywood Reporter.

‚ÄúAs consumer attention is going to get more and more fragmented and folks go back outside that $5.99 that they may have been willing to spend or $7.99 on the fourth or fifth streaming service or that cable subscription may get reviewed‚Äù Bangah says. ‚ÄúConsumers are going to take a fresh look at where their money is going and in some cases make different decisions. So being in the top 1 2 3 kind of sources of entertainment and media consumption that really are adding value.‚Äù

In the U.S. 2020 media and entertainment industry revenue fell 4.5 percent from $717 billion to $685 billion but it will consistently grow to reach $855 billion in 2025 after getting to nearly $724 billion in 2021 PwC projects. Excluding access services the sector will for the 2020-2025 period hit a compound annual growth rate of more than 4 percent to reach $624 billion.

But the global cinema industry including box office revenue is facing a slow return to pre-pandemic levels that will take several years according to the forecast. And many shifts in consumer mindset and behavior that started or accelerated in 2020 will take years to play out.

‚ÄúA global recession the first since 2009 and only the second since 1944 is being followed by a rapid but highly asymmetrical snapback‚Äù PwC noted about the worldwide fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

The most notable and global driver of industry change is the rise of digital consumption. ‚ÄúHistorically rising digitization was a challenge as analog dollars were frequently replaced by digital dimes‚Äù PwC noted. ‚ÄúBut in 2020 consumers‚Äô embrace of all things digital helped offset sharp revenue losses across the broader global E&M sector.‚Äù

When it comes to global advertising revenue dollars are following eyeballs with PwC forecasting a 6.5 percent compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2025 driven by digital spending gains. ‚ÄúInternet ads follow attention and commerce‚Äù the report stated. ‚ÄúInternet advertising thought to be entering a period of slower growth has been buoyed by the rapid global adoption of e-commerce.‚Äù

Meanwhile the PwC report notes that ‚Äúthe music industry which many analysts believed had been left behind by the digital era is enjoying a renaissance spurred by strong growth in digital streaming and a strong rebound in live performances.‚Äù

And ‚Äúvirtual reality is doing extremely well‚Äù Bangah notes. ‚ÄúGaming including e-sports is doing extremely well too.‚Äù

But will people return to multiplexes and other shared entertainment experiences in huge numbers following the pandemic? ‚ÄúThere are tensions between protecting populations and maintaining people‚Äôs economic and psychological wellbeing including the freedom to enjoy collective E&M experiences‚Äù PwC stated while urging: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt write off the blockbuster.‚Äù

Bangah adds: ‚ÄúWe do expect some of the big blockbusters that are coming out over the summer and into the fall are going to help the industry have significantly healthier revenue this year. But looking ahead cinema growth is so closely correlated to vaccination status so cinema is going to take a few years to dig out of that very stark decline that we saw last year with consumers either being unable or unwilling to go to theaters given the risk profile. We are not forecasting cinema returning to 2019 revenue levels until 2024.‚Äù

Indeed PwC calculates total cinema revenue including advertising fell from $44.4 billion in 2019 to $13.1 billion in 2020 and will grow to $25.4 billion this year and nearly $45.2 billion in 2024. Within that it forecasts global box office revenue of $23.0 billion in 2021 after $11.8 billion in 2020 down from $40.7 billion in 2019 and a climb back to $41.6 billion in 2024.

In North America PwC projects box office revenue will recover from less than $2.3 billion in 2020 after $11.4 billion in 2019 to $4.9 billion this year and eventually $11.1 billion in 2025. For the U.S. alone PwC projects box office revenue to recover at a 37.3 percent compound annual growth rate over the forecast period to $10.4 billion in 2025 or 2.6 below the 2019 total of $10.7 billion.

While traditional film consumption methods were affected by the pandemic traditional TV‚Äôs challenges may have also been underlined by it as consumers stuck at home gravitated towards the internet and streaming services hitting TV viewership and advertising. Competition from online advertising is just part of the reason with demographics particularly younger people using streaming and other digital services more also playing a role.

PwC‚Äôs Global Entertainment and Media Outlook predicts that broadcast TV revenue will not recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 by which time online and connected TV advertising revenue will contribute a combined $22.6 billion to the global industry just $1 billion less than multichannel TV advertising.

And Bangah tells THR that marketers are looking to get the balance right in various ways these days. ‚ÄúThere are a few things that marketers are doing differently when you look at everything that‚Äôs happened over the last 18 months. Not only have we had the pandemic we have had heightened focus on social justice equity and inclusion and we have had a lot more focus on corporate responsibility including environmental social and government pressures.‚Äù

So not only are marketers focused on getting brand messages out but also on advocating for their brand in a way that is authentic and showcases purpose. Bangah adds: ‚ÄúI think we are gonna see more fluidity in the way marketers are managing their spend and making decisions on how they approach the market and who they are willing to partner with.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9maWxtL2FtYXpvbi1pbi10YWxrcy13aXRoLWNocmlzLXByYXR0LWZvci10aGUtdG9tb3Jyb3ctd2FyLXNlcXVlbC0yOTkwMDY40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon in talks with Chris Pratt for 'The Tomorrow War' sequel,"Amazon is currently in talks with Chris Pratt for a sequel to its sci-fi war movie The Tomorrow War it is being reported.

If you want to understand more about Stripe‚Äôs business model keep following up.

A brief history of Stripe

Stripe is a young company founded in 2010 by two also young prodigies: the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison. Patrick at only 16 was awarded the Young Scientist of the Year (for his work on Lisp programming language). He also had to leave high school earlier in order to attend his Computer Science classes at MIT. On his side John has the record of the highest score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (the last examination to qualify for university) and entered Harvard University for Computer Science too another Ivy League institution.

At the beginning of his freshman year (2007) Patrick and John founded Auctomatic an auction management system for marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. Auctomatic joined the winter batch of Y Combinator a seed money startup accelerator. Some months later the company would be acquired by Live Current Media for $5 mi ‚Äî and Patrick became its Head of Product Engineering ‚Äî at 19 years old. At that time John was entering Harvard. The next year John dropped out of Harvard and the two brothers started Stripe. Stripe‚Äôs first funding could not come from any other place than Y Combinator ‚Äî actually by its founder Paul Graham who previously knew Patrick.

A little long later the brothers met Peter Thiel and Elon Musk founders of PayPal. The result was an investment of $2 million and great insights and orientation according to Patrick. Stripe was finally launched in September 2011 and five months later raised another round of funding ‚Äî $18 mi from Sequoia Capital with participation from Affirm and PayPal.

In the following years Stripe would expand its operation and product line and its first clients included names like Lyft and Wish. In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic forced traditional companies to adapt to online sales boosting Stripe‚Äôs path which increased its valuation from $20 bi in 2019 to $95 bi the next year. Currently Stripe works with more than one million businesses all over the world and employs over 4000 people.

Who Owns Stripe

Stripe is still owned by its founders the brothers Patrick and John Collison with Patrick holding the position of the company‚Äôs CEO and John as the President.

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr. (vs.$2.3B/qtr. cons.) for the remainder of this year‚Äù noted Daniel T. Fannon equity analyst at Jefferies.

Photo: Sarah Silbiger/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla apologized to him for not giving health officials advance notice that the company would seek an authorization for a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine. The big picture: After Pfizer's announcement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration published a joint statement saying Americans do not need boosters yet.

""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time"" the CDC and FDA wrote in the statement.

Driving the news: Blitzer asked Fauci about concerns over a ""lack of coordination"" between the federal government and vaccine companies following the communication mishap.

""We are on the same page"" Fauci told Blitzer. ""They came out with the announcement without giving us a heads up.""

""Quite frankly the CEO who is a really good guy got on the phone with me last night and apologized ... for not letting us know that he was going to do it ahead of time.""

Of note: Fauci reiterated Friday that individuals who have received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson do not need to get a booster.

""The FDA CDC and NIH are now gathering information through clinical studies and laboratory studies to determine if and when we might need boosters. But that's not right now.""

Go deeper: Pfizer to seek FDA authorization for third dose of coronavirus vaccine",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLW1lZGljYWwubmV0L25ld3MvMjAyMTA3MTEvUGZpemVyLUJpb05UZWNoZTI4MDk5cy1DT1ZJRC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1hbmQtc2FmZS1mb3ItdXNlLWFtb25nLWNhbmNlci1wYXRpZW50cy5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine effective and safe for use among cancer patients,"Researchers in Israel have conducted a study showing that the use of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine appears to be safe and effective among patients with cancer.

‚ÄúTo our knowledge this study is the first to prospectively characterize the serologic status immunogenicity and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a cohort of patients with solid tumors who are receiving active anticancer therapies‚Äù writes the team from the Rambam Health Care Campus the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and the Technion-Integrated Cancer Center in Haifa.

While the efficacy and safety profiles of COVID-19 vaccines have previously been demonstrated in phase 3 studies the team says patients with cancer were not adequately represented in these trials.

‚ÄúOwing to the recommendation to prioritize high-risk populations for vaccination further data are warranted‚Äù says Irit Ben-Aharon and colleagues.

As reported in JAMA Oncology the team‚Äôs prospective cohort study of more than 230 cancer patients found that administration of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs BNT162b2 vaccine appeared to be safe and achieved satisfactory levels of antibodies (seropositivity) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ‚Äì the causative agent of COVID-19.

Although there was a pronounced lag in antibody production among the cancer group compared with among healthy controls seroconversion occurred in most cancer patients following the second dose and any adverse events reported resembled those reported among healthy individuals.

Cancer patients may be at risk of more severe COVID-19

Some studies have shown that patients with cancer may be at risk for more severe COVID-19 with metastatic cancer hematologic malignant neoplasms and lung cancer reported as the major risk factors.

However other studies have reported no such additional risk among cancer patients compared with the general population.

Regulatory agencies approved the BNT162b2 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech based on a phase 2/3 trial of more than 43500 participants who received two doses of the vaccine separated by a 21-day interval.

However ‚Äúalthough cancer had not been an exclusion criterion in the trials the use of cytotoxic therapy or systemic corticosteroids throughout the study were considered as such in the pioneer study‚Äù says Ben-Aharon and colleagues.

Mass immunization with BNT162b2 began in Israel in January 2021

In December 2020 the vaccine was approved for use in Israel and a mass immunization program was initiated on January 10th 2021. Healthcare workers and high-risk populations including patients with cancer were prioritized as the first in line for vaccination.

‚ÄúAlthough real-world data regarding vaccine effectiveness are emerging depicting a positive outcome in the general population there is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety in the population of patients with cancer‚Äù say the researchers.

Despite this lack of data several professional organizations have recommended vaccination of patients with cancer with guidelines encompassing all cancer patient populations irrespective of treatment type adds the team.

What did the researchers do?

As mass vaccination of high-risk populations was launched in Israel from January 10th 2021 the researchers enrolled and followed up vaccinated cancer patients during their routine visits to the Division of Oncology of Rambam Health Care Campus between January 15th and March 14th 2021.

The study cohort included 232 patients with solid tumors who were receiving active treatment following a first or second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine and 261 age-matched healthcare workers who served as controls.

Serum samples were collected after each vaccine dose and questionnaires were administered regarding sociodemographic factors and adverse reactions.

A regulatory agency-approved assay was used to assess anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in samples collected before the second dose (more than 10 days after the first dose) and in samples collected 14 days after the second dose.

What did the study find?

Of the 232 patients receiving cancer treatment 132 were men (57%) and the mean age was 66 years (age range 25 to 88).

Of the 261 control participants 118 were men (45%) and the mean age was 59 years (age range 25 to 81).

Most of the patients (74%) had metastatic disease and the most common cancers were gastrointestinal (27%) genitourinary (21%) lung (19%) and breast (18%).

The treatment protocols being followed were chemotherapy among 58% biological agents (35%) and immunotherapy (36%) with some patients receiving more than one treatment type.

After the first vaccine dose 29% of the cancer patients were seropositive compared with 84% of the controls.

However seroconversion occurred at higher rates in the cancer cohort following the second dose with the seropositivity rate reaching 86%.

The adverse events reported by cancer patients were similar to those previously reported by healthy individuals.

What did the authors conclude?

The team says that the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to be safe with satisfactory levels of seropositivity in patients undergoing treatment for cancer although protection may occur later compared with healthy individuals.

The researchers also say the results imply that a potential intention to decline a second vaccine by some jurisdictions owing to a shortage of vaccines warrants reevaluation of unique populations such as patients with cancer in view of lagging immunogenicity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXBmaXplci1ib29zdGVyLWNvbmZ1c2lvbi1zYW5kb3ZhbC1uZHdrbmQtcGtnLXZweC5jbm7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Fauci weighs in on confusion surrounding Pfizer‚Äôs Covid-19 booster,"1.

Videos spreading widely on Instagram and Twitter on Thursday touted a report from Spain that allegedly claimed to find graphene oxide ‚Äî a material made by oxidizing graphite ‚Äî in a vial of the Pfizer shot.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other reason for this to be in here except to murder people‚Äù said a woman in one of the videos.

The woman also baselessly claimed the compound would cause an inflammatory immune reaction called a cytokine storm in people who got the vaccine.

In reality there‚Äôs no graphene oxide in the Pfizer vaccine according to the ingredient list and Kit Longley senior manager of science media relations at Pfizer.

There‚Äôs also no evidence to suggest the Pfizer vaccine would cause a cytokine storm Longley said. The coronavirus itself however has caused this type of immune response in some patients.

Chemical and medical experts who are not associated with Pfizer confirmed to The Associated Press that there is no way graphene oxide would be found in the vaccine.

‚ÄúIt is not in the ingredient list and there is no way it could be present‚Äù said Allen Myerson a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

‚ÄúUtter nonsense‚Äù said Dr. Paul Offit a vaccine expert at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia.

There has been research on potentially using graphene oxide in other vaccines but the amounts would not be toxic to human cells according to Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh Adalja.

The report cited in some of the viral posts lists Spain‚Äôs University of Almeria on its title page and appears to be written by a professor at the university.

The university has said it was not involved in research indicating the presence of graphene in the vaccine.

The university added in a statement that it supports vaccines and disavows the conclusions of the professor‚Äôs unofficial report.

The report has not been peer reviewed and is not published in a scientific journal. It includes a disclaimer that its findings do not represent any institutional position of the university."

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor‚Äôs race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld‚Äôs request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present ‚Äúany persuasive arguments‚Äù supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he‚Äôs out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America‚Äôs ‚Äú10 Cushiest Prisons‚Äù by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform ‚Äúofficial acts‚Äù and ‚Äúdeliver the votes‚Äù to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

‚ÄúThis was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment‚Äù federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

‚ÄúSittenfeld‚Äôs actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even ‚Äúpolitics as usual‚Äù‚Äîthis is corruption.‚Äù

Sittenfeld‚Äôs federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a ‚Äúquid pro quo.‚Äù

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld‚Äôs lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld‚Äôs appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn‚Äôt show clear and precise proof of corruption the ‚Äúquid pro quo.‚Äù

If Sittenfeld‚Äôs convictions are allowed to stand it would bring ‚Äúa First Amendment Ice Age‚Äù where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

‚ÄúThe government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting‚Äôs chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support‚Äù his appeal states.

‚ÄúYet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.‚Äù

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld‚Äôs appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld‚Äôs case they wrote ‚Äúhas two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld‚Äôs conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSecond the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct‚Ä¶The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.‚Äù

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn‚Äôt developed into one since. He‚Äôs generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn‚Äôt score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell‚Äôs ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that‚Äôs while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell‚Äôs quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he‚Äôs able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He‚Äôs even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren‚Äôt used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell‚Äôs signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Wilma Plaster was lonely after her husband died and was delighted to make a new friend. Tragically that new friend would end her life.

Con Artist Kills And Dismembers Pastor‚Äôs Wife ‚Äî Did She Do The Same Thing To Her Mother?

People liked Shirley Jo Phillips. She was energetic good-looking and charming. She was also a thief and a con artist. Even her family would tell you so.

How to Watch Watch Snapped on Oxygen Sundays 6/5c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.

‚ÄúMy mother always said ‚ÄòYour aunt‚Äôs a kleptomaniac. She can‚Äôt come in the house without stealing something'"" Phillips‚Äô nephew Jack Jackson told ‚ÄúSnapped‚Äù airing Sundays at 6/5c on Oxygen.

Shirley Jo Phillips was born in 1936. She was briefly married which resulted in a son Glenn ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Minster born in 1959 afterward raising him as a single mom. Jackson said Phillips had a ‚Äúcombative‚Äù relationship with her own mother Lela Kyle. Kyle cast a disapproving eye on her daughter‚Äôs lifestyle and blamed her for the hardships she suffered.

In 1984 Phillips‚Äô family noticed a change in her as she became distant. ‚ÄúShe barely looked at me. Wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. I even commented to my grandmother I said ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the deal with Aunt Shirley?‚Äô and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄòYour aunt just changed in a bad way'"" Jackson told producers.

Shirley Jo Phillips

Phillips had become a con artist stealing from men she hooked up with and selling their belongings.

‚ÄúShe usually chose men but when men no longer availed themselves she looked for other people and when she found somebody she took them for everything she could‚Äù nephew Mickey Jackson Jr. told ‚ÄúSnapped.‚Äù

In 1989 Phillips met 66-year-old Wilma Plaster. Daughter Linda Baker said her mother was an easy target.

‚ÄúI think she realized how lonely Mom was because Shirley Phillips popped in there and she told her what she wanted to hear‚Äù Baker producers.

Wilma Plaster

Wilma Plaster was born in Ozark County Missouri in 1923. She met her future husband Layton at church when she was 15. He later became a pastor and church and family were at the center of Plaster‚Äôs life. She was a doting mother and grandmother.

Tragically in 1984 Layton was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Five months later he was dead. His death hit Plaster hard. She was able to get through the grieving process with the help of Janice Cook a fellow widow and friend from church.

But then on October 3 1989 Plaster‚Äôs children became concerned when they couldn‚Äôt get ahold of her and three days later a woman driving home from work in Springfield Missouri pulled over when she saw several bags strewn about the side of the road. Inside one were garden shears a knife and paper towels all covered in blood. Others contained a human torso and head.

Dental records confirmed the victim was Wilma Plaster. The cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head by a .38 caliber bullet according to court documents. The medical examiner concluded Plaster was murdered on Oct. 3.

Police searched Plaster‚Äôs home and determined the knife and garden shears found with her body parts came from her home. Her car was missing and her garage appeared to have been recently cleaned. Crime scene investigators sprayed the area with luminol.

‚ÄúThe crime lab found blood residue there. A lot of blood. We felt like the actual decapitation and body dismemberment occurred in the garage of Wilma‚Äôs house‚Äù former Springfield Police Detective David Asher told producers.

Plaster‚Äôs neighbors told detectives that on the night of Oct. 3 they heard a loud noise possibly a gunshot at around 10:30 according to court documents. Neighbors also recalled seeing an unknown silver car pulling into the garage.

Detectives spoke with Janice Cook and asked if Plaster had any close friends she thought they should talk to. Cook said she had a brand new friend she met line dancing. Her name was Shirley Jo Phillips.

‚ÄúMom was excited about having a new friend. Janice had started dating somebody and had kind of moved on from their relationship and she was sort of alone. Shirley kind of stepped in and filled the gap‚Äù Plaster‚Äôs son Dr. Mark Plaster told ‚ÄúSnapped.‚Äù

Plaster and Phillips had been friends for less than a month. When asked what kind of car Phillips drove Cook said she drove a silver Cadillac.

On October 10 Phillips‚Äô friend Nora Martin contacted police. She said Phillips visited her the day before. Upon her arrival Phillips insisted they take their cars to get washed and diligently vacuumed and washed her car several times. That night while watching the evening news the two women saw a report on Plaster‚Äôs murder. Phillips became visibly upset and said her fingerprints were all over Plaster‚Äôs home.

After Phillips left Martin found several bags hidden under her porch. They contained cleaning materials bank documents and checks belonging to Plaster and a .38 caliber revolver that later matched to Plaster‚Äôs gunshot wound according to court documents.

The gun was registered to Plaster's son Buddy Minster. Detectives questioned him but found he had an alibi.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been in jail off and on he went to prison. He‚Äôd break into a place but violence murder? My cousin wasn‚Äôt like that‚Äù Jackson told producers.

Investigators also discovered a canceled check of Plaster‚Äôs made out to Phillips in the amount of $4050.00 according to court documents. At the time of her death Plaster‚Äôs bank account had been almost completely drained.

Before they could bring her in Phillips showed up at the police station. She‚Äôd heard investigators wanted to talk to her and submitted a handwriting sample.

Phillips denied having anything to do with Plaster‚Äôs murder and claimed the money was to pay for furniture. She said she had last seen Plaster leaving the hotel bar at a Ramada Inn in Springfield where Plaster‚Äôs car was later found. However the handwriting sample got her into trouble.

‚ÄúFrom the handwriting samples the calligrapher determined that the check for $4050 was not signed by Wilma Plaster. That was not her handwriting and was confirmed as being Shirley‚Äôs‚Äù Asher told police.

Phillips was detained on suspicion of check forgery. When investigators searched her car they found traces of blood in the trunk according to court documents.

On October 12 1989 Shirley Jo Phillips was arrested and charged with murder in the first degree according to a 1989 report from the Tulsa World newspaper.

Three weeks later the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation contacted detectives in Springfield about the disappearance of Phillips‚Äô mother Lela Kyle. She had gone missing the previous spring.

‚ÄúWe were contacted by Broken Arrow Oklahoma in reference to nine pounds of human flesh they had recovered at a roadside park‚Äù Asher told producers. ‚ÄúThis was recovered back on or about Mother's Day of that year and what it was was four fingers of a left hand a part of an upper lip a nose an ear and other body parts.‚Äù

After hearing of Phillips‚Äô arrest her sister Wanda Lou Moorer reported their mother missing. Authorities ultimately identified the body parts as belonging to Kyle The Oklahoman reported at the time.

Phillips was never charged for her mother‚Äôs murder but she ended up behind bars regardless for Plaster's killing.

Shirley Jo Phillips was found guilty of first-degree murder in February 1992. That April she was sentenced to death but in 1998 Phillips‚Äô death sentence was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole according to the Southeast Missourian newspaper. Now 84 Phillips is currently incarcerated at Chillicothe Correctional Center a women‚Äôs prison in Missouri.

The estate formerly owned by Jane Fonda has four miles of river running through it. It‚Äôs muddy at the moment he says but on a good day a fly fisherman can easily pull out 20 or so rainbow trout. It is a dreamy-sounding place with pine-covered cliffs and roving elk.

The last time your columnist spoke to Mr Sheffield five years ago the co-founder and boss of Pioneer Natural Resources was the Permian‚Äôs greatest free-market evangelist. It was the heyday of the shale revolution. Pioneer was in the middle of a drilling bonanza that pushed its oil output up by an average of 15-20% a year for a decade. All the money it earned it reinvested into fracking even more shale wells. Mr Sheffield was fond of comparing the Permian with Ghawar Saudi Arabia‚Äôs biggest oilfield.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The pool across Don Mattingly Way from Bosse Field cost nearly $30 million to build with funding from various public and private sources.

It is expected to open by September in time for high school swimming season. Girls teams start practice on Oct. 25 boys on Nov. 8.

After using the deteriorating Lloyd Pool for many years high school teams are excited to jump into their new pool said Andy Owen Evansville Vanderburgh School Corp. athletic director.

Lloyd Pool is plagued by old technology and a lack of spectator seating Owen said. Deaconess Aquatic Center will take care of both of those problems.

The competition pool features a huge scoreboard sponsored by Berry Global and seating for 992 with overflow also available.

The competition area has translucent panels which will allow natural light to filter in without causing a reflection on the pool. The competition pool has 10 north-south racing lanes and 28 east-west racing lanes.

There are four springboard diving boards.

Owen said Deaconess Aquatic Center ""will really grow the sport"" of swimming and all five EVSC high schools will use it. ""The kids will be excited. Facilities matter.""

The Evansville Sports Corp. says the pool will be used for college competitions as well including the NCAA Division II swimming and diving national championships in 2026.

The recreation side of the new building meanwhile has play features for child swimmers and areas set aside for swim lessons and lap swimming. The whole facility is accessible for people with differing abilities.

There's also an outdoor splash pad with entry from the inside. A concession window can be accessed from inside and outside. A room can be rented for birthday parties or other functions.

Deaconess Aquatic Center will have a wall of champions with interactive features about Evansville swimming history and yes there will be a prominent tribute to Olympic gold medalist Lilly King.

Cost schedules for recreation swimming and other uses aren't set yet.

""That will be a decision for us and the YMCA which will manage the facility"" said Brian Holtz director of Evansville Parks & Recreation.

Holtz joked that completing the Deaconess Aquatic Center project ""has taken a couple months off my life"" but he's glad to see the construction winding down.

The facility covers 75000 square feet. It was designed by Hafer. Garmong Construction Services is managing the project.

The pools recently were filled and then drained which officials said is part of the process to make sure all the systems are working.

""The next time we fill both pools it will be for good"" said Dan Alcorn project manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Youth Congress hits Keystone State corporations for lack of LGBTQ support ‚Ä¢ Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"By Jason Villemez

PHILADELPHIA ‚ÄîIn June as corporations donned rainbow merchandise and updated their logos for Pride the Pennsylvania Youth Congress was sending a message: companies who celebrate Pride month must do more to help pass LGBTQ nondiscrimination legislation in Harrisburg and if they don‚Äôt they will be called out.

‚ÄúCorporations and leaders that use LGBTQ people as marketing props through rainbow-themed marketing campaigns or press events without taking any meaningful action to fight for us or use their political capital to address the urgent issues of our time will no longer have our support‚Äù the organization said in a statement. ‚ÄúThere are many large businesses operating in Pennsylvania that claim to support LGBTQ inclusion yet have refused to support or chosen to remain silent on the civil rights of LGBTQ people.‚Äù

Various iterations of the Fairness Act which would provide protections for LGBTQ people statewide against discrimination in housing employment and public accommodations have been introduced in Harrisburg for decades but none have passed.

The most recent bill was reintroduced last month by state Rep. Dan Frankel D-Allegheny. However the Republican-led legislature specifically the committee on state government where the Fairness Act has been referred is unlikely to bring the bill up for debate or a vote.

The companies called out by PYC for refusing to publicly support the Fairness Act include Wawa Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods QVC and Chewy. When the Philadelphia Gay News contacted the four companies Wawa reiterated its support for LGBTQ employees but did not take a position on the legislation while the latter three did not return requests for comment.

In most regions of Pennsylvania an employee can work for an LGBTQ-friendly business but still be denied housing or public accommodations when they are not in their workplace. Local nondiscrimination laws only cover around 3 percent of Pennsylvania‚Äôs 2562 municipalities leaving LGBTQ people in large swaths of the state without legal protections.

The PYC campaign calls to light the difference between supporting LGBTQ employees only in the workplace or supporting them in their full lives.

‚ÄúSeveral companies operating in Pennsylvania have made the decision to adorn their social media in rainbows or invest thousands of dollars in colorful seasonal apparel yet decline to publicly back the most basic of civil rights for LGBTQ people‚Äù the PYC said in its statement. ‚ÄúThese companies want credit for supporting LGBTQ people and the money of those who support us without doing the work. Many of them think if they throw up a Pride flag they never have to use their political social and financial capital to actually stand with LGBTQ people‚Ä¶. How can companies claim to be LGBTQ allies when they are refusing to publicly state that LGBTQ people should be treated with dignity and respect under the law?‚Äù

In addition to calling out the businesses refusing to support the Fairness Act PYC which is the only statewide LGBTQ youth advocacy organization also recognized the businesses which have signed on in support of it including Hershey PPG Industries PNC and Erie Insurance. Since PYC launched the Pennsylvania Values campaign to coordinate public support and pressure the General Assembly to pass a nondiscrimination bill over 65 businesses have signed on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The bank has hired Yeeshu Kumar as the founding principal of its fixed income derivatives trading business. Kumar is relocating to Sydney after spending the last three years working in Hong Kong as a director at HSBC where he was a director in US dollar swaps and treasuries trading. Prior to that Kumar spent seven years in London with UBS according to his LinkedIn profile.

This follows the recruitment in March by Barrenjoey of Sean Larcombe as founding partner head of trading and client execution from Citi in Hong Kong.

Since its foundation last September Barrenjoey which is partly owned by Barclays and Magellan financial group has been hoovering up talent and now has grown to 220 staff.

Barenjoey‚Äôs aggressive expansion along with hiring by Jarden Australia has created a massive recruitment wave in the Australian sector but the hires of Larcombe and Kumar show that the ripple has now reached Hong Kong.

Kumar‚Äôs old UBS links may have been a factor in his move. Barrenjoey has staffed up by poaching the Swiss bank‚Äôs top talent in Sydney and in April it hired Matthew Grounds the former head of UBS in Australia and its top rainmaker as executive co-chairman.

Barrenjoey operates four lines of businesses ‚Äì corporate finance equities research and fixed income. On its website the bank says it offers global coverage of fixed income through its partnership with Barclays which in turn sees its investment in Barrenjoey as a way of rebuilding its presence across the Asia-Pacific region after it pulled back four years ago.

Barrenjoey did not return a request for comment.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%).

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."
PGR,Progressive Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2pvZS1iaWRlbi1oZWFsdGgtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtcG9saXRpY3Mtb2hpby1lbGVjdGlvbi0yMDIwLTdlNzEzODY0OWRkZjY5ZWY2NjA3OGM3NjBjYjU2NDk20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democratic primary in Ohio emerges as test for progressives,"CLEVELAND (AP) ‚Äî Amid relentless sunshine and intensifying humidity Nina Turner led a small procession of voters last week to a polling place on Cleveland‚Äôs east side guiding the group down a long block to the crosswalk even though darting across the street would have been easier.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want you breaking the law‚Äù an aide admonished. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go down to the light.‚Äù

Turner built a national reputation as a leading voice for Bernie Sanders‚Äô presidential campaigns bringing crowds in packed auditoriums to their feet with rousing calls for universal health care and bold action to combat climate change. But as she faces an election of her own next month Turner is focused on more mundane aspects of campaigning like avoiding jaywalking as she encourages supporters to vote and offering reassurances that her brand of politics still has a place in the Democratic Party.

‚ÄúSomething I can add whether mainline Democrats get this or not is I can speak the language of people from all walks of life‚Äù Turner said in an interview. ‚ÄùThat is important for the expansion of the Democratic Party.‚Äù

Turner is the best known of more than a dozen Democrats vying to replace former Rep. Marcia Fudge who left Congress to become President Joe Biden‚Äôs housing chief. The Aug. 3 primary is shaping up as one of the final tests this year for progressives who have faced setbacks in other races including Democratic primaries for Virginia governor and New York mayor.

With just a six-seat advantage in the House some Democrats are taking aggressive steps to blunt Turner and back more centrist alternatives.

House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn the highest-ranking Black member of Congress whose support helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination last year is backing county councilwoman Shontel Brown over Turner. Hillary Clinton the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus several leading unions and more than 100 local leaders are doing the same.

Federal rules prohibit Fudge from endorsing in the race but her mother appeared in a commercial for Brown.

While the contest is emerging as a proxy for the future of the Democratic Party local leaders say voters are more worried about issues like creating jobs addressing crime and improving access to health care which remains elusive for many despite Cleveland‚Äôs high concentration of major hospital chains.

‚ÄúPeople are trying to make this like it‚Äôs moderate versus progressive. I don‚Äôt see it that way‚Äù said Cleveland Councilman Blaine Griffin who has endorsed Turner but is friends with everyone running. He added that regardless of ideology no one ‚Äúlikes poverty speeding cars down the street bad roads or bridges.‚Äù

The district is shaped like a hatchet with an oversize head snaking from Cleveland to Akron nearly 40 miles to the south. The population is 53% African American and nearly a quarter of residents live in poverty. The winner of the primary in the solidly blue district will likely cruise to victory in November‚Äôs general election.

A 53-year-old community college professor Turner served on the Cleveland City Council was a state senator and ran unsuccessfully for Ohio secretary of state before crisscrossing the country with Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 presidential bids.

Her signature phrase ‚ÄúHello somebody!‚Äù became a campaign fixture prompting crowds across the country to yell back with delight. But those who worked with Turner years ago in Cleveland remember her for another catchphrase ‚ÄúDo you feel me?‚Äù which she first used addressing audiences of otherwise unresponsive young people.

As she talks to voters Turner explains her support for universal health insurance coverage under ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù by pointing to the experience of her mother who was uninsured and died when she was just 42. Turner also says she wants student debt eradicated because she knows its sting: She and her son owe nearly $100000 combined in loans she‚Äôs still paying off.

But the hard-fought presidential primary between Biden and Sanders has left some lingering resentments. The advocacy group Democratic Majority for Israel has produced ads seizing on Turner once likening supporting Biden to being forced to eat excrement.

Brown has pointed to such moments to argue that she will be able to accomplish far more far quicker in Washington.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to start with a long letter of apology‚Äù Brown said from her campaign office in a onetime pet store. ‚ÄúI can just walk in the door with good relationships and get to work on behalf of the constituents.‚Äù

The Rev. Aaron Phillips executive director of the Cleveland Clergy Coalition blames Sanders and Turner for so dividing Democrats which he says helped Republican Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016.

Brown meanwhile ‚Äúhas been a faithful Democrat all of her life‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúShe has never varied.‚Äù

Turner says she remains a proud progressive. And while some like-minded candidates haven‚Äôt won their races lately she said they are nonetheless ‚Äúmoving the narrative in this country.‚Äù The cargo van that serves as her mobile campaign office is emblazoned with the slang phrase ‚Äúcorporate Democrat want a puppet.‚Äù

As Turner briefly hung out in the van‚Äôs shade after the walk to the polling place Sam Cooke‚Äôs ‚ÄúEverybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha‚Äù blared over the speakers and she started dancing.

‚ÄúI can do this. But no singing‚Äù she said laughing. ‚ÄúThere are people with that talent. I am not one of them.‚Äù

The Rev. Regis Bunch of Cleveland‚Äôs Fifth Christian Church said Turner makes personal connections with voters and insisted most aren‚Äôt scared away by big progressive goals which he said ‚Äúare not as far off as many believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need something more wide than this liberal paradigm we‚Äôve been living in‚Äù said Bunch 34 who said he supported Sanders in the primary and only voted for Biden last fall ‚Äúby force.‚Äù

Turner nonetheless denies that she‚Äôll be a congressional provocateur arguing that she worked well with both parties in the state Legislature. She‚Äôs also aired TV ads promoting her past work as the Ohio Democratic Party engagement chair.

Brown counters that she can actually achieve the kind of bipartisanship Turner only talks about.

‚ÄúI feel like the ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô approach ends up with nothing. So we have to be able to find compromise‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBeing a partner doesn‚Äôt mean being a puppet.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL3doeS1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS13b21lbi13YW50LXRvLWRhdGUtbWVuLXdoby1hY3QtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why progressive women want to date men who act like conservatives,"My friend Mark 36 is a ‚Äúcatch‚Äù by many New York City standards. He‚Äôs good-looking highly educated and a talented photographer. He‚Äôs also progressive and participates in protests and gives to left-leaning causes. And Mark is looking for love. He wants to get married and have kids.

In a liberal city like New York swimming with single women wishing they weren‚Äôt one could assume Mark wouldn‚Äôt have a problem finding a mate. And while he dates and recently had a couple of short-lived relationships Mark remains single. He‚Äôs trying to understand why.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really open-minded and cool about gender stuff on dates but I always feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells‚Äù Mark told me. ‚ÄúIf I pay for dinner it signals I don‚Äôt value my date as my equal so I‚Äôm super casual about it all. If she wants to pay or split it or whatever that‚Äôs fine with me.‚Äù

I told Mark that despite his best intentions his egalitarian dating style could be the problem that‚Äôs holding him back. While some women balk at any hint of traditional male gender behavior more lament the loss of chivalry. I‚Äôm one of them. I find it attractive when a man plans our first few dates and knowingly walks curbside when we‚Äôre together. It signals he wants to protect me from passing traffic or errant puddle splashes.

‚ÄúWhen I was a kid my mom told me to always walk curbside but I assumed my generation of women would think it‚Äôs too old-fashioned‚Äù Mark told me. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm really confused.‚Äù

3 The New York dating scene is swimming with progressive women and many of them want men who‚Äôll pick up the check. Christopher Sadowski

The female desire to feel protected and looked after is built into our DNA says evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller a professor at the University of New Mexico and author of several books including ‚ÄúThe Mating Mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mismatch between what progressive women say they want and what they actually respond to‚Äù Miller told me. ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs instinctive mate preferences have evolved for hundreds of thousands of years for guys who are competent strong good providers good protectors and happy with a sexual division of labor‚Äù he added. Women want ‚Äúdecisive men who are also compassionate and thoughtful.‚Äù

A 2018 study from Iowa State University backs this up reporting that progressive women prefer men who demonstrate more traditional dating behaviors. The women found these men to be ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù because they signal a willingness ‚Äúto invest by being protective committed and by providing resources.‚Äù

Gwen Stefani presumably has No Doubt of these findings. On July 3 the pop star who was raised in blue-state California wed Country & Western star Blake Shelton a native of red-state Oklahoma who is pro-gun ‚Äî and a famous gentleman. Shelton even asked Stefani‚Äôs father for his blessing before proposing in the Catholic wedding chapel he built for his bride.

3 Psychologist Geoffrey Miller LinkedIn

When asked what she loves about her betrothed Stefani gushed: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs full of love and generosity ‚Ä¶ So you feel safe: You can lean on him and trust him.‚Äù

My friend Roc 44 exemplifies this same type of old-school man. His girlfriend 36 is a ‚Äútypical New York City progressive feminist‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBefore me she dated liberal artists and creatives. I work in corporate America and am much more conservative and methodical. I pay for stuff open doors and she likes that I walk on her right side because she has a mild case of scoliosis‚Äù he added. The couple has been together for five years.

Kari 45 is a fundraising executive who dated a man in 2018 with similar left-leaning values and beliefs. But before long his egalitarian dating attitude and lack of initiative to plan dates led to a breakup. ‚ÄúAt work I‚Äôm the boss. I have to run the show be the cheerleader have tough conversations‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI make decisions all day long. At the end of the day I want my guy to say: ‚ÄòBabe I got this.‚Äô ‚Äù

Kari‚Äôs next boyfriend was a conservative who works in finance. ‚ÄúWithout fail he would pick the place set the time and then ask if his plan worked for me‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt felt great to know he was taking care of it all.

‚ÄúI appreciate a man who opens the door for me and picks up the check. This makes me feel safe like I can count on him for other things‚Äù Kari said adding ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful when a man steps up and acts like a man; it makes me feel more feminine.‚Äù

While Kari and her boyfriend broke up (for reasons outside of political views) she remains a feminist who will only date conservative men although she draws the line at ‚Äúfar-right conspiracy theorists.‚Äù While she met her most recent ex on a plane she‚Äôs now using dating apps to find her next love and said she‚Äôs more likely to swipe right on profiles of men who say they prefer more traditional dating behaviors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good indicator that there‚Äôs a shared mindset‚Äù Kari said.

3 Blake Shelton asked Stefani‚Äôs father for her hand in marriage before proposing. Instagram @gwenstefani

Kari‚Äôs preference for conservative men comes as no surprise to professor Miller. ‚ÄúThis is a time-tested set of behaviors strategies and cultural norms that have lasted for centuries because they help find and keep good mates‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd everybody knows this. Women in their hearts know this. And men don‚Äôt take them at their word.‚Äù

Now my friend Mark is planning to stop making the same mistakes. He told me he‚Äôs going to start dating like a conservative ‚Äî and hopefully find his ideal progressive wife soon.

Witness the response to Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson's successful journey to the edge of space yesterday on his company's Unity spaceship.

The flight‚Äîwhich carried Branson and five other crew members more than 50 miles above the Earth's surface‚Äîrepresents an important milestone for the nascent private space tourism industry. But several commentators were only concerned with what the British billionaire's money could have funded instead.

On Twitter Mother Jones' Clara Jeffery declared it an ""advertisement for a wealth tax"":

Billionaires is space is one giant advertisement for a wealth tax pic.twitter.com/yHt1In4EEF ‚Äî Clara Jeffery (@ClaraJeffery) July 11 2021

Journalist Teddy Schleifer said on CNN that the press should cool its jets when covering billionaires' space travels saying that ""it's impossible to talk about the billionaire's success without talking about the system that creates this in the first place.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I‚ÄìVt.) struck a familiar dyspeptic note:

Here on Earth in the richest country on the planet half our people live paycheck to paycheck people are struggling to feed themselves struggling to see a doctor ‚Äî but hey the richest guys in the world are off in outer space! Yes. It's time to tax the billionaires. ‚Äî Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 11 2021

Rep. Ro Khanna (D‚ÄìCalif.) asked a few days before Branson's launch whether that money could be spent on health care and education rather than ""space travel fantasies.""

Should billionaires play out their space travel fantasies or should we invest in schooling provide healthcare and create prosperity for everyone? We need a wealth tax.https://t.co/PrpnWgxoev ‚Äî Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) July 7 2021

Khanna doesn't see such a stark trade-off with the government's own resources given his co-sponsorship of the ""Endless Frontiers Act"" the initial version of which would have given $100 billion to the National Science Foundation to research such sci-fi ideas as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Surely that money could be spent on health care too? And Khanna is a member of Congress' ""NASA Caucus"" so he isn't objecting to spending money on space exploration per se.

In any case billionaire-backed space companies‚Äîwhich includes not just Branson's Virgin Galactic but also Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX‚Äîcan help to eliminate wasteful space spending. That's certainly the case with SpaceX. Back in May 2020 the company's Crew Dragon vehicle ferried NASA astronauts to the International Space Station from American soil for the first time since 2011 when the accident-prone Space Shuttle was retired.

To develop and launch Crew Dragon SpaceX received a $2.6 billion contract from NASA through the agency's Commercial Crew Program. In comparison the Constellation program run directly by NASA‚Äîwhich had a similar goal of developing a launch system for putting astronauts in low-earth orbit‚Äîwas estimated to cost closer to $34.5 billion.

SpaceX was ""effectively doing what the Constellation Program was doing with about the same amount of money total that they were burning in a single month"" NASA engineer Mike Horkachuck told ArsTechnica's Eric Berger.

In time the competition between these various private ventures will put yet more downward pressure on prices while spurring the development of new better space technology‚Äîhelping the government's space efforts as well as the private sector's.

Even if you aren't convinced of the value of space travel given that we've yet to reach a utopia free of poverty disease and war here on Earth there's something to be said for a private space industry soaking up the legions of engineers and other aerospace professionals who might otherwise be spending their careers designing faster-flying missiles for traditional military contractors.

The private space industry has problems from a libertarian perspective too. SpaceX and Blue Origin are primarily in the business of competing for government contracts. New Mexico taxpayers shelled out $220 million to fund Virgin Galactic's desert launch facility.

Yet even a rigid ideologue like Ayn Rand was able to see some good in government-funded space travel. ""Nothing on earth or beyond it is closed to the power of man's reason"" she wrote of the Moon landing. ""This is the fundamental lesson to be learned from the triumph of Apollo 11.""

Her criticism of space flight's detractors also rings only truer today. Their attitude she wrote ""penalizes the good for being good and success for being success.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLzU2MjI1NC1maW5hbGx5LWEtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLXBsYW4tdG8tZml4LWFtZXJpY2FzLWJyb2tlbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zeXN0ZW0v0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvNTYyMjU0LWZpbmFsbHktYS1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtcGxhbi10by1maXgtYW1lcmljYXMtYnJva2VuLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXN5c3RlbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finally a conservative plan to fix America‚Äôs broken health care system,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/562254-finally-a-conservative-plan-to-fix-americas-broken-health-care-system/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLzU2MjI1NC1maW5hbGx5LWEtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLXBsYW4tdG8tZml4LWFtZXJpY2FzLWJyb2tlbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zeXN0ZW0v0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvNTYyMjU0LWZpbmFsbHktYS1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtcGxhbi10by1maXgtYW1lcmljYXMtYnJva2VuLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXN5c3RlbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

After ShipBob decided last July to let staffers work from anywhere the logistics start-up had its landlord erect a wall in the middle of its Chicago headquarters so half the space could be rented out to another company. On March 1 the office reopened at reduced capacity for socially distanced meetings. But while it's using less office space ShipBob's real estate needs have been expanding at a breakneck pace. The company which provides fulfillment services to online retailers has more than doubled its warehouse count since mid-2020 to 24 locations today including four outside the U.S. with plans to reach 35 by the end of 2021. The seven-year-old company is a microcosm of the U.S. commercial real estate market. While office vacancies have soared as employers prepare for a post-Covid future of distributed work the industrial market is hotter than ever because of a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce and increased consumer demand to get more products at Amazon -like speeds. Vacancy rates in industrial buildings are near a record low and new warehouses can't get built quickly enough to meet the needs of clothing makers furniture sellers and home appliance manufacturers. Real estate firm CBRE said in its first-quarter report on the industrial and logistics market that almost 100 million square feet of space was absorbed in the period the third-highest amount ever and that a record 376 million square feet is under construction. Rents rose 7.1% in the quarter from the same period a year earlier to an all-time high of $8.44 per square foot CBRE said. The firm wrote in a follow-up report last month that prices in coastal markets near population centers and inland port hubs are soaring by double-digit percentages. In Northern New Jersey average base rent for industrial properties jumped 33% in May from a year earlier and California's Inland Empire saw an increase of 24% followed by Philadelphia at 20%. ""The need to have facilities in these markets coupled with record low vacancy rates has often led to bidding wars among occupiers that are driving up rental rates"" CBRE said.

Skyrocketing prices

The wheels were well in motion before Covid-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020. Amazon was already turning next-day delivery into the default option for Prime members and big box stores like Best Buy and Walmart were racing to add fulfillment space to try and keep pace. The pandemic accelerated everything. Consumers were stuck at home and ordering more stuff while physical stores had to go digital to stay afloat.

watch now

Grocery delivery added to the market tightness as Instacart and Postmates were suddenly inundated with orders from customers who didn't want to enter a Costco  Albertsons or Kroger store. Instacart is now planning a network of fulfillment centers loaded up with cereal-picking robots according to Bloomberg and Target has bolstered same-day fulfillment through so-called sortation centers. In addition to the rapid change in consumer behavior the pandemic also exposed the fragility of the global supply chain. With facilities in China and elsewhere shuttered stores experienced dramatic shortages of apparel car parts and packaging materials. Retailers responded by securing more storage space to mitigate the impact of future shocks said James Koman CEO of ElmTree Funds a private equity firm focused on commercial real estate. ""The reshoring of manufacturing is gaining momentum"" Koman said. Companies are ""bringing more products onshore and need to have room for their products so we don't fall into another situation like we're in right now."" All of those factors are contributing to skyrocketing prices he said. Additionally construction costs are higher because of inflation and supply constraints and companies are building more sophisticated facilities filled with robots. ""You have these automatic forklifts conveyor belts and automated storage retrieval systems"" Koman said. ""All this is where the world is going.""

Betting on a long-term need for fulfillment and logistics facilities ElmTree has acquired about $2 billion worth of industrial space over the past seven months outpacing prior years Koman said. He estimates the U.S. will need an additional 135-150 million square feet annually to support e-commerce growth. For ShipBob the e-commerce boom has played right into its business model. But competition for space is simultaneously forcing the company to reckon with higher costs. ShipBob works with brands like perfume company Dossier powdered energy drink maker Juspy and Tom Brady's sports and fitness brand TB12 providing a wide network of fulfillment centers for fast and reliable shipping and software to manage deliveries and inventory. Unlike the retail giants ShipBob doesn't go after large football field-sized fulfillment centers and only has leases at a few of its facilities. Rather it looks for warehouses that are typically family-owned with 75000-100000 square feet and some unused capacity. It then outfits them with ShipBob technology and pays based on order volume and the amount of space it uses. While ShipBob isn't signing leases it is competing for space in warehouses that are now sitting on much more valuable property than they were a year ago. ShipBob CEO Dhruv Saxena said that his company has to be in areas like Southern California and Louisville Kentucky a major transportation and logistics hub despite the rapid increase in prices. ""We have to find ways of placing inventory closer to the end customer even if it comes at a lower margin for us"" Saxena said in an interview late last month after his company raised $200 million at a valuation topping $1 billion. ShipBob competes directly with a number of fulfillment outsourcing start-ups including ShipMonk Deliverr and Shippo. Those four companies have raised almost $900 million combined in the past year.

Not just Amazon

Saxena said a major reason smaller retailers turn to ShipBob is to avoid the costs and hassle of finding fulfillment space and hiring the requisite workers. He likened it to companies outsourcing their computing and data storage needs to Amazon Web Services and paying for how much capacity they use rather than leasing their own data centers. ""The same math applies"" Saxena said. ""I can open a warehouse hire people and rig the software or I can convert those fixed costs into variable costs where I pay on a transaction basis.""

Nate Faust is in the very early stages of building Olive an e-commerce start-up that's working with brands to offer more sustainable packaging and delivery options by using recycled boxing materials and bundling items. Olive opened its first two 30000 square foot warehouses last year one in New Jersey and the other in Southern California. Faust who previously co-founded Jet.com and then worked at Walmart after the acquisition said if he were entering those leases today they'd easily be 10% to 15% higher. Olive isn't actively in the market for more fulfillment centers and doesn't face a lease renewal until February but Faust said start-ups have to be opportunistic. He's working with real estate firm JLL which he said is constantly on the prowl for attractive space. ""We have them looking all the time because industrial space is so tight right now"" Faust said. ""If we find something perfect for what we're looking for it's not unreasonable to have overlapping leases.""

Olive package Olive

Vik Chawla a partner at venture firm Fifth Wall which invests in property technologies said the challenges in the real estate market are driving more emerging brands and sellers to the outsourcing model. ""It's very difficult as a single e-commerce business to try to secure attractive space and run your business"" Chawla said. ""The line of people trying to get into industrial buildings is out the door."" Many tenants occupying that line are traditional big third-party logistics providers (3PLs) like C.H. Robinson and XPO Logistics as well as UPS and FedEx . At the top end of the market Amazon Walmart and Target are mopping up space to speed distribution and in Amazon's case to manage fulfillment for its massive marketplace of third-party sellers. Prologis  the largest U.S. owner of industrial real estate said in a May report that utilization rates which indicate how much space is being used reached close to 85%. Vacancy rates are at 4.7% close to a record low the company said. Amazon is the real estate firm's biggest customer occupying 22 million square feet followed by Home Depot at 9 million and then FedEx and UPS according to Prologis' latest annual report. Walmart is seventh. In April an analyst on Prologis' earnings call asked what types of clients were most actively pursuing leases. ""E-commerce is a big component of it but it's certainly not all about Amazon"" Michael Curless Prologis' chief customer officer said in response. ""Certainly they're the most active customer. But we're seeing a lot of activity from the Targets the Walmarts Home Depots and lots of evidence of the Chinese players making their way to the U.S. and Europe as well.""

About 35 kilometres south of Milan lies the city of Pavia. Twenty years ago I studied there for a semester ‚Äì so I have very fond memories of that city.

One of the most famous people that ever lived in Pavia is Alessandro Volta. In 1799 he invented the battery. This invention would soon lead to the development of the first electric motor ‚Äì a machine that in its current form plays an important role in the transition to a net-zero society.

This transition will be hard to achieve. But it is what we will need to do ‚Äì because climate change is a major threat to societies and economies all over the world and to the stability of the entire financial system.

Currently however we are still far from achieving the ambitions set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.

If we want to achieve these ambitions we will need large-scale investments in sustainable energy services in agriculture in manufacturing and so on. And these investments will need to be accompanied by increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The lion‚Äôs share of these investments will have to come from the private sector.

But when we look at financing flows whether in capital markets or bank finance we see they are mostly directed towards large and often carbon-intensive companies ‚Äì companies perceived as having low credit risk.

The energy transition however hinges on successful technological innovations.

According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency  and I quote: ‚Äúmost of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 in the net zero pathway come from technologies readily available today. But in 2050 almost half the reductions come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase.‚Äù

Early on these innovative technologies are often less competitive than fossil alternatives. This makes banks more hesitant to finance these higher risk activities. And innovative start-ups are often too small to attract capital market financing.

So currently innovation investment is best aligned with the risk appetite of private equity firms. But they do not have a large presence around the world.

So this is where governments come in.

The bulk of the much needed investments will indeed have to come from the private sector ‚Äì but there is a loud and clear sine qua non. And that is that governments create investment conditions that improve the business case for climate investments.

They need to do this for both companies in need of green finance and investors providing green finance. If demand and supply grow in the same pace we reduce the risk of a green bubble once the private sector increases its green investments. And to reduce the risk of greenwashing we need international standards such as a taxonomy.

Our governments‚Äô broad mandates allow them to create favourable conditions for green investments ‚Äì and so they should act upon it.

Meanwhile of course central banks should do what they can within their mandates and continue to work on favourable financing conditions.

But I want to stress that given their broader mandate our governments are the primary actors in greening our economies.

I will now elaborate on three ways governments could step up their efforts. After that I will talk about the role of supervisors and central banks in greening our economies.

So first ‚Äì governments need to address the issue of under-priced carbon emissions. This will improve the business case for climate investments.

With the Emissions Trading System the ETS European leaders have a powerful tool to do this and achieve the target of reducing net EU greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent by 2030.

Second ‚Äì investment uncertainty which is usually high for innovative green investments needs to be reduced. And governments could contribute to this with a consistent and reliable policy mix of subsidies co-financing and guarantees. A good example are offshore wind farms in the Netherlands: minimum price guarantees helped the industry scale-up after which costs fell sharply.

The European Commission can stimulate public-private partnerships by simplifying government support rules. They can also do so by granting exemptions for the co-financing of climate investment by governments.

Third ‚Äì corporate reporting of sustainability data must improve in terms of quality comparability and consistency. And this credible and comparable information should be readily available for all market participants shareholders and other stakeholders across the world.

That is why I encourage authorities to support the IFRS Foundation in developing a global baseline standard. One that is first compatible with regional and national disclosure frameworks that may be more far-reaching; and two builds upon the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures.

Until the IFRS reporting standards have been developed it is important we avoid fragmentation. We need to ensure that national and regional requirements currently being put in place can easily dovetail with the new global standards later on.

Let me now talk about what supervisors could do to encourage climate investments.

Supervisors expect financial institutions to manage their climate-related risks.

This calls for a more forward-looking approach from financial institutions and supervisors ‚Äì with stress tests and scenario-analyses becoming an integral part of the regular toolkit.

And this requires financial institutions to take material sustainability risks into account ‚Äì which means measuring assessing and controlling these risks as part of their regular risk management processes.

The Dutch financial sector is increasingly aware of climate risks and is taking steps to mitigate them. For example many financial institutions are working on identifying which carbon-intensive sectors they are exposed to. The Dutch financial sector has also committed to reporting on the climate impact of its financing and investment and to reduce its impact.

Supervisory authorities like De Nederlandsche Bank also need to investigate where and how climate-related risks can be further integrated in the applicable prudential frameworks for banks and other financial institutions. They need to do this to ensure the soundness of financial institutions.

Furthermore climate risks should be adequately reflected in prudential regulations with adjustments to the framework where necessary. That is why I welcome the work of the European Banking Authority and the Basel Committee in this area. The uncertainties surrounding climate-related risks make them harder to quantify but this certainly does not mean we can afford to ignore them. Prudential regulation is aimed at ensuring financial institutions can absorb unexpected losses ‚Äì and this should include losses related to climate change.

In our macroprudential supervision we have designed a climate stress test. And in the future we aim to integrate climate-related risks in our regular macroprudential supervision.

Last but not least let me now turn to what role central banks can play in greening our economies.

The primary objective of the ECB is price stability. And we know that climate change in itself can cause adverse demand and supply shocks and that these shocks cause higher inflation volatility.

Governments‚Äô transition policies may also lead to more inflation volatility. The most effective measure for greening the economy is adequate pricing of carbon emissions. Doing this will lead to relative price changes and the reallocation of resources across sectors. The greater the delay in implementing such government policies the more abrupt the transition will be. This raises the risk of stranded assets on balance sheets and shock-induced revaluations of financial sector exposures.

Whether transition measures are direct or indirect all the possible likely or actual effects of climate change will be reflected in pricing measures. And this affects price stability. So you can easily see that climate change falls within the monetary policy horizon.

The secondary objective of the ECB implies that it shall support the general economic policies of the EU provided it does not interfere with the primary objective. And with the Green Deal the EU has an ambitious climate agenda. The ECB is considering how best to take account of climate change in its current monetary policy strategy review.

In addition to the primary and secondary objective the ECB needs to integrate risks related to climate change in its own risk management framework. We know that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk. And since we expect financial institutions to manage their climate-related risks the ECB should lead by example.

And finally ‚Äì central banks should be transparent about the climate risks on their own balance sheets. And they should ensure that their own reserves are aligned with international sustainability goals and Corporate Social Responsibility standards.

At De Nederlandsche Bank we are currently exploring whether we can align the equity portion of our own-account portfolio with the agreements set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. And we will start identifying the physical climate risks of our investment portfolios such as the impact of increasing drought and extreme weather conditions on our investments.

By setting a good example central banks can advocate transparency on climate risks in financial markets. This is for instance why De Nederlandsche Bank added a climate annex to its annual report this year fully in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures the TCFD.

Dear all today I have spoken to you about the role that governments supervisors and central banks can play in greening our economies. But I would like to stress that none of them operate in isolation. Collaboration and coordination between the different stakeholders including these three parties but also international organisations like the FSB and the G20 and the financial sector itself will be paramount in the transition to a net-zero society.

Let me conclude.

Exactly one hundred years after Alessandro Volta invented the battery the first car reached a speed of over one hundred kilometres an hour.

This was in 1899. It was a Belgian car. And that car was electric.

This electric car even had a name. It was called La Jamais Contente. The Never Satisfied in English. Or La Mai Felice in Italian.

Regarding the energy transition we have been satisfied with too little for too long.

We need immediate decisive and greater action.

And we need this from everyone ‚Äì each within their own mandate everyone contributing their own expertise.

All of us to use a famous ‚ÄòItalian‚Äô expression will need to do ‚Äòwhatever it takes‚Äô.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

The project site is a parcel spanning an area of 35000 square feet. The new self-storage will cover an area of 119881 square feet and offer storage options totaling an area of 111073 square feet. The proposed facade will rise to a height of sixty-three feet and storage spaces will be distributed throughout all four stories. A parking space of 8363 square feet with a capacity of four bicycles and eight vehicles is also proposed.

The total cost of construction is $19.5 million. The City Planning Commission will be reviewing the application materials. The estimated construction timeline has not been announced yet.

The property site is located in an industrial area neighboring other business and industrial setups.

The rest is often off-site and hidden from view tucked away in closed depots. The new Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam designed by architecture firm MVRDV is bucking this trend making 99 per cent of its building accessible to the public and the entire collection of the neighbouring Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen ‚Äì some 151000 artefacts ‚Äì available for viewing even as they are stored.



Technological innovation was key to this bold move says MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas. ‚ÄòWe put technology on the same level as sociology ecology and economics‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòInnovations and achievements in all these aspects are equally important.‚Äô Indeed the Depot‚Äôs ovoid monolithic appearance belies the most sophisticated engineering. The 39.5m-high bowl-shaped structure is 40m in diameter at the bottom and 60m at the top and its overhanging part has no direct supports. Additionally the openings including the visitors‚Äô entrance and the entrance and exit for the exhibitions create weak points on the ground floor. The task therefore was to come up with a design in which the lowest (and narrowest) part of the building could withstand the high load from above.

The solution lay in the foundations: the first two floors were made from concrete poured in situ functioning as a structurally solid plinth upon which the building‚Äôs remaining four storeys could be constructed. These upper floors are made from prefabricated concrete elements. Below ground the architects were keen to keep the foundation work strong but also as discreet as possible to avoid obstructing the natural flow of underground water. ‚ÄòThe foundation piles of the Depot are kept limited and narrow. We trialled this with our design for the Oslo headquarters of the Norwegian bank DNB where we guaranteed that water could flow through subterraneously using the same principle‚Äô says Maas. ‚ÄòIt is important for the environment that no blockage is created by underground parking garages metro lines and so on.‚Äô



Covered by 1664 mirrored glass panels the 6609 sq m fa√ßade appears to multiply the green scenery of the surrounding Museumpark. A number of different types of glass were used including standard reflective glass; reflective glass with a film coating which is used opposite the Erasmus medical centre to safeguard the patients‚Äô privacy; transparent glass for work spaces that need more daylight; and a type of gradient glass that goes from mirror to fully transparent for the entrances and the roof so that visitors can enjoy the long views from inside too. The curvature of the glass panels was another challenge. ‚ÄòMost of the panels had to go in the oven two or three times to gain the perfect shape. It was a labour-intensive process‚Äô says Maas.

The experimentation did not end there. On the roof are 75 birch trees each several metres high in an architectural garden. ‚ÄòWe started growing them in the south of the Netherlands. By keeping the water level just beneath the surface we trained them to grow their roots horizontally. When we moved them from the nursery we knotted the roots together then spread them out on the rooftop as the overlapping of the roots creates a strong structure‚Äô says Maas. ‚ÄòGrowing them was a simple but lengthy process; it took five years.‚Äô The bowl shape means that the building has a limited footprint on the ground floor while the roof is roomier also offering wider views over the Museumpark and the city beyond.



To ensure energy efficiency MVRDV installed underground thermal storage for climate control solar panels LED lighting and high-performance insulation. Rainwater is stored for use in irrigation and the toilet facilities while the remaining water run-off is directed into a neighbouring pond (belonging to Het Nieuw Instituut) which will be converted into a water basin for the surroundings.

Maas also invited other creatives to contribute to the project. The ground floor comprises two half-moon shaped spaces; one of them contains the entrance hall and the other a loading dock. They are separated by glass. Artist John K√∂rmeling took advantage of the high ceiling here to create a mezzanine so visitors can watch art handlers at work on the other side of the transparent wall. Amsterdam-based design firm Concrete created a mobile table system for the rooftop restaurant which means it can be transformed into a gallery or performance space at any time. Artist and photographer Marieke van Diemen designed the atrium‚Äôs 13 floating glass display cases: when an artwork is removed from storage it will immediately be put into a case for protection but will still be on view. ‚ÄòWe developed a system where you can see the exhibits at all angles; you can even walk on top of them or see them below from the glass bridges‚Äô says Maas.



There will be storage depots on floors one to five the education centre will be on the second galleries on the third and fourth and the Stichting De Verre Bergen suite (named after Rotterdam‚Äôs social investment fund which covered the building cost of the Depot alongside the City Council) on the fifth. The atrium occupies the central space on all floors and its crisscrossing staircases lead visitors through various public areas all the way up to the rooftop. Each atrium staircase will have a landing exactly in the centre of the building allowing visitors a panoramic view from the heart of the Depot.

An architectural marvel and a landmark for the city of Rotterdam the Depot marks a new wave of urban development in Europe's largest seaport. The next few years will see the unveiling of MVRDV‚Äôs Harbour Experience Centre the Feyenoord Stadium by OMA and the Fenix Museum of Migration by MAD Architects to name a few. As one of the draughtsmen of the city‚Äôs bold architecture statements Maas calls it ‚Äòa kind of laboratory‚Äô. ‚ÄòInnovations are allowed in Rotterdam‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòThe process has actually been going on for 50 years and we have made a very beautiful collection of urban interventions; here you see the experiments of our time.‚Äô

It‚Äôs called the YN455.



Back in 2018 Yongnuo announced the YN450  an unusual Android-powered mirrorless camera that packed a Four Thirds sensor on the inside and an EF lens mount on the outside. On the back of the camera was a large touchscreen interface and the camera‚Äôs other features and specs included a Qualcomm 8-core processor 16-megapixel photos 4K video 3GB RAM 32GB onboard storage and more.

The YN450 has been sold in China but the camera never made it to international markets. A couple of years later Yongnuo began selling a new YN450M variant of the camera which swaps the EF lens mount for a Micro Four Thirds mount that finally matched the sensor within.

Both the YN450 and the YN450M have been panned by critics but it seems that hasn‚Äôt stopped Yongnuo from pushing onward towards its Android mirrorless camera dreams.

Photo Rumors reports that Yongnuo has quietly unveiled the YN455 a successor to the YN450M that adds improved ergonomics beefier specs and a tilt screen.

While the predecessors of this camera straddled the line between camera and phone at least when it came to their design the YN455 breaks away from that mold with its much more prominent handgrip that should allow photographers to hold the device more comfortably and securely.

Inside the camera is a new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor. The lens mount on the front appears to still be Micro Four Thirds. On the back of the camera is a new 5-inch tilting touchscreen.

Features and specs of the camera include an 8-core 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù CPU 64GB storage 6GB RAM support for a microSD card of up to 256GB 4G 4K/30p video recording 3.5mm headphone and microphone jacks dual USB-C ports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity GPS a 4400mAh removable battery and a weight of 23.6oz/670g.

The camera will have a price tag of 3888 Chinese yuan or about $600. It‚Äôs unknown whether the YN455 will be exclusively sold in China or whether photographers around the world will be able to pick one up like they can Yongnuo‚Äôs lenses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3NhbXN1bmctZXh5bm9zLWZsYWdzaGlwLWNoaXBzZXQtaGlzdG9yeS0xMjMzNjk5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exynos flagship chipsets: A history of Samsung's homegrown silicon,"Samsung is one of the few smartphone companies possessing the ability to design its own high-end chipsets along with Apple and HUAWEI (until the US trade ban nipped that in the bud). The Korean firm‚Äôs Exynos flagship processors have been a fixture in its high-end phones for years now covering the Galaxy S series and Galaxy Note series.

But where did this story actually start? Join us as we take a look at the history of Samsung Exynos flagship processors from the earliest phones with this silicon all the way to today‚Äôs superphones. Related: Everything you need to know about Samsung‚Äôs Exynos processors

2010: When flagship chipset meant Hummingbird

Samsung

Our dive into Samsung Exynos history starts with Samsung‚Äôs first Galaxy S smartphone which launched in 2010 and was powered by an in-house chipset from the get-go. This wasn‚Äôt the debut of Exynos though as the chipset was actually called the Hummingbird. Man I wouldn‚Äôt mind a return to dainty bird names like sunbird and goldfinch.

Anyway the 45nm Hummingbird was retroactively renamed the Exynos 3 Single and it was a pretty capable chipset for the time. Samsung‚Äôs in-house processor sported a 1GHz single-core Cortex-A8 CPU at a time when 1GHz mobile CPUs were a rarity. In fact the manufacturer said it was the industry‚Äôs first 1GHz processor at the time of its 2009 unveiling.

The Hummingbird chipset also delivered a PowerVR SGX540 GPU support for 800 x 600 displays (not so impressive when Apple was about to launch the 960 x 640 iPhone 4) and support for 1080p recording (beating the iPhone 4‚Äôs 720p output). Other features like LPDDR2 RAM and eMMC 4.3 support were par for the course at the time.

It‚Äôs also interesting to note that this was the only Samsung chipset to find its way into a Nexus or Pixel device being used in the Nexus S. Other Nexus and Pixel devices used Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon with the exception of 2011‚Äôs Samsung Galaxy Nexus (using TI OMAP silicon).

2011: The first proper Exynos flagship SoC

The first Samsung Exynos flagship chipset in history (i.e. without a retroactive name change) was actually the Exynos 4210 Dual debuting inside 2011‚Äôs Galaxy S2. And it was part of the first wave of dual-core smartphone processors delivering a 1.2GHz Cortex-A9 CPU.

Another notable Exynos 4210 Dual feature was the once-ubiquitous Mali-400MP4 GPU which was the first time we saw Arm GPUs inside a Samsung Galaxy S series flagship. This is a trend that continues to this day although it looks like change is afoot for 2022. Related: Did you know: The first Galaxy Note was mocked and predicted to flop at launch

The SoC has a few features in common with its predecessor though such as the 45nm manufacturing process LPDDR2 RAM support and 1080p/30fps video recording. We do however see support for higher resolution displays (1440 x 900) and eMMC 4.4 support. One strange listed feature is support for 5MP cameras but the chip was actually inside phones with 8MP rear cameras.

The Exynos 4210 Dual also found its way into the original Galaxy Note back in 2011 (seen above) powering the super-sized phone at a time when large screens weren‚Äôt common at all. Furthermore this chipset powered Meizu‚Äôs first phone (the Meizu MX). The Chinese brand would go on to use Exynos flagship SoCs in plenty of its devices.

Notable phones: Samsung Galaxy S2 Samsung Galaxy Note Meizu MX

2012: The industry moves to quad-core

2012‚Äôs biggest mobile silicon trend was the shift to quad-core CPUs and Samsung was a part of this trend by offering the Exynos 4412. The new chipset debuted inside the Galaxy S3 but also appeared in the Galaxy Note 2 in the second half of the year albeit with a slight CPU clock speed boost.

Speaking of the CPU we got a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU which doubled the number of cores seen in the previous year‚Äôs flagship SoC. It‚Äôs still based on the same Cortex-A9 CPU but the quad-core arrangement was welcomed due to Android and various third-party apps embracing multi-core support.

Mobile gamers would‚Äôve been slightly disappointed back in 2012 as the Exynos 4412 used the same Mali-400MP4 GPU seen in the previous year‚Äôs Exynos processor. It also topped out with the same basic eMMC support and 1080p/30fps recording capability. Otherwise the Exynos 4412 offered a 32nm design which was a solid improvement on paper as well as a 1440 x 900 display resolution.

Oddly enough this processor also found its way into two Lenovo phones back in the day as well as the first-generation Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet.

Notable phones: Lenovo K860/K860i Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Samsung Galaxy S3

2013: You thought they‚Äôd stop at quad-core?

The smartphone industry quickly moved from single-core CPUs to dual-core and then quad-core processors in just a few years. But 2013 marked the first time Samsung adopted an octa-core processor in its high-end phones. The 28nm Exynos 5410 debuted inside the Galaxy S4 and delivered what looked like a big.LITTLE design. That meant a cluster of four high-powered Cortex-A15 CPU cores and a cluster of four lightweight Cortex-A7 cores. But there was a rather significant issue with this SoC.

The Exynos 5410 had a major limitation in that only one cluster could be active at a time. That meant you couldn‚Äôt have all eight CPU cores active at once nor could you have just a Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15 active at the same time. So you either have the four Cortex-A7 cores running or the four Cortex-A15 cores active. It was a bizarre decision and kind of defeated the purpose of going octa-core in the first place.

It wasn‚Äôt all bad though as we got a beefy PowerVR SGX544 MP3 GPU display resolutions up to 2560 x 1600 and LPDDR3 support. The chipset was pretty capable in the camera field too offering 1080p/60fps video recording and a rear camera up to 13MP.

The Exynos 5410 was a somewhat controversial chipset and it wouldn't be the last time Exynos silicon courted controversy.

Thankfully Samsung released the Exynos 5420 in late 2013 and it offered a more sensible take on an octa-core design. The upgraded processor indeed allowed for both the little and big cores to be active at once. This chipset also swapped out the PowerVR GPU for a Mali T628 MP6 GPU with Samsung claiming the Mali GPU was ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù over the PowerVR part as a result. It was otherwise identical to the Exynos 5410.

One interesting tidbit here is that the Snapdragon version of the Galaxy Note 3 offered 4K/30fps recording but the Exynos version topped out at 1080p/60fps. This situation would be reversed in later years. The Exynos variant also reportedly lacked LTE support topping out at 42.2Mbps HSPA+ instead.

Notable phones: Samsung Galaxy S4 Samsung Galaxy Note 3

2014: Exynos beats Qualcomm to 64-bit

2014 was a great year for Samsung as the firm released what might arguably be one of its best phones ever in the Galaxy S5. But this phone was exclusively powered by the Snapdragon 801. Fortunately Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge later that year which indeed offered Exynos silicon.

The 20nm Exynos 5433 was the flagship Samsung processor for 2014 and it actually beat Qualcomm to the 64-bit post. Yes the new chipset had an octa-core CPU featuring Arm‚Äôs first 64-bit CPU cores. That means we got four Cortex-A57 cores for complex tasks and four Cortex-A53 cores for less advanced activities.

This chipset also offered Arm‚Äôs Mali-T760 MP6 GPU LPDDR3e RAM support and the same display resolution as the previous year‚Äôs processor. Camera performance took a step up as the Exynos 5433 supported a 3.7MP selfie camera a single 16MP rear camera and 4K video as well as 120fps video at 1080p. The latter feature (or 240fps) is now a staple for many Android smartphones.

The selfie camera resolution sounds extremely low quality but the truth is that none of Samsung‚Äôs flagship phones supported anything close to 5MP at the time. We‚Äôd have to wait a year for more comprehensive support in this regard.

Samsung‚Äôs 2014 chipset also brought LTE connectivity delivering 300Mbps download speeds thanks to Cat 6 downlink support. This support helped narrow a connectivity gap between the Qualcomm and Exynos variants.

Notable phones: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge

2015: The best flagship processor of the year

Is this the apex of Samsung‚Äôs Exynos program? Well it‚Äôs hard to argue otherwise as the 14nm Exynos 7420 may have been the most capable Android flagship processor of 2015. It wasn‚Äôt the first 64-bit Android processor or even the first 64-bit Exynos chipset but it still made for a great bit of silicon compared to Qualcomm MediaTek and HUAWEI‚Äôs offerings at the time. We‚Äôd go so far as to say it was the best Samsung Exynos chipset in history at the time of its release.

The Exynos 7420 maintained the same octa-core CPU as its predecessor featuring four Cortex-A57 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores. We also got the same Mali-T760 GPU albeit with two extra cores (MP8) for a graphical boost. But the chipset introduced a small 14nm design 4K display resolutions (4096 x 2160 3840 x 2400) LPDDR4 RAM support and support for UFS 2.0 storage.

Other notable specs include support for a 20MP single rear camera an 8MP selfie camera and 4K/30fps video recording with HEVC.

This processor exclusively powered the Galaxy S6 series and the Galaxy Note 5. Reports at the time alleged that Samsung was put off the Snapdragon 810 due to heating concerns.

2016: Exynos gets custom CPUs

Samsung had been relying on Arm CPUs for all of its Exynos processors up until this point. But 2016‚Äôs Exynos 8890 marked a major change as it used Samsung‚Äôs first-generation Mongoose CPU. More specifically we had four Mongoose M1 cores paired with four Arm Cortex-A53 cores.

This 14nm processor also touted a Mali-T880 MP12 GPU 4K display resolutions and LPDDR4 RAM support. We also got dual-camera support for the first time topping out at 12MP+12MP (or a single 24MP main camera) as well as a selfie camera up to 13MP.

The Exynos 8890 also brought support for 4K/60fps recording but unfortunately Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 devices didn‚Äôt get this feature. This is presumably because the Snapdragon 835 which powered some Galaxy S7 variants didn‚Äôt have support for 4K/60fps recording. So it stands to reason that Samsung may have wanted to maintain feature parity.

Our own Gary Sims benchmarked 2016‚Äôs flagship Android processors and found that the Exynos 8890 was a close second to the Kirin 960 in terms of CPU performance but fell behind both the Snapdragon and HUAWEI chips when it came to GPU performance. The likes of GSMArena also reported that the Exynos Galaxy S7 was more power-efficient than the Snapdragon variant.

2017: The rise of heterogeneous compute

The Exynos 8895 was Samsung‚Äôs flagship processor for 2017 and the small number tweak belied a few major changes. The company‚Äôs new processor was built on a 10nm process delivering notable space and power savings on paper. It also used an octa-core CPU design featuring four Mongoose M2 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores sticking with custom cores for the heavyweight CPU core.

Samsung also upped the ante in the GPU department opting for Mali-G71 MP20 graphics. Rival brand HUAWEI would use the same GPU but opted for eight shader cores instead of 20 and this discrepancy showed in benchmark testing.

Other notable Exynos 8895 features included 4K display resolutions Gigabit LTE connectivity UFS 2.1 storage compatibility and LPDDR4X RAM support. Samsung also debuted a so-called ‚Äúvision processing unit‚Äù or VPU here responsible for computer vision tasks such as scene and object recognition. This would mark a first major foray of sorts into machine learning silicon. More reading: Everything you need to know about smartphone chipsets

The chipset was also packed to the gills on the camera front delivering a dual ISP design with one core being used for heavyweight imaging tasks and the other being used for less complex activities. You also got 4K/120fps recording capabilities up to a single 28MP camera or 16MP+16MP dual camera support and up to a 28MP camera for selfies.

The processor‚Äôs auxiliary features don‚Äôt stop here as it offered dedicated security bits to handle biometric authentication (e.g. fingerprint iris) flash memory protection and other security matters.

Much like last year we didn‚Äôt see 4K/60fps or 4K/120fps video recording officially come to phones with this chipset. But we did see unofficial workarounds to enable the former quality option on Samsung‚Äôs devices.

2018: Evolution not revolution

It felt like 2018‚Äôs Exynos 9810 was more of an iterative upgrade over the Exynos 8895 than a game-changing revolution. But we definitely saw two notable upgrades in the CPU and GPU categories.

In the case of the CPU we saw Samsung maintain a two-cluster octa-core design but with all-new CPU cores. This time we had four third-generation Mongoose CPU cores paired with four Cortex-A55 cores. And the A55 cores remain in Samsung‚Äôs Exynos flagship processors as of 2021.

Moving to the graphical side of things the firm switched to Arm‚Äôs Mali-G72 MP18 GPU. Again Samsung opted to pack far more shader cores than rival brand HUAWEI‚Äôs Kirin 970 SoC (Mali-G72 MP12).

Otherwise the chipset was still built on a 10nm process and still supported features like LPDDR4X RAM UFS 2.1 4K display resolutions and 4K/120fps recording. We did however see a bump to 1.2Gbps cellular speeds via LTE and 16MP+16MP dual cameras (as well as a 24MP single camera).

This would also be the last flagship Exynos processor to be used by small Chinese brand Meizu. We have seen vivo embrace Exynos silicon for its Chinese phones in recent years but this is restricted to mid-range silicon.

2019: A blueprint for future Samsung silicon

Samsung‚Äôs Exynos 9820 established a number of trends that the firm continues to embrace in its chipsets today. For starters we saw a MediaTek-inspired move to a tri-cluster CPU featuring two heavy-lifting Mongoose M4 CPU cores two Cortex-A75 cores for medium-level tasks and four Cortex-A55 cores for lightweight activities.

The Korean manufacturer also introduced a neural processing unit (NPU) for the first time following in HUAWEI‚Äôs steps. In fact Samsung would claim that the Exynos 9820‚Äôs NPU could accomplish machine learning tasks up to seven times faster than the previous year‚Äôs Exynos 9810.

Samsung also offered a Mali-G76 MP12 GPU touting a 40% improvement over the Exynos 9810 or a 35% efficiency gain. So what did the CPU and GPU improvements mean for the battle against Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon silicon?

Well our own testing showed that the Exynos 9820 beat the Snapdragon 855 when it came to single-core CPU performance owing to those beefy custom CPU cores. But that was pretty much the sole bright spot for Samsung as the Snapdragon silicon delivered better graphical performance less heat and better battery life.

The Exynos 982x series lagged behind its Snapdragon counterpart in several ways but it's nevertheless set the template for future efforts.

Still the Exynos 9820 had plenty more to offer. We also got an 8nm design improved hardware security 2Gbps cellular downlink speeds via 4G support for UFS 3.0 storage and LPDDR4X RAM and 4K display resolutions.

Perhaps the most impressive feature is 8K/30fps video recording but none of the Exynos-powered phones launched this year offered this option. Again we‚Äôre guessing Samsung strove for feature parity here as the Snapdragon 855 chipset lacked this option.

The Exynos 9820 also served up a hefty ISP capable of supporting up to five camera sensors a 22MP main camera (and 22MP front) or two 16MP shooters and 4K/120fps video once again. The 22MP support seems rather arbitrary in light of the support for 8K recording which generally requires a 33MP+ sensor.

Samsung also released an Exynos 9825 later in 2019 and it was used in the Galaxy Note 10 series. Unfortunately our own Speed Test G results showed that Samsung‚Äôs new chipset still lagged behind Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon 855 chipset particularly when it came to graphical performance.

2020: The lowest point for Samsung Exynos

Perhaps one of the biggest signs that the Exynos 990 was a bit of a failure for Samsung was that the chipset wasn‚Äôt actually used in the Korean Galaxy S20 series phones. After all Samsung has traditionally used Exynos power for flagships in its home market.

The Exynos 990 was a pretty good flagship SoC on paper featuring a 7nm design and a tri-cluster CPU. The processor offered two Mongoose M5 cores for heavyweight tasks two Cortex-A76 cores for medium-level tasks and four Cortex-A55 cores for the least demanding activities. This would be the last Exynos flagship processor with Samsung‚Äôs home-grown Mongoose CPU cores as Samsung shuttered its custom CPU division in late 2019.

On the graphical front the Exynos 990 packed Arm‚Äôs Mali-G77 MP11 GPU. So how did the CPU and GPU stack up to the Snapdragon 865 chipset used in the US and Korean Galaxy phones? Not very well.

Our testing showed that the Exynos 990-toting Galaxy S20 Plus lagged behind the Snapdragon variant in pretty much every CPU and GPU benchmark. At least 2019‚Äôs Exynos 9820 offered better single-core performance. You shouldn‚Äôt notice the CPU disparity as the difference isn‚Äôt huge but it‚Äôs another story when it comes to GPU performance. No wonder big changes are coming to Exynos GPUs.

The rest of the chipset was suitably cutting edge though showing that Samsung is still capable of producing high-level features in other areas. We got a bundled 5G modem supporting mmWave and sub-6GHz standards (topping out at 7.2Gbps) and support for UFS 3.0 storage and LPDDR5 RAM. There‚Äôs also a dual-core NPU and DSP delivering up to 15 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of performance in line with the Snapdragon 865.

Samsung‚Äôs 2020 flagship processor also explicitly supported high refresh rates for the first time offering 120Hz refresh rates at QHD+ or 60Hz at 4K. The firm would put this support to good use with the Galaxy S20 series and Note 20 Ultra with the former offering 120Hz at FHD+ while the latter offered 120Hz at QHD+ resolution.

The Exynos 990 was a pretty potent camera platform on paper too offering 108MP single camera support 24.5MP+24.5MP dual camera support up to six camera sensors and the ability to simultaneously process data from three sensors. We also got 8K/30fps recording once again and the company would put this support to good use with 2020‚Äôs flagships using it as a burst mode of sorts via the 8K Video Snap option.

2021: The end of an era?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

You‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that 2021 is a stopgap year for Samsung‚Äôs Exynos division. After all the company announced a partnership with graphics colossus AMD to deliver a purpose-built GPU that‚Äôs expected in 2022‚Äôs flagships. It‚Äôs also the first year without custom CPU cores as it now relies solely on Arm technology.

Fortunately the 5nm Exynos 2100 makes a strong argument for being one of the best Samsung Exynos chipsets in recent history. We‚Äôve got a tri-cluster CPU that‚Äôs virtually identical to the rival Snapdragon 888 SoC featuring a powerful Cortex-X1 CPU three Cortex-A78 CPU cores and four Cortex-A55 cores. Then there‚Äôs the Mali-G78 MP14 GPU which doesn‚Äôt use nearly as many shader cores as the Kirin 9000‚Äôs GPU (Mali-G78 MP24) but still promises a nearly 50% performance boost over the previous year‚Äôs Exynos 990.

What does this mean in terms of horsepower then? We compared the Exynos 2100-toting Galaxy S21 Ultra to the Snapdragon 888 variant and it‚Äôs definitely a much closer race than the previous year. More specifically we said that CPU performance between the two variants was ‚Äúneck-and-neck.‚Äù The Snapdragon variant still emerged victorious in GPU testing but the gap was much smaller than last year. Interestingly enough we also noted that the Exynos variant throttled a little sooner but delivered better endurance. Related: Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Snapdragon vs Exynos: How big is the performance gap?

Samsung‚Äôs 2021 chipset also features an integrated 5G modem for the first time in the flagship Exynos range. This should result in improved efficiency compared to processors with separate modems. Nevertheless you‚Äôre getting mmWave and sub-6GHz support here topping out at 7.35Gbps.

The new chipset also stepped things up in the machine learning area going from a dual-core NPU in 2020 to a triple-core design. Samsung says this enables AI performance in the region of 26 TOPS.

The rest of the Exynos 2100 spec sheet is pretty top-tier for 2021 featuring LPDDR5 RAM support support for UFS 3.1 storage a 144Hz refresh rate at QHD+ 120Hz at 4K resolution and support for AV1 decoding. The latter should result in significant bandwidth savings when streaming video via services supporting AV1.

Samsung‚Äôs chipset also delivers in the camera category featuring 200MP single camera support 32MP+32MP dual cameras up to six camera sensors and 8K/30fps video recording.

2022: What to expect next?

Next year marks a new era of sorts in the history of Samsung Exynos chipsets as the firm switches to AMD GPUs for its smartphone processor efforts. AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su revealed that this first GPU will be based on the firm‚Äôs RDNA2 architecture and will support ray tracing and variable rate shading. In pure English that means we‚Äôre expecting a unique piece of silicon.

Dr. Su added that Samsung would share more info on the new chipset ‚Äúlater this year.‚Äù Furthermore Samsung previously confirmed to Android Authority that the Exynos 2100 successor would indeed have AMD graphics. So it sounds like we should expect a reveal in late 2021 and the first commercial products with this chipset in 2022.

Samsung has also gone all-in on Arm CPUs this year so it stands to reason that the firm‚Äôs next flagship chipset will continue this trend by offering one Cortex-X2 core three Cortex-A710 cores and four Cortex-A510 cores. We do wonder how Arm‚Äôs CPU cores will progress especially as Qualcomm will debut its first processor powered by Nuvia tech in 2022 (albeit on laptops). Will Arm have something comparable up its sleeve in the coming years?

Either way 2022 is looking like the start of a new era for Samsung Exynos processors. We‚Äôre not expecting game-changing results from the first AMD-powered Exynos chipset but it will lay down the foundation for future efforts.

In the face of concerns raised about if the company will have GAA designs out in time to keep pace with competitor TSMC it insists that its first iteration of the technology will begin mass production in 2022.

Samsung's public roadmap was presented recently at its Foundry Forum 2021 in China. Particularly conspicuous in its absence from the slide shown however was Samsung's 3GAE (3nm GAA-Early) the first iteration of their 3nm technology. 3GAE was originally revealed in 2019 alongside its follow-up 3GAP (3nm GAA-Plus) but only the latter was shown off in the presentation.

Prior to this roadmap being revealed there had already been concern brewing over the health of the node; 3GAE had originally been planned for risk production in late 2020 and volume production in 2021 but the company only taped out its first 3nm test chips last month.

Furthermore Dr. Chidi Chidambaram VP of Engineering at Qualcomm Samsung Foundry's largest third-party customer was quoted by SemiAnalysis as estimating GAA technology as only reaching production in 2023-24 at a recent event hosted by Applied Materials.

While the estimate is likely intentionally vague for NDA reasons it still puts Samsung a year behind TSMC's plans for volume production of 3nm-class silicon next year. This combined with the absence of 3GAE on the published roadmap led to speculation that the node had been completely skipped over in favor of 3GAP.

Just to explain the naming by Samsung: 3GAE (Gate-All-Around Early) is missing here. This indicates that the early process is not viable for mass production and got killed completely. 3GAP (Gate-All-Around Plus) now planed for HVM in 2023 which is confirming Qualcomm's statement https://t.co/9GeMcLq3jt --- Andreas Schilling (@aschilling) July 7 2021

When contacted for comment by Anandtech the company said that 3GAE was still due for mass production in 2022 and it's possible that the node isn't being publicized simply because it's reserved for internal usage at Samsung LSI.

However while this was done with other ""-Early"" process variants from the company in the past those were still marked on the map; 5LPE saw third-party usage in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 but that node was itself derived from 7LPP.

The company is also putting out a 4LPP based on more traditional FinFET technology. This (and its predecessor 4LPE) are now listed as their own family of nodes instead of being an evolution from 5nm/7nm-class technologies.

It may be that the process has a substantial enough improvement to warrant marketing as a new ""headline"" node or simply because of more significant differences in design and manufacturing.

Still the absence of 3GAE on the public roadmap and the FinFET-based 4LPP node overlapping with Samsung's stated 2022 target for 3GAE draws uncomfortable comparisons with Cannon Lake Intel's earliest 10nm processors.

Those technically shipped in 2018 to meet investor commitments but were so bad that they were passed over in favor of further evolutions of the older 14nm node; the company now ignores that generation completely insisting that Ice Lake was its first real 10nm line-up.

But perhaps at least the oft-mocked 14+++ was more easily understandable than a branching tree of processes and their sub-evolutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTAvaG93LW11Y2gtdGhlLXNuYXBkcmFnb24taW5zaWRlcnMtcGhvbmUtd2lsbC1jb3N0LWluLWluZGlhLWFuZC1jaGluYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much the Snapdragon Insiders Phone will cost in India and China,"The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will be sold in a number of key markets including China and India. Ahead of its availability in August the device has now been listed on the ASUS online store for India and China along with their respective prices.

The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders (or Snapdragon Insiders Phone) sold in India and China will have the same specifications as the models sold in other regions so buyers will also get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.

According to the listings the phone will sell for ‚Çπ111990 in India which converts to about $1500 the same price the device will go for in the U.S. For those in China the price tag is Ôø•9999 (~$1543). While it is interesting to see that those in India won‚Äôt be paying more the fact is that they will be getting less than the other regions.

For starters the phone will ship with a slower 30W charger (Qualcomm‚Äôs site says it is a 35W charger) compared to the Quick Charge 5 65W charger other regions will be getting. Also the ASUS store listing doesn‚Äôt mention the pair of premium earbuds among the items in the box which means it won‚Äôt be included.

If you thought the sacred WASP uniform ‚Äì a uniform that‚Äôs as old as time itself ‚Äì was the next domino to fall before the global pandemic‚Ä¶ think again. If anything a global pandemic has only provided even more opportunities to thrive.

Two versions of the Ralph Lauren face mask have already been teased earlier this year. The first is The Polo Cloth Mask with an 80% particle filtration rating that‚Äôs perfect for the daily slugger who finds themself in close quarters amongst the concrete jungle (now available to purchase). Naturally it simply wouldn‚Äôt be Ralph without the casual flex. Which is why you can even cop The Polo Cloth Mask in the brand‚Äôs iconic plaid.

If hardcore anti-virus confidence is what you‚Äôre after though you‚Äôll want to step it up with option number two: The Polo High-Filtration Mask ‚Äì a bit of apparel that claims to keep up to 95% of the nasty stuff away from your respiratory system (still to come this summer).

As previously mentioned the Ralph Lauren Polo Cloth Mask is currently available to purchase while the Polo High-Filtration Mask is coming soon. Excluding tax 50% of the net purchase price of each mask will be donated to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO powered by the UN Foundation.

Onda Electronics has not released any graphics card or other computer components as far back as the latter part of last year. With the lack of any website and product updates users were unsure if the company had halted manufacturing completely.

The Onda NVIDIA RTX 3060 Aegis does not have a lot of information about the specifications of the GPU from the company. However sources at VideoCardz suggests that this is the LHR or low hash rate model to keep in competition with other GPU manufacturers.

The RTX 3060 Aegis graphics card features a boost clock of 1780 megahertz but the overclock speed is only three MHz. If this information is correct that would be the lowest overclocking on any of the ONDA GPUs to date. The graphics card features a 2.5 slots and three 90 mm fans a 2.5 slot style and a plastic casing. The back of the card is not completely shown but from one of the profile angle shots of the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Aegis it appears that the backplate is possibly a lightweight metal backplate.

ONDA's new graphics card appears to be geared for a more budget friendly consumer base with the information we have at this time. Or this may be another graphics processing unit to be utilized for cryptomining with Onda Electronics history of bitcoin mining. Hopefully before Onda Electronic's graphics card releases we will have more solid information.

Water-cooled graphics cards aren't exactly new. For years enthusiasts who build their own custom liquid cooling loops have incorporated blocks onto their GPUs to keep the heat at bay without producing a ton of noise. In recent years some manufacturers have released cards with their own closed-loop AIO coolers. Gigabyte has gone a totally different route though: its AORUS gaming brand has announced the RTX 3080 Ti GAMING BOX. This all-in-one Thunderbolt enclosure holds inside it a water-cooled GeForce RTX 3080 Ti NVIDIA has supported external graphics cards on the Thunderbolt 3 bus for quite a while and eGPUs are nothing new. They can give some serious gaming chops to a lightweight notebook that normally relies on integrated graphics. Because of the horsepower of Tiger Lake-based 11th generation CPUs that's actually a pretty viable gaming solution that would allow someone to have a single notebook like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 for travel and for play at home. A Core i7-1165G7 likely has plenty of horsepower to drive games especially at very high resolutions either on an internal 4K display or an external montiro where the graphics card becomes a bottleneck.This modularity does come at the expense of a some performance since the GPU is hamstrung by the 4x PCIe 3.0 connection that Thunderbolt 3 uses. The GPU is limited to a 20 Gbps between the CPU and the graphics card and accelerating a notebook's internal display will use some of that bandwidth as the GPU pushes the frame buffer back to the notebook for display. It's not as big of a deal on an external display that can connect directly to the graphics card however. It's a good thing the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has 12 GB of GDDR6X memory then since it should be able to hold plenty of texture model and shader data to compute complex scenes.The cooler Gigabyte uses in the AORUS RTX 3080 Ti GAMING BOX is an all-in-one closed loop that integrates the pump into the block like many popular AIO CPU coolers. It comes with a 240-millimeter radiator with a pair of 120-mm fans pushing air through the fins and carrying heat out of the chassis. The fans use temperature controls to keep noise to a minimum which is especially appreciated while the GPU isn't in use. The block has an integrated copper plate that covers the GPU VRM and video memory to carry away all excess heat.AORUS added Gigabyte's RGB FUSION 2.0 support to the chassis so that its ""neopunk"" stylings can sync with other RGB hardware and integrate into an existing setup. The RGB Fusion software can turn off all LEDs as well so those who aren't interested in the fancy lighting can just disable it. The company also announced that it's compatible with NVIDIA's Studio drivers for content creation.Pricing has not yet been disclosed but with an external Thunderbolt enclosure all-in-one cooler and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti itself all this external GPU horsepower won't come cheap. While the very worst of the chip shortages may be behind us  the secondary market for new graphics cards hasn't returned to normal yet. However with a cryptocurrency crackdown in China and former miners dumping a glut of used GPUs onto the second-hand market  the market's appetite may yet be sated this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L1Bva2Vtb24tR08tTmlhbnRpYy1zLWVhcm5pbmdzLWZyb20tdGhlLXBvcHVsYXItQVItbW9iaWxlLWdhbWUtcmV2ZWFsZWQuNTUwMjU2LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pok√©mon GO: Niantic's earnings from the popular AR mobile game revealed,"Pok√©mon GO has been an enormous success for Niantic.

According to Sensor Tower Pok√©mon GO has now made Niantic over US$5 billion in half a decade or more than US$1 billion yearly since its launch. Unsurprisingly these figures make Pok√©mon GO one of the most successful games ever not just mobile games.

Pok√©mon GO's total revenue reached US$1.3 billion last year with 2H 2020 outstripping 1H 2020 a common pattern for revenue. However people have already spent over US$600 million in Pok√©mon GO during 1H 2021 with Apple and Google absorbing roughly 30% of that in app store charges.

Apparently Google Play accounts for 52.8% of overall spending compared to 47.2% for iOS. Sensor Tower reports that the game has downloaded 632 million times across Android and iOS since 2016 but 77% of installs have occurred on Android. Hence iOS users tend to spend more on Pok√©mon GO than Android users do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd3lhdC5uZXQvMjAyMS8yNDQ4NDkvbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktZm91bmRlcnMtZWRpdGlvbi1yZXZpZXctdGhlLW5ldy1hbmQtZXhwZW5zaXZlLTRrLWdhbWluZy1jaGFtcGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition Review: The New (And Expensive) 4K Gaming Champion,"Back in September last year NVIDIA gave PC gamers the GeForce RTX 3080 the first card in its arsenal that was truly capable of sustaining high framerates at 4K. Nearly a year later the GPU brand launched a follow-up to it the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.

Now a little more than a month after its grand launch with the RTX 3070 Ti the card has finally arrived in our hands for testing. So without wasting any more time let‚Äôs get started.

Specifications

In comparison to the RTX 3080 NVIDIA is clearly giving the RTX 3080 Ti a lot of love. As I mentioned in initial reports prior to this review the majority of this card is almost akin to the RTX 3090 having nearly as many CUDA cores RT Cores and Tensor Cores as the card itself.

Even its memory bandwidth is similar at just 24GB/s shy of the full monty as is the card‚Äôs TDP of 350W and 384-bit memory bus. That said the RTX 3080 Ti does have only half the amount of graphics memory at 12GB GDDR6X but that is still 2GB more than the RTX 3080.

Design

As it is with all Founders Edition (FE) cards the aesthetics and cooler design of the RTX 3080 Ti is no different than the RTX 3080 FE or RTX 3090 FE. That means you still get the same Dual Axial Flow Through technology the same ultra-compact PCB beneath it and the wickedly cool multi-fin heatsink and cross-pattern look that also serves as the bulk of the card.

In fact the only difference that would allow me to tell the RTX 3080 Ti from its non-Ti sibling is its slightly brighter outlook literally. Side by side the edges and outline of the card actually bear a more polished sheen. At the same time the plates inside these aesthetic boundaries also seem darker in colour.

As is the standard with all graphics cards the RTX 3080 Ti has three DisplayPort 1.4 ports and an HDMI 2.1 port the latter capable of supporting resolutions up to 8K.

Aside from its design though one of the card‚Äôs massive drawbacks would have to be its starting price tag of RM5680. Mind you that‚Äôs just the price of the Founders Edition model so you can imagine just how much AiB partners are marking up the price of their cards.

Testbench

To test the RTX 3080 Ti the other components in my testbed remains the same. This includes the same Ryzen 9 5950X CPU MSI motherboard and 16GB of RAM. For comparison sake I am obviously benching the card against the RTX 3080 FE but also the RTX 3070 Ti FE and AMD Radeon RX 6800XT.

Benchmarks

So the question is: just how much more powerful is the RTX 3080 Ti FE compared to the RTX 3080? The short answer would be not by a whole lot. The longer version of that answer though is that it actually varies from title to title.

On the synthetic benchmark portion of this review you can see the RTX 3080 Ti FE maintaining a decent lead ahead of the other three cards in most scenarios while screaming past in one or two of them.

Suffice to say gaming is when the RTX 3080 Ti FE obviously really begins to come into its own. In the five titles that I use ‚Äì Control Deus Ex: Mankind Divided DOOM Eternal Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Watch Dogs Legion ‚Äì the card is more than able to maintain more than 60 fps in most of them especially in titles without DXR switched on.

For DOOM Eternal I will point out that the average framerate seen here are reflective of the game being run without ray-tracing and DLSS turned on. On average the RTX 3080 Ti FE runs approximately 30 fps faster at 4K and close to 80 fps at 1440p. With ray-tracing and DLSS set to Balanced those numbers obviously drop but to my surprise it was still above the 100 fps mark at 4K.

As for the other two RTX-capable titles it is equally surprising to see the RTX 3080 Ti actually blow the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark out of water and by a significantly wide margin for that matter. With RTX turned on and DLSS disabled the card isn‚Äôt breaking past the 60 fps threshold but it is leaving the other cards in the dust. Likewise the same applies to the other two resolutions.

Watch Dogs Legion seems to be the exception to the rule with the card performing just slightly worse than its non-Ti sibling. What is a little odd is that the card‚Äôs performance in the other two resolutions was identical especially when the framerates should theoretically be higher in Full HD.

Temperature and Power Consumption

In regards to overall temperature the RTX 3080 Ti FE‚Äôs runs only mildly hotter than the RTX 3080 when I tested it at 74.6¬∞C on a full load. Now it should be reiterated that I use an open testbench and the ambient temperature of my lab is always a cool 19¬∞C at all times which are quite likely contributing factors to the obtained temperature. In a closed and encased system the RTX 3080 Ti‚Äôs temperature shoots up and can stay within the 80¬∞C range.

In terms of power consumption the RTX 3080 Ti clearly consumes its stated TGP never going beyond the 350W line.

Conclusion

There is little doubt that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is an absolute unit and like its predecessor continues to push the limits of what NVIDIA‚Äôs Ampere-powered lineup is capable of achieving. That said while we are looking at an average increment of 20 frames across the board for all titles I genuinely do not believe that its starting asking price of RM5680 is entirely justified.

Remember when the RTX 3080 launched NVIDIA had priced it at least half the price of its last generation flagship the RTX 2080 Ti which was sold at an average of RM7000 at the time. If you‚Äôre planning on bumping up from an RTX 3080 I highly recommend that you don‚Äôt. Barring the fact that supply for the card is scarce this really is a graphics card that would better serve those wanting an upgrade from their Turing-power RTX 20 Series cards or older.

A fully human monoclonal antibody dupilumab also improved lung function vs placebo by week 12 an improvement that lasted the length of the 52-week trial.

Dupilumab previously had been shown to be safe and effective in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe asthma patients 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis but its safety and effectiveness for moderate-to-severe asthma in the 6-11 years age group was not known.

Results from the randomized double-blind VOYAGE study conducted across several countries were presented Saturday July 10 at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Hybrid Congress 2021.

Leonard B. Bacharier MD professor of pediatrics allergy/immunology/pulmonary medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville Tennessee presented the results from the trial which was funded by Sanofi/Regeneron.

Dr Leonard Bacharier

Researchers enrolled 408 children ages 6-11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Children on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or medium-to-high‚Äìdose ICS with a second controller were randomly assigned either to add-on subcutaneous dupilumab 100 mg or 200 mg based on body weight at study start or to placebo every 2 weeks for 52 weeks.

Analyses were done in two populations: 350 patients with markers of type 2 inflammation (baseline blood eosinophils ‚â• 150 cells/Œºl or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ‚â• 20 ppb) and 259 patients with baseline blood eosinophils ‚â• 300 cells/¬µl.

""The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations"" Bacharier said. ""The key secondary endpoint was change in percent predicted prebronchodilator FEV1 [forced expiratory volume at 1 second] from baseline to week 12.""

At week 12 the annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate was reduced by 59% (P < .0001) in children with the type 2 inflammatory phenotype and results were similar in those with blood eosinophils ‚â• 300 cells/¬µL compared with placebo.

Results also indicate a favorable safety profile for dupilumab.

Table. Safety Profile of Dupilumab vs Placebo Event Placebo (No. of Patients [%]) Dupilumab (No. of Patients [%]) Any Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 107 (79.9) 225 (83) Any Treatment-Emergent Severe Adverse Event 6 (4.5) 13 (4.8) Any TEAE leading to death 0 (0) 0 (0) Any TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 2 (1.5) 5 (1.8)

James M. Tracy DO an expert with the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology told Medscape Medical News that adding the dupilumab option for children in the 6-11 age group is ""huge.""

Tracy who was not involved with the study said although omalizumab (Xolair Genentech) is also available for these children dupilumab stands out because of the range of comorbidities it can treat.

""[Children] don't have the same rhinosinusitis and polyposis that adults would have but a lot of them have eczema and this drug with multiple prongs is incredibly useful and addresses a broad array of allergic conditions"" Tracy said.

Dr James Tracy

More than 90% of children in the study had at least one concurrent type 2 inflammatory condition including atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor for interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 which are key drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases.

Tracy said that while dupilumab is not the only drug available to treat children 6-11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma it is ""a significant and unique addition to the armamentarium of the individual practitioner taking care of these very severe asthmatics in the 6-11 age group.""

Dupilumab also led to rapid and sustained improvement in lung function. At 12 weeks children assigned dupilumab improved their lung function as measured by FEV1 by 5.21% (P = .0009) and that continued through the 52-week study period.

""What we know is the [improved lung function] effect is sustained. What we don't know is how long you have to keep on the drug for a more permanent effect which is an issue for all these biologics"" Tracy said.

Bacharier reported speaker fees and research support from Sanofi/Regeneron. Tracy has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Iran‚Äôs railroad service became a victim of a cyberattack on July 9 with hackers posting fake delay messages or cancellations on display boards at stations across the country. A semi-official news agency in Iran reported that the hackers had sent messages such as ‚Äúlong delayed because of cyberattack‚Äù or ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù on the boards. Further they also urged the passengers to call for information on a number that belonged to Iran‚Äôs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Fars news agency also stated in the report that the hack led to ‚Äúunprecedented chaos‚Äù at the railway stations.

Till now no group has taken the responsibility for the hack. Earlier on Friday the news agency had also reported that trains across Iran had lost their electronic tracking system but it was not immediately clear if that was also part of the massive cyberattack. Reportedly Fars then removed its report and instead quoted the spokesperson of the state railway company Sadegh Sekri saying ‚Äúthe disruption‚Äù did not cause any problem for the normal functioning of the rail services.

Back in 2019 multiple delays occurred in train services due to an error in the railway company‚Äôs computer. In December of that same year Iran‚Äôs telecommunications ministry had said that the country had defused a major cyberattack on unspecified ‚Äúelectronic infrastructure.‚Äù However the officials did not provide any more details regarding the purported attack.

Unclear if attack caused any disruption in system

As per The Associated Press report it was not immediately clear if the latest reported attack caused any disruptions in Iran‚Äôs computer and internet systems and whether it was the most recent incident in the United States and Iran‚Äôs cyber operations targeting the other. Reportedly Iran has already disconnected most of its infrastructure from the internet after the Stuxnet computer virus which in Iran is believed to be a product of US-Israeli collaboration. In the late 2000s the same virus had disrupted thousands of Iranian centrifuges in the country‚Äôs nuclear sites.

RHI,Robert Half,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWdyZWF0LXJlc2h1ZmZsZS11cHdhcmQtbW9iaWxpdHktcXVpdHRpbmctam9ic9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Frenzy in the Job Market Is Getting Crazier by the Day,"In the 25 years that Dawn Fay has been in the recruiting business she's seen a hot job market several times. But nothing she says comes close to the frenzy she's seeing right now as the economy begins to boom in the wake of the pandemic. ""It's just wild"" Fay a senior district president at the staffing firm Robert Half told me. ""There is so much movement in the market. The churn is amazing to see.""

""Churn"" may be something of an understatement: It's downright chaos at HR departments across the US. So many Americans have quit their jobs this spring that the resignation rate has skyrocketed to a two-decade high. And people aren't just looking to switch employers. Many are taking advantage of the market to supercharge their careers landing positions with higher salaries and better opportunities for advancement. Some are jumping into new professions altogether. Others are climbing the ladder at their current workplace snagging promotions that wouldn't have been on offer before the pandemic.

The result is an economy-wide game of musical chairs ‚Äî a wholesale transformation of the job market that has left employers scrambling to retain employees and attract new ones. Call it The Great Reshuffle. Today according to a national survey that economists at Arizona State and Virginia Commonwealth conducted with the Dallas Fed one in four Americans works for a different employer than the one they had before COVID-19 struck. In the process 26% of those job-switchers have ended up with a salary bump of 10% or larger.

""Something has fundamentally changed"" said John Haltiwanger an economics professor at the University of Maryland and one of the country's foremost experts on job creation. ""It's been a very long time since the US economy has exhibited the kind of dynamism that's been associated with periods of really rapid growth. It appears that we're in a period like that right now.""

At first it looked as if the job boom might be limited to low-wage workers at restaurants which were forced to offer higher pay and big bonuses as they scrambled to reopen. But recruiters HR executives and career coaches I spoke with report that the bidding wars have spread to include professionals as well. ""It's crazy"" said Kathleen Duffy president and CEO of the recruiting firm Duffy Group. ""It's all across the board."" To land entry-level employees companies are offering signing bonuses as large as $5000. For mid-career hotshots firms are being thrust into bidding wars with four or five rivals and having to sweeten their usual offers by tens of thousands of dollars. And at the executive level one headhunter told me about a recent job offer that would not only allow the candidate to work from home halfway across the country from the company's headquarters but also give them access to a private jet for business trips.

The hiring boom showed up first in low-wage jobs ‚Äî but now recruiters are seeing a red-hot job market everywhere. MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty Images

From stagnation to shock

For the economy as a whole The Great Reshuffle is a good thing. Sectors that are productive and growing rapidly can suck up the workers they need from more sluggish parts of the economy and put them to better use. Workers meanwhile benefit from what Haltiwanger calls ""a healthy job ladder"" one where it's relatively easy to get a job and move up quickly. And if the reshuffle continues enabling millions of Americans to build better careers for themselves it could set the stage for a decade of stronger and more equitable growth.

The last time the job ladder was in good shape was the 1990s during the sustained boom of the Clinton years. The Bush era proceeded to whittle away its lower rungs but it was the Great Recession that knocked it over entirely stranding workers in place for years. The unemployed couldn't find work and those who already had a job were too scared to quit and look for a new one. Then COVID-19 hit. Millions found themselves out of work and 73% of those who managed to find a new employer in the first few months of the pandemic were forced to take a pay cut of at least 10% according to the Dallas Fed survey. It was a gigantic reallocation of labor but not the kind that economists like to see.

Now thanks to widespread vaccinations and trillions of dollars in government stimulus the bad chaos of 2020 has morphed into a good chaos of 2021. Millions of Americans are voluntarily leaving their jobs for better ones at a speed we haven't seen since the turn of the millennium. ""We're still relatively early on in this rapid bout of restructuring"" Haltiwanger told me ""but there's some indication we're in for a late 1990s kind of surge. I think we can be optimistic.""

So why are so many people switching jobs now in the wake of a pandemic? The most important factor is the economy's sudden shift to working from home. Employers are rolling out all kinds of different policies ‚Äî from office-only to fully remote ‚Äî and workers are shopping around for the arrangement that works best for them. Nicholas Bloom an economics professor at Stanford who has been studying remote work since before COVID told me in April that this part of the reshuffle will probably take a few years to play out creating a tumultuous transition.

The second factor is existential: The trauma and solitude of the past year made people step back and reexamine their careers in a new way. Amanda Gulino a career coach told me that before the pandemic her clients wanted help with things like managing their direct reports or landing a job with a little more pay. But last summer their concerns suddenly got much deeper. ""I've been tolerating this job forever"" many told her ""and now that I'm home and I'm not seeing anyone I realize how much I hate it."" The flood of inquiries hasn't let up and Gulino now has a two-month waiting list.

Combine those two pandemic factors with a rapid economic rebound that's generated a record number of job openings and you have the makings of a job-switching bonanza. The competition is especially fierce in the tech industry where HR executives say that as many as 70% of finalists for engineering and product roles are turning down job offers because they have so many to choose from. Splash an online platform for event marketing has found itself competing for candidates who have been offered salaries that are off the charts. ""I'm hearing from candidates 'Well I have in my hand an offer for $45000 more'"" Liz Hall Splash's chief people officer told me. ""That just wasn't happening before.""

But the bidding wars go far beyond tech. Tyler Haven 24 was so emotionally drained by his job caring for teenagers at a residential treatment center in Utah that he recently gave notice without having another job lined up. In a normal economy that would have been a risky move. But in this one he got a job offer the same day from an organization where he had applied a few weeks earlier. His new position which he's allowed to do from home came with better hours a 27% pay bump and the chance to transition into a more stable career in public policy. ""I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck"" Haven who doesn't have a college degree told me. ""I plan to set myself up a little bit better than I have for the past six years.""

Quitters help everyone

The Great Reshuffle doesn't just benefit quitters like Haven. Every person who leaves a company ups the pressure on managers to persuade everyone else to stay. That means lavish counteroffers for those who get wooed by a competitor and across-the-board raises and retention bonuses to prevent others from jumping ship.

Splash the event-marketing platform got ahead of the trend earlier this year by doling out more promotions than ever. But attrition still rose. Hall told me that the company would probably hand out more promotions and raises in the fall ‚Äî even though it typically does so only at the start of its annual performance cycles. ""The economy is just crazy"" Hall said. ""We hire three people and one gives notice. We hire three more people and another gives notice.""

Even Amazon the US's second-largest employer has been forced to bend the knee in The Great Reshuffle. On March 30 the company notified all employees working from home that they would have to return to the office. As my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart reported competitors were quick to swoop in. One employee who wanted to stay remote received a recruiting email from Facebook the day after the announcement. Oracle went even further posting a recruiting message on LinkedIn that targeted disgruntled Amazon employees. Amazon quickly backtracked relaxing its ""office-centric"" demands. In a job market as hot as this one even the biggest employers have to respond to what workers want.

That's not to say that everyone will benefit from the job churn. Economic upheaval always creates winners and losers. In decades past the losers were the manufacturing workers who lost jobs to globalization. In the post-COVID economy they will be the restaurant workers and owners who used to serve lunch to bustling office crowds in cities like San Francisco and New York. ""Reallocation is a costly process"" Haltiwanger told me. ""You always need to think about the folks left behind.""

The good news is The Great Reshuffle is shaping up to be a net good for most workers especially those with the least bargaining power. In a stagnant job market Haltiwanger and his coauthor Steven Davis found it's tough for younger and less-educated workers to find a job. But during a boom companies don't just hire to expand ‚Äî they also hire to replace the people they've lost. And the more desperate they get the more likely they'll be to take a chance on someone they wouldn't have considered before.

Fay the recruiting executive at Robert Half has already noticed a change among hiring managers. ""I'm seeing people more willing to broaden their minds"" she told me. ""Whether it be somebody who doesn't have all the skills somebody who doesn't have as much experience or somebody who hasn't been in that industry or the workforce for a long time."" The nightmare of the pandemic in other words has forged the rarest and most essential element of the American Dream: genuine opportunity.

Parlons Opelousas

Recently on Facebook there was a post from someone that resulted in comments from others about Euzebe Vidrine and the 1924 murder of Robert Leo Wiggins of nearby Evangeline Parish.

I knew this story and actually wrote about it in the book I co-authored with Aimee Ardoin Guillory titled ‚ÄúLa Famille Ardoin de la Louisiane‚Äù published by Andrepont Printing Inc. in 1990.

Let‚Äôs talk about that.

Robert Leo Wiggins was born on Feb. 7 1897 in Ville Platte. He was the son of Robert Lee Wiggins sheriff of Evangeline Parish and Eva Ludeau. On Aug. 7 1921 he married Sarah Hazel Ardoin the daughter of Dr. Yves Ardoin and Nancy Amelia Thompson. Dr. Ardoin was the coroner of Evangeline Parish. The young couple were well known and highly respected in the Evangeline Parish area. They were very happy in love and looked forward to having a family and spending a long life together.

Leo Wiggins as he was known by his friends opened a store in Ville Platte and had a promising business career ahead of him. On Monday May 19 1924 at about 3 p.m. Leo left Ville Platte by car for Mamou a journey of about 18 miles. He drove down a beautiful peaceful country road ‚Äî a woodland beauty spot at that time. By 4 p.m. he arrived at Mamou and took care of some business. On his way out of town at about 4:30 p.m. he stopped at Guillory Brothers store on the Ville Platte highway.

There he met a traveling man looking for directions and information about a road to Ville Platte. Wiggins said ‚ÄúTrail me I‚Äôm headed for Ville Platte.‚Äù Wiggins left the store and a few minutes later the traveler followed.

About two and a half miles from Ville Platte almost half way between Mrs. Thomas Vidrine‚Äôs home and the Baskin Fontenot Bridge on Bayou Jos. Manuel the traveler saw a Ford coupe bogged in a gully on the north side of the road. He saw a young man step from the car and walk away into the woods.

At about 5:30 p.m. Pascale Reed was traveling through the woods bordering the highway on his way to the home of a relative when he noticed someone behind a tree. He investigated and discovered the body of Robert Leo Wiggins. The body was still warm.

Reed informed neighbors who immediately went to the site and summoned Ville Platte law officers. Coroner Dr. Yves Ardoin was also summoned to the scene. Dr. Ardoin who was the father of the murdered man‚Äôs wife took up the formal inquest and had the body removed to his home where the inquest was continued. He called the traveling man for consultation. As he questioned area residents and continued his investigation he began to realize that the crime had probably been committed by Euzebe Vidrine a local resident who had been suspected of similar murders in the area during that time.

Ardoin asked the sheriff‚Äôs office to send officers to guard the house of Mrs. Archille Vidrine the mother of Euzebe. Other officers were sent to guard the Wiggins car bogged in the woods. When Evangeline District Attorney Lee Garland arrived and the evidence in hand was presented to him he awakened Justice Eraste Dupre and a warrant was issued for Euzebe Vidrine. Vidrine was hiding out in the woods for most of the night. At 5:30 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday May 20 1924 approximately 12 hours after Leo Wiggins was murdered Euzebe was found at his mother‚Äôs home and placed under arrest.

Vidrine was wearing blood-stained clothing and shoes at the time of his arrest. His shoes and clothing along with a .22-caliber pistol a score of cartridges the bullets corresponding to those fired into Leo Wiggins including one found under his shirt when his body was being dressed were all submitted as evidence of the crime evidence that supported the murder charge against Vidrine.

After further investigation it was reported that Vidrine had flagged Wiggins down on the highway as he was passing and it is likely that Wiggins thought the man wanted to come into town and stopped to pick him up. He opened the right-hand door to let the man into the car. The murderer fired two shots and dragged the dead man‚Äôs body from the car across the ditch at the roadside and placed it behind the tree. Then he got into the car and turning into the woods headed back toward Mamou in an effort to get away. The car was bogged in the gully alongside the road.

Who was Euzebe Vidrine?

The son of Archille Vidrine and Aureline Fontenot Euzebe was born on July 12 1898 in Ville Platte. On Aug. 20 1918 he married Lillian Andrus. She was 14 and he was 20.

In his own words written in his autobiography Euzebe describes himself as: ‚ÄúI have been reared by an honorable father and mother they reared me to the best of their knowledge. And I always showed a tender heart to my people and always did not only to my people but to everybody. I was partly reared with five sisters and four brothers. They had no trouble with me.‚Äù

Euzebe Vidrine trial began on June 29 1924 and he was convicted of the murder of Robert Leo Wiggins. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Euzebe Vidrine was executed on Friday Aug. 8 1924. It was the first and last legal hanging in Evangeline Parish.

After addressing a large crowd for about 45 minutes his last words were ‚ÄúCut it Charley and be my friend.‚Äù

The body was put on public display and later moved to the home of his mother. A brief service was held at Sacred Heart Catholic Church with burial in the Te-Mamou Cemetery on Highway 167 near Ville Platte.

Vidrine‚Äôs sentence was carried out. The case of the murder of Robert Leo Wiggins was closed and the story could finally be ended. But that story would never end.

While in jail awaiting his execution Euzebe wrote a book about his life. It was published by Aurelis Mayeaux V. L. Dupuis and J. Hugo Dore of Ville Platte and printed by the Clarion Press of Opelousas in 1924. In that book he admitted to all the crimes and wrongdoing in his life and confessed to the murders of four other men. One of those men was killed in Orange Texas and another man was in prison convicted of that murder. Before he died Vidrine asked officials to contact law officers in Texas and make sure that innocent man was released from jail.

The book titled ""The Life of Euzebe Vidrine"" was released on the day he was executed. His story was read by many and repeated over and over again from generation to generation. What seemed to be the end of a story in the middle of that hot August day of 1924 continues to this day. The story of the murder of Robert Leo Wiggins and the life of Euzebe Vidrine effected many people and it was never forgotten.

He finished his career with three NBA championships three MVPs and 12 NBA All-Star Game appearances. He also ended his playing days with 21791 regular-season points.

Back in Bird‚Äôs playing days he credited one unselfish teammate for helping him score all those points. Without him Bird said he wouldn‚Äôt have scored half his points.

Larry Bird said the best player he ever played with was Dennis Johnson

During his 13 years in the league Bird played with some pretty good teammates. During a one-on-one interview with Magic Johnson Johnson asked Bird who the smartest player he‚Äôs ever played with was.

‚ÄúDennis Johnson‚Äù Bird quickly said in the video posted by The Universe Galaxy in January 2020.

Then he was asked the best player he‚Äôs ever played with.

‚ÄúProbably Dennis Johnson but it‚Äôs close between Kevin (McHale) and Dennis Johnson‚Äù Bird told Johnson. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre two different types of players. I always thought if we really needed something big Dennis was always shooting 44 percent during the regular season and then 60 in the playoffs.

‚ÄúKevin was incredible. You know you played against him. But D.J. was a guy I loved to play with. He thought the same way I did and he was pretty good.‚Äù

Larry Bird gave credit to Robert Parish for helping him with his scoring

Bird was always one to give credit to his teammates. He got all the attention with his all-out efforts and his big-time scoring but he always made sure to point out the little things that helped him become so successful. He had a lot of respect for Johnson and center Robert Parish two guys who always did those little things that never showed up in the box score.

Bird credited Parish with helping him scoring many of his points even without the big guy touching the ball.

‚ÄúEverybody knew when we needed a basket DJ passed me the ball and I came off a pick set by Robert who sets the best pick in the world‚Äù he told Sports Illustrated during a West Coast Trip in 1991. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how he does it. Now I don‚Äôt come off those picks as much because that‚Äôs not our offense. But if it wasn‚Äôt for Robert I wouldn‚Äôt have scored half the points I have.‚Äù

Bird wasn‚Äôt sure if Parish was sick of him getting all the baskets because of his screens. Bird got the credit. Parish went unnoticed.

‚ÄúDoes he resent me?‚Äù Bird asked. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure pretty near everybody has a little resentment toward me. They‚Äôre out there working their asses off and all you hear is ‚ÄòLarry Bird‚Äôs in town‚Äô or ‚ÄòLarry Bird and the Celtics are here.‚Äô I never talked about it with ‚Äôem but what can I do about it? I‚Äôm not gonna quit playin‚Äô as hard as I can because I get publicity.‚Äù

Parish was No. 3 of the Celtics‚Äô Big Three

The Warriors traded Robert Parish & the 3rd pick in the 1980 Draft to the Celtics for the 1st & 13th pick in the Draft.

The Celtics selected Kevin McHale https://t.co/NUzaYZEjUC pic.twitter.com/7mXuFyxCZO ‚Äî Ballislife.com (@Ballislife) August 30 2019

Parish was the no-nonsense man in the middle for the Celtics. He teamed with Bird and McHale for their version of the Big Three. He was just as happy setting 20 picks as he was scoring 20 points. Parish was mild-mannered but he could turn things up when triggered. Such was the case on that ‚Äô91 West Coast swing when the Celtics were taking on the rival Lakers and a young trash-talking Vlade Divac.

According to Sports Illustrated Divac had been quoted a few days earlier saying the game against Boston was ‚Äúan exhibition.‚Äù Celtics assistant coach Jon Jennings brought it to Parish‚Äôs attention.

‚ÄúWell screw Vlade Divac‚Äù Parish said.

Parish put up 21 points in the first quarter.

‚ÄúVlade got his reverse dunk‚Äù said McHale after the Celtics‚Äô 98-85 win ‚Äúand Robert got 29.‚Äù

Parish was content being the screen-setter for Bird but clearly proved he could do some of that scoring on his own.",,,,,,

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

The global digital twin market is expected to witness rapid development in the coming years thanks to its increased adoption by enterprises to effectively manage various critical activities of their business. As the term suggests it is considered as a digital counterpart of a real-time or physical machine or process. It can be a computer program that is quite useful for conducting virtual simulations of a physical product or process to understand and estimate its future performance.

Several governments across the world are showing their support towards the development of advanced production technologies in the form of favorable initiatives and policies. Digital twins are becoming quite popular among companies as they help them analyze the future performance of an object or process thereby saving a lot of money time and effort for the organization. For instance ORE Catapult and James Fisher Asset Information Services Ltd. in April 2020 announced a strategic alliance to use digital twin technology for effective offshore wind management.

The top trends that will bolster the global digital twin industry are given below:

Use of advanced technologies will drive digital twin industry in Europe:

Europe‚Äôs digital twin market size is anticipated to go past the valuation of $9.5 billion during the forecast period of 2020-2026. The region is widely known for the creation and use of advanced technologies across different industries. Digital twin technology has picked up pace in recent years in several countries across Europe because of the rising need for virtual technologies and high-end analytical tools to help build future processes across industries.

GHENOVA Ingenieria launched its own digital twin center named GHENOVA 360 in May 2020. The launch will help in the creation and deployment of naval systems and has enabled the company to deliver solutions to military ship manufacturers.

The automotive industry will use digital twins to improve product performance:

Digital twin technology will find increased application in the European automotive industry. The automotive sector will use this technology to analyze the performance of vehicles and make desired changes. It will help companies make improvements in the overall design and efficiency of the vehicles as well. Advanced technologies like AI IoT and IIoT are being increasingly adopted to continuously enhance the driving experience for the owners. The use of digital twin technology even helps predict potential risks in vehicles and provides solutions for the same.

Germany‚Äôs role in the European digital twin industry :

Germany is known for its use of advanced technologies and will play a key role in the development of the digital twin market in Europe. Digitization is taking place on a large scale across different sectors like healthcare in the country. This has prompted the development of digital twin solutions among many domestic companies.

Siemens AG announced a partnership with Atos SE to create digital twin services for the pharmaceutical sector. Various technologies like AI IoT and IIoT are being used in digital twin processes to analyze the overall efficiency in the production of pharmaceutical products and make improvements accordingly. The use of this advanced technology has helped increase the overall reliability and quality of processes.

Improved design and performance demand in North America:

North America‚Äôs digital twin market is expected to become worth nearly $1.5 billion in valuation over the coming years. There has been a growing need for improving the design and performance of the products and services among the regional producers. In fact the product design and development application held a share of nearly 50% in the regional digital twin market in 2019. The demand for detecting faults beforehand and making significant improvements in the design and performance of the product has stimulated the need for using digital twins.

This technology helps in saving a lot of money time and efforts of companies by speeding up the designing procedures which ultimately helps in launching new products at a faster rate.

North America aerospace and defense sector uses digital twin:

The aerospace and defense sector in North America will increasingly adopt digital twin technology through 2026. One of the main reasons for this substantial rise in demand is the need to reduce casualties and increase the efficiency of military weapons. Digital twin technology helps in creating virtual models of weapons and other components to understand their current status.

The data received from real-time machinery helps the advanced technology in detecting potential faults in these weapons and even helps in predicting the exact time when maintenance will be required. The aircraft industry is using digital twins of real airplanes and feeding them with real-time data to improve the reliability of their functioning and reduce the overall cost of maintenance. They effectively help in enhancing the performance of the airplanes as well.

The rise in industry 4.0 practices will foster APAC digital twin market:

The Asian Pacific digital twin market will become worth more than $11 billion in valuation by 2026. Industry 4.0 is seeing rapid adoption across different sectors and is helping them become digital in many ways. The use of digital twin technology will enable industries in bridging the gap between the virtual and physical world and will even play an important role in enhancing overall efficiency and productivity. Toyota had for example had displayed its concept of futuristic warehouses with digital twin in April 2019 having intelligent pre-trained forklifts and lean logistics.

Higher focus on process support and services in Asia Pacific:

Digital twin technology solutions will find increased application in process support and services segment in Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific digital twin market share from the application is anticipated to grow at 35% CAGR throughout the mentioned forecast timeline. Processes of several industries can be improved with the help of digital twins; they can even be used to reduce the overall maintenance costs by predicting faults beforehand. These efforts will improve customer experience reduce overhead costs incurred in repair and maintenance and optimize manpower use in the manufacturing processes.

Some of the prominent companies involved in providing digital twin technology solutions across the world are Oracle Corporation IBM Corporation Siemens AG PTC Inc. SAS Institute Inc. Rockwell Automation Schneider Electric and some others.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""I'll be honest I've met Seth multiple times and he's met me and I don't think we'll ever be best friends [laughs]"" Riddle said. ""I don't think we like one another we're just two different people. [Although] we both love wrestling. I know my significant other said something about Becky that they didn't like and I also did not like or agree with. Seth didn't like me after that and I don't think Becky liked me or my wife either which is understandable. It is what it is.""

Riddle and Rollins will be joined by King Shinsuke Nakamura Big E Kevin Owens Ricochet John Morrison and Drew McIntyre in next Sunday's Men's MITB match. You can click here for the updated PPV card.

The two men will be sharing the ring for the first time since the 2021 Royal Rumble where Rollins eliminated Riddle after a Curb Stomp.

Ross who is a judge in The Circle Awards (read more about that here) is a global leader in clean green beauty winning a slew of awards around the world plus a legion of adoring customers for her colourful‚Äîand accessible‚Äîrange of nail polishes and lipsticks. Aside from her obvious grit and tenacity (she started the business with little more than $50 in her pocket) our favourite part about Ross is that despite the huge success of Kester Black she remains incredibly humble.

The epitome of a hard-working entrepreneur who thrives on the hustle we caught up with Ross to talk about how she built Kester Black from the ground up and why the circular economy is something we all need to embrace. Prepare to be seriously inspired.

When did you launch Kester Black and what inspired you to come up with the idea?

Kester Black began in 2008 as a clothing label while I was studying a Bachelor of Design majoring in fashion at Otago Polytechnic. When I graduated my mum suggested I broaden my horizons overseas so I packed my bags and began searching for a job in Melbourne.

After landing myself a job in retail I began making jewellery and selling it back to New Zealand (and in Australia at a store called Life With Bird) and that seemed to be quite successful for a few years. After a year in retail I finally landed my dream job‚Äîdesign assistant for a well known Australian fashion label. I worked in that role for just over a year until I was offered a production manager role for another large company in the industry. The pay they were offering was more than double what I was on but the catch was that I would have to give up my own little business. I felt like I had worked so hard for the last two and a half years to just give it all up. So I turned down the job and worked on building Kester Black.

And how did you make the switch to nail polish?

I had decided I was bored of working with sterling silver and began researching enamel paints to use on the jewellery I was making. It led me to looking into nail polish where I saw a gap in the market. I decided to manufacture and sell my own nail polish line to complement my jewellery. The first six colours were launched in 2012 but the brand as you know it today was registered in 2014 so let‚Äôs call it our 7th birthday.

What was the biggest challenge in getting Kester Black off the ground?

Finding a manufacturer willing to work with me! Because I was a nobody‚Äîa university graduate with a fashion portfolio‚Äîso they didn‚Äôt really take me seriously. I ended up hustling this manufacturer in Australia for over a year and a half emailing every week and then they were so sick of me they let me order 50 units of each colour‚Äîeven though their minimum order was 400.

Fortunately I sold out within a week and placed another order. But that first order for around $2500 would have bankrupt my business if it didn't work out. It was a total gamble to do it back then because I didn't have capital or anything that was just money saved from my wages.

I read that you changed the formula of the polish early on after an encounter with a customer‚Äîcan you talk me through that?

Yes this shows the beauty of a small business‚Äîwe can do cool shit like this. I was at the Big Design Market in Melbourne in 2015 and a girl came over and asked me if the nail polishes were breathable. I was like what is that? She explained that Muslim women can only wear breathable nail polish when they pray so many don‚Äôt wear any at all. I thought ok then I‚Äôll make you a breathable nail polish.

I spoke to our formulator who followed all the correct standards and two months later he was like yeah we can do this. I want to have a product that's accessible for everybody so I‚Äôm glad we made the change and for a very long time Malaysia was our second biggest market because of the breathability of the nail polish.

Sustainability is at the core of Kester Black‚Äîhow do you ensure it encompasses all elements of the business?

We open sourced all of our formulations from the get go and accreditations have been a big part of what we do. I wanted external certifications to validate the claims we were making as a brand so we got Cruelty Free and Vegan certifications early on and we were the first cosmetics company in the world to become a certified B Corp. This rigorous certification isn‚Äôt easily achieved and takes serious commitment to transparency and sustainability. We have also been certified carbon neutral since 2017.

These ethical considerations have seen Kester Black gain a cult-like following and recognition globally. We have been awarded over 24 awards most of them global programs and we‚Äôre stocked in major department stores across Europe including Liberty London NK Stockholm and Ka De We Berlin.

What‚Äôs been one of the biggest career highlights thus far?

When I won the Telstra Business Women's Award because of the work that we've been doing around sustainability and inclusion in the business. I was so excited when I won because I was up against really experienced business people. And let's be honest I didn't know anything about business back then. And the other huge highlight was getting stocked in Liberty in London because it‚Äôs one of the most well known international department stores and they wanted our stuff! It means that we're doing something right.

Who or what inspires you and your work?

I would say nature in general inspires me but I also find myself impressed with two companies in particular. Patagonia is an obvious one because they're leading the way in business and sustainability‚Äîthey show normal people what it means to make a stand for something within a company for the environment. The second company is Natura. They‚Äôre actually a giant company that owns the likes of AESOP and The Body Shop and they‚Äôre B Corp. I know how hard it was for us to B Corp and we‚Äôre so much smaller so for them to achieve that and be in beauty is huge.

What‚Äôs the biggest misconception about running your own business?

First of all that you make lots of money. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily true (and hasn‚Äôt been for us). The benefit having your own business is the possibility of a payout or passive income stream far into the future but you have to be OK with the possibility of never getting it. Everything could go belly up before you make it.

The obligation to your staff is a big one and I wish more people realised that as an employer more often than not staff are paid a lot more than the owners. That seems to be the case for most small business owners that I know.

And finally that you have heaps of free time to live a desired lifestyle. We work so hard and for so many hours that although we could go for a midday coffee we‚Äôre generally making up that time working late into the night.

You‚Äôre a judge for The Circle Awards‚Äîwhy did you get involved and why is the Circular Economy so important to you?

The beauty industry is quite complex and to say the least not exactly in line with circular economy practices. I have found it really difficult moving from the fashion industry into beauty. I see many fashion brands embracing sustainable and circular practices and not much innovation coming out of the beauty industry. I wanted to see what innovative ideas people are coming up with to see if we can implement within our industry. The main problem we see in beauty is not that brands lack innovation but that manufacturers lack flexibility. The technology is there (think eco /carbon positive packaging materials) it's just that manufacturers refuse to even test the viability of a new material or packaging concept with the formulations etc.

The more we can get the general public excited in this new way of design/manufacturing and consumption the more every industry will respond and embrace new technology and innovation.

What are some ways people can embrace the Circular Economy in their everyday lives and business?

Put simply consume less consume better and create systemic change. How can you live that in your everyday life? There are so many ways. The most obvious is when it comes to shopping though. Say no to any unnecessary packaging when purchasing in store. We love shopping at the bulk source and take along our own jars.

I also recommend that you read/watch The Minimalist‚Äîthis will help you question whether you need all ‚Äòthat‚Äô stuff! Some others that spring to mind is composting food waste and setting up a mini permaculture garden. It‚Äôs also the little things that really do help carpool to work use reusable drink bottles and buy quality things so you only buy once (like furniture) rather than spending more money over the long term on couches that snap in half when you jump on them (that has actually happened to me).

Finally what advice would you give to young entrepreneurs out there?

Honestly there are so many things I want to say but I‚Äôm going to go super practical here. If you‚Äôre starting your own business the right tools are incredibly important. When I started my business I did everything on a spreadsheet because I was trying to keep costs low but I wish I had gotten onto accounting software earlier (I like Xero accounting software) because you can really start to look into details of your business and see where growth is possible and your margins. It's so worth the money from what you can get out of it.

What started off as a small general store in 1921 soon expanded to a thriving dancehall in 1935 and after four generations of serving the people of Co Antrim and further afield the rest is history.



The Rinkha now a thriving general store once again is in the safe hands of third-generation owner William Hawkins and his son Ross.



Speaking to Belfast Live William spoke about the rich history of The Rinkha and how it all started with his grandfather W.J Hawkins.

(Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live)

He said: ‚ÄúWhen he built this place as a dancehall it was quite a large building for its time - there was no houses around it all just green fields so a lot of the local community thought he wasn‚Äôt wise.



‚ÄúDuring the Second World War American soldiers were stationed nearby and my grandfather would ever so often give them a dance hall to let them run their own dances.



‚ÄúAnd in those days this was good old conservative Islandmagee and a few eyebrows raised so my grandfather got a few signs made to please the clergy.‚Äù



Showbands from all over Ireland would make the journey to Islandmagee to play The Rhinka before the music scene began to change in the 60s.

(Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live)

‚ÄúAt that stage my father the second generation was left with this huge building out in the middle of nowhere so he decided to change it into what you see now.



‚ÄúThe common denominator in all of that was the ice cream - it started in the original Gobbins Stores in 1921‚Äù he explained.



Since joining the business full-time in 2004 fourth-generation son Ross has taken that famous ice cream recipe and grown it to the popular attraction it is today.



Ross said: ‚ÄúMy great grandmother Henrietta Hawkins came up with the recipe and when The Rinkha was built the ice cream was moved over here and it‚Äôs always been the front of the shop ever since.



‚ÄúI started with different flavours like strawberry chocolate and mint and they worked okay but then a friend of the industry suggested we work out of a cabinet because we were still at that stage working out the old fashion churns.

(Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live)

‚ÄúOnly a year later we ended up scrapping the single cabinet for a second one as it just took off.‚Äù



In 2019 Ross‚Äôs innovation with their original recipe paid off as their Turkish Delight flavour won Best Flavour in the UK a massive achievement for a small family-run business.



Ross described that what makes their ice cream a massive pull for the business is that it is ‚Äútruly homemade‚Äù based on the same recipe that was created in 1921.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a special product to us our customers and the community - people drive here for the experience not just a shop and if we have this ice cream everywhere it would not be the same‚Äù he added.



What William and Ross both agree makes The Rinkha more than just a general store is the customers old and young that make the journey to see them.



William said: ‚ÄúWe still have people coming in to say my father used to buy me toys here and now they‚Äôre buying toys for their kids.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rare thing now to have a family business that has lasted the pace and never closed its doors.‚Äù



Ross continued: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been a destination spot as people would‚Äôve come from Belfast and all over for the dances and ice cream and that‚Äôs carried on right up until today.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people that come here that met in the dancehall days and their children now come in - it‚Äôs a special place to a lot of people with a lot of sentiment.‚Äù



A full-circle moment came for the family in 2013 when they opened a new cafe within The Rinkha which had the original Canadian maple wooden floors danced on for decades by thousands of feet.

‚ÄúThe very last dance was held in 1968 and two of the local ladies who still live here were at the last dance so when we opened up the caf√© those two ladies turned up‚Äù William explained.



‚ÄúWe thought we knew everything that was going to happen that night but as things start to settle down people went up into the caf√© and started dancing on the original dancefloor and the first two ladies up that night were the two ladies at the last dance.‚Äù



The Rinkha is showing no plans of stopping and William hopes for the next 100 years they can ‚Äúkeep doing what we have always done‚Äù.



‚ÄúOne of our successes is being able to react quickly - we‚Äôre big enough to absorb change but not too big that we can‚Äôt adapt quickly.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had to continually adapt and evolve to try and stay ahead of the game.‚Äù



Ross added: ‚ÄúIt has always been a big part of Islandmagee and we want to carry on what we‚Äôre doing and what we know best which is ice cream.‚Äù",,,,,,

The Royal Caribbean‚Äôs Serenade of the Seas is on a simulated voyage per requirements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test protocols for safe voyages KTUU reported.

It left Seattle and docked in Ketchikan for around eight hours before heading back south to Seattle in the evening. It had around 10% of its full passenger capacity.

A smattering of Ketchikan residents came out in light rain to greet the ship as it pulled into port around 7 a.m.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very excited we‚Äôve been waiting for this for a long time‚Äù said Norbert Garney. ‚ÄúHopefully there will be a whole lot more ships after this one.‚Äù

Passengers disembarked wearing faces masks. Many are employed by Royal Caribbean and volunteered for the test sailing before cruise ships with more passengers start arriving later in July and through October.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to be back‚Äù said Sean Rollins a passenger on the downtown Ketchikan dock. ‚ÄúI think everybody is really dying to get out and explore again everybody has been yearning for a vacation for 15 months.‚Äù

Tour operators were ready for the 300 or so passengers stepping off into Ketchikan.

Rick Thomas owner of Sourdough Tours spoke about the challenges facing the city. The local visitor‚Äôs bureau estimates the city lost $250 million last year with cruise ship cancellations.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see them come back‚Äù Thomas said. ‚ÄúHopefully we‚Äôll see them have a great season out here.‚Äù

Close to the Serenade of the Seas a group of Alaska dignitaries gathered to celebrate the return of cruising in Alaska.

Alaska Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said it was just the economic boost the state needed after the pandemic devastated the visitor industry in 2020. Sen. Lisa Murkowski R-Alaska helped pass legislation in May that was needed for large foreign-owned cruise ships to temporarily bypass stopping in Canada before sailing to Alaska.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here today for a celebration because this ship is just the beginning‚Äù she said.

The shortened 2021 cruise ship season will see fewer sailings than a typical year. It‚Äôs unclear to what capacity the ships will be full when they sail to Alaska.

Tom Mattis a spokesperson for Royal Caribbean said the company will look to ‚Äúmoderately‚Äù increase its passenger loads as it works to prove that its COVID-19 protocols work.

In the meantime some shopping bags are full and some tours were busy again.

Jamie Palmer the Ketchikan division manager at Allen Marine Tours was overjoyed as 32 passengers left aboard one of their ships to visit Annette Island.

‚ÄúThis is a huge day for us‚Äù she said.

Sushi robot bartenders and 80s rock - onboard Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas World of Cruising has been sailing again! Given the date it might have been more appropriate to be boarding Independence of the Seas but on July 4 we joined her cousin Anthem of the Seas.

The cruise was the first of Royal Caribbean‚Äôs sailings in the UK since lockdown started in 2020 and despite the grey overcast skies there was a real sense of excitement and anticipation amongst the 700 or so passengers and 1300 crew onboard. We travelled to Southampton to join the cruise ship and were greeted and ushered through check-in by a superbly efficient team. Safety protocols of masks and distancing were impeccably followed and never did we feel at all unsafe. Royal Caribbean place a lot of emphasis on their very good app which you are required to download before your cruise to run through safety questionnaires and check-in online which worked very well. The mandatory safety briefing was duly completed and armed with our double-vaccination certificates (the NHS app) and negative PCR tests we were ushered through and towards the ship.

Anthem of the Seas Review The first thing you notice about Anthem of the Seas from the outside is that she is big. However when you're onboard she doesn‚Äôt feel that way; the ship's decks are easy to navigate and the flow is excellent so you never feel far from one of the many onboard destination attractions. (That said my phone‚Äôs step-count suggested otherwise at the end of each day as we regularly made our way between deck 3 and deck 14 where the indoor passenger facilities are to be found!) Onboard safety protocols are well monitored and enforced with masks mandatory in all public areas when not seated to eat or drink and there were plenty of hand sanitiser stations located throughout. Anthem of the Seas is blessed with a whole array of restaurants and eateries. While our trip was far too short to try them all we did manage to eat in the My Time Dining Room Izumi Japanese restaurant and Chops Grille.

The food in the main dining room was plentiful and served by a very attentive team and accompanied by decent white and red wines. A choice of starters including crab cakes escargots shrimp salad and beef carpaccio lead you into the entr√©e selection which boasts such tasty dishes as Rib of Beef lamb rogan josh baked cod in lemon butter and chicken and asparagus pie. Sweet desserts include cr√®me br√ªl√©e apple tart with toffee sauce ice creams and chocolate cake and cheesecake. - READ MORE: Everything you need to know about Royal Caribbean cruise line - DO go to Izumi if you get a chance; this great restaurant offers first-class Japanese food and is well worth the supplement necessary. Another speciality restaurant is Chops Grille where the menu features filet mignon whole lobster and a very filling surf and turf (filet mignon and whole lobster) which was an additional $34.95. If Japanese and chops are not your thing then there are other choices including Jamie‚Äôs Italian Wonderland (a gastronomic experience not to miss!) American Icon for burgers and much more.

You‚Äôre also blessed with a number of bars and lounges for a beer or a cocktail onboard - and even some made by robots!

Watching these machines make cocktails chosen by guests is fascinating and we almost felt sorry for one robot when the drink spilt - it sat there motionless like a puppy that‚Äôs been recently told off. Nevertheless the drinks that weren't spilt looked great and guests were proudly sat with their Long Island iced teas and Sex on the Beaches. Prices are okay ‚Äì but I recommend buying a drinks package if you do intend on enjoying a few cocktails each day. The entertainment is non-stop and you can see how Anthem of the Seas can cater for a wide range of holidaymakers. Whether it‚Äôs a family cruise or a romantic voyage for two there‚Äôs somewhere for you to go and something to do all the time. Unfortunately for us the weather was not kind but all the swimming pools were open and supervised by a lifeguard team who diligently watched over each one despite very few people being in them.

From the kids‚Äô pools and whirlpool to adult jacuzzis and the adults-only indoor solarium area there‚Äôs a great selection of spots to take a dip. The flow-rider was also in full swing for anyone who fancied learning to surf. Other areas include a big casino with tables and slot machines the North Star which elevates a viewing globe above the ship an arcade and an indoor sports area with bumper cars ‚Äì you‚Äôre never short on something to do. Two70 is a brilliant room used for cabaret and daytime shows as well as having a massive set of screens onto which is projected all manner of spectacles from cartoons to orchestral recitals and fireworks! The main show onboard was We Will Rock You which was shown in the afternoon and then again in the evening. It lasts nearly two hours and is well worth watching and of excellent quality.

Our favourite was the 80s mixtape by live band Coyote. Led by singer Laura Broad who was a runner-up in Britain's Got Talent they produced an excellent evening of 80s rock music and again it was great quality entertainment. There‚Äôs always so much going on that you‚Äôre only really limited by time and what you fancy doing! It would be wrong not to mention the amazing crew. They‚Äôve had a long time out and are all genuinely pleased to be sailing again and back at sea. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone from the cabin steward and the bar teams to the restaurant staff. We found the Guest Services team to be really efficient and cleared any questions and issues immediately to our satisfaction. Who should go? Anyone really; Royal Caribbean caters for all different budgets and holiday needs. Multi-generational families will have a great time as the ship caters for each group individually allowing you to come together for family time as you wish. Couples can find a hideaway in the spa or solarium or on their private balcony and be waited on hand and foot by the onboard team. Of course there are also suites if you really want to splash out... Happy Cruising!

(Here‚Äôs their 2020 pay info),"Shipping magnates don‚Äôt pervade the billionaire ranks like they did in the days of Aristotle Onassis. They‚Äôve been left behind by tech bosses financiers and oligarchs. Yet ocean shipping is still big business and the CEOs overseeing the fleets are high earners.

So how much do shipping CEOs actually make?

While many shipping companies aren‚Äôt required to list individual executive compensation a number of them are whether in annual reports or in proxy submissions prior to annual general meetings. American Shipper compiled the available public information on executive compensation across container shipping dry bulk tankers and cruise shipping.

Annual remuneration is a combination of salary shares and/or options performance-based cash payments and other cash and benefits. For shares and options the equity value is estimated at the time of the award and may change significantly by the time shares are cashed in.

Denmark-listed Maersk is the largest container liner operator in the world (excluding newbuild tonnage) at least for the next few months until MSC takes the crown. Maersk CEO Soren Skou made 43.1 million Danish kroners in 2020 ($7.1 million) up 24% from 2019 remuneration (using end-of-year currency conversions).

Germany-listed Hapag-Lloyd is the world‚Äôs fifth-largest liner company according to Alphaliner. The company has a current market cap of $39 billion. Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen received total compensation of 2.5 million euros last year ($3.1 million) up 23% from $2.5 million in 2019.

ZIM (NYSE: ZIM) which went public in the U.S. in January is the 11th largest liner company in the world. With a market cap of $4.8 billion it is the largest shipping company (excluding cruise companies) in the U.S. public market. Its CEO Eli Glickman made $2.18 million last year.

Underscoring the difference between U.S. and European executive pay Matthew Cox CEO of Hawaii-based Matson (NYSE: MATX) earned $5.5 million in 2020 up around $1 million or 22% from 2019. Cox made far more than Habben Jansen last year despite the fact that Hapag-Lloyd is a much larger company; Matson is the world‚Äôs 25th largest liner operator with a market cap one-thirteenth of Hapag-Lloyd‚Äôs.





Compensation for 2020. Chart: American Shipper based on data from securities filings and annual reports. Skou and Habben Jansen compensation reported in Danish kroner and euros respectively. Currency conversion estimated as of Dec. 31 2020.

Bulk commodity shipping

Most of the bulker and tanker owners listed in the U.S. are foreign filers meaning that they only have to disclose the aggregate compensation of their executive teams.

Among the U.S.-listed bulk shipping companies that are required to disclose individual compensation numbers the largest by market cap is tank-barge operator Kirby Corp. (NYSE: KEX) and predictably its CEO David Grzebinski tops the compensation list. His cash and stock remuneration totaled $4.2 million in 2020 down 11% versus 2019.

Lois Zabrocky CEO of crude and product tanker owner International Seaways (NYSE: INSW) had 2020 compensation of $3.4 million up 20% from 2019. Craig Stevenson CEO of crude and product tanker owner Diamond S Shipping (NYSE: DSSI) earned $2.8 million last year down 28% from 2019. International Seaways is in the process of merging with Diamond S Shipping. Zabrocky will remain CEO and Stevenson will depart. His exit package is valued at $5.4 million.

The 2020 compensation of John Wobensmith CEO of dry bulk company Genco Shipping & Trading (NYSE: GNK) was valued at $2.2 million down 8% year on year. Sam Norton CEO of Jones Act tanker company OSG (NYSE: OSG) earned $2 million up 2% year on year.

Gary Vogel CEO of Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ: EGLE) received compensation valued at $1.7 million last year down 35% from 2019. Ed Coll CEO of dry bulk company Pangaea Logistics (NASDAQ: PANL) earned $1.2 million down 21% year on year.

In general top executives of listed bulk commodity shipowners with disclosed earnings had more of their compensation in the form of equity versus cash and saw more compensation declines in 2020 than liner execs.

Compensation for 2020. Chart: American Shipper based on data from securities filings.

Among the foreign-filer companies that disclosed aggregate compensation for executive teams most reported 2020 remuneration in the range of $2 million to $3 million. There was one big outlier: Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG).

Scorpio Tankers has six senior executives led by CEO Emanuele Lauro and President Robert Bugbee. Last year the executive team received compensation in cash and stock of $33.2 million. In 2019 executives received $32.5 million and in 2018 $25.8 million. (Furthermore five of Scorpio Tankers‚Äô execs are also execs at the former Scorpio Bulkers now Eneti [NYSE: NETI] where they earned several additional millions of dollars in aggregate compensation per year.)





Chart: Scorpio Tankers annual report

An important caveat to shipowner compensation is that in several cases particularly with Greek companies the CEO is the head of the private sponsor of the public entity. The sponsor can in some cases earn significant income from related-party transactions with the public company for commercial and technical management services and asset deals ‚Äî a lot more income than a non-sponsor shipping CEO could make.

Cruise shipping

Executive compensation in the cruise sector is on a whole different ‚Äî much higher ‚Äî level than in commercial shipping. CEO annual compensation is in the eight digits not seven.

The cruise industry suffered a near-death experience in 2020 due to COVID and the jury‚Äôs still out on its fate. COVID had major effects on CEO compensation.

Richard Fain CEO of Royal Caribbean Ltd. (NYSE: RCL) took a 49% salary cut in last year and voluntarily declined $3 million in incentive-plan cash compensation. His overall compensation totaled $12.1 million but 92% of his compensation last year was in stock ‚Äî the future value of which depends on what happens in the cruise sector. The cash portion of his compensation fell 84% versus 2019.

Arnold Donald CEO of Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) took a 43% salary cut and like Fain did not receive incentive-plan cash compensation. His overall compensation increased 19% year on year in 2020 to $13.3 million. But this was entirely due to stock grants. His cash compensation decreased 73% year on year.

Not so for Frank Del Rio CEO of NCL (NYSE: NCLH). His overall compensation increased 104% in 2020 to a jaw-dropping $36.4 million. The cash portion of his compensation increased 228% not only due to an inducement bonus that will be clawed back if he doesn‚Äôt stay until the end of this year but also due to a $10.3 million cash payout to a previous employment contract.

Compensation for 2020. Chart: American Shipper based on data from securities filings.

To put Del Rio‚Äôs pay in perspective NCL‚Äôs market cap is less than one-fifth of Maersk‚Äôs but Del Rio earned over five times more than Skou did last year.

During the NCL annual general meeting on May 20 shareholders conducted a non-binding vote on Del Rio‚Äôs compensation. It was a landslide albeit a symbolic one: 83% of the votes opposed it.

Situated in the heart of the vibrant Strijp-S district the design was created in collaboration with the Trudo housing association. Titled ‚ÄúThe Tribune‚Äù the architecture boasts a stepped tribune-like structure offering residents and visitors access and views onto the public square below.

Originally built as a component of the Philips electronics company‚Äôs factory complex Strijp-S has transformed since Philips‚Äô departure in the 1990s into the center of Eindhoven‚Äôs culture. Now a hub of activities it hosts Dutch Design Week and a mix of creative businesses and residents living in renovated factories and contemporary high-rises surrounding the area.

Reflecting the area‚Äôs industrial past The Tribune climbs eight stories then falls to a low two stories at Ketelhuislein blending in with the surrounding greenery. The two-story design alongside the plaza of the Ketelhuisplien forms a mediating element between the open space and the Tribune‚Äôs high rise. It boasts a timber facade adding warmth and echoes the activations exhibited during Dutch Design Week such as 2019‚Äôs famous Biobasecamp.

Without a doubt Strijp-S is a neighborhood with extraordinary charisma. With our design we aim to capture and contribute to the emergent energy of this place creating a new building that fits seamlessly in its place while lifting the atmosphere of Strijp-S to the next level. The many features that promote a dynamic and tight-knit residential community in the building are a big part of that. --MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas.

In an effort to embrace sustainability The Tribune‚Äôs steps are generously planted with greenery with a number of trees and long planters that serve as railings. The Tribune also boasts expansive private green terraces that feature biodiversity and mitigate water runoff. These oases offer private spaces for residents and communal gathering spots interconnected by staircases fostering a sense of community. Extending toward Leidingstraat the design features a pier that doubles as a public lookout enhancing connectivity and safety.

Internally the building hosts commercial spaces on the lower two stories that can be used as retail stores restaurants cafes or offices. Above the apartments are accessed with wide internal hallways boasting natural daylight. In fact the design creates a sense of gathering within hallways serving as community spaces and fostering neighborly relationships like a small street.

In other similar news MVRDV has recently revealed a large-scale residential complex in Qianhai Bay Shenzen. Similarly the Netherlands-based studio has just begun construction on the LXK Office and Residential Campus in Berlin.

Gay St.,"

The openings keep coming. The Kennedy a new chef-driven Americana gastropub opens today at 11 a.m. for lunch service. The previous tenant Blackhorse Brewery closed last summer and the renovations began shortly after. I met with Chad Kennedy and Brittany Singh the owner and the marketing and events manager at Kennedy Concepts respectively to see the changes.

The Tailor Lofts building has undergone numerous changes in the last ten years including apartment living and at least three restaurants (Arby‚Äôs Five and Blackhorse Brewing). You can see the history of those changes in former articles written by Inside of Knoxville. Chad tells me they wanted to create a space that was timeless a space that would last and be here for many years to come just like the building itself which dates back to the 1800s.

From the Knoxville History Project ‚ÄúThe Sanford Chamberlain and Albers building most recently known as Tailor Lofts was built by an alliance of pharmaceutical entrepreneurs who were all Union combat veterans who‚Äôd had very different experiences with the war. A former Navy man Albers had done time in the notorious Libby Prison. All were from up north though Sanford had moved to Knoxville long before the war. It‚Äôs shorter than the other buildings on its block just because it‚Äôs a generation older; it was the sole survivor of the 1897 fire.‚Äù

The interior vastly differs from its predecessor and those that came before it. The walls are back to the natural brick color and the bar is now a stunning centerpiece that has been moved from the left side wall to the more appropriate center of the space. The large historically preserved windows provide natural light keeping the space bright and airy. There is a section behind the bar that can be curtained for private dining for small parties and the mezzanine seating area that holds 30 can be rented for special events (open to the public for dining as well). It offers excellent views of the restaurant from above. With seating for 158 the restaurant is suited for a casual lunch or elegant dinner.

The menu at The Kennedy is a culinary adventure offering a blend of casual and upscale options that perfectly match the restaurant‚Äôs vibe. From a delectable bone marrow dish to homemade mini corndogs the menu is a testament to the chef‚Äôs creativity. During the soft opening events I enjoyed sampling a few items. Each dish was prepared with precision served promptly and was a delight to the taste buds. I sampled the mini corndogs Caesar salad spicey rigatoni pizza(not pictured) and the bourbon banana foster shortcake.

The cocktails were born from the group‚Äôs travels to other cities to find cocktails they hadn‚Äôt seen before. They put their spin on the ones they liked best and created the menu from those. One of those cocktails is based on a drink called the Paper Airplane. Bar Manager/drink specialist Matt Leonard made his version and they call it the M.I.A. (Loosely associated with the song Paper Planes by M.I.A.) This is one of the ‚ÄúGood for Groups‚Äù drinks that serve four or more at the table. It uses whisky as a base and is served in a tall container with four spouts. It is quite the talking piece. They offer two other group drinks one served in a teapot with dry ice to simulate steam from a hot tea. It is a gin-based drink that is floral and sweet. The final community drink is rum-based and is called the Shake & Bake. It is presented in a vessel that looks like a canteen. I applaud the creativity of the drink menu and the serving pieces the drinks come in. I‚Äôm particularly excited about the Milk and Honey drink served in a small bathtub with a floating rubber ducky and a swirly straw. It is gin-based and a throwback to when gin was made in bathtubs during prohibition. They will have a rotating list of local beers and many popular staple beers and wines. For the sober curious they offer six mocktails.



Chad Kennedy began Kennedy Concepts 25 years ago ‚Äúto make people happy.‚Äù He credits his mom for that mentality. His operations have been mainly in Gatlinburg but he came into the Knoxville scene around 2021. He says ‚ÄúIf you get into this business for any other reason than making people happy you won‚Äôt last because it is hard.‚Äù He focuses on building a solid staff keeping them bought into a positive culture and ensuring customers‚Äô enjoyment of the spaces he creates.

When looking for new projects he asks ‚ÄúWhat does the area not have and what can we do better for the market?‚Äù In early 2023 Oliver Smith approached Chad about entering a partnership to put a restaurant in the space being vacated by Blackhorse Brewing. Having worked with him before Chad jumped at the opportunity. Horner Building Co. was the contractor for the project. The Johnson Studio out of Atlanta led the architecture and renovations. They also worked with Chad on another local business Loco Burro. Chad also holds partial ownership in Caf√© 4.



The hours will be 11 a.m.-1 a.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m.-3 a.m. on Friday/Saturday. They plan to begin serving brunch in July and will open at 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday for that service. Reservations are not required but encouraged through Resy.

Up next for Kenndey Concepts in Knoxville is a restaurant concept at The Davy new student housing for UTK. They will call the restaurant on the bottom floor there Mimosas (it backs up to Mimosa Ave). The concept will serve all-day brunch and late-night meals. It is still in progress but they hope to open in the Spring of 2025."
CRM,Salesforce,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzExL3dpbGwtc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1iZS13b3J0aC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LTIwMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Salesforce Be Worth More Than Microsoft by 2030?,"Could the cloud CRM giant follow Microsoft into the 12-zero club?

When Satya Nadella became Microsoft's (MSFT 0.36%) third CEO seven years ago the tech giant was worth $300 billion. Today it's worth over $2 trillion. Microsoft will likely keep growing over the next decade but it could struggle to repeat its near-sevenfold growth since 2014.

So investors should consider a some smaller tech companies that have a shot at replicating Microsoft's massive gains. One potential candidate is salesforce.com (CRM -1.64%) a cloud enterprise software company that is currently worth about $230 billion. Let's examine Salesforce's growth rates and see if it could join the trillion-dollar club and either match or even surpass Microsoft by 2030.

The past 10 years

Between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2021 which ended this January Salesforce's annual revenue rose from $1.66 billion to $21.25 billion representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.1%.

Salesforce's sales skyrocketed as more companies adopted its cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services. It leveraged that strength to launch additional cloud sales marketing and analytics tools -- and gobbled up smaller companies to continuously expand that ecosystem.

Between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2020 which ended last June Microsoft's annual revenue rose from $62.48 billion to $143.02 billion which equals a much lower CAGR of 8.6%.

Most of that growth occurred after Nadella took the helm and aggressively expanded Microsoft's ""commercial cloud"" business which includes Office 365 (now Microsoft 365) Dynamics CRM and Azure. Between fiscal 2014 and 2020 the segment's revenue jumped from $2.8 billion to $51.7 billion.

How the next decade might go

Last December Salesforce estimated it could more than double its annual revenue to $50 billion by fiscal 2026. That would represent a CAGR of 18.7% between 2021 and 2026.

Salesforce expects the total addressable market for its entire portfolio of services (sales service marketing and commerce platform and analytics and integration) to grow at a CAGR of 11% between fiscal 2021 and 2025. It expects its own growth to outpace the broader market.

Salesforce didn't provide any forecasts beyond 2026 but it would only need to generate a CAGR of 14.9% for the following five years to hit $100 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2031.

Microsoft hasn't offered any comparable long-term forecasts but analysts expect its revenue to rise 16% this year and 12% next year. If Microsoft subsequently grows its revenue at an average rate of 10% per year or at a CAGR of 10.8% it could generate $400 billion in revenue by fiscal 2030.

Assuming that Salesforce and Microsoft's price-to-sales ratios remain roughly the same as today Salesforce could be worth about $1 trillion by the end of 2030 while Microsoft's market cap could climb over $5 trillion.

But market caps don't matter all that much

So Salesforce could join the trillion-dollar club by 2030 but it probably won't be worth more than Microsoft.

However Salesforce will likely grow faster than Microsoft during the 2020s. Companies will increasingly rely on its services to reduce their dependence on human employees automate their operations and crunch data to make business decisions. It will continue to gobble up smaller companies -- like MuleSoft Tableau and Slack -- to expand its ecosystem beyond its market-leading CRM platform.

Meanwhile Microsoft will keep growing as Azure expands its reach in the cloud infrastructure market Windows continues its evolution into a service and it launches new hardware and gaming devices.

It's impossible to tell which stock will perform better over the next decade and it's naive to assume both companies will generate unfettered growth free from competition disruption or macroeconomic shocks. However both of these tech titans should continue to expand -- so it really doesn't matter which one ends up with the bigger market cap by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHmh0dHBzOi8vZW4ucGluZ3dlc3QuY29tL2EvODkyMtIBImh0dHBzOi8vZW4ucGluZ3dlc3QuY29tL2FtcC9hLzg5MjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Authing is China's Okta as the domestic SaaS industry grows fast,"Although the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted ""normality"" in a devastating way digital transformation has been accelerated. Software as a service (SaaS) companies are benefiting from the trend. The stock prices of SaaS giants including Salesforce Okta and Twilio have almost doubled since the outbreak of the pandemic.

In China the sector fueled by capital is also expanding rapidly. According to data released by startups database IT Juzi in the first half of 2020 280 financing events occurred in the SaaS industry raising a total of 35.413 billion yuan ($5.47 billion).

Authing's website

With the increase in the number of mobile devices and data access points in the cloud cloud security is now the fastest-growing sector. As an important part of cloud security identity as a service (IDaaS) is also riding on the high-speed train. Log-in‚Äìtech startup Authing has secured a $5 million exclusive investment from GGV capital in January.

The company founded by three entrepreneurs born in 1996 provides services that enable the workforces of clients to use a ‚Äúsingle sign-on‚Äù across cloud services providers such as Alibaba Tencent Baidu and others.

In March Auth0 the American peer of Authing was acquired by Okta for $6.5 billion consolidating the latter's position in the IDaaS field. Okta concentrates more on pre-built pre-configured solutions while Auth0 which shares more similarities with Authing focuses on purpose-built app developers.

The costly acquisition has brought IDaaS which plays a central role in enterprise identity management by removing ID silos and enabling one account-access-all function into the spotlight. According to Fortune Business Insights the global identity and access management market is projected to reach $24.76 billion by the end of 2026 exhibiting a CAGR of 13.2% from 2018 to 2026.

Authing identifies itself as an API (application programming interface)-first developer-friendly solution for identity management. ( API allows easier embedding of content from any site or application)

""I have coded for more than 10 years. I noticed that people need to re-develop login and registration modules every time they develop applications which will slow down the development progress to a certain extent. So I decided to turn identity authentication services into API forms and provide them to others"" Xie Yang the CEO told PingWest.

""Modularization of software development and microservices are the future. As a developer-friendly identity infrastructure Authing will contribute to the prosperity of cloud computing in China"" said the CEO.

Speaking of the investment in Authing Wu Chenyao executive director of GGV Capital said they felt the trend of SaaS services going to API-ization and SDK (software development kit)-ization from its global investments.

""In China we clearly see the rapid development of enterprise digital transformation and IT infrastructure innovation said the venture capitalist. ""With just a few lines of code non-core business function modules can be integrated into your own service which enables you to focus on your core business.""

SaaS reduces the enterprise's demand for IT talents while providing the latest technology applications to meet theirs requirements for digital management. Wang Huiwen the co-founder of on-demand delivery giant Meituan believed that the lack of well-capitalized mid-sized companies is the reason why enterprise-oriented SaaS has been developing relatively slowly in China.

Traditionally mid-sized firms are the landing point for SaaS companies in both the US and Europe but in China comparatively inexpensive labor and low willingness to pay for software hold back the expansion of SaaS.

Therefore the current valuation of Authing is much lower than its western matches. In March Vancouver-based startup Trulioo has raised $394 million at a $1.75 billion valuation for its identification technology service.

Now the informatization level of mid-sized enterprises remains fairly low in China where Tencent's instant messaging app and e-mail service dominate the office.

Besides Tencent giants such as Alibaba Baidu and Bytedance are all cultivating and promoting their own cloud-based services which also poses a threat to start-ups.

But Authing believes that neutrality is their advantage. ""Tech barriers exist between the giants so they are unable to integrate with each other but we can blend all of them into Authing"" said the CEO.

According to the company it currently serves hundreds of corporate customers mainly state-owned enterprises and financial institutions and tens of millions of users and corporate employees are using its secure access function.

The Beijing-based company also provides services for French advertising firm JCDecaux and Italian bank UniCredit.

Xie told PingWest that the company started with only 2 people and is expected to grow into a team of 100 people by the end of this year. Among them staff of product and R&D will account for 68%.

Cloud infrastructure spending in China increased from about $107 billion in 2019 to $142 billion in 2020 surging more than 32% in the last quarter of the year. Industry analysis provider Qianzhan forecasts that the size of the country's enterprise-oriented SaaS market will reach 74 billion yuan ($11.43 billion) in 2021 and will exceed 270 billion yuan ($41.71 billion) by 2026.

Some investors believe software is the future and finds it valuable to review trends underway in the US. ‚ÄúIn the next 20 years China will follow the US in using software to improve enterprise efficiency‚Äù said Patrick Zhong founder of M31 Capital. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not saying it will be the exact same path as the US but it‚Äôs a reference point.‚Äù

New opportunities are triggering the development of the SaaS sector in the country‚Äîthe demographic dividend is waning Covid-19 has accelerated the adoption of cloud and remote work and the government has been vigorously promoting cloud adoption. It is foreseeable that startups like Authing will keep coming out to enrich the entire ecosystem.

Organized by the New York design gallery R & Company and BassamFellows the by-appointment-only exhibition is curated by James Zemaitis R & Company‚Äôs Director of Museum Relations and the art advisor Erica Barrish. It includes an impressive array of postwar modernist design from R & Company‚Äôs collection by furniture masters like Marcel Breuer Poul Kjaerholm Charles Eames Eero Saarinen and S√©rgio Rodrigues; lighting by legends like Angelo Lelii and Greta Magnusson Grossman; the elegantly-crafted Scandiavian-influenced contemporary furniture designed by BassamFellows‚Äôs founders the architect Craig Bassam and the creative director Scott Fellows; and artworks by Bauhaus masters like Josef Albers and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy as well as contemporary pieces by John McCracken and Prabhavathi Meppayil‚Äîjust to name a fraction of the pieces on view.

And if that weren‚Äôt enough BassamFellows‚Äôs offices are housed in a one-story brick building designed by Philip Johnson in 1952 as the administrative offices for the Schlumberger Research Institute; the designers moved into the building in 2018 after doing a thorough restoration of the original structure with its ingeniously-daylit spaces for meetings and gatherings private offices with views of the landscape and a glass-enclosed landscaped courtyard. (R & Company is hosting another exhibition Carve Curve Cane which focuses on the materials and craftsmanship of BassamFellows‚Äôs furniture in New York at its Franklin Street location through August 27th; reservations are encouraged.)

Bassam and Fellows‚Äîwho own a Johnson-designed house across the road from the architect‚Äôs famed Glass House‚Äîhad always envisioned having gatherings and exhibitions in the space and a conversation with R & Company led to Modern in Your Life. Fellows notes that Johnson designed the modestly-sized building to connect to nature. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all done for well-being‚Äù he says which ‚Äúmakes the building relevant today.‚Äù Bassam adds ‚ÄúOur building was designed to accommodate life‚Äù and not just work.

For Zemaitis the exhibition and its location offered an opportunity to refer to the Good Design exhibitions that were held at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1950s when Johnson was head of MoMA‚Äôs department of architecture and design and after Eliot Noyes had led its industrial design department and ‚Äúto bring in Connecticut Modernism‚Äù which refers to the fact that Johnson Noyes and Breuer were among the Harvard Five a group of architects who designed Modernist houses in and around New Canaan. At the office‚Äôs entrance is a table designed for the space by Florence Knoll who designed the building‚Äôs original interiors. And Zemaitis worked with the textile dealer Cora Ginsburg to obtain rare fabrics displayed in the private offices by designers like Jens Risom Olga Lee and Joel Robinson the first Black designer to win a Good Design award from MoMA and to be included in its architecture and design collection.

For Barrish certain artists ‚Äúneeded to be‚Äù in the exhibition like Moholy-Nagy who was friendly with Breuer and Albers at the Bauhaus and whose never-before-exhibited Untitled (1925) a fascinating abstract work made with pen and ink sprayed-on and brushed watercolor graphite and collage on paper was gifted to Breuer in 1928. ‚ÄúIt has all the hallmarks of Modernism‚Äù Barrish says. Albers‚Äôs City from 1928/1936 in tempera on Masonite in a wooden frame said to have been made by the artist was the basis for a large mural in the 1963 PanAm Building (now the MetLife building) in New York City. Another Albers the lusciously colored Variant/Adobe from 1947 was inspired by a trip to the American Southwest. And a remarkable sculpture by Jean Arp Hurlou sur Socle-colonne a combination of bronze granite and wood elements balances delicately in the central conference room.

Near the far end of the building Siskiyou (1988) a tall glossy geometric solid by the Minimalist artist John McCracken reflects Breuer‚Äôs Short Chair (1936-39) one of his early influential molded plywood pieces and one of Angelo Lelii‚Äôs Triennale Floor Lamps designed in the 1950s for the Italian company Arredoluce; nearby is one of Rodrigues‚Äôs overstuffed Sheriff lounge chairs and BassamFellows‚Äôs Asymmetric Sofa. A three-legged floor lamp designed by Johnson and the lighting designer Richard Kelly stands near its four-legged successor which was more stable than the original version. Along the building‚Äôs east walkway a line of side chairs ranging from Eames and Saarinen‚Äôs winning entry in MoMA‚Äôs 1940 Organic Design competition to others by designers like Risom Kjaerholm and Hans Wegner as well as several BassamFellows designs that illustrate their fascination with what they call ‚Äúarchetypes‚Äù by the masters who preceded them. But this is just a small sample of the riches in the exhibition.

By the time grocery shelves returned to a somewhat normal state I had developed a permanent chip on my shoulder toward the neighbors I saw scurrying about with 20 cans of chicken noodle soup in their carts.

WSJ cited Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc. the nation‚Äôs largest grocery store wholesaler as an example. The company recently purchased up to 20% more inventory mainly of shelf-stable packaged foods in preparation for coming price increases from major companies such as General Mills Inc. Campbell Soup Co. and J.M. Smucker Co. ‚ÄúWhen you have a uniquely inflationary period like now it‚Äôs a feeding frenzy‚Äù said Tony Sarsam chief executive officer of Michigan-based food retailer and distributor SpartanNash Co.

WSJ explains that supermarket stockpiling is a burden on an already stretched U.S. food supply chain. The grocery industry is struggling with transportation costs ingredient shortages and a reduced workforce (at least at current grocery store wages) which you can read more about here. Interestingly consumers haven‚Äôt yet felt the effects of those major price increases largely because markets are still burning through their stockpiles. While you may notice a slight increase in the cost of some of your pantry staples retailers are reportedly working to keep prices low to compete against discount or low-price chains like Walmart and Aldi WSJ reports. But with a barely recovered food supply chain and perhaps permanently altered consumer buying habits you have to wonder: how much more can our brittle food economy take?",,,,,,,,,,,,

MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry could share a snap of Lilibet's feet for the first public picture of their baby girl a royal expert has claimed.

Daniela Elser said it was likely the parents were weighing up their options following their daughter's birth last month.

The expert said that the couple's main concern over sharing a photograph was privacy as they continue their lives away from the Royal family in the USA.

Their daughter Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on June 4 in a hospital in Santa Barbara becoming the 8th in line to the throne.

But in stark contrast to big brother Archie no pictures have yet emerged of the newborn.

Writing in news.com.au Mrs Elser said: ""While they might desperately want to be able to offer their daughter a level of privacy that Harry was never allowed to enjoy growing up in the royal fishbowl the hard truth is that they do still occupy a strange nebulous place between public figures and private citizens.

""Which is why some sort of shot of Lili ‚Äì a toe! A finger! One tiny hand holding an even tinier hand! ‚Äì does not seem out of the question.""

She noted that Harry and Megan now face a number of ‚Äútough choices‚Äù over Lilibet's christening and the choice of her godparents.

The expert cited a row over Meghan and Harry‚Äôs refusal to name Archie's godparents after he was christened while they were still senior and full-time royals ‚Äì emphasising how the pair do not want to make the same mistake twice.

She said: ""In hindsight the handling of Archie‚Äôs christening was a turning point for the couple and you can draw a straight line from that furore to ‚ÄòMegxit‚Äô.‚Äù

Mum Meghan hasn't returned to the UK since moving to the US.

Ms Elser said this means Lilibet's christening has the potential to ‚Äúimprove or further damage‚Äù Harry‚Äôs relationship with the royal family.

She continued: ""However if the Sussexes‚Äô decided to hold the ceremony in California thus precluding the Queen who no longer travels internationally from attending it would be seen as nothing less than a clear rejection of the royal family.

""There is also a third option here: They decide to skip a baptism entirely.

""But again this too would be read as deeply disrespectful to Her Majesty given she is after all the head of the Church of England.""

Ms Elser wrote that the Sussexes face a similar problem with choosing Lili's godparents.

She said: ""If they were to choose a cadre of A-list names news of which would be bound to seep out in the press then it would look like they are wholly throwing their lot in with their new Hollywood besties family and lifelong friends back in the UK be damned

""On the other hand opting to appoint a few carefully chosen cousins or old Eton mates could go a very long way to healing various breaches.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05Nzc1NjM5L0plbm5pZmVyLUNvb2xpZGdlLXJldmVhbHMtZGlkbnQtaWNvbmljLWJlbmQtc25hcC1MZWdhbGx5LUJsb25kZS5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk3NzU2MzkvYW1wL0plbm5pZmVyLUNvb2xpZGdlLXJldmVhbHMtZGlkbnQtaWNvbmljLWJlbmQtc25hcC1MZWdhbGx5LUJsb25kZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Coolidge reveals why she almost didn't do the iconic 'bend and snap' in Legally Blonde,"Jennifer Coolidge's life was forever changed after she starred in the iconic 2011 comedy Legally Blonde.

Chloe Ferry's fans point out 'bad' Photoshop edit with floating football on latest snap

Chloe Ferry has been accused of a Photoshop fail after fans pointed out the ""edited"" pink football on her latest snap.

The former Geordie Shore star 25 is excited for the Euro 2020 final on Sunday.

In her most recent Instagram post there appeared to be a neon pink ball floating on the step as she posed outside of a door.

The reality star wore a mini dress which was the same colour as the ball while squatting on the floor and throwing a pout at the camera.

She penned: ""It's coming home baby! @JYYLondon have 50% OFF EVERYTHING use code ENGLAND at checkout"" with a bunch of football-related emojis added on at the end.

But her followers were unsure why the ball looked like it had been edited on with many pointing this out in the comments.

""Why is the football photoshopped in? Lol"" one person asked.

A second shared: ""Sick editing on that football [laughing emoji]"".

A third commented: ""What's with that shady photoshopping of the football not only that‚Ä¶ check the pipe. You look gorgeous as ever but think you need a new photoshopper.""

Meanwhile others pointed out the ""wonky"" pipe next to her chest.

One wrote: ""T he pipes bent around her boobs aswell it's not even good photoshopping.""

""That gutter pipe looks straight"" another chimed in.

A third said: ""BRO STOP PHOTOSHOPPING YOUR PHOTOS! THE LINES ARE LITERALLY BEND NEAR YOUR WAIST AND ARMS. the walls are actually uneven and don't match up ughhh.""

She was also called ""the queen of photoshop"".

It's not the first time Chloe has been called out for manipulating her snaps.

In the past her eagle-eyed fans have accused her of editing doors and walls to alter her images.

Chloe who shot to fame on Geordie Shore in 2015 recently purchased her ""dream home"" for ¬£1million.

Her mansion is the perfect backdrop to take her sexy Instagram snaps which she frequently posts.

She found her incredible pad back in March and her mortgage was accepted earlier this month with the Geordie babe having a glass of wine to celebrate her next milestone.

The Mirror has contacted Chloe's representative for a comment.

Can it last?,"In the fields beyond Alamosa it was a rare morning. Cleave Simpson found his hay damp.

""It's frustrating when you got hay on the ground and there's rain on it"" he said. ""But when you live around here you learn to appreciate it.""

Once again this summer rain has been hard to come by in this historic farming valley of southern Colorado. The average annual precipitation in the middle of the San Luis Valley hovers around seven inches ‚Äî about as low as it gets in all of Colorado according to the Colorado Climate Center.

And yet farming prevails. It is the lifeblood of Alamosa the town that rose from a once-bustling railroad and today is often passed by travelers en route to more flashy destinations on the Western Slope. Unlike other rural communities that have swapped mining or energy for tourism the ruling industry here is and always has been agriculture.

ABOUT THE SERIES In the arid West water means life. Turn on your tap and you're part of the Colorado circulatory system. The towns born along the banks of Colorado's most iconic waterways -- The Colorado the Big Thompson the Arkansas lead a list of 158 named rivers -- live the same way yet differently along the banks. The staff of Colorado Politics with the journalists of the Denver and Colorado Springs Gazettes are fanning out this summer to tell the story of a state as reflected in its water its people and its future with the past as prologue. Come along all summer to learn more about the people and places that make us all a little bit more Coloradan.

""The hospital the county and city offices and school district all of those are important"" said Alamosa Mayor Ty Coleman. ""But farming and ranching that's it. That's huge.""

It‚Äôs a legacy of resilience maintained by generations of families dating to the 1800s when companies carved canals across this high desert to capture generous snowmelt from the mountains. Winters would be harsh and sudden freezes in the spring all too common and summers would be hot and dry. But that runoff would provide. With grit and innovation potato producers here would be nationally renowned.

Simpson represents his family's fourth generation to tend the fields.

And often he wonders if he'll be the last. This is the modern plight of life along the Rio Grande River.

Simpson‚Äôs worries led him to seek and win his district's Senate seat last year.

""The ag community here is feeling an abundance of pressure as electricity and fuel and seed and fertilizer and labor all continue to increase. What we get for our crops isn't keeping up"" he said. ""And then there's this pressure about our demand for water exceeding our supply.""

That imbalance is almost as old as the state's first water right that was decreed in this valley in 1852 where tribes and conquistadors clashed before the U.S. staked its territory. Narrow gauge tracks led the way to a central hub that would be called Alamosa so named for a Spanish word meaning cottonwood for the trees lining that life-giving river.

But by the turn of the 20th century the Rio Grande was considered over-appropriated. Demand outpaced supply.

""So we've always lived in this area where there was this level of stress"" said Heather Dutton manager of San Luis Valley Water Conservancy District and fifth-generation native.

The difference she said is this century's more dire circumstances.

Fundamental changes

A multi-agency report last year found average annual streamflows to be steadily declining since the 1930s with drops worsening in the 2000s. Citing climate change the report warned of that long trusted snowpack in the mountains becoming less dependable.

""Farmers and ranchers are likely to have significantly less surface water available"" researchers wrote ""and groundwater recharge may decline.""

Where Simpson's and Dutton's grandfathers and fathers didn't have the Rio Grande to count on they had groundwater. They joined drilling and pumping that ramped up in the '30s. The shallow and ""unconfined"" aquifer and deeper ""confined"" aquifer both remnants of an ancient lake represented turning points for farming.

""But it was also a turning point for what my generation is now grappling with"" Dutton said ""where now we have too many wells we have too much pumping and we're taking more out of the aquifer than we're putting back in.""

The decades saw agreements for taking and giving back ‚Äî for digging a hole filling it with water and thus recharging the unconfined aquifer in hopes of making up for Mother Nature.

""By far that's where most of the groundwater withdrawals occur in the valley"" Simpson said. ""The potatoes are grown and raised above that unconfined aquifer. Most of the intense irrigation is above that unconfined aquifer.""

Simpson manages the Rio Grande Water Conservation District which has tracked the aquifer's storage since 1976. From the mid-'80s to today charts show a staggering drop: a change amounting to about 1.3 million acre-feet of water.

The severe drought of 2002 started the steep trend of decline. Since then there have been year-to-year gains of storage ‚Äî eight years totaling 746791 acre-feet. But there have been more years of drops 10 totaling more than 1.7 million acre-feet. Lows this year are on par with record lows following the 2012 drought data show.

The hope of Simpson and Dutton is to locally regulate before higher powers enforce harsher demands. The state has called on the valley to bring water back up to pre-2000 levels or else face possible consequences of widespread shutdowns in 2030.

Simpson looks at the charts and struggles to see the line rising that high. ""The clock's ticking on us"" he said.

Farmers are taxing themselves to pump with that money going to other farmers to pump less. Simpson and Dutton have been encouraging creativity such as less water-needy crops like hemp and quinoa.

But they fear more drastic measures.

""There is a need to physically take land out of production"" Dutton said. ""And it's not like it's just one person owns everything and we can just say 'Hey can you cut back your farm by 30%?' There are hundreds of families that farm and ranch here.

""And this is how they make their living it's in their blood they want to do it they're proud of it. So trying to get people to cut back or stop farming altogether it's a study in psychology and human behavior. It's really hard.""

And there are broader ramifications to consider when farms close Simpson said. The well-being of his hometown is at stake when that happens he said ‚Äî Alamosa's school hospital and small businesses.

""The potential to fundamentally change this place it's there"" he said.

A river that binds

Alamosa is trying to change before it's forced to. Leaders are looking to the river.

""The river is the thing that unites us"" Coleman said.

Last year's report on the Rio Grande described it as ""a diverse river starting in once-glaciated mountain valleys spilling out onto a broad and ancient alluvial fan and then following a rift in volcanic rock as it turns south into New Mexico.""

Equally diverse are the people the river meets on the basin floor. About half of Alamosa's residents identify as Hispanic or Latino many of them descendants of early settlers.

Upon his mayoral election in 2017 Coleman promised to proudly represent that diversity as a person of color. He was a newcomer in valley terms a resident since 2010 who brought new enthusiasm to the poverty-stricken town. Coleman is known to end conversations by saying: ""Don't let anybody steal your joy.""

""The good thing about being an outsider you can see things that people who haven't been on the outside can't see"" Coleman said.

Where others were taking it for granted he saw the river as beautiful an unrealized attraction and economic tool. His time in office has coincided with a collaboration called Revitalize the Rio aiming to improve the stretch through town.

The mission is led by growing nonprofit San Luis Valley Great Outdoors. It's personal for Patrick Ortiz. He represents the nonprofit and the young generation plagued by a crisis that has swept rural America including Alamosa.

""The opioid crisis really took a big chunk"" Ortiz said. ""It was a big loss of untapped talent and energy and just people power. And I think that's what galvanized efforts like Revitalize the Rio.""

The goal is to get people to fall in love with the river and the parks and trails Ortiz is helping to build along the banks. ""To put people on a path that is restorative and not destructive"" he said.

That well-being could be tied to the future well-being of the river.

Rio Grande Headwaters Restoration Project has been tasked with fixing outdated infrastructure and diversions revegetating eroded banks and doing other work meant to improve flows. This is for the sake of fish anglers boaters and farmers explained Emma Reesor the project's executive director ‚Äî for the sake of improving efficiency when water does come from mountains or sky.

The work can be ""overwhelming"" Reesor said. She's seen the river's record lows of the past decade; channels in and around Alamosa have been reduced to nothing at times. She's seen climate projections suggesting conditions will worsen.

""It's challenging because in a lot of ways we work where it is outside the control of"" she said stopping to take a breath. ""We're trying to make the system work as hard as it can. Making every drop of water work as hard as it can.""

‚ÄòFighting waters‚Äô

Coleman is hopeful ever the optimist.

""Communities like Salida where you have the river flowing through town and restaurants on the river?"" he said. ""Eventually Alamosa will get to that point.""

But growth is a contentious topic in town.

""Pretty much everything comes down to water"" said Derek Heersink whose family has farmed in the valley since 1897.

He is the next to carry on the tradition. But he also expanded his prospects; he and a buddy opened a brewery in 2017. The business wouldn't mind more people around. Others would mind.

""I'd love to see the standard of living for the folks here improve dramatically but I don't know that I'd like to see more people or more industry"" Simpson said. ""I don't know how you find that balance.""

The balance he refers to is about water. It is all the more uncertain in the face of a multi-million-dollar idea to harvest the aquifer.

Backed by major real estate moguls Renewable Water Resources has proposed dealing for water rights and exporting millions of gallons from the faltering supply to booming populations on the Front Range.

The company website dangles a promise to ""enrich the local economy bring more jobs to the area support essential nonprofits and community groups and improve the health of the area's aquatic habits and wildlife.""

The local senator has contributed to the resounding ""no"" around the valley. ""We're not hugely prosperous so it's easy for big-money interests to come in and flash money"" Simpson said.

At least four times in 50 years valley people have managed to ward off such developers ‚Äî on some occasions combining funds to go to court. The message is clear as one Alamosa city councilor recently put it: ""Those are fighting waters.""

But Heersink wonders if his people can keep winning.

""As long as more and more people keep going over (to the Front Range) and more and more money is going over there it's gonna continue to be a thing"" he said. ""They're always gonna be eyeing our water. I have a real feeling that within my lifetime we'll see at least some of the water end up over the hill.""

The feeling strikes Simpson during quiet moments on the farm. These have always been peaceful moments almost meditative coming with the satisfaction that comes with work that feels somehow sacred deeply ingrained.

Now the moments come with worry.

""I wish I felt like my son had this really definitive wonderful future in front of him by doing this as well as my grandson"" Simpson said. ""But you find yourself questioning: Is this really the right thing to do?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ2ZGFpbHlwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL3JvbGwtZW0tdXBzLXRhcXVpdG9zLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtcmVhZHktdG8tcm9sbC1pbnRvLXZpY3RvcnZpbGxlLzc5MjQxNjcwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When is Roll-Em-Up Taquitos opening in Victorville,"Foodies across the High Desert are excited about the new Roll-Em-Up Taquitos eatery coming this summer to Restaurant Row on Amargosa Road in Victorville.

The Southern California-based ‚Äústreet casual‚Äù restaurant is known for its beef chicken and cheese taquitos which are hand-rolled pan-fried in cast iron skillets and made daily according to the company.

The Victorville Roll-Em-Up will occupy the building that once housed the Cafe Rio Mexican Grill at the retail development that‚Äôs also home to Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and several other eateries.

Cafe Rio opened to much fanfare in 2017 and closed three years later. The company did not disclose the reason for shuttering the location but industry leaders believe state restrictions on restaurants amid the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure the Daily Press reported.

The building which now sports an orange and white paint job includes a large banner that reads ‚ÄúNow Hiring‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Vibes Only‚Äù and ‚ÄúApply Online @RollEmUp.com/jobs.‚Äù

The Victorville Roll-Em-Up store will be the company‚Äôs third after opening its first in 2019 in Chino Hills and later in Brea. No exact opening date has been announced.

The chain plans to open a minimum of 10 taquito locations by year‚Äôs end and expand to over 500 locations in the next five years according to a company press release.

The food

Mexican food ‚Äúaficionado‚Äù Sylvia Luna 45 of Hesperia told the Daily Press she‚Äôs eaten at the Chino Hills Roll-Em-Up several times and is excited about the new High Desert location.

‚ÄúMy mom and grandma‚Äôs homemade taquitos are the best I‚Äôve ever tasted but Roll-Em-Ups is right there with them‚Äù said Luna who works at a local supermarket. ‚ÄúThe taquitos are addicting and I love their dipping sauces.‚Äù

Luna said the ‚Äúfreshness of the meat‚Äù used in the corn and flour taquitos is ‚Äúvery noticeable and tasty‚Äù along with the potatoes sauces guacamole and salsas.

The restaurant‚Äôs menu includes street corn ‚Äî elotes in Spanish ‚Äî that are served on a stick or in a cup and come loaded with butter mayo and cotija cheese. The corn is also served with a dusting of hot Cheetos or Tajin seasoning.

The restaurant offers housemade beans and rice chips and fried ""churro donuts"" that come drizzled with caramel sauce.

Beverages include Coca-Cola products Batch Craft Soda agua de jamaica pink lemonade assorted flavors of horchata and other drinks.

‚ÄúWe are a family-oriented restaurant that provides a one-of-a-kind consumer experience with each visit and some reggae music for ambiance‚Äù Ryan Usrey CEO and founder of Roll-Em-Up Taquitos said in a statement.

Roll-Em-Ups history

The inspiration behind the taquito-centric fast-casual restaurant came from Usrey‚Äôs mother Karen who would make her popular beef taquitos for family parties and other occasions.

‚ÄúGrowing up in Southern California our family always loved eating all kinds of Mexican food and especially taquitos‚Äù said Usrey. ‚ÄúMy mom would make taquitos every weekend for me and my dad. When they‚Äôre cooked fresh and served hot and crispy it makes all the difference and always hits right.‚Äù

As Usrey his father Ron and their family continued to discuss opening a taquitos-only eatery ‚ÄúMama Karen‚Äù passed away before they could realize the dream together the company said.

After the company opened its first store they began selling an average of 3500 taquitos a day with a steady stream of cars snaking around the parking lot daily.

The company's future

The homemade taquito brand is targeting markets across the country including California Nevada Arizona Utah Idaho Texas Colorado and Oregon.

With 38 franchise units in development since it rolled out franchising opportunities in April the company plans to eventually sell 100 units.

In an interview with FastCasual Usrey said for franchisees there will be a three-store minimum and a $20000 ""territory fee"" per location plus an additional $20000 per location franchise fee.

There is also a 5% royalty fee and a 1.5% general marketing fee. The total investment range is $278000 to $795000 and is contingent on construction and location.

Madison 30 shared a short video of her date in an Instagram story.

Madison jokingly said: ""Don't play with your food! Have you not watched that documentary!""

At a restaurant the Southern Charm star giggled as her hunky boyfriend played around with their shrimp appetizer.

After their romantic dinner at The St. Regis Deer Valley the two went off on a hiking trip and ended up on a slide in Park City according to The Daily Mail.

Before getting launched in an innertube Madison was overheard by the crowd as she said: ""This is probably the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever done.""

Back in June the Bravo star had shared snapshots while she was boating with her shirtless boyfriend.

In two snaps the couple wore similar striped coverups.

In the next snap Madison's buff beau took off his shirt and showed off his toned body in a swimsuit.

Madison captioned the photos: ""Mad happy.""

The TV star posted more videos from their Lake Tahoe getaway which also showed her beau helping her strap on her heels.

After he said: ""Got you"" Madison replied: ""A guy who's got you. Woo game-changer.""

Madison first mentioned her new relationship back in April after a follower commented on a snap: ‚ÄúMmmm Arod on his way girl get bags pack he coming for you.""

But the reality star commented: ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend!‚Äù

Back in February the reality star claimed she had just ""talked but didn't get physical"" with Alex 45.

Madison confessed to PageSix that she had ""never met up"" with the sports star and that the two had ""innocent"" calls and had ""only spoken on the phone.""

She claimed that they had ""never been physical‚Ä¶any kind of anything. Just an acquaintance.‚Äù

Madison added: ""He‚Äôs never physically cheated on his fianc√©e with me.""

The cheating rumors between Madison and Alex started because of Craig Conover 32.

At a reunion show Madison's Southern Charm co-star had accused her of being a ""homewrecker"" and had traveled to Miami ""to sleep with married men ‚Äì ex MLB players.""

The TV personality denied Craig‚Äôs accusations and stated: ""Put me on a lie detector test I never flew to Miami. Tell me when did I fly to Miami? No because that's fake.""

Then in April Jennifer 51 and Alex announced that they had called off their engagement.

Jennifer rekindled her romance with Ben Affleck 48 with who she was engaged back in 2002 after her split with the baseball star.

A decade ago Delta Air Lines (DAL 0.93%) became known as a savvy acquirer of used aircraft. However as its fleet aged and its cash flow surged toward the middle of the past decade Delta began ordering brand-new jets in increasing numbers. By late 2019 management was talking about a new fleet strategy focused on fleet simplification and a shift to new-technology aircraft.

However the COVID-19 pandemic caused Delta to rethink its fleet strategy once again. The airline has regained interest in used jets and has reportedly finalized at least two deals for used aircraft recently.

Why Delta used to love used aircraft

Delta exited the Great Recession with a weak balance sheet and plenty of aircraft in need of replacement: most notably 71 DC-9s that were 35 years old on average. It also needed to expand its fleet over the following years to take advantage of the recovery in air-travel demand.

The airline solved this conundrum by scouring the globe for out-of-favor jets that it could buy or lease cheaply. These included a slew of MD-90s acquired from various foreign airlines and 88 Boeing 717s subleased from Southwest Airlines. Delta's experienced maintenance organization gave it a competitive advantage in managing the resulting operational complexity.

By leaning on cheap used aircraft for most of its growth and replacement needs in the five years after the Great Recession Delta was able to generate solid free cash flow despite the slow economic recovery. That allowed it to steadily pay down debt bolstering its balance sheet.

More recently Delta changed strategies. First cash flow soared beginning around 2014 giving Delta the flexibility to ramp up capital spending. Second it became difficult to find parts for MD-90s a few years ago exposing a drawback of buying ""orphan"" aircraft that were produced in small numbers. As a result Delta has been spending billions of dollars a year on new jets recently and buying few (if any) used aircraft.

The calculus has changed

The pandemic changed management's perspective in three key ways. First the full-service airline accelerated the retirement of hundreds of jets last year in order to simplify its fleet and reduce costs. Second the pandemic caused Delta to burn billions of dollars of cash making balance sheet restoration a key priority for the next few years. Third used aircraft values have tumbled due to the sharp drop in air travel demand -- particularly outside the U.S. and China.

Once again used aircraft represent an elegant solution allowing Delta to replace the jets it plans to retire in a cost-effective manner. It has agreed to lease seven Airbus A350s from AerCap according to The Air Current (subscription required). These jets were previously operated by LATAM which decided earlier this year to permanently eliminate the A350 from its fleet even though its oldest A350s were delivered in 2016.

The Air Current also reports that Delta has reached a deal to buy 29 Boeing 737-900ERs that Asian budget carrier Lion Air previously operated. And the airline could potentially expand its used aircraft plans further depending on market conditions.

A new take on an old strategy

While Delta appears poised to scoop up dozens of used jets it hasn't actually reverted to its fleet strategy of a decade ago. The used jets it is pursuing this year are quite young: particularly the A350s. Moreover they fit with the airline's fleet simplification plans. Delta has 130 737-900ERs in its fleet today averaging less than five years of age. It also has 15 A350s plus orders for 20 more.

Despite pursuing relatively modern aircraft this time around Delta is likely to secure big discounts relative to pre-pandemic prices as the supply of used jets continues to outstrip demand by a wide margin. Thus it will be able to continue modernizing and simplifying its fleet -- and reaping the associated cost savings -- while keeping capex in check.

Investors got a glimpse at the alternative last month as United Airlines ordered 270 new jets to update and expand its fleet. This boosted United's capex commitments by more than $12 billion to a staggering $35.9 billion. Delta's move to capitalize on the availability of cheap modern used jets looks far more shareholder-friendly and will enable the company to fix its balance sheet much faster than rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1yZWZ1c2VkLWJvYXJkaW5nLXRvLXR1cmtpc2gtZml0bmVzcy1tb2RlbC1vdmVyLXJldmVhbGluZy1jbG90aGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Refused Boarding To Turkish Fitness Model Over Revealing Clothes,"Deniz Saypinar the first Turkish woman to become an International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness pro and the first non-American to win the US National Bikini Fitness Competition is a fitness model with over 1 million followers on Instagram. American Airlines denied her boarding on a flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Miami on Thursday because they found her attire too revealing.

In an Instagram story she said the airline‚Äôs employees called her ‚Äúnaked.‚Äù She posted photos of her outfit at the airport. Here she is in a DFW bathroom wearing ‚Äúa brown top denim shorts and trainers as well as a white blouse tied around her waist.‚Äù

Saypinar says she ‚Äúlike[s] to wear feminine clothes that reveal my femininity but I never dress in a way that will offend anyone. I‚Äôm mature and civilized enough to know what I can and cannot wear.‚Äù She felt treated ‚Äúlike the worst person in the world for wearing denim shorts.‚Äù

To her it‚Äôs an issue of feminism and religious freedom offering that she ‚Äúmoved from Islamic country because how they treat women as a [redacted] second or third even no class and now this is happening.‚Äù

According to American Airlines

On July 8 American Airlines denied boarding for a customer traveling from Dallas-Fort Worth to Miami. As stated in the conditions of carriage all customers must dress appropriately and offensive clothing isn‚Äôt permitted onboard our flights. The customer was advised of our policy and was rebooked on a subsequent flight. The customer has since arrived in Miami.

In November Southwest Airlines kicked a Playboy Playmate off a flight over her revealing outfit. And in October a Southwest pilot gave a woman his sweater so she‚Äôd be allowed to fly since her ‚Äúlow-cut black halter top‚Äù was deemed inappropriate for the airline which plastered a bikini model on the side of one of its Boeing 737s.

Southwest is known for these sorts of incidents the way that Spirit Airlines and the U.K.‚Äôs Jet2 are known for lewd and drunk passenger stories. But passenger dress issues happen at American too.

Virgin America since acquired by Alaska Airlines famously declared ‚Äòall passengers are welcome‚Äô after a woman was photographed at one of their checkin desks in her underwear."

Just in time for the premiere of Marvel‚Äôs Black Widow Totally the Bomb has now created a Black Widow Frappuccino recipe you can order off the secret menu at Starbucks! As usual you will need to give your Starbucks barista step-by-step instructions as they won‚Äôt be familiar with how to make it if you just order a Black Widow Frappuccino. Lucky for us Totally the Bomb was kind enough to share the directions:

Start by ordering a Grande Strawberry Cream Frappuccino. Ask for extra puree in and around the cup. Ask for two pumps of white mocha. Ask for one scoop of strawberry inclusions. Ask for mocha cookie crumble topping. Ask for mocha drizzle. Ask for more strawberry inclusions to go on top of the whipped cream.

And that‚Äôs it! Look at how wickedly delicious this drink looks. The flavors are bold just like our leading hero and the colors are black and red just like a Black Widow!

Fans have been anxiously awaiting the premiere of Marvel‚Äôs Black Widow for a while now and fans all over the world are flocking to both the movie theaters and accessing the film with premiere access on Disney+. If you have plans to watch the movie soon be sure to stop by Starbucks first and order one of these amazing drinks to get in the spirit of celebrating the movie!

As soon as we heard that Starbucks was now offering an afternoon tea set we knew there was one thing we had to do before heading out to try it. We picked up the phone called the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo the only place in Japan where it was being offered and asked the staff how many minutes it took for them to sell out every day. They replied:

‚ÄúOn the first day we sold out in 60 minutes.‚Äù

With that information on hand we knew that in order to be able to try the new set for ourselves we‚Äôd have to line up right at the time it became available if not a little beforehand to ensure we didn‚Äôt make a wasted trip out to the Reserve Roastery.

The afternoon tea set made its debut on the menu on 7 July and is only available from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and only in limited quantities. We set out on 8 July with plenty of time to head to the Teavana section of the Roastery by 1:00 p.m. but when we got there just before sale time there was already a queue of people waiting to get a seat.

Starbucks truly has some diehard fans in Tokyo because this afternoon tea isn‚Äôt cheap ‚Äî it‚Äôs priced at 4620 yen (US$42) per person.

Thankfully we weren‚Äôt the only people feasting on afternoon tea for one because once we were seated we saw a number of other singles indulging in the experience. And as soon as staff brought our set out to us we were glad we‚Äôd ordered it because well look how beautiful it is!

The set comes with a pot of tea ‚Äî there are threes type of black teas and one type of Japanese tea to choose from ‚Äî and the one we chose was the Strawberry Mint Oolong.

‚ñº The hue was gorgeous and the flavour was fruity and refreshing.

The afternoon tea goes by the name ‚ÄúRoastery Pasticcini Flight‚Äú with the Italian word ‚Äúpasticcini‚Äù meaning ‚Äúsmall sweets‚Äù. While the tea is provided by Teavana the Roastery‚Äôs tea specialist section the pasticcini is made up of colourful cakes and baked goods from the Roastery‚Äôs Princi bakery.

‚ñº The two-tier tray of sweets was a masterpiece to look at.

The tea set contains the following bite-sized delights (pictured from left-to-right on the top tray in the photo below): Chestnut Cream Puff Berry and Pistachio Mousse Cake Dark Chocolate Biscuit Lemon Meringue‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and on the bottom tray: Rum Raisin Loaf Cake Vanilla Biscuit Cheesecake and Butter Cream and Caramel Pastry.

‚ñº One of the highlights for us was the chocolate biscuit which was impeccably made and absolutely decadent on the taste buds.

Every morsel was delicious and the set also comes with three types of savoury bites: a Polenta Scone with Italian Honey Mascarpone Cream a Sweet Potato Scone with Seven Spice and Bottarga (salted cured fish roe) Mascarpone Cream and a Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese Caprese Sandwich.

Despite being classified as savoury the scones were still on the sweet side so the only truly savoury item on the menu was the Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese Caprese Sandwich which was tasty and delightfully salty.

After polishing off the Roastery Pasticcini Flight we understood why the afternoon tea set was so popular. It was a wonderful feast for the senses and it allowed us to feel as if we‚Äôd been transported to Italy for the afternoon. Plus the quality of everything we consumed was far higher than anything you‚Äôd usually get at a regular Starbucks making this a very special treat for Starbucks fans.

The Roastery Pasticcini Flight won‚Äôt be on the menu forever though as it‚Äôs only been released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Starbucks‚Äô first arrival in Japan. Other festivities to celebrate the milestone anniversary include exclusive Roastery beverages and the release of 47 Frappuccinos around Japan one exclusive to each prefecture so there‚Äôs still plenty more options to explore on the menu!

The worker shortage is blamed,"Crossing western Pennsylvania on their way to Virginia Beach Jennifer and Mikayla Matheney followed a familiar green Starbucks sign to the Pennsylvania Turnpike‚Äôs Oakmont service plaza. But the chain‚Äôs espresso machines ‚Äî and counters ‚Äî were empty.

Although Mikayla was able to find her iced vanilla latte an hour further east at the Turnpike‚Äôs South Somerset plaza she and her mother arrived with the realization their lunch options were no less limited. Three of the plaza‚Äôs five eateries ‚Äî Popeye‚Äôs Sbarro and Auntie Anne‚Äôs ‚Äî were closed leaving travelers to choose from the well-known Seattle coffee chain and Burger King.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kind of stuck with what they have on the Turnpike right now‚Äù said Jennifer Matheney of Akron Ohio while waiting for her daughter in the plaza‚Äôs food court-style dining hall Thursday. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs basically closed except Burger King.‚Äù

Spanning the state between Lawrence County and the Lehigh Valley the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission‚Äôs 17 always-open service plazas dot the roadway every 45 minutes or so ‚Äî offering recurring reminders of how the current COVID-19 climate continues to impact the food service industry. Even as virus cases continue to fall across much of the nation and summer travel revs up the plazas‚Äô contracted operator HMSHost is still struggling to find people to fill shifts Turnpike Commission officials said.

The story is consistent along the 360-mile toll road Turnpike Commission spokeswoman Roseanne Placey said. ‚ÄúOur service plazas are experiencing the same sorts of issues everyone in the hospitality industry is facing ‚Äî staffing is down significantly and they are struggling to hire folks‚Äù Placey said.

With motorists‚Äô minds shifting to vacation mode rising demands threatens to magnify the issue. More people will be lining up to grab meals inside the plazas ‚Äî with the same limited number of employees there to serve them Placey acknowledged. ‚ÄúRight now we‚Äôre asking everyone to be patient‚Äù she said.

Nearly 6 million people used the highway over the 10-day Fourth of July travel period ‚Äî a 20% increase from 2020. Maryland-based HMSHost operates travel centers from Indiana to Maine and as far south as Beckley West Virginia. Company officials did not respond to messages for comment about the worker shortage. A manager inside the South Somerset plaza declined comment citing corporate policy while she shifted from handling duties behind Burger King‚Äôs counter to straightening up in the customer area just before lunchtime on Thursday.

One staff member indicated restaurant options expand during peak weekend hours but there were no indications of how long the overall closures could extend.

That was tough news to swallow for Angel Peralta. The Newark New Jersey man was hoping for a bowl of Sbarro pasta for lunch during his trip. Peralta said he sometimes travels the Pennsylvania Turnpike three times a week which means he either has to pack something to eat or rely on a limited service plaza.

‚ÄúOnce in a while a fast-food burger is fine but you can‚Äôt eat it every day‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs pretty much the choice you have right now.‚Äù

Still that doesn‚Äôt mean the folks working inside the plazas are to blame travelers said. Jennifer Matheney works in the plumbing business and despite the good wages it brings her company is backed up with scheduled jobs she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of work but there aren‚Äôt enough people around who want to do it‚Äù the Ohio woman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just here. It‚Äôs the same problem everywhere.‚Äù

In the video TikToker @mrleighteaches can be seen alongside a co-worker turn off the different products on screen to make them look like they were unavailable to purchase.

The former worker explained in the video text that he had done this ‚Äúso it can be a slow day at work.‚Äù

At the end of the video @mrleighteaches and his co-worker can be seen laughing at their antics and doing a shushing motion.

We can‚Äôt imagine their local customers were too impressed when they came across this...

Though the TikToker does not have to worry about losing his job over the stunt as he explains in the video caption: ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt fire me if I already quit‚Äù along with a skull emoji.

Since it was uploaded three days ago the TikTok has been viewed over 175000 times. You can watch the video in full here.

People flooded the comments asking if this may be why their favourite Starbuck drink is never in stock.

One person wrote: ‚ÄúIs this why I can‚Äôt order my Refresher?!?!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo this is why my store says they‚Äôre out of caramel when I literally see them add caramel on drinks‚Äù another person added.

‚ÄúMy Starbucks order is always out of blonde roast on the app but always has it when I order in stores lmao I know the truth now‚Äù a fourth person replied.

The TikTok responded to the last comment saying: ‚ÄúSometimes we have to turn off the blonde button when we clean our machines throughout the day.‚Äù

He also wrote in the comment section: ‚ÄúYesterday was my last day cheers to being free from the bux.‚Äù

In a follow-up video he addressed the people who left negative comments.

The TikToker responds to the negative comments on his previously video TikTok/mrleighteaches

He wrote: ‚ÄúPeople pressed about my last video... but just so you know.‚Äù

Using a Kourtney Kardashian voiceover @mrleighteaches mouthed her words: ‚ÄúWe all have different priorities and like working it‚Äôs just it‚Äôs not my top priority.‚Äù

He then shows off his Starbucks shirt that says ‚ÄúPartner of the Quarter‚Äù and writes: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get this shirt without being amazing at what you do.‚Äù You can watch the video in full here.

According to Starbucks website The Partner of the Quarter(POQ) award recognizes the significant contributions of eligible partners (cafe attendants baristas shift supervisors and shift managers)."

He didn't feel any different.

""Kind of like the day you turn 40"" he said chuckling. ""Feels the same as when you were 39 the day before.""

Besides he said the new beginning for St. Thomas athletics was less of a light switch moment and more a blur of projects that needed to be crossed off a never-ending checklist over the past year after the school successfully petitioned the NCAA to jump directly to D-I.

With so many things to do and so little time to do them it felt like running a mile at a dead sprint.

""We are starting from scratch"" said Esten hired as AD in November 2018. ""I think some people don't realize how blank the slate actually was.""

Esten has hired four new head coaches (with one more coming soon) and 12 full-time staff employees while signing off on the addition of a dozen or so full-time assistant coaches. And he still has more positions to fill.

Being able to offer athletic scholarships brings a labyrinth rulebook and stringent regulations. For instance Tommies men's basketball coach Johnny Tauer coached in recent summers an AAU team that included Michigan signee Will Tschetter of Stewartville the state's No. 2 ranked recruit. The NCAA allowed it because D-III does not offer scholarships. Not anymore now that Tauer is a D-I coach.

Esten hired a compliance director to keep everything in order. Every coach went through NCAA recruiting certification last fall.

The Tommies also now must comply with the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate (APR) which penalizes teams that fall short of standards. Esten hired a director of academic support who is responsible for among other things developing systems to monitor academic data that must be reported.

Fundraising? Yep that's a major component of any D-I operation. Esten hired a senior administrator to oversee this growth and create a new fundraising umbrella called the Tommie Athletic Fund.

The department build-out touched every area: facilities ticketing sports medicine strength and training communications. The extreme makeover included having to change out all the MIAC signage on campus to Summit League.

""In any given year that's a project for us one summer"" Esten said. ""But it's just one of 87 other things.""

That list included an about-face in June on eliminating women's tennis after being threatened with a Title IX lawsuit.

Esten worked in athletic departments at Ohio State Minnesota California and Penn State so he understands what he calls the ""normal cadence of business"" in D-I. St. Thomas had to create that operation in one year.

""A year from now we'll be so much smarter"" he said. ""We'll have a year under our belt as far as selling tickets engaging with corporate sponsorships recruiting scheduling.""

The Tommies' move comes with a provisional status for five years making them ineligible for NCAA postseason play but allowing them a buffer to get up to speed. Esten told his coaches not to worry about wins and losses right away but to build a sustainable foundation instead.

""Let's put it all together so that by the time we hit the end of that provisional period we're in a position to be successful"" he said. ""That helps you not get too concerned about the immediate jump that we have to take.""

St. Thomas signed an inaugural D-I class of 150 athletes who have an average grade-point average of 3.65 Esten said. The number of athletes on full-ride scholarships is about one-quarter of what the final number will be eventually as that process moves in phases.

Esten has a projects wish list. His No. 1 priority for facilities is to build a hockey arena with a capacity of 4000 to 5000. He envisions a new basketball arena of similar size someday.

The next milestone happens Aug. 19 the school's first Division I contest when women's soccer plays at Wisconsin-Green Bay.

As he relaxed over lunch this past week Esten didn't need a reminder of what lies ahead but his mind drifted there.

The last women's hockey game St. Thomas played as a D-III program came against St. Mary's. Their first Division I game will be against Ohio State a national semifinalist this season.

The last men's hockey opponent before the transition was St. John's. Next up: St. Cloud State the national runner-up.

No miles-long trail of brake lights white knuckles on steering wheels or lengthy commute times that can exponentially increase with a mechanical failure of the swing bridge in Madisonville.

Trump came through the fighter tunnel before the welterweight bout between Gilbert Burns and Stephen Thompson. The crowd was on its feet as he was escorted to his seat near the octagon near where supporter and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was seated.

Despite the mainly pro-Trump crowd there were some faint boos sprinkled in throughout. However they were quickly drowned out as multiple ""U-S-A"" chants broke out.

Trump and UFC President Dana White have had a long-standing friendship. In November 2019 Trump became the first person ever elected into office to attend a UFC event when he sat cageside at UFC 244 in his home state of New York where he received more boos than cheers. White in return spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention advocating for Trump's presidential re-election.

Following UFC 264 White told reporters he met with Trump before the main event and that having Trump at T-Mobile Arena was just ""two friends who are fight fans watching a fight.""

Trump's attendance is one of the few public appearances he's made since leaving the White House in January. He recently held a rally in Florida as the Trump Organization was indicted by a grand jury in Manhattan for tax-related offenses last week.

Former President Donald Trump was met with boos cheers and chants of ‚ÄúU-S-A‚Äù when he arrived for the McGregor vs Poirier UFC fight in Las Vegas.

The loud chants and cheers largely overshadowed the boos of Mr Trump as he entered the T-Mobile Arena through the fighter‚Äôs tunnel with UFC president Dana White late on Saturday.

Mr Trump and Mr White have been friends for a long time. The then-president became the first elected officeholder to ever attend a UFC event when he went to UFC 244 in New York in 2019 USA Today reported. Unlike in Nevada Mr Trump was greeted with more boos than cheers in his home state.

Mr White spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention pushing for his reelection. The UFC boss told reporters that having the former president at UFC 246 was just ‚Äútwo friends who are fight fans watching a fight‚Äù.

Mr Trump was escorted to a seat near the octagon close to the owner of the New England Patriots Robert Kraft.

Donald Trump Jr shared a video from the event.

Mr Trump arrived for the final three fights at the packed arena.

Other celebrities who attended the fight included Dave Chappelle Mel Gibson Miles Teller Jared Leto Steve Aoki Jackass‚Äô Steve-O Baker Mayfield and Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis.

Ahead of their July 22 showcase EA will announce the return of an old sports franchise. Fans are already speculating what that game will be.

Return of Beloved Franchise?

The publishing titan already has their hands full with Madden FIFA and the return of NCAA Football. Still could they have more up their sleeve? Fans have been clamoring for returns to beloved franchises like Def Jam Fight Night and SSX just to name a few.

It has been 10 years since the last Fight Night and maybe ESBC was the jolt EA needed to make another one. Def Jam promised game news if fans got them to 1 million followers. Though it may have been a marketing ploy anything can happen in the game industry.

EA has reached into their extensive library before. Around this time last year they announced the return of the Skate franchise. So it is not beneath them to bring old games back from the dead.

The publisher already has a big month ahead of them. Throughout the month they will make appearances showing Battlefield 2042 and Madden. Even Knockout City is making an appearance.

From their website ‚ÄúLook we‚Äôre not allowed to tell you much about this one yet sorry. But we can say this Spotlight will highlight an extremely cool new addition to an extremely popular and long-running EA SPORTS franchise. We may have said too much already. Just keep your calendar free OK?‚Äù

We have 2 weeks until the showcase and the excitement is already there. With the power of next-gen consoles EA can potentially deliver new experiences for old and new fans alike. We will have to wait and see what franchise they decide to bring back from the dead.

GreetingsMy Model Y has experienced significant paint damage reported by other owners to the leading edge and bottom rear bump-out on the rear doors of the car from road debris being kicked up by the tires. Both driver and passenger rear doors appear to be ‚Äúsandblasted‚Äù in these areas. This damage occurred with less than 10000 miles and driving exclusively on paved roads. I do live in a snowy winter climate but we actually use very little sand on the roads where I live. I did not experience similar damage with my previous Model 3 which I drove for more than 30000 miles. And in more than 40 years of driving dozens of vehicles in similar conditions I‚Äôve never experienced this type of damage.I would like to connect with other owners who have experienced similar damage and. I‚Äôm aware that Tesla has repaired similar damage under warranty for some owners. But my polite requests to Tesla to repair this damage have so far fallen on deaf ears. If you got Tesla to repair this type of paint damage please contact me by PM on this site. There is strength in numbers!In my opinion this damage results from a design flaw in the Model Y due to the tires protruding more from the wheel wells and the failure of Tesla to install mud flaps and/or PPF at the factory. Both mud flaps and PPF for the rear door panels are now sold by Tesla as accessories and recommended by Tesla Service as the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to this problem but are not installed at the factory on new vehicles. In addition there have been several reports of testing of paint hardness on Tesla vehicles which reveals Tesla paint is not as hard as other manufacturers. Finnish Tesla Model 3 Inspection Reveals Soft Thin Under-Spec Paint In addition the damage to the leading edges of the doors was caused by incorrect door installation at the factory. Specifically the lower edge of the rear doors was installed so the rear door was sitting slightly ‚Äúproud‚Äù of the front doors. This resulted in the leading edge of the rear door protruding into the slip stream and allowing debris to impact the leading edge of the door. Tesla service actually adjusted the doors to correct that defect under warranty. So I‚Äôm not sure why they won‚Äôt cover the paint damage that was caused under warranty too.Finally if you had similar damage repaired I would be interested in hearing about what was required and how much it cost to repair the damage.I‚Äôm a Tesla fan and stockholder. I am not looking to create FUD or asking for anything unreasonable in my opinion. I want Tesla to do the right thing by their owners and stand behind their product. In general I‚Äôm delighted with my car and Tesla as a brand. This is the one exception to an otherwise excellent owner experience.Thanks!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzExL3JvZGVudHMtY2hvdy1kb3duLW9uLXRlc2xhcy1jYXVzaW5nLXRob3VzYW5kcy1pbi1kYW1hZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rodents chow down on Teslas causing thousands in damage,"Elon Musk may have a rat problem.

Fans of the South African billionaire‚Äôs electric cars say rats mice and rodents are chomping down on their Teslas. And despite having dropped tens of thousands of dollars to buy the pricey vehicles Tesla refuses to cover the damage.

Sarah Williams a 41-year-old physician who lives in Manhattan and uses her Tesla to commute to work in the Bronx told The Post of an alarming incident when she took her 2018 Model 3 into Tesla‚Äôs Paramus NJ dealership in mid-May after her air conditioner had stopped working.

‚ÄúThey opened the glove compartment and a rodent fell out‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

The pest apparently found its way into Williams‚Äô Tesla and gobbled through several internal wires that were insulated with soy rather than oil which critics claim makes them more appealing to rodents.

5 The dead rat in Sarah Williams‚Äô Tesla.

When Williams ‚Äî who paid $59200 for her car ‚Äî complained the company refused to help. The repair has taken more than a month and estimated costs have soared over $5000 she said.

Despite repeated promises that the pricey vehicle will be ready soon Williams was unable to pick up her Tesla at the time of this publication ‚Äî almost two months later.

‚ÄúMost auto manufacturers use the soybean vs. oil in their wire insulation for newer vehicles because it is less expensive and better for the environment‚Äù Tesla service adviser Jose Solis wrote in an email to Williams that she shared with The Post. ‚ÄúThe use of this material would not be considered a ‚Äòdefect‚Äô in design or use ‚Ä¶ Considering there are too many factors outside of Tesla‚Äôs control we cannot cover this under a warranty or repair.‚Äù

Solis is right that it‚Äôs not just Telsa.

5 Rat damage in Sarah Williams‚Äô Tesla.

Automakers have been getting slammed for years with complaints of their allegedly rat-friendly soy-based wiring. And like Tesla they have all refused to cover the damage claiming that rats chewing on car innards is the result of nature and therefore not their problem.

‚ÄúIt is a long-established fact that rodents are drawn to chew on electrical wiring in homes cars or anywhere else they may choose to nest‚Äù Honda told the Chicago Sun-Times in June about an Illinois man‚Äôs efforts to bring a class-action case against it.

Tesla so far only appears to be unique in having escaped legal action tied to its use of soy materials. But that could change as complaints about rats in Teslas appear to rise along with the popularity of the brand now valued at $632 billion.

Toby Bateson a UK-based inventor who came up with a product designed to keep rats out of vehicles said his company has seen special interest from Tesla drivers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a lot of inquiries from Tesla owners because they seem to be vulnerable to the problem‚Äù he said adding that his company has been contacted by about 150 Tesla owners with rodent issues over the past year.

Bateson sells a product called the RatMat which he describes as a ‚Äúhorizontal electric fence‚Äù that keeps rodents from entering vehicles. In New York the RatMat is distributed by a Kips Bay company called HoneyDoBoys which charges about $1500 to $1700 for a single parking spot-size system the company‚Äôs owner Paul Turzio told The Post.

Bateson said that in addition to wiring damage some Tesla owners had told him their brake cables were chewed by rodents ‚Äúto the point of the car becoming unusable.‚Äù

Other Tesla owners who have complained of rats include a user of the Tesla Motors Club forum who griped that his 5-month-old electric vehicle went ‚Äúhaywire‚Äù after a mouse chewed through the coolant hose which may also be made from soy-based materials although it‚Äôs unclear if this is the case for Tesla.

‚ÄúApparently this is not uncommon especially with electric cars‚Äù the user lamented.

And this year an apparent Tesla owner complained on Reddit that his brand-new Model 3 was undrivable just two weeks after it was delivered due to rat damage. Several other users have complained about damage from mice and squirrels on the forum as well.

The Post did not immediately receive a reply to a request for comment from Tesla which is owned by Elon Musk who went by the nickname ‚ÄúMuskrat‚Äù as a child according to a 2009 New Yorker profile.

The complaints come as concerns about rats have risen generally.

The number of rodent complaints to New York City‚Äôs 311 hotline surged by 80 percent in March as the economy reopened to 2906 ‚Äî over and above even March 2019 levels of 2395 Bloomberg recently reported.

One reason may be that rats were forced to change their habits during the pandemic when their normal sources of food dried up including by moving into emptied-out office buildings according to Pest.co.uk.

5 The news comes as more and more Teslas hit the rat-infested streets of New York City. AFP via Getty Images

‚ÄúWe are gearing up for a busy year in 2021‚Äù Jenny Rathbone of Pest.co.uk said.

Meanwhile more Teslas are being introduced to rat-infested areas like the Big Apple. At least one Model 3 is currently in use as a yellow cab ‚Äî and hundreds more are expected to enter service in the coming years according to Business Insider.

Williams says she would not recommend any other New Yorkers buy Teslas until the company rodent-proofs its vehicles.

‚ÄúFor me if I‚Äôm going really fast on the highway and I reach for something in my glove compartment and a rat crawls out it could be a catastrophe‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWho cares if you have this great technology if a rat is in there eating the wires?‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMS90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLW1vZGVsLXktc3RpbGwtZG9taW5hdGUtdXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXNhbGVzL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMS90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLW1vZGVsLXktc3RpbGwtZG9taW5hdGUtdXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXNhbGVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 & Model Y Still Dominate US Electric Car Sales (Charts),"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

I love seeing the tremendous growth of electric vehicle sales in Europe which is likely to achieve more than 10% of new car sales being plugin vehicle sales this year but there is something bittersweet about it. The bitter part is that Europe‚Äôs quick EV adoption makes the story in the United States quite a bit depressing.

It‚Äôs wonderful that we have Tesla ‚Äî no doubt. It‚Äôs great to see Teslas all over the place in the area of Florida where I live and I‚Äôm sure in many other places in the United States. Tesla is indeed a wonderful American business and sustainability story and it‚Äôs simply stunning that this still-young automotive company has broken into the big time and is producing and selling nearly a million vehicles a year many of those in the U.S. However those sales don‚Äôt approach 10% market share and neither do all EV sales combined. When I create our quarterly U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales reports there‚Äôs a truly inspiring side and a side that is not so uplifting. We need more models at or near the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y level in order to make significant progress.

That said even though Tesla still dominates the U.S. market (through the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y) and even though no other models are close to Tesla‚Äôs in terms of sales it seems that we are seeing signs of life from a few others. If you can look beyond the two Tesla mountains in the sales charts you can see that there are a few brands that are increasing their EV sales significantly on the backs of a few nearly high-volume models.

Notably two of those models ‚Äî the Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford Mustang Mach-E ‚Äî were the two contenders for 2021 CleanTechnica Car of the Year that got the most votes from readers and the third model (the one with the most sales aside from Tesla‚Äôs top models) was the 2017 CleanTechnica Car of the Year. It seems that our writers and readers might know what they‚Äôre talking about when they highlight top electric models.

It should also be said that we don‚Äôt have data for some electric models ‚Äî the Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV most notably. All indications imply that they are not achieving many sales in the U.S. but we can‚Äôt really evaluate that like we can with the other models because Hyundai and Kia didn‚Äôt build them on dedicated electric platforms and don‚Äôt break out their sales from the sales of their gas-powered twins in their monthly sales reports.

Getting more specific with regards to the models that we do have data for you can see that the Chevy Bolt EV + Chevy Bolt EUV combined for more than 11000 sales in the quarter (which is sort of like combining the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y as Tesla does in its sales reports). The Bolt EV/EUV led the market outside of Tesla‚Äôs top sellers. The Ford Mustang Mach-E (6356 sales) and Volkswagen ID.4 (5756 sales) were significantly below the Bolt but these are young faces. I do expect more from them in the future as production ramps up and word gets around that they are on the market and they are great vehicles.

The old-timer Nissan LEAF is also still doing its part getting 4804 sales in the 2nd quarter. This vehicle likely gets its sales from low prices at dealerships around the country that notably undercut the prices of other popular electric models. Also the vehicle has been on the market for so many years that there may still be repeat buyers upgrading their LEAFs rather than jumping to a Tesla (as many early LEAF buyers have done) Chevy Bolt Ford Mustang Mach-E Volkswagen ID.4 or other new electric car.

That‚Äôs the story of the U.S. electric vehicle market for now. The trend lines are up for several models and they have plenty of room to rise this year if their makers are willing to push them much faster now.

What are your predictions for these models for the rest of the year? Are any of these non-Tesla electric models going to one day get to 100000+ vehicle sales in a year? Or starting at a lower step which models will surpass 50000 sales a year in the U.S.?

This is the car recently range tested which is supposedly equipped with a 82 kWh battery (Panasonic cells).

Additionally the video shows a Performance version (but this session was noticeably slower maybe because of older software) and an older 2019 Tesla Model 3 Long Range which was the fastest charging version so far. The data comes from the ScanMyTesla app.

The main thing for us is to see how the 2021 compares to the 2019 version as well as to other tests.

Charging power vs state-of-charge (SOC)

The shape of the charging curve is typical to Tesla although the peak charging power of 249 kW is available only for a short while.

State-of-charge (SOC) vs time

Charging from 20% to 80% SOC took about 31 minutes.

The chart below is only for illustrative purposes:

Average charging power vs state-of-charge (SOC)

The average power in the very important range from 20% to 80% SOC is 94 kW which is 38% of the peak value.

C-rate vs state-of-charge (SOC)

The peak C-rate* - charging power in relation to the total battery capacity of 82 kWh (estimated) - is about 3.0C.

The average C-rate when charging from 20% to 80% SOC is over 1.1C.

*C-rate tells us how the charging power relates to the battery pack capacity. For example: 1C is 1-hour charging power (current) when the power value in kW is equal to the battery pack capacity in kWh. 2C would be enough to recharge in half an hour.

The net battery capacity of 76.5 kWh (estimated) stands for about 93% of the total battery capacity.

Range replenishing speed vs state-of-charge (SOC)

The rate of range replenishing depends on the energy consumption and the energy consumption depends on the use case. Here we will focus on the WLTP test cycle.

WLTP

Taking into consideration the WLTP range of 614 km (382 miles) and available battery capacity of 76.5 kWh we can assume energy consumption of 125 Wh/km (200 Wh/mile).

The effective average speed of range replenishing when charging from 20% to 80% SOC would be 12.5 km/minute (7.8 miles/minute).

Comparisons with other EVs

Now it's time to compare the results to the other tests. We have a total of six examples:

Comparison of charging power

Let's start with the first three cars tested by Bj√∏rn Nyland. As we can see the car from 2019 has the best charging curve despite it having less battery capacity by a few kWh.

The 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range holds the peak value much shorter while the session for the Performance version appears to be a bit strange (we will leave it aside).

Here we have a comparison of all six cars (blue and yellow are Tom Moloughney's tests) which also shows that the 2019 cars noted better results than 2021 (the peak value lasted up to almost 30% SOC).

The average charging power in the 20-80% SOC window in the case of 2021 Tesla Model 3 LR tested by Bj√∏rn Nyland are below 100 kW (Tom Moloughney noted 106 kW) while the older cars noted noticeably more than 100 kW (128 kW and 113 kW).

The interesting thing is that even at a CCS2 charging station (without exceeding 200 kW) the average was around 128 kW.

The 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (AWD) tested by needed some 31 minutes to go from 20% to 80% SOC while the 2019 equivalent did it in just about 22 minutes. That's a significant difference.

Comparison of C-rate

The peak C-rates at V2 Superchargers are similar between the packs.

Conclusions

The conclusion from the DC fast charging tests of Long Range Tesla Model 3 at V3 Superchargers is that the older cars - 2019-2020 - appear to have a better charging curve with a wider window of peak power.

Of course a lot depends on a particular session but that's what we see from this particular comparison.

It remains an open question whether Tesla sacrificed some of the charging performance for higher energy density (longer range) and/or efficiency longevity or cost of the batteries in the latest editions of its cars.

Bj√∏rn Nyland is already considering an additional test of the 2021 Long Range version with LG Chem's LG Energy Solution batteries.

Refraction AI's 4.5-foot tall 150-pound Rev-1 three-wheeled robot vehicle has been delivering pizzas in Austin Texas. The company believes the future of autonomous driving is 'zero occupant.' Source: Refraction AI

As companies like Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk come to Austin Texas the booming city and new tech hub has grown so much it has struggled to make good on its ""keep it weird"" motto. But since early June when residents of the South Congress Downtown or Travis Heights neighborhoods order pizza from Southside Flying Pizza their pies might arrive inside a three-wheeled robot ‚Äî the REV-1. But it is no full self-driving Tesla. About two dozen REV-1 vehicles now trundle down the roads of Austin and Ann Arbor Michigan where the company behind the robots ‚Äî Refraction AI ‚Äî first launched in 2019 in a bid to harness driverless technology in a new way. Autonomous vehicles and their potential to disrupt the way people get around have hovered on the horizon for years. But the technology hasn't matured as dramatically as early investors had hoped. Tesla says it is full speed ahead with autonomous and is launching its latest beta test on July 10 but the company has missed many self-imposed deadlines and Musk recently conceded that full self-driving is harder than he had forecast. Meanwhile both Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving research divisions in recent months. For start-ups like Refraction AI though the aim is to speed the arrival of a driverless future by starting small with more modest systems focused on moving packages rather than people. ""We think this is the future of autonomy"" Refraction AI CEO Luke Schneider said.

A 150-pound challenge to Alphabet Waymo

While one might technically call the electric REV-1 a driverless vehicle it's a completely different beast from the LiDAR-equipped multi-ton vans in development from Alphabet -backed Waymo General Motors -backed Cruise and other multibillion-dollar ventures. Musk has bashed LiDAR in the past calling it a ""crutch"" though recent reports indicate the company has recently used the technology for reasons that remain unclear. The REV-1 ""trikes"" stand 4.5 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds making their profile more like bicycle couriers than delivery vans. And they act like cyclists too. After a restaurant worker places the ""payload"" in a REV-1's storage compartment (which fits about six grocery bags) the robot uses an array of sensors to navigate to the edge of the road or if available a bike lane. It then drives away at no more than 15 miles per hour toward its destination where the customer greets it at the curb and unlocks their meal or package with a unique code. If the vehicle runs into trouble along the way which could include unusual obstacles like a curbed couch or common but tricky-to-automate moves like turning left across traffic or navigating crosswalks a dozen ""pilots"" are standing by to remotely and temporarily take control of the REV-1.

This is going to take a lot more money and a lot more time than we thought it was. It's not going to be a flip switch overnight. Luke Schneider Refraction AI CEO

In Schneider's eyes these distinctions give the REV-1 a crucial edge in the delivery business. The small slow carts can't do much damage in the event of a malfunction. They don't hog the road. And the outsourcing of the trickiest driving to the pilots means the company is ready to deliver food today. Spending years and billions of dollars to develop a fully autonomous 4000-pound vehicle and then using it to deliver pizzas to Schneider is overkill. ""I call it bringing a ballistic missile to a knife fight"" he says. So far the company appears to be making progress in solving this facet of the overall challenge of autonomous driving. They recently reconfigured the REV-1's sensors to give it night vision allowing it to work during the most popular time for meal delivery. Schneider says the REV-1 fleet carried seven times more meals early this year than it did late last and has continued to make more deliveries every month since March. The 50-employee company recently raised 4.2 million dollars in seed money for a total funding of $8 million.

Domino's FedEx and 'zero occupant' Nuro

Refraction AI isn't the only self-driving start-up thinking small. Nuro a California company that has raised about $1.5 billion in funding according to Crunchbase has developed a golf-cart sized delivery vehicle called the R2 capable of driving at 25 miles per hour. In April the R2 began delivering pizzas for Domino's Pizza in Houston Texas. Last week the company announced that its next-generation vehicle will deliver packages in a partnership with FedEx .

Nuro was founded by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu two former Alphabet engineers whose self-driving enterprise became Waymo. They were motivated by an assumption similar to that driving Refraction AI: Getting people entirely out of the equation would allow for a lower stakes first application of driverless vehicles. ""We set out to build a new class of vehicle designed purely for transporting things"" wrote Ferguson in a 2020 Medium post. ""A zero-occupant vehicle."" A Chinese startup Unity Drive Innovation has taken a similar approach to distributing vegetables and meal boxes during the pandemic.

Full self-driving dream economic reality

Even as mini-delivery carts start to venture out into residential streets and bike lanes self-driving behemoths continue to doggedly pursue the technology's full potential: vehicles that can carry anyone or anything anywhere without a driver. Alphabet's Waymo initially rolled out a partially autonomous beta test of its ride hailing service Waymo One in Phoenix Arizona in 2018. Last October it opened the service to the public simultaneously making it fully autonomous with no drivers and no remote pilots ‚Äî although it does use a ""fleet response team"" specialists who feed the cars information when the machines can't interpret an ambiguous situation such as construction or road closures. Waymo has also worked with UPS in Phoenix to shuttle packages between UPS stores and a local shipping hub. And two weeks ago it announced a partnership with trucking company J.B. Hunt to autonomously haul cargo across a route in Texas initially under human supervision. The company's leadership remains confident in what Julianne McGoldrick a Waymo spokeswoman describes as a flywheel effect. Once you develop a vehicle that can navigate the roads about as well as a human can you can use it for any number of applications that will mutually reinforce one other. ""We have seen that all the progress we're making on ride hailing and on passenger cars directly feed into the trucking and local delivery areas and then the progress we make there also goes back into ride hailing"" McGoldrick says.

Fifty years ago this month Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor the 4004. Microprocessors are tiny general-purpose chips that use integrated circuits made up of transistors to process data; they are the core of a modern computer. Intel created the 12 mm2 chip for a printing calculator made by the Japanese company Busicom. The 4004 had 2300 transistors‚Äîa number dwarfed by the billions found in today‚Äôs chips. But the 4004 was leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors packing the computing power of the room-sized vacuum tube‚Äìbased first computers into a chip the size of a fingernail. In the past 50 years microprocessors have changed our culture and economy in unimaginable ways.

Here‚Äôs a look at the historic achievements in materials chemistry and electrical engineering that made the 4004 possible the subsequent advances that resulted in today‚Äôs computers and the cutting-edge technology that could lead to tomorrow‚Äôs devices.

Early days

Vacuum tubes

Credit: US Army

Early computers used vacuum tubes to serve as switches for digital logic calculations. These vacuum tubes consisted of metal electrodes inside a glass tube and could turn the current flowing through them on or off to create the necessary 1 and 0 states. Vacuum tubes were large power hungry and failure prone. The first electronic computer in the US the electronic numerical integrator and computer (ENIAC) booted up in 1945. The size of a room it used over 17000 vacuum tubes whose wiring had to be reconfigured for each new series of calculations.

Birth of the transistor

Credit: Mark Richards/Computer History Museum

Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed an alternative to the vacuum tube in 1926: the transistor. He couldn‚Äôt build one at that time because researchers didn‚Äôt have access to the high-quality semiconductors that are the heart of the transistor. Transistors typically use three metal electrodes and a semiconducting channel. A gate electrode provides enough electrical energy to switch the channel between conducting and insulating states. When conducting current can flow between a source electrode and a drain. Like vacuum tubes these devices can switch between 1 and 0 by turning current on and off and they can amplify electrical signals. But they are more compact sturdy and energy efficient than vacuum tubes. The first transistor was made by a team at AT&T‚Äôs Bell Labs in 1947. It was a small slab of germanium addressed with two gold electrodes held in place by a plastic wedge. A voltage applied to one of the electrodes could modulate the current through the other.

The silicon transistor

Silicon transistors were more reliable and performed better than those made from germanium‚Äîparticularly at the high temperatures demanded in military applications which were some of the major early uses of computing. Texas Instruments announced in 1954 that it had come up with a way to work with silicon and by 1960 silicon had become the dominant transistor material. Like the Texas Instruments transistor shown here‚Äîthe first such silicon device sold commercially‚Äîearly transistors were individual components packed in metal cans with trailing wire connectors. Engineers built circuits from these individual digital switches.

Integrated circuits

The first integrated circuit which brought together multiple transistors on a single piece of germanium used so-called flying wires made of gold. Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments built the circuit in 1958. The industry would soon replace this design with flat integrated circuits that included electrical contacts within the same plane.

Metal-oxide semiconductor transistors

Another key ingredient to microprocessors as we know them today‚Äîand a crucial element of Intel‚Äôs first microprocessors‚Äîis the metal-oxide semiconductor transistor recipe. These transistors consist of layers of conductive metal contacts insulating oxides and semiconductors that use only one kind of charge carrier: either electrons or positively charged species called holes. Early transistors carried both kinds of charges and were faster. But metal-oxide semiconductor transistors used less energy and could be aggressively miniaturized.The microprocessor grows up

Moore‚Äôs law

In 1965 Intel cofounder Gordon Moore then at Fairchild Semiconductor predicted that the number of components on integrated circuits would double every year for 10 years. In 1975 he revised his law to state that components would double every 2 years. Continued innovations in semiconductor manufacturing over the ensuing decades have allowed the industry to match this prediction. In the 50 years since the Intel 4004 computer chips have become increasingly complex and densely packed with transistors and other components‚Äîwithout corresponding increases in size cost or energy use.

Widening wafers

To make integrated circuits today engineers start with thin slices of crystalline silicon called wafers and then repeatedly deposit materials and etch features onto them. They also add other elements to the silicon to change its electrical properties a process called doping. After those steps machines dice wafers into computer chips. One key way the semiconductor industry has kept costs down is by using larger and larger wafers to make more and more chips at once without adding process steps. Early wafers were just a few centimeters in size; chips now are mostly made on 300 mm discs. Wafers are sliced from pure single crystal ingots of silicon grown from molten solutions.

Copper interconnects

As important as transistors are to a microprocessor they‚Äôd be nothing without the minuscule metal wires that connect these switches. Circuits are faster and more efficient when these so-called interconnects are highly conductive and don‚Äôt heat up. Interconnects were initially made from aluminum. IBM introduced more-conductive copper wiring into its chips in 1997 after working out a fix to prevent copper ions from migrating into the surrounding silicon.

Strained silicon

The semiconductor industry made a lot of progress by cramming ever-greater numbers of ever-smaller transistors into circuits. But another way to boost chip performance is to make the individual switches faster. In 2002 Intel announced it could achieve this by putting the meat of its transistors‚Äîthe silicon channel through which electrical current flows when the transistor is on‚Äîunder mechanical strain. By adding materials adjacent to the channels that caused the silicon crystal to stretch apart or compress by about 1% Intel could boost current through the transistors and make the circuits faster.

FinFETs

As transistors got smaller chipmakers hit a wall. In smaller transistors it‚Äôs more challenging to fully turn off the flow of current so transistors that are supposed to be off can still leak current and waste power. This problem led the industry to switch to a new transistor design that wraps insulating material around three of four sides of a silicon channel sticking up from the wafer surface. Called FinFETs or Tri-gate transistors these devices were developed by researchers at the University of California Berkeley in the late 1990s; Intel was the first to adopt them commercially in 2011.

Gate-all-around transistors

One likely pathway for the semiconductor industry to continue miniaturizing chip components is the gate-all-around transistor which goes to the next logical step after the FinFET advance completely enveloping the silicon channel in an insulating material to further prevent leakage. This year IBM demonstrated highly miniaturized chips based on this technology.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.78%) became one of the more notable comeback stories of the last few years. The chip stock bounced back as CEO Lisa Su orchestrated a comeback and built a technical lead on longtime rival Intel (INTC 0.32%). Consequently investors who dared to buy the stock at the lows hit in 2015 when many feared bankruptcy have earned a high-risk but massive reward.

AMD stock fell to a low of $1.61 per share in July 2015. At this level $5000 would have bought an investor around 3105 shares. At the current price of roughly $91 per share this investment would hold a value of about $282640 -- a return of approximately 5550%. This far exceeds the roughly 110% return for the S&P 500 over the same period. Also the stock may have more room to grow as many analysts still consider AMD a hot growth stock.

AMD in 2015

One can forgive investors for not wanting to buy AMD in the summer of 2015. At that time AMD and other PC-related chip stocks such as Intel and NVIDIA (NVDA -1.50%) found themselves supporting what many saw as a dying product. Once companies such as Apple and Samsung introduced consumers to smartphones and later tablets many consumers felt they no longer needed PCs. In 2015 alone PC sales fell by more than 8% marking what was at the time the fourth consecutive year of declining sales according to Gartner.

This hit AMD particularly hard since it had consistently lagged Intel in market share. According to Passmark Software Intel controlled 77% of the PC market in mid-2015 and that percentage had steadily climbed since 2012.

Furthermore due to the three- to five-year cycles required for developing chips an AMD comeback looked like a gamble at best. Since Su had only become CEO the year before investors had no way of knowing if her plan would succeed.

How Su changed AMD

It would also take more than a successful career to convince investors that Su could turn AMD around. After graduating with a doctorate from MIT she worked for both Texas Instruments and IBM later rising to the chief technology officer position at Freescale Semiconductor. Su then started at AMD in 2012 as senior vice president and general manager of global business units before becoming CEO.

Su applied her engineering and business experience to bet the company's fortunes on high-performance CPUs and GPUs letting other businesses fall by the wayside. Also Intel had prospered through the tick-tock cycle advancing manufacturing in ""tick"" years and offering new microarchitecture during the ""tock"" cycle. To buy time AMD pursued both processes simultaneously according to an interview Su gave to CNN.

Through these efforts AMD released its first Ryzen and Epyc processors in 2017. This helped send the stock above $10 per share by January of that year. In time AMD began challenging NVIDIA in the GPU space. It won several contracts and today AMD processors help power Tesla's vehicles as well as gaming consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and the Sony PlayStation. Moreover due to internal problems at Intel AMD took a technical lead in the CPU space. Now AMD sells 7nm processors at a time when Intel has delayed the release of 7nm processors until 2022. This should ensure AMD's technical lead for the foreseeable future.

Putting the AMD comeback into perspective

The AMD story shows how much investors can profit from taking a chance on a troubled stock.

To be clear though articles like this do not convey the dangers risks and emotions that come with buying a stock below $2 per share when investors see no concrete prospects for recovery. You can lose everything on such holdings and you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.

Still as AMD has shown these investments can sometimes succeed -- even wildly succeed. If you have some spare cash a small position in such a company could deliver outsized returns to the risk-tolerant patient investor.",,,,,,,,,

Dearing and his maternal grandson Terry Shipman share a trait.

Call it perseverance.

Dearing was born in 1865 a tough time to be a child of the new South. He was orphaned and kidnapped. Family lore has it that as a child he was once traded for a shotgun and another time for a ham.

Casting aside the obstacles Dearing became a businessman was elected circuit clerk of Independence County and in 1911 served as sergeant-at-arms of the Arkansas Senate.

Shipman to his knowledge has never been traded for a shotgun. Or a ham. Nor has he held elective office electing instead for a long career as a telephone technician.

But he has taken on a task that links him directly to his grandfather whom he never knew and who died in 1938.

Shipman owns lives in and has worked since his 2012 retirement to restore T.H. Dearing's house sited on five acres on a high spot in Newark. It's 745 N. Locust Place for those who want to drive by and read the historical marker placed there in 1977 the year the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. (Arkansas has about 2600 such places.)

Windows aren‚Äôt just glass. They‚Äôre sashes and frames and sills. In Terry Shipman‚Äôs house the rebuilding or replacement of a of a window takes time and care. Some of the replaced windows were aluminum and not exactly compatible with the home‚Äôs 19th Century construction.

The marker some the worse for 45 years of weather says the house has been in the Dearing-Shipman family since its construction and at the time was the property of T.H. Dearing's daughter Lena Shipman and her husband E.E. Shipman.

Forty-five years? An eye blink. This house was built in nearby Akron in about 1890 and moved to this site in 1901 a process that further family lore says resulted in leftover building materials that would fill no more than a wheelbarrow.

Lena and E.E. were Terry Shipman's parents. His plan is to continue family ownership through his three stepchildren.

But that's down the road. Casting his eyes on the roof Shipman recalled that he fixed that roof over four years from his ages 56 to 60.

""The next time it needs a roof I'll be near 90 and won't be getting up on the roof anymore"" he said.

That's optimism. The flip side of which is pragmatism:

""It's never-ending and I'm 71 now.""

Ornate floral wallpaper was popular in the early 20th Century. This is a detail shot of the remnants of a border in Terry Shipman‚Äôs home older than a century in Newark in Independence County.

WHERE IS NEWARK?

Newark is 12 miles from Batesville the Independence County seat and 15 miles from Newport the Jackson County seat. 2010 Census figures put the city's population at about 1200. The downtown the block-long Front Street is mostly empty. There's a cabinet shop and City Hall which used to be a Bank of America branch.

Rising out of the nearby flatlands is the Independence Power Plant a coal-fired plant whose two units came online in 1983 and 1984. Entergy said this year that it plans to close the plant by 2030.

About two miles from the Dearing house is the Akron Cemetery also on the National Register of Historic Places. Its first interment according to the Arkansas Department of Heritage was in 1829.

In its nomination document the department noted the cemetery is mere yards from the White River and is frequently flooded. Leaves of ancient trees rustled in the breeze of a hot June day as Terry Shipman pointed out the nearness of the river that ended Akron.

That's why the Dearing House was moved to Newark. That plus a population shift in the late 19th century from river towns to railroad towns.

The nomination document notes that many Akron residents moved uphill to Newark and adds this: ""The handsome Dearing House was constructed in Akron about 1890 and bought early on by T.H. Dearing. In 1901 he dismantled the one-story house reconstructed it in Newark and added the second story in 1913.""

This newspaper first visited Shipman seven years ago. A second visit was designed to answer the question: How goes the restoration?

Much of Shipman‚Äôs house is in a state of repair and rehabilitation. He also has a collection of tools not seen in an ordinary garage. The black and orange device in the corner is a wood planer handy for salvaging boards and planks for further use.

It goes and goes. But much remains.

Shipman sat in his easy chair and explained the progress. His small dog Sandy was on his lap. Sandy showed up on the porch one freezing winter day. Shipman wouldn't leave him out there to die. Freezing to death on this day wasn't a problem. The house has neither central heat nor air.

""It never gets that uncomfortable for me unless it gets over 100"" Shipman said. He does have a window air-conditioning unit in his bedroom. He has space heaters ""but February was terrible. They couldn't keep up. I was sitting in my chair and could see my breath.""

He ticks off what's been accomplished.

This room once a bedroom and now a family room ‚Äî most of the rooms he said have played musical chairs ‚Äî has been restored with raised ceilings new panel doors and reproduction transoms. A transom is a window over a door that lets in light and when opened allows air to flow.

Raising a ceiling requires sheetrock. And a sheetrock jack one of the many tools Shipman has acquired. He also has a planer useful for salvaging wood.

The original kitchen is once again a kitchen. The original 12-foot ceilings have been restored as has the floor. The pantry chock full of tools and not food has a plaque over it: ""Mrs. T.H. Dearing's 1901 kitchen. Rebuilt 2020.""

An important part of the fixing up of the kitchen in the Dearing house was installation of transoms windows above doors which let in light and when opened provide air flow. The latter in especially important in a house without central heating or air conditioning.

The porches have been rebuilt completely. This required a contractor but also a lot of work on Shipman's part. He used a scroll saw to carve out umpteen gingerbread balustrades. A swing graces one of the porches. Along with a pile of building materials for the never-ending projects to come.

Rebuilding the porches was a big thing Shipman said and quipped: ""I no longer have an AT&T company savings plan.""

Back in the kitchen the brick flue has been replaced. Over in Batesville at the Tractor Supply Co. store Shipman saw for $300 a cast-iron stove identical to the one his grandmother Fleetie Dearing used for 40 years. It would only be decorative ‚Äî the flue would be unsafe for a wood-burning stove Shipman said.

He has painted the exterior another never-ending job. ""It's clapboard 100 years old and doesn't hold the paint."" He estimates that over the past 50 years the exterior has been painted 10 to 15 times.

The house is a history of change in Newark which got electricity in the 1930s city water in 1958 and sewer service in 1969 Shipman said. The house's first bathroom was installed in June 1968.

So what percent of the projects have been done? Shipman estimates 50% to 60%.

Terry Shipman explains some of the tasks involved in rehabilitating as best as he can the Dearing house in Newark owned by his grandfather T.H. Dearing in 1890. A second story was later added. Shipman a retired telephone technician has done much of the work himself since his retirement in 2012.

RESTORING HISTORY

One hundred miles away at Curran Hall on East Capitol Avenue in Little Rock Patricia Blick understands Terry Shipman's challenge. She's executive director of the Quapaw Quarter Association and has been in the business of historic preservation for more than 20 years. She's worked in Arkansas Virginia and Maryland in Annapolis where she was involved in the rehabilitation of a Colonial-era warehouse.

She has perspective on what it takes to save an old old place. Pay attention would-be restorers.

It helps to be a person of means. It helps to engage a historical architect. It helps to have blueprints. It helps to have photographs. It helps to have time.

It helps to have a plan and a list of priorities. ""That can keep you from making a mistake that can be time-consuming and costly."" Some of the most important work will be some of the most mundane. Heating and cooling for instance. The roof. The electrical system.

It helps to know the difference between rehabilitation and restoration.

In the former a modern use is found for a historical building. In the latter a higher level of commitment the building is ""taken back to a very specific time when it was constructed.""

To better explain rehabilitation she offered a visit to the Woodruff House on East Eighth Street in Little Rock. It was built in 1852-53 by William Woodruff founder of the Arkansas Gazette. It's a beauty with four massive front-porch columns three stories and 7000 square feet.

The Quapaw Quarter Association owns the house. Blick admits to being ""semi-complicit"" in its purchase ‚Äî at the time she was assistant director of the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program. The house can be bought for a mere $300000. Once sectioned into 14 apartments its best use is likely as an office building she said.

A swing is a pleasant thing to have on a porch. Realizing he didn‚Äôt have the ability to fix the house‚Äôs three porches Shipman called in a contractor. Because the work on the house never ends a porch is also a good place to store building materials.

Don't be fooled by that low low price. Making the Woodruff House into office space would take $300 to $400 a square foot Blick said. Figure $2.1 million to $2.8 million. On the happy side a state tax credit of 20% of the restoration cost is available. ""That's nothing to sneeze at"" Blick said.

Shipman also has something to say about the commitment made to fixing up an old old place.

""If I was wealthy I would hire a contractor who specializes in restoration. But I have to do as much as I can myself"" he said.

Doing it himself means electrical work. Hiring out means plumbing. Know when a job is too big to handle by yourself he said. The internet has resources such as a YouTube video that showed him how to miter obtuse angles for baseboards and quarter rounds.

Go into a house with eyes wide open he said because it can become a money pit.

Blick cautions against television programs that fix up a house in an hour. ""They've warped our sense of construction projects"" in terms of time and cost.

After almost a decade of work Terry Shipman's eyes remain wide open and the goal remains the same.

""I want to restore the house as closely as possible to what it was when I was a little boy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcG9ydGVyLm5ldC9uZXdzL29pbmtpbmctYWNyZXMtZmFybS1zYXZpbmctb25lLXBpZy1hdC1hLXRpbWUvYXJ0aWNsZV9iOGRkZmUxNC1hMmRhLTExZWItYWMwYy1hZjFjYTljODlhZmMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oinking Acres Farm saving one pig at a time,"Support local journalism

Some 30 people stood outside the 376 Hudson St. office Thursday morning even though walk-ins were not allowed. Others are trading tips in Facebook groups or besieging their Congressional reps for help.

The State Department is still operating under some COVID-19 staffing restrictions which have all but eliminated the ability to get a passport in person within three days of an international trip which was the norm pre-pandemic. The waiting time to get a new passport or renewal through the mail is now 18 weeks ‚Äî more than double what it was before COVID-19 hit.

Even paying an extra $60 for expedited service doesn‚Äôt always help.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so nervous I have to travel Sunday‚Äù Bronx resident Mirla Warrell said Thursday outside the Manhattan passport office where she was hoping to get inside. ‚ÄúThey are not giving any information to me when I call.‚Äù

Warrell arrived with plane tickets to prove she had a trip scheduled to Honduras to see her father who is hospitalized. Her daughter‚Äôs passport which she applied for in June never arrived despite spending more than $200 including the rush service fee.

Maria Rodriguez a teacher from Queens applied for her passport in April to go to Spain and see a nephew who is a doctor and will treat her back pain.

‚ÄúI figured four months before my trip would be enough time‚Äù said Rodriguez who brought a chair to sit on while waiting because she cannot stand for long periods. ‚ÄúI wait on the phone for five hours then after five hours they tell me there are no appointments left and that I have to try again.‚Äù

Bronx resident Mircis Gomez who was hoping to go to the Dominican Republic Tuesday for a cousin‚Äôs wedding waited seven hours but was not allowed in and did not see anyone else without an appointment enter.

The State Department says anyone with a life or death emergency can contact them to get an immediate passport and it offers a limited number of in-person appointments for non-emergency travel within three days of the trip.

But the department‚Äôs website rarely shows available appointments.

Jesse Hansen a middle school principal from San Francisco arrived at the passport office Thursday straight from Kennedy Airport with all his luggage. His family had gone on to Costa Rica for a vacation but his passport was expired and he couldn‚Äôt leave.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying the last 24 hours to get an appointment here and they tell me they are unable to make an appointment‚Äù Hansen said. ‚ÄúThere is no appointment here Connecticut anywhere else. There is nothing I can do.‚Äù

The dearth of options is leading some travelers to join Facebook groups like US Passport and Visa Services where they are trading tips and appointments much like some did to get a COVID-19 vaccine slot during the winter.

5 Brooklyn resident Victoria Linchong almost flew to Michigan to take advantage of an open passport appointment there.

Brooklyn resident Victoria Linchong who is scheduled to fly to Berlin this month to see her boyfriend after seven months apart started to panic last month when her passport didn‚Äôt arrive.

Through the Facebook group she learned she might have better luck trying to get an appointment if she called the State Department which she did more than 50 times beginning at midnight one evening before giving up and starting again at 5 a.m.

She found a open slot ‚Äî in Michigan.

‚ÄúI was about to pay for a flight to Detroit‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was ready to almost do it.‚Äù

Linchong kept trying and managed to score a New York City slot and then learned her passport was on the way in the mail. She received it Tuesday and ‚Äúgifted‚Äù her Manhattan appointment to another traveler.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island) said her office has received about 250 requests for passport help since June and has resolved most of them.

‚ÄúThe State Department must get their employees back to work to handle the backlog‚Äù Malliotakis said.

‚ÄúWe have no higher priority than the health and safety of our employees and our customers as we continue to move towards resuming our normal operations‚Äù a State Department spokeswoman said. ‚ÄúWe urge the public to plan ahead and apply well before any scheduled travel because of our limited appointments. ‚Äú",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbWFuYWdlbWVudC5uZXQvb3BlcmF0ZS9wcm9zLWFuZC1jb25zLWhvdGVsLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Offer Airport Shuttles & Transportation for Hotel Guests,"Among hotel amenities transportation services can make or break a hotel‚Äôs appeal especially for group business. But with Uber and Lyft making it easy for travelers to access a ride with a few clicks on a phone hoteliers have more options than ever when it comes to providing‚Äîor not providing‚Äîtransportation services.

Third-Party Partnerships

Late last year the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles partnered with National Transportation to provide shuttle service for hotel guests.

Fred DeSota director of sales and marketing at the airport hotel said the property‚Äôs team selected NTI because the company offered more options than a traditional airport shuttle. For example NTI can arrange private car service beyond the traditional round-trip rides to and from the airport and dedicated shuttles for groups to help them stay together.

Because NTI specializes in group transportation DeSota said the company can adjust quickly to special demands. In one case the hotel learned that it needed to secure eight 57-passenger buses for transfers with just hours to spare. ‚ÄúNTI was able to accomplish that for us with less than three hours‚Äô notice‚Äù he said.

Perhaps most importantly DeSota said the partnership lets guests track NTI‚Äôs shuttles. When a reservation is made either through Marriott.com or the Bonvoy app guests can schedule their transportation at the same time. ‚ÄúAny guest that has a reservation arrived at our hotel can now go onto their app and see exactly where the shuttle is [and] what the time is to their particular waypoint‚Äù he added.

Dedicated Fleet

The Country Inn & Suites by Radisson Bloomington at Mall of America next to the Minneapolis‚àíSaint Paul International Airport has four dedicated shuttles for airport transfers. Jodie Grannes regional general manager for the hotel said providing transportation provides peace of mind for guests. The wait at the airport pickup area for a ride-share could easily be 15 or 20 minutes but the longest wait for one of the hotel‚Äôs shuttles to reach a guest is 15 minutes. ‚ÄúThe average traveler we're seeing right now doesn't mind the wait‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe are just five minutes from the airport and we have quite a refined system of signups for the shuttle‚Äù Grannes said. The airport does not make pickups ‚Äútraveler friendly‚Äù she said with hotel shuttles limited to one dedicated area that can be hard for a passenger to find. ‚ÄúSo we have little PDFs that travelers can download off of the website or little cards they get at the front desk that directs them over and [details] on how to call us so that we can be there shortly after they arrive.‚Äù The system works well to minimize wait times she said aided by the multiple shuttles that can get to the airport quickly. ‚Äú

The hotel also helps locals flying out of the airport letting them stay for one night and leave the car at the hotel‚Äôs lot for a week. ‚ÄúThey can add additional nights if needed for a fee‚Äù she added.

Ride-Sharing

Ben Seidel president and CEO of Real Hospitality Group is not a fan of free shuttles for off-airport properties. ‚ÄúPersonally I would rather call an Uber and spend $15 to get there rather than wait for an airport shuttle to get there‚Äù he said. Shuttles can also negatively affect the guest experience if something goes wrong he added. ‚ÄúAs an operator if I'm not meeting your expectations on timeliness and you wait a minute longer than maybe you think you should then the entire guest experience is compromised.‚Äù

A good number of RHG‚Äôs customers are Marriott Bonvoy members and the loyalty program offers points for Uber rides. With the industry facing a labor shortage he said not having to build a team of drivers can be helpful to a hotel‚Äôs‚Äîor a management company‚Äôs‚Äîbottom lines.

Most airport-adjacent hotels in Real Hospitality Group‚Äôs portfolio have their own dedicated shuttles with dedicated drivers which makes it easier to control the guest experience than partnering with a third-party transportation company that runs shuttles on a set schedule. ‚ÄúAnd we can generally do it less expensive especially when we're doing it on-demand and not on a constant route‚Äù he added. Similarly if a guest feels that a third-party driver has been disrespectful a hotelier has limited options. ‚ÄúWhen I called our companies they were quick to offer a credit on our weekly invoices‚Äîbut that didn't help the customer.‚Äù Having disciplinary authority over drivers also makes it easier to solve any problems and mollify unhappy guests quickly.

Offering a free shuttle for airport passengers can get very expensive Seidel cautioned: ‚ÄúI don't know how necessary it is. It's going to vary market by market and be based on what the competitive landscape is for that service.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91cy1jYXJyaWVycy1iYWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Carriers Are Back: How Many Flights Are They Operating?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91cy1jYXJyaWVycy1iYWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbnRoYWlsYW5kLmNvbS9wci1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzQwMDAzMTMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fairfield by Marriott Celebrates Its Brand Debut In Vietnam,"Located in the one of the largest business parks in the province and home to almost 70 international manufacturing companies Fairfield by Marriott South Binh Duong is an ideal base for local entrepreneurs and international business travellers.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: JPMORGAN PEPSICO GOLDMAN SACHS

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr. (vs.$2.3B/qtr. cons.) for the remainder of this year‚Äù noted Daniel T. Fannon equity analyst at Jefferies.

The industry is thriving with record-breaking sales and with projections for dramatic growth. While some states allow it federal law classifies cannabis as illegal thereby prohibiting its possession and use.

How does an industry flourish that is banned by federal law shunned by the credit card networks (Visa Mastercard American Express) and rejected by most banks? How do cannabis retailers accept payments when credit cards and merchant accounts are unavailable?

I‚Äôll examine those questions and more in this post. I‚Äôll address the workarounds that payment service providers offer to cannabis businesses. Some of these benefit from gray areas in the regulations. Others use clever but risky techniques to conceal rule-breaking from banks and credit card networks.

State of Cannabis Payments

The state of cannabis payments is a confusing mess of semi-viable workarounds. Credit card companies and acquiring banks will not allow their networks to process cannabis sales so long as it‚Äôs illegal federally. Cannabis retailers have limited options.

Cash is the primary payment method for cannabis sales. However accepting cash payments comes with logistical and security challenges. Cash must be counted stored transported and secured. Moreover cash cannot be accepted online.

In-store ATMs. Automated teller machines allow customers to withdraw cash for in-store purchases. But ATMs are expensive for both customers and merchants. Customers pay approximately $5 for a single cash withdrawal. Storeowners pay about $4000 per machine plus monthly maintenance and cash-reload fees.

Cashless ATMs are relatively new to the payments industry. They seem to have been invented for cannabis retailers. Instead of inserting a bank debit card into an ATM the customer inserts her card into a countertop point-of-sale terminal which authorizes the card and PIN code and then allows the customer to make a direct payment to the merchant via an account provided by the cashless ATM provider. Merchant fees for cashless ATM transactions are reasonable. Most vendors provide the equipment and technology for $5 per month provided the merchant has purchased a physical ATM from that vendor. However consumer fees are not reasonable at roughly $5 per transaction. Some vendors share those fees with the merchant.

Cryptocurrencies. With exaggerated claims of anonymity and lack of government control cryptocurrencies are seemingly ideal for cannabis purchases. But cryptocurrencies are primarily speculative investments rather than cash alternatives. Cannabis consumers ‚Äî like all consumers ‚Äî are mainly cryptocurrency observers not investors.

Real-time peer-to-peer payments are immediate transfers of funds from a payor to a payee. Cannabis retailers have adopted various forms of real-time payments mostly to circumvent the prohibition on credit card transactions. The retailer asks the customer to send a real-time bank-to-bank or account-to-account payment. Upon receiving and confirming the real-time payment the merchant will either ship the products (an ecommerce transaction) or allow the customer to pick up his order. Merchants must be careful however. Many P2P payment systems ‚Äî PayPal Venmo Zelle Square Cash App more ‚Äî including the financial institutions that maintain the merchant‚Äôs account do not allow their networks to be used for cannabis sales. Retailers can sidestep this issue by concealing the nature of their business and P2P providers sometimes ignore their own rules allegedly.

Credit cards. Some cannabis retailers accept credit card payments. How is this possible? Payment providers will sometimes help by assigning cannabis transactions to legitimate categories. For example instead of classifying as a cannabis seller the dishonest provider will call it a flower shop or a farmers market. Other service providers will open merchant accounts with financial institutions in Eastern Europe where law enforcement is lax. In all cases these gray-area providers charge remarkably high fees ‚Äî roughly 6% per transaction on top of monthly maintenance charges. Moreover the merchant accounts often require large reserves. Plus merchants who mislead payment networks and U.S. banks risk penalties account closures and worst of all a permanent ban from accepting credit cards.



Ecommerce?

When cannabis becomes legal in the U.S. federally all merchants ‚Äî ecommerce and brick-and-mortar ‚Äî can expect an explosion of legitimate payment providers. Until then cash is king.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2lsLnVzZW1iYXNzeS5nb3YvdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy13ZWxjb21lcy1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQtb2YtaXNyYWVsLWFuZC1oYXNoZW1pdGUta2luZ2RvbS1vZi1qb3JkYW4tYWdyZWVtZW50cy1vbi13YXRlci1hbmQtd2VzdC1iYW5rLXRyYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Welcomes Announcement of Israel and Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Agreements on Water and West ...,"We‚Äôre sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

More than half of transactions in the US involved cash in 2010. The number had dropped to 28% in 2020 even before the Covid-19 pandemic which led to wider adoption of cashless and contactless payment among businesses.

But going cashless means a heavier reliance on private companies‚Äîbanks credit card companies payment processors‚Äîall of which have delays and fees that hit poor people hardest. At the moment a cash-free economy would exclude the 7.1 million Americans or 5.4% of US households that are unbanked meaning they do not have a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union according to the FDIC‚Äôs most recent study in 2019.

That has the US Federal Reserve thinking about backing its own digital version of cash. A Fed-backed digital dollar would in theory function like cash‚Äîwithout delays processing fees or onboarding requirements‚Äîand could usher unbanked or underbanked Americans into the digital economy. Citizens could send cash digitally to one another or swipe a government debit card to pay and that money would live in a Fed-backed wallet outside of the private banking system.

Building a central bank digital currency (CBDC) carries risk for failure hacking or breaches of personal privacy but if the Fed can bring a digital dollar online it could make the digital economy much quicker more efficient and more accessible to those who need it most.

The digital divide is growing

Right now the US digital payment system relies heavily on the private sector. That has its downsides. Interest rates can hit hard if balances are not paid off (The average US credit card balance was about $5900 at the end of 2020). Banks charge overdraft fees if a person takes out more money from a checking account than they have. And while some apps like Venmo and Zelle allow people to easily transfer money between one another digitally they are still largely linked to bank accounts with multi-day processing delays‚Äîor fees for instant deposits.

What‚Äôs missing say digital currency advocates is a public option free of fees delays and hassles.

The Fed revealed last summer that after years of in-house research it had partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to ‚Äúunderstand the opportunities and limitations‚Äù of a CBDC. The project is set to release its findings later this summer the next step before the Fed decides if and how to implement a new currency.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very expensive to be unbanked and participate in the digital economy‚Äù

Neha Narula who is leading Project Hamilton the name of the Fed-MIT collaboration told lawmakers on June 9 that a digital dollar offered a ‚Äúground up redesign of our payment systems‚Äù in the US. Skeptics like Republican Sen. Pat Toomey pushed back on the idea that a CBDC is necessary arguing a CBDC would turn the Fed into a retail bank and claiming that the private sector does the job well enough.

But Narula sees the opportunity as revolutionary. ‚ÄúIf we were able to create a well-designed interface to a central bank digital currency we could do for the transfer of value what the internet did for the transfer of information which is create a platform for innovation‚Äù she said at the recent hearing.

Access to the US financial system should be a public good said Hanna Halaburda a professor at NYU‚Äôs Stern School of Business and a former senior economist at the Bank of Canada. ‚ÄúA lot of central banks have a mandate to provide a means of transaction that would be free and accessible to everyone‚Äù she told Quartz. That‚Äôs a reality for cash but there is no digital equivalent at the moment.

The Digital Dollar Project a research group pushing for a CBDC in the US said that inclusion is the number one priority. The project is a partnership between the consultancy Accenture and the Digital Dollar Foundation a nonprofit co-founded by Christopher Giancarlo the former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very expensive to be unbanked and participate in the digital economy‚Äù said David Treat a director of the Digital Dollar Project and a senior managing director at Accenture. ‚ÄúAs we make more and more advancements in the digital economy that divide is just growing.‚Äù

The US isn‚Äôt leading the way

The US is not the first country to consider a digital currency. In fact it‚Äôs a bit behind the pack. More than 60 countries and jurisdictions are currently researching or deploying their own digital tender according to the website CBDC Tracker run by Boston Consulting Group.

The Bahamas already introduced its Sand Dollar China is testing its digital yuan and Sweden is testing an e-krona among others.

The motivations are different for each country. In developing countries where populations have less access to reliable and affordable banking CBDCs could be transformative. For those sending money across borders digital currencies could rapidly speed up the process which is notoriously tricky and intermediated by different banks and dynamic exchange rates.

In many nations central bankers see digital currencies as a way to keep their currency dominant. ‚ÄúOn both digital currency and payments we in Europe must be ready to move as quickly as needed or risk an erosion of our monetary sovereignty ‚Äî something we cannot tolerate‚Äù Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau Villeroy said at a recent conference.

Digital dollars versus cryptocurrency

One of the biggest questions is whether an official digital currency should be set up in the same way as cryptocurrency. Private cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether rely on blockchains decentralized ledgers that record real-time transactions across many computers. A digital US dollar would not necessarily need to.

That poses fundamental questions for America‚Äôs Federal Reserve. Will a digital dollar be run by the commercial banks or the Fed itself? Will there be a physical card associated with it so it can be inclusive of users who do not have access to broadband or a smartphone?

Halaburda said most central bank proposals right now don‚Äôt rely on a blockchain in part because there are limitations and costs associated with many different computers replicating the same transactions. Narula told lawmakers that she too doesn‚Äôt believe the system would necessarily need to be based on blockchain but said it must be encrypted in some way. The Digital Dollar Project meanwhile is considering various architectures but believes that a distributed ledger system would offer the most robust security. It is testing a series of pilot programs for a US-based CBDC and is building Sweden‚Äôs e-krona on distributed ledger technology.

At the moment this leaves more questions than answers.

A more secure system

The downsides of a digital dollar revolve almost entirely around two issues: privacy and security.

Unlike cash a digital system can be hacked. There‚Äôs no physical barrier to lifting copious amounts of digital currency. A digital currency system would be an obvious target for hackers which could put Americans‚Äô data and finances at risk. But Narula says there are ways to secure the system for example by making it open source with an open API. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a firm believer that open-source software is critical for security‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe more people who are looking the more likely you are to find bugs and to find problems.‚Äù

And a digital currency also presents a new way for the state to monitor its citizens. In China the digital yuan is a technological advancement a way to divorce Chinese currency from the wide reach of the US financial system and another way for the state to expand its reach. That‚Äôs less of a concern in the US says Treat of the Digital Dollar Project since Americans‚Äô constitutional rights shield them from financial surveillance without due process.

But it will not be easy to convince some members of the Fed that these barriers can be overcome. Fed vice chair Randal Quarles for example said on June 28 that CBDCs could be a ‚Äúdeluded craze‚Äù informed by America‚Äôs ‚Äúcenturies-long enthusiasm for novelty‚Ä¶ susceptibility to boosterism and the fear of missing out.‚Äù He jokingly likened a digital currency to the parachute pants fad of the 1980s warning of the real risks of such a system like hacking. ‚ÄúThe potential benefits of a Federal Reserve CBDC are unclear‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúConversely a Federal Reserve CBDC could pose significant and concrete risks.‚Äù

But other Fed members are more enthusiastic about it. Fed board member Lael Brainard offered a much rosier view for embracing innovation while Fed chair Jerome Powell said he remained open to the idea of a digital dollar.

When CBS News asked him in April if the Fed is likely to implement a digital dollar Powell simply said ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible‚Äù but he has acknowledged ‚Äúit‚Äôs more important to get it right than to be first.‚Äù"

Uber is available in more than 700 cities around the world and this number will only increase. Whether you're traveling to Seattle Dubai Tokyo London Paris Montreal Chicago or another major metro center you can expect Uber rides to be available.

Uber Facts

Uber is not a taxi service. Drivers cannot pick up riders off the street. Instead Uber is a car-for-hire service that relies on smartphone technology to dispatch drivers and manage fees. Also unlike taxi services Uber drivers do not possess special licenses; rather they use their personal vehicles to offer discounted fare rides.

Uber's smartphone app takes care of the entire ride-hailing and payment process. Use your credit or debit card to pay right in the app with no need for cash.

You must be 18 years or older to have an Uber account and use the service. In the United States Uber drivers must be at least 21 years old have at least one year of licensed driving experience and drive an acceptable four-door vehicle.

Uber is designed so that the rider doesn't need to carry cash. However you can tip with cash if you prefer not to add the tip via the app.

How Uber Works

Uber is intended to be easier than using a taxi. Here's how the Uber process works.

Before Using Uber

Install the app on your smartphone and create an online Uber account. You'll provide information about the credit card you plan to use to pay for rides so you never need to bring or handle any cash.

When You Need a Ride

When you need a ride use the app to tell Uber your pickup location. You can choose from a variety of ride-type options; the most common is UberX. Alternately you can select Uber Pool if you are willing to share the ride and save some money. (More on Uber ride tiers below.)

Uber will locate drivers in your area find a driver for you and tell you how many minutes away your driver is. Rides are commonly three to 10 minutes away in major centers.

Uber will alert you when the ride has arrived. The Uber app will show you the driver's details such as name photo and type of car so you know what to look for.

During and After the Ride

Enjoy your ride. The app handles payment so just step out of the car when you arrive at your destination and thank your driver. You'll be asked via the app to rate your driver on a scale of 1 to 5 (politeness safety cleanliness). Similarly the driver rates you from 1 to 5 (politeness). You have the option of adding a tip.

The entire trip is tracked through the Uber app for accountability and ease.

Why People Love Uber

Uber's appeal revolves around the trifecta of price quality and convenience.

Price

Taxicab drivers hate Uber because Uber undercuts their fees by up to 50 percent but this of course is one reason riders love using Uber. Plus Uber drivers don't require tips and can't pressure you for them; as mentioned you can add them later in the app. Taxi drivers on the other hand typically expect at least a 15 percent tip at the time of payment. You can also use Uber Pass which is essentially a subscription to Uber that gives you discounted rides.

Bear in mind however that Uber does impose surge pricing for peak events such as major sporting matches holidays like New Year's Eve and even busy weekend evenings. Fees can climb significantly for a few hours. As a rule though Uber rides are still cheaper than taxi cabs.

Quality

Uber cars tend to be cleaner newer and better-smelling than many taxis. The accountability built into the Uber app motivates drivers to keep their cars in good shape. Because Uber drivers are rated by every passenger every day there is the incentive to be both prompt and safe.

Convenience

The payment process is easy and stress-free. Likewise the app frees you from the often frustrating process of hailing a cab. The ability to handle all these details right from your phone saves time and aggravation (and keeps company and driver overhead low).

Because Uber is attractive for drivers to join the number of available drivers usually results in very fast response times. While this certainly does vary the typical Uber rider gets a pickup within three to 10 minutes of hailing while taxis can take 30 to 45 minutes after being called.

Service Tiers

Uber offers a range of service tiers spanning from single riders and groups up to executive limo services.

UberX is the cheapest and most commonly used form of Uber. Vehicles are ordinary four-door models that fit up to four riders. Fares are about half the price of taxis in major cities.

Uber Pool offered in some cities allows you to share your ride with another person and split the cost. UberXL can accommodate six passengers using an SUV or minivan; it's more expensive than UberX. Uber Comfort is for riders who are constantly on the go and want a little extra comfort. Uber Select is a premium ride in a high-end car.

Uber's highest-tier services include Uber Black luxury rides with professional drivers and Uber Black SUV which offers luxury rides for six people.

In some cities Uber even offers Uber Espanol for Spanish-speaking riders Uber Assist if a rider needs extra help and Uber Wav for wheelchair-accessible rides.

Driver and Passenger Ratings

Part of Uber's appeal is that drivers are under tremendous pressure to deliver pleasant safe prompt and clean experiences for passengers. Every passenger rates every driver on every trip and drivers are required to maintain an average customer rating of 4.6 out of 5.0. (Minimums vary by city.) Uber deactivates drivers who fall below this standard.

Uber does not disclose this to passengers directly but every driver gets to see your rating when deciding whether to pick you up. And yes every driver rates you right after you leave the Uber vehicle at the dropoff point. This is to protect future drivers from having to deal with rude violent aggressive and drunk/impaired passengers. If your rating is too low Uber can bar you from using the service temporarily or permanently.

To encourage kinder gentler Uber rider behavior (stop slamming doors!) the app displays rider ratings right underneath names in the Uber app's menu.

Becoming an Uber Driver

In large cities taxi cab drivers pay $500 to $1200 per month to their parent companies and municipalities. This cost includes dispatch and administration services and any additional fees the taxi company chooses to levy on its drivers.

Uber does not charge any of these monthly fees to its drivers making Uber very attractive for amateur drivers. Uber requires that drivers:

Are at least 21 years old

Have at least one year of licensed driving experience (three if you are less than 23 years old)

Possess a clean driving record

Have no criminal record

Drive an insured car that is less than 15 years old

Your car must:

Have a clean title (not salvaged reconstructed or rebuilt)

Not be a rental unless it's from an approved Uber lender

Not have damage missing pieces commercial branding or taxi signage

Uber will confirm all these details with the appropriate authorities. Uber will also do a background check looking for serious infractions such as excessive speeding driving while intoxicated and other criminal offenses.

In short if you're an honest person safe driver and reliable worker with a newer four-door car you can be an Uber driver within two weeks or so.

Cousins affectionately calls him ‚Äúthe prince‚Äù in his voiceover in tribute to Jeremy being Brit-cinema royalty: he is respectively son and nephew of directors Ralph Thomas and Gerald Thomas (of Doctor and Carry On fame). Cousins wackily frames his film as something between a home movie and a road movie riding shotgun in Thomas‚Äôs sleek Alfa Romeo as the producer brings him along on his annual five-day car journey down through France to the Cannes film festival. And on the way he chats to Thomas about life the movies and everything while interspersing this with clips from Thomas‚Äôs films and interviews with his many admirers and colleagues including Tilda Swinton and Debra Winger.

It has to be said this is hardcore movie-mad immersion and prose-poem free-associating targeted at the cinema faithful and very much a festival event. And for those who are not used to Cousins‚Äôs style and inimitable vocal presence and perhaps hoping for more talk from the man in the title it could be a bit too much to take. Anyone coming to this film hoping for some nuts-and-bolts insight into what a producer actually does and the ever-present worries about money will be disappointed. This film floats free from that sort of banal consideration. But as always I find myself considering that in a world where everyone‚Äôs a cynic and an ironist Cousins‚Äôs unaffected rapture is unique and refreshing. And there is an odd-couple comedy here with Cousins as the unstoppably garrulous super-fan and Thomas as the reticent English gentleman almost like a charismatic Cambridge don on the long vacation who has picked up a voluble hitchhiker.

Perhaps Thomas a model of charm and self-effacement (which of course conceals a hypervigilant creative alertness) is unused to being at the centre of attention for all his iconic status: normally he is a couple of steps to one side as the director a Bernardo Bertolucci or a Takashi Miike basks in the limelight. But that is a position he relishes. Ironically film is not a medium that really captures the subtlety and intimacy of Jeremy Thomas‚Äôs personality. Showbusiness is full of bigmouth showoffs claiming to be ‚Äúshy‚Äù. But Thomas is the real thing. Possibly radio would come closer.

At the end of all this Cousins makes Thomas take a word-association test. He says ‚ÄúCannes‚Äù and the producer shoots back: ‚ÄúDo‚Äù. It is the perfect producer response. A producer has got to make things happen make connections and see opportunities and Thomas says that the festival is where he has a ‚Äúline out‚Äù like a fisherman waiting for a new idea or talent to swim up. It is a pleasure to sit on the riverbank alongside him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3ViZXItcGlja3MtZm9ybWVyLXRlc2NvLWV4ZWMtdG8tcnVuLWV1cm9wZWFuLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWFybS0xMjM1MzYwOdIBYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC91YmVyLXBpY2tzLWZvcm1lci10ZXNjby1leGVjLXRvLXJ1bi1ldXJvcGVhbi1kZWxpdmVyeS1hcm0tMTIzNTM2MDk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber picks former Tesco exec to run European delivery arm,"Uber will this week name a former Tesco executive as the head of its European delivery arm amid a frenzy of competition in the rapid grocery sector.

Sky News understands that Eve Henrikson who spent years working for Britain's biggest online grocer is joining the owner of the world's best-known ride-hailing app as regional general manager for Uber Delivery in Europe the Middle East and Africa.

The last permanent occupant of the role was Stephane Ficaja who left Uber earlier this year.

Ms Henrikson's appointment will come amid a deluge of investment in tech companies specialising in fast urban logistics.

Deliveroo which went public in London through a calamitous flotation earlier in 2021 has since seen its shares recover amid continued growth in consumer demand.

Meanwhile the likes of Getir and Gorillas which promise to deliver groceries within minutes are raising vast sums of capital to accelerate their efforts to capture market share.

Ms Henrikson said her role would include an attempt to launch ""new on-demand services and adjacencies providing best-in-class customer experiences and delivering profitable growth"".

Uber is expanding its delivery services into areas such as groceries retail and pharmacy products having been one of the early entrants to the restaurant delivery space through its Uber Eats operation.

It has also launched Uber Direct a delivery-as-a-service offering for corporate customers such as McDonald's.

Uber said it had more than doubled gross bookings for the delivery business in the first quarter of the year.

The Uber Eats app is now available in nearly 900 cities in 14 countries across the EMEA region and the second-largest player in the UK market according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbWFuYWdlbWVudC5uZXQvb3BlcmF0ZS9wcm9zLWFuZC1jb25zLWhvdGVsLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Offer Airport Shuttles & Transportation for Hotel Guests,"Among hotel amenities transportation services can make or break a hotel‚Äôs appeal especially for group business. But with Uber and Lyft making it easy for travelers to access a ride with a few clicks on a phone hoteliers have more options than ever when it comes to providing‚Äîor not providing‚Äîtransportation services.

Third-Party Partnerships

Late last year the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles partnered with National Transportation to provide shuttle service for hotel guests.

Fred DeSota director of sales and marketing at the airport hotel said the property‚Äôs team selected NTI because the company offered more options than a traditional airport shuttle. For example NTI can arrange private car service beyond the traditional round-trip rides to and from the airport and dedicated shuttles for groups to help them stay together.

Because NTI specializes in group transportation DeSota said the company can adjust quickly to special demands. In one case the hotel learned that it needed to secure eight 57-passenger buses for transfers with just hours to spare. ‚ÄúNTI was able to accomplish that for us with less than three hours‚Äô notice‚Äù he said.

Perhaps most importantly DeSota said the partnership lets guests track NTI‚Äôs shuttles. When a reservation is made either through Marriott.com or the Bonvoy app guests can schedule their transportation at the same time. ‚ÄúAny guest that has a reservation arrived at our hotel can now go onto their app and see exactly where the shuttle is [and] what the time is to their particular waypoint‚Äù he added.

Dedicated Fleet

The Country Inn & Suites by Radisson Bloomington at Mall of America next to the Minneapolis‚àíSaint Paul International Airport has four dedicated shuttles for airport transfers. Jodie Grannes regional general manager for the hotel said providing transportation provides peace of mind for guests. The wait at the airport pickup area for a ride-share could easily be 15 or 20 minutes but the longest wait for one of the hotel‚Äôs shuttles to reach a guest is 15 minutes. ‚ÄúThe average traveler we're seeing right now doesn't mind the wait‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe are just five minutes from the airport and we have quite a refined system of signups for the shuttle‚Äù Grannes said. The airport does not make pickups ‚Äútraveler friendly‚Äù she said with hotel shuttles limited to one dedicated area that can be hard for a passenger to find. ‚ÄúSo we have little PDFs that travelers can download off of the website or little cards they get at the front desk that directs them over and [details] on how to call us so that we can be there shortly after they arrive.‚Äù The system works well to minimize wait times she said aided by the multiple shuttles that can get to the airport quickly. ‚Äú

The hotel also helps locals flying out of the airport letting them stay for one night and leave the car at the hotel‚Äôs lot for a week. ‚ÄúThey can add additional nights if needed for a fee‚Äù she added.

Ride-Sharing

Ben Seidel president and CEO of Real Hospitality Group is not a fan of free shuttles for off-airport properties. ‚ÄúPersonally I would rather call an Uber and spend $15 to get there rather than wait for an airport shuttle to get there‚Äù he said. Shuttles can also negatively affect the guest experience if something goes wrong he added. ‚ÄúAs an operator if I'm not meeting your expectations on timeliness and you wait a minute longer than maybe you think you should then the entire guest experience is compromised.‚Äù

A good number of RHG‚Äôs customers are Marriott Bonvoy members and the loyalty program offers points for Uber rides. With the industry facing a labor shortage he said not having to build a team of drivers can be helpful to a hotel‚Äôs‚Äîor a management company‚Äôs‚Äîbottom lines.

Most airport-adjacent hotels in Real Hospitality Group‚Äôs portfolio have their own dedicated shuttles with dedicated drivers which makes it easier to control the guest experience than partnering with a third-party transportation company that runs shuttles on a set schedule. ‚ÄúAnd we can generally do it less expensive especially when we're doing it on-demand and not on a constant route‚Äù he added. Similarly if a guest feels that a third-party driver has been disrespectful a hotelier has limited options. ‚ÄúWhen I called our companies they were quick to offer a credit on our weekly invoices‚Äîbut that didn't help the customer.‚Äù Having disciplinary authority over drivers also makes it easier to solve any problems and mollify unhappy guests quickly.

Offering a free shuttle for airport passengers can get very expensive Seidel cautioned: ‚ÄúI don't know how necessary it is. It's going to vary market by market and be based on what the competitive landscape is for that service.‚Äù"

‚ÄúIt was one of the markers that told me that we turned a corner‚Äù said the 60-year-old who lives in Augusta Georgia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the little things that you do that were taken away and now they‚Äôre back.‚Äù

When the pandemic was declared in March 2020 retailers worried about the potential spread of the coronavirus so they cut off free sampling of everything from food to makeup to toys. But now with vaccinations rolling out and the threat of COVID-19 easing in the U.S. stores like Costco are feeling confident enough to revive the longstanding tradition.

For customers sampling makes it fun to shop and discover new items ‚Äî not to mention getting all the freebies. For retailers they‚Äôre critical tools to keep shoppers coming back and battle against online retailers like Amazon.

Food sampling converts browsers into buyers at a 20% higher rate than if customers weren‚Äôt allowed to test says NPD Group Inc. a market research firm. The conversion rate is 30% higher when beauty products are sampled.

‚ÄúSampling is critical‚Äù said Marshal Cohen NPD‚Äôs chief industry analyst. ‚ÄúImpulse alone drives 25% of the retail business.‚Äù

Jake Tavello a senior vice president at Stew Leonard‚Äôs said promoting new items had been challenging without sampling a tradition started by his grandfather who founded the regional grocery chain in 1969. Sales of a new item pink glow pineapple were OK this past spring for example but have tripled since demonstrations were reintroduced.

‚ÄúWhen people taste it that‚Äôs what can makes people want to buy it and decide what they want to eat for dinner‚Äù Tavello said.

But while sampling is back it‚Äôs not clear if everyone is ready to bite. With that in mind some retailers are putting various safety protocols in place to ease any safety concerns.

At Costco masked workers prepare the hot and cold samples behind plexiglass counters and distribute to its members one at a time. Stew Leonard‚Äôs also brought back hot samples with similar safety measures.

Meanwhile Walmart and its wholesale club division Sam‚Äôs Club are only serving pre-sealed food samples. And Sam‚Äôs Club is limiting to sampling on the weekend. Target said that staffed food and beverage sampling has remained on pause since March 2020 but it has been allowing self-service sampling of individually wrapped items.

With beauty testing retailers appear to be even more cautious. Beauty chain Ulta Beauty said it‚Äôs still figuring out how to bring back makeup testers. Target said in May it will resume beauty product sampling in stores this year where customers can take home individually wrapped items. Kohl‚Äôs would only say that it hadn‚Äôt brought back makeup or fragrance sampling.

Lawrence Gostin a public health expert at Georgetown University said handling and eating food has not been a major route for the spread of COVID-19. But food sampling can lead to people congregating together and that increases the risk of transmission. He also pointed to concerns about food sampling that go beyond the coronavirus: ‚ÄúMultiple hands grabbing samples can lead to the spread of germs while contaminated gloves can also disperse unwanted bacteria.‚Äù

As for makeup testing Gostin said it‚Äôs ‚Äúmuch safer and wiser‚Äù to use samples that are fully packaged. And with letting kids play with toys frequent sanitizing of objects is recommended to contain viruses like influenza which unlike COVID-19 can be easily spread through touching contaminated surfaces.

Toy retailer Camp which centered its shopping experience around children playing with toys now has individually wrapped craft kits in the store instead of letting kids dig around for art supplies says Tiffany Markofsky the company‚Äôs marketing director. For testing out toys it‚Äôs sticking to items that can be easily cleaned like remote control toy cars instead of dolls with faux hair.

Marianne Szymanski president of Toy Tips Inc. a toy guide believes toy testing overall will be ‚Äúlimited‚Äù because of the lingering fears about germs due to the pandemic.

Some retailers are doing away with sampling altogether. For instance West Hollywood California-based beauty company Blushington isn‚Äôt reopening its six stores and is instead moving more toward virtual makeup sessions and offering services at shoppers‚Äô home says CEO Natasha Cornstein. She thinks shoppers believe they have better control of their environment and hygiene in their own home.

‚ÄúThe consumer is coming out of COVID with very different habits‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only about COVID now.‚Äù

Although consumers are still spending on quarantine-era hobbies and habits they are branching back into outdoor categories centered around human connection. ‚ÄùSeventy-two percent tried a new hobby this past year and those aren‚Äôt going away‚Äù Habner said. ‚ÄúSome of the ones getting the most buzz are streaming services because folks have gotten used to streaming all of their shows. Fitness clubs too as consumers can return to them are popular‚Äù she said.

The more outdoor-facing the category the better it is expected to fare Habner said. ‚ÄúFor Millennials the only constant is change. Spending patterns were upside down last year and some traditional categories were down during the pandemic like travel and dining. As the world is opening up again we‚Äôre seeing those return‚Äù she said.

Here the top five categories Millennials are planning to spend on.

Happy hours/socializing with their coworkers over food: 44 percent Going to live entertainment after work: 36 percent Traveling for work: 28 percent Running errands around the workday: 23 percent Group fitness classes around the workday: 19 percent

Why Trust Us?

Some products show up everywhere ‚Äî subway ads Instagram celeb endorsements. With this series we're testing such products to conclude one thing: Does it live up to the hype?

What‚Äôs everyone talking about?

 a line of skin and ‚Äúsoul‚Äù-soothing products by award-winning singer and A-list celeb Alicia Keys. The affordable skincare collection includes seven face products three body products a candle and a facial roller.

What‚Äôs the buzz about?

As of lately just about every celebrity (seriously every) has some form of beauty line collaboration or product that they're promoting. Though many of them don't live up to their hyped expectations we finally found a line of celeb-founded skincare that we can't get enough of: Keys Soulcare co-created by none other than famed crooner and soulful goddess Alicia Keys.

Keys Soulcare

Created alongside the beauty experts over at e.l.f. Cosmetics this line includes a total of 12 products to turn your usual skincare and shower routine into an indulgent ritual without the luxury price tag. Best of all every product in this line is less than $40. The curated take on elevated skincare basics (think cleansers moisturizers exfoliators and more) will make your skin and your soul feel zen and harmonious.



Where's all the hype coming from?

Rave reviews from major lifestyle publications like Allure Glamour and WhoWhatWear.

Over 112000 followers on the brand's Instagram alone.

Alicia Keys herself

So does it live up to the hype?

How‚Äôd we come to this conclusion?

I'm going to be fully transparent: Every time I see a new celebrity beauty launch I immediately eye roll. As much as I love a good beauty launch many of these new celeb-backed brands bring nothing entirely new to our vanities and contribute to the industry's undeniably shameful environmental impact.

But  the Alicia Keys-backed line of skincare products that are meant to nurture your skin and your soul has proven to be a rather impressive beauty gem that just so happens to be co-created by an A-list celebrity.

Keys Soulcare

Just about each and every product in this deliciously scented collection is as soothing as the next and it‚Äôs genuinely a brand that your complexion and your conscience can feel good about using. Inspired by Keys‚Äô own foray into skincare and love of ancient beauty rituals the singer teamed up with dermatologist Dr. Ren√©e Snyder to create a line of skincare products that are made with potent yet gentle ingredients. Dr. Snyder might sound familiar ‚Äî she also cofounded cult-favorite beauty brand  an award-winning cruelty-free and plant-powered mineral makeup line.

The brand axed restricted by the FDA and European Union Cosmetics Regulation Guidelines from the skincare collection and put a focus on fusing naturally-derived minerals and botanicals with modern skincare saviors like hyaluronic acid and ceramides. It is worth noting that most of the products (except for the fragrance-free version of the Skin Transformation Cream) do have fragrances and while we do love a good scent fragrances are known irritants to skin. So if you're sensitive to them you may want to skip most of the products in this brand.

Keys Soulcare

Of course what‚Äôs inside the bottle is important but there are also a few details that Keys intentionally placed outside of the formulas. The beauty brand is considered a ‚Äúsoul care‚Äù line for a reason: Keys wanted to highlight the connection between ‚Äúskin and soul‚Äù and wanted you to embrace your daily skincare routine as a calming ritual to start and end your day. Each recyclable glass package is labeled with a mantra to help you zen out bringing all of your senses to the forefront and allowing you to mentally chill TF out.

It all sounds amazing on paper but does it live up to its award-winning cofounder's name?

After slathering myself in every item in this line for thorough testing I can honestly say that I'm fairly impressed with most of the products from Keys Soulcare. If you're intrigued and want to learn more about each product here's some good news: I've ranked each and every product from Alicia Keys‚Äô beauty brand (minus the deliciously scented  for pretty obvious reasons) just for you.

I must warn you that I have very high standards when it comes to what I put on my skin so here are the criteria that I kept in mind while testing out Keys Soulcare:

What are the ingredients?

How does it feel on my skin?



Does it cause irritation?



Will it cause acne/breakouts?



Overall is it doing what it promises to do?

Below check out which products from Keys Soulcare made the cut into my heavily curated skincare routine and which ones fell short:

10. Keys Soulcare Obsidian Facial Roller

Overall Rating: 3/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Obsidian Facial Roller Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Obsidian Facial Roller $25 at Ulta Beauty

This face roller is made from black obsidian which is a precious stone made out of quickly cooled lava that‚Äôs formed into volcanic glass ‚Äî pretty cool right? Its rotating head is meant to help you massage your facial muscles while allowing the product to get deeper into the skin creating a more sculpted lifted and overall healthier look to your complexion.



But I'm not going to lie ‚Äî this was the product I was most disappointed in. It just didn't have enough weight to it as most other facial rollers do and it doesn't stay cool like other ones I've tried as well. It's fun to use but unless you know how to properly use a facial roller at home (which you can find out here) you're not going to get much out of this product.

9. Keys Soulcare Rich Nourishing Body Cream

Overall Rating: 3.5/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Rich Nourishing Body Cream Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Rich Nourishing Body Cream $36 at Ulta Beauty

This body cream is meant to give your skin head-to-toe hydration and a soothing treatment. It contains natural ingredients like hydrating shea butter cocoa butter ceramides calming oats and ‚ÄúRose of Jericho‚Äù a Mexican plant that the brand claims is great for hydrating parched skin.

When I opened up this giant tub of cream I expected a rich buttery texture that would glide right onto my skin. Unfortunately this cream was too thick almost like the consistency of a very sticky balm. It took forever just to seep into my skin and as I type this my legs are still sticking together from this cream about 2 hours after I applied it.

Yes it does have a great smell (which might be a red flag for sensitive skin) and my legs do feel hydrated but this formula is just way too sticky for my taste. From now on this cream is dedicated solely to the roughest parts of my skin: my knees and elbows and that's about it.

8. Keys Soulcare Reviving Aura Mist

Overall Rating: 5/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Reviving Aura Mist Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Reviving Aura Mist $25 at Ulta Beauty$25 at Amazon

This face and body mist is meant to hydrate tone and revive your skin while you indulge yourself in the scent of rose and the cooling sensation of each and every spritz. Made with a mix of Rose of Jericho (clearly a favorite ingredient of the brand) and exfoliating witch hazel you should expect your skin to feel revitalized and awakened while it gently detoxes your pores of any congesting impurities.

This mist is nice but that's just about all I can say about it. It's not bad by any means ‚Äî it feels cool on the skin which makes it nice for getting through hot summer days it seeps into skin instantly and its scent is far from overwhelming.

But to be honest I rarely get excited about face mists because they don't really provide much beyond a light dose of hydration and a soothing feel. In fact if a face mist has a harsh ingredient like alcohol it can actually dry out your skin even more.

7. Keys Soulcare Sacred Body Oil

Overall Rating: 6/10



Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Sacred Body Oil Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Sacred Body Oil $25 at Ulta Beauty

This body oil is infused with botanically derived ingredients like marula baobab and jojoba oils to give your body a deep hydration treatment. This oil also includes clarifying sea buckthorn and moisturizing manuka honey to help clear your skin of any blemishes while making every inch of your body feel soft smooth and supple.

I will say that I genuinely enjoyed this body oil way more than the body cream. However I felt like it had the opposite problem: It's not as hydrating as I would like it to be. But I don't blame the brand because there's a very fine line between making a skincare oil that's too greasy and too dry and this one just missed that sweet spot. While the formula does seep into skin instantly instead of leaving my skin a slippery mess it just didn't give me that indulgent quenched feel that other body oils provide. After half an hour of applying it my arms actually felt like they could use a layer of lotion to rehydrate.

I'm sure you can counteract this feeling by putting more on but who wants to eat up all their product in one sitting like that? Also the dropper is very sensitive and it did drip a lot of oil on my floors so put a towel down before you apply.

6. Keys Soulcare Comforting Balm

Overall Rating: 7/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Comforting Balm Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Comforting Balm $12 at Ulta Beauty

The name truly says it all with this product: This balm is meant to comfort hydrate and soothe the parts on your skin that need some extra love (think your elbows cuticles heels etc.). This lightweight and vanilla-scented balm is formulated with natural ingredients like hydrating camellia seed oil Rose of Jericho avocado oil and shea butter to treat your complexion to an instant dose of moisture when it needs it the most.

I have to say ‚Äî I really enjoyed this balm. It melted into my skin like butter it instantly seeped into the pores of the roughest parts of my body (especially my heels) and it left behind a velvety-smooth feel. Unlike other balms this one didn't leave a greasy feel on my skin which was a major plus in my book. I was able to put this balm on immediately step into my open-toed sandals and head out the door without any greasy feel messing up my steps.

The only reason why this balm isn't higher up on the list is because of how tiny the jar is albeit it is the cheapest product in the line. If the balm had come in the same jumbo size as the body cream it might've earned the top spot on this list.

5. Keys Soulcare Be Luminous Exfoliator

Overall Rating: 7.5/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Be Luminous Exfoliator Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Be Luminous Exfoliator $25 at Ulta Beauty

This may be one of the gentlest exfoliators you could ever come across but that doesn't mean it won't perform. This powder-to-foam formula works its magic through potent ingredients like antioxidant-rich green tea gently exfoliating lactic acid and hojicha powder and texture-refining mung beans while soothing oats comfort your skin.

The Be Luminous Exfoliator is another one of my favorites from Keys Soulcare. I love the combination of exfoliating acids and gentle micro granules for gently washing away any dirt and debris on my complexion. I especially love that the micro granules are made out of naturally derived ingredients.

A little goes a long way with this exfoliant too. With just a teaspoon of the exfoliating powder I was able to scrub my face neck shoulders and chest! It also had a slight tingling feeling which I love since my skin can handle it but I'd recommend patch-testing first if you're more of a sensitive skin type.

Once I rinsed it off my skin did feel soft and supple but it did leave my skin a bit tight which is the main reason why it's earned the fifth spot on this list.

4. Keys Soulcare Golden Cleanser

Overall Rating: 7.5/10

This cleanser has a gel-like feel that turns into a deliciously foamy lather that feels calm and cool on the skin making it the perfect summer cleanser for relaxing sunburnt complexions. It contains ingredients like moisturizing manuka honey brightening turmeric and calming chamomile to give your skin a trifecta of benefits in just one wash.



I usually find gel cleansers to feel a little too drying on my skin but I really do like this cleanser. While this one did leave my skin feeling a little too squeaky-clean it wasn't nearly as severe as other cleansers. The smell is also amazing but again sensitive skin types should patch-test to make sure the fragrance won't cause any reactions.

Though it works like a charm when I'm cleansing on a minimal makeup day you may want to break out another cleanser if you're wearing a full face of makeup. After a day of my face coated in concealer contour blush and full eye makeup all I wanted was to rinse off my makeup immediately but alas ... the cleanser just couldn't cut through it all. I had to break out another oil cleanser to help rid my face of stubborn waterproof mascara so try opting for a more intensive cleanser if you wear a full face of makeup daily.

3. Keys Soulcare Renewing Body + Hand Wash

Overall Rating: 8/10

Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Renewing Body + Hand Wash Keys Soulcare Keys Soulcare Renewing Body + Hand Wash Now 50% Off $13 at Ulta Beauty

This dreamy gel cleanser lathers up and gives your skin a deep cleanse while hydrating it in the shower. This body and hand wash claim to pack on the moisture through its blend of shea butter cocoa butter and manuka honey plus it has the calming scent of sage and oat milk to transport you to an exotic getaway (even if you're just in your shower).

I‚Äôm obsessed with this body wash and it‚Äôs currently the only one I‚Äôm using at the moment. First off my shoulders and back are extremely prone to breaking out so I always approach new body washes with extreme caution. Thankfully this cleanser actually helped with my body acne and has made inflammation and redness a thing of the past which is perfect timing considering that it‚Äôs tank tops and bikinis season.

While it is supposed to be a hydrating body wash it did still leave my body feeling a bit dry out of the shower which is the only reason why it's earning spot #3.

2. Keys Soulcare Skin Transformation Cream (Fragrance-Free)

Overall Rating: 9/10

While the of this gel-like cream is fragranced I opted to test out the fragrance-free version in order to not upset my sensitive currently acne-prone skin. Though you can't expect a whiff of sage and oat milk with this cream you'll definitely be pleasantly greeted with a surge of hydration via hydrating hyaluronic acid and ceramides. But those aren't the only ingredients you'll find in this cream. Your skin will also get a detox treatment from malachite and a burst of bakuchiol a retinol alternative that'll improve the tone and texture of your complexion without irritating it.

I usually don't vibe with gel moisturizers but this cream just made me a full convert to them. Its bouncy texture felt cool the second it touched my skin which helped calm down red patches and blemishes. Its rich-yet-airy texture left my skin feeling and looking dewy radiant and brighter without leaving a greasy film on my face like other moisturizers tend to do. The only reason why this moisturizer didn't earn the top spot is that I just love the number-one product that much!

If you're a fan of charcoal masks then you absolutely need to give this one a try. This mask has the purifying powers of activated charcoal but it stands out from other face masks in the beauty aisle for its moisturizing properties which you can thank manuka honey for. And as an indulgent surprise this mask is also infused with gold foil which Cleopatra herself used every night to brighten her complexion.

Oh how I love this mask. It has that same detoxing feel as most charcoal-based face masks but one of the best things about it is that it won't leave your skin feeling stripped of all of its natural oils thanks to the hydrating manuka honey. Its formula has a cooling and creamy texture when I first applied it and as it dried down I noticed that the mask still had a bit of moisture in it making it much easier to move around my lips and face.

After wearing it for a full 10 minutes (you can wear it up to 20 minutes if you want a more intensive detox) I rinsed off the mask and my skin instantly felt plumped hydrated and cleansed. Most importantly it calmed down my breakouts so much that I decided to slather this mask on my shoulders and back to see if it would also help calm down my body acne and lo and behold ‚Äî it helped! This is definitely going to be a staple in my weekly skincare routine.

What‚Äôs the bottom line?

Though there are a few products that miss the mark but overall Keys Soulcare is one of the few celebrity beauty brands that I can actually vouch for. The clean formulas and sustainable packaging are major pluses and though I'm not a fan of every product on this list I'm definitely impressed and satisfied with how Alicia Keys brought this skin (and soul) soothing collection to life. The entire line may not take up my entire skin routine but expect to see a few Keys Soulcare products pop up in my #shelfies.

(AP) - Run red lights. Break the speed limit. Drive over the curb.

And please do it in front of a police car. If you break the law in front of a police car maybe the officer will realize what is happening and escort us to the hospital.

Or the officer would deliver the baby. They're trained to do that right?

Those were the thoughts racing through Gayla Thompson's mind on June 16 just after 8 a.m. as she sat in the front seat of a Jeep stuck in heavy traffic on I-440 en route to Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Those also were the things she was actually screaming at her husband.

She was extremely pregnant in the middle of contractions but her husband Ryan Thompson wasn't entirely convinced they were contractions.

He did not share her same sense of urgency. He did not perform any of the car maneuvers his wife asked him to do.

""He did nothing"" Gayla Thompson said still a bit angry days later.

Maybe it was because he is experienced when it comes to deliveries. After all he works for United Parcel Service.

Gayla Thompson had their baby in the Jeep and it ended up being her husband who saved the baby's life.

___

They met online in 2014 when she was breaking up with another guy.

She went on a dating website to check the other guy's profile to see if he was seeking dates with other women.

That's when she saw Ryan Thompson's picture.

He was a 6-foot-2 construction worker from California who had just moved to Tennessee. She said it was love at first sight.

For their first date she invited him over to her apartment in Hermitage.

To feel more comfortable she said she loaded a 9-mm Beretta and put it on the dining room table. As it turned out the gun wasn't necessary.

Their first date went great.

""It was almost annoying how sweet and generous he was"" she said.

They were married in 2015. There was no ceremony just an appearance before a Justice of the Peace in Nashville.

She is a wedding photographer with a Dr. Seuss line tattooed on her ankle: ""Today you are you and that is truer than true. There is no one else who is youer than you.""

Connor their first child was born in 2016 at Summit Hospital which was walking distance from their Hermitage apartment.

By the time she got pregnant again in October 2020 Ryan Thompson was no longer a construction worker. He got a job last June at UPS loading packages overnight. Quickly he was promoted to delivery driver.

UPS Gayla Thompson said is great because it offers top-notch insurance plans. She was happy their new insurance got them an appointment at Vanderbilt for their second baby delivery.

Vanderbilt is 13.3 miles from their home normally a 25-minute drive without traffic.

They decided weeks ago to name their second boy Carson which would become so ironic given their son would be born in a car.

___

On June 14 Gayla Thompson began having pain that felt like contractions but she wasn't sure. She thought they were Braxton Hicks which are sometimes known as false labor pains.

Her husband latched onto the ""false"" part of that description. If she wasn't sure then he was going to try to stay calm.

On June 16 just after 6 a.m. the pain started and Gayla Thompson took a warm bath to try to relax. She told her husband to call his boss to let him know he wasn't coming in. She felt like this could be the day the baby comes.

But he didn't want to take a day off if they weren't sure.

So she convinced her husband to take her to Vanderbilt for a checkup. Something was going on with these Braxton Hicks.

""I can't feel what she's feeling"" Ryan Thompson said. ""I wasn't sure.""

She blew her hair dry. He called his boss and said he had to take his wife to a doctor appointment. They packed a bag just in case.

They got into their white Jeep which has a decal on the windshield that reads: Boobie Bouncer. (They do some off-roading.)

They dropped off Connor at daycare at 8:25 a.m. and headed for Vanderbilt. Gayla Thompson was convinced she would be delivering the baby. Her husband thought this would be another prenatal appointment.

___

When he got on I-40 West about 8:30 a.m. Ryan Thompson saw his map app was directing him to get off the freeway. Instead of a straight shot to Vanderbilt there was traffic. The couple heard later that a food delivery truck had rolled over ahead of them.

So the phone app re-routed him to Briley Parkway.

She wanted him to keep going straight on I-40. But Ryan Thompson got off the freeway. After a few minutes on Briley he got on I-440.

""We were stopped dead"" Gayla Thompson said. She remembers yelling ""Why are you following GPS?""

That's when she started screaming about jumping the curb breaking the law.

""She definitely let me know"" Ryan Thompson said in an understated way. ""She wanted me to speed but there wasn't a whole lot of options.""

They were near the Nolensville Pike exit stuck in the center lane with cars stopped all around them when his wife moved her seat back and put her legs up.

""I got in birthing position"" she said.

That's when Ryan Thompson called 911.

While he was talking with the dispatcher the baby's head appeared. Gayla Thompson got out her phone and started taking photos of the baby's arrival.

""The 911 operator kept me calm"" he said.

___

A UPS guy delivered his own baby.

Ryan Thompson got out of the Jeep on the freeway and went to the passenger's side. The baby's head was out but there was no crying. The baby wasn't breathing.

""Babies are supposed to cry"" Gayla Thompson said. ""We looked like we were going to have a dead baby on the side of the road.""

The baby wasn't moving at all. He noticed the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck.

""That was the scariest part"" Ryan Thompson said.

He slid his finger under the cord and slipped the cord over the baby's head.

""We heard a tiny little cough"" she said. ""Then a cry. It was a miracle.""

Her husband had saved their baby.

A firefighter arrived and cut the umbilical cord.

When he got to the hospital Carson Thompson was seven pounds three ounces.

""He's so healthy"" Gayla Thompson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEwL3Bvc3QtYXBvY2FseXBzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post Apocalypse,"In November 2020 George White sent his mother a birthday card from where he lives in Ohio to her home in Virginia. The typical United States Postal Service (USPS) promise is to get first-class mail to most destinations within three days.

White‚Äîas the president of an Ohio-based greeting card company Up With Paper that makes heavy use of the postal service‚Äîsuspected that an on-time delivery wasn't in the cards.

To be on the safe side he mailed his mom's birthday card a week early. It got there a week late.

""That was a bummer for me"" says White who serves as the president of the Greeting Card Association a trade group. It was also a bummer for his industry. The value of greeting cards rests on timely delivery of products commemorating particular dates be they birthdays graduations or holidays. Late delivery White says ""can lead to less greeting cards being purchased and mailed. Because if they're not going to get it in time what's the point?""

White was far from the only one to experience late arriving mail in 2020. In the final months of that year with tens of millions of people quarantining at home Americans sent and ordered an unprecedented number of holiday packages. E-commerce which relies on shipping services to deliver goods to customers had been growing rapidly even before the pandemic but COVID-19 moved retail online at an even faster pace.

Complaining about the post office has long been a national pastime. Years of declining paper mail volumes persistent fiscal deficits and a logistics network not optimized for package delivery were all challenges that predated COVID-19. The pandemic made them much worse.

At the same time a record number of Americans voted by mail in what would become one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in U.S. history. Critics wondered if the troubled agency would be able to handle the added volume created by the additional mailed ballots while some Democrats worried that then‚ÄìPresident Donald Trump might use the government-run post to steal the election.

The combination of preexisting retail trends increased package volume spurred by stay-at-home workers and high-stakes political gamesmanship surrounding mail-in voting pushed the postal service nearly to the point of collapse. By late December only about a third of first-class mail was getting to its destination on time in major East Coast metros such as New York Philadelphia and Baltimore. Libertarians and other critics who have long warned about the inefficiencies of a government-run postal monopoly could at least feel some vindication when they found their mailboxes empty.

""In my experience of 18 years following the postal service we had the most high-salience bizarrest postal politics moment ever"" says Kevin Kosar a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

The dual crises of the election and the pandemic are now fading but this affords the troubled agency little breathing room. With short-term fires extinguished the USPS now must ask itself some existential long-term questions. Is the post office's traditional business model finally falling apart?

'Every Day Is Christmas'

March 2020 sparked a big change in Kate Murray's business Quick Brown Fox a one-woman Brooklyn-based greeting card company. The retail stores she normally sold bulk orders of cards to were all shut down. Meanwhile customers were stuck inside with little to do but shop online.

""Suddenly people were home and people were buying"" says Murray. So she pivoted. Instead of larger shipments to businesses she started filling individual direct-to-consumer orders. To make up for the drop-off in wholesale cards she started to push higher-price-point candles and wrapping paper.

Her changing business model meant changes in how she interacted with the USPS. Concerns about going to a physical post office meant she had more packages picked up at her front door. Suppliers too ended up shipping more directly to her. More candles and fewer cards meant more packages less first-class mail.

For Murray these shifts in her business all proved manageable. She says she was pleased with the postal service during the pandemic. It was likely much less pleased with her.

The postal service's massive logistics network is made up of 644000 people staffing around 34000 post offices plus a few hundred annexes hubs and processing and distribution centers. It was primarily designed to get high-margin ""flat mail"" to 161 million addresses across the country.

""For most of the U.S. Postal Service's history letters cards and magazines were its bread and butter"" notes a USPS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report from September 2020. ""Its delivery infrastructure was primarily designed with mail in mind‚Äîfrom the vehicles to the facilities to the mailboxes.""

That business model has been in steady decline for over a decade with paper mail volumes falling 45 percent between 2007 and today. In fiscal year 2020 alone they fell 11 percent. In an age of near-universal email access and paperless billing for every imaginable service mail you can fit in an envelope has become increasingly irrelevant.

Thanks to the rising popularity of e-commerce however packages are in greater demand than ever. An October customer survey by the USPS OIG found that the number of respondents who ordered a product online at least once per month rose to 81 percent in 2020 up from 57 percent in 2019. The number of packages handled by the service rose from 6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to a little over 7 billion in fiscal year 2020 a 19 percent increase. This is causing serious problems for the USPS.

""Paper mail and boxes are not the same thing"" Kosar says. He pointed to congressional testimony from Louis DeJoy in March in which the postmaster general said that your average USPS tractor-trailer could carry 500000 pieces of first-class mail‚Ä¶or about 5000 packages.

It's also a crowded field given the existence of private parcel rivals like FedEx and UPS.

Meanwhile people's reticence to visit physical post offices during the last year meant more mail had to be collected and dropped off at individual residential addresses often in dense urban areas‚Äîwhere constrained space makes pick-ups and deliveries more difficult‚Äîor rural locations that private shippers don't serve.

The sheer space all these packages took up put an incredible amount of strain on the system that needed to collect sort and ship them. One common utterance among USPS employees during the first few months of the pandemic was ""every day is Christmas."" It wasn't meant to be a happy saying.

During the actual 2020 Christmas rush a surge of 1.1 billion holiday packages enveloped USPS producing scenes of logistical horror across the country.

At one post office in Cleveland drivers waited upward of 12 hours to pick up or drop off packages according to News5 the local ABC affiliate. ""Don't be using the post office right now"" a USPS employee told the Philadelphia Inquirer ""because we can't deliver the mail."" According to CNN one processing facility was receiving 250000 packages a day in December‚Äîso many that it had to open a fourth annex just to store them all.

The flood of bulky holiday packages was always going to prove a challenge for an agency designed to sort and deliver envelopes. But that challenge was made substantially more difficult by the fact that the agency had also been tasked with facilitating a high-stakes presidential election.

The Myth of the Missing Blue Boxes

In August 2020 Twitter user Thomas Kennedy posted a picture of a number of blue USPS mail collection boxes wrapped in plastic and piled up on their sides behind a fence in what looked like a dump. ""This is happening right before our eyes. They are sabotaging USPS to sabotage vote by mail"" he wrote.

In fact the soon-to-go-viral image didn't show discarded mailboxes and it wasn't taken at a dump. It showed mailboxes at a facility waiting to be refurbished. It nevertheless came at the perfect time to fuel paranoia that Trump through his stooge DeJoy was plotting to use the post office to steal the election.

In the days and weeks prior to that picture going viral local news stories and social media had been filled with mostly accurate accounts of mailboxes being taken off the streets and sorting machines being decommissioned. These moves were part of cost-cutting operational changes being made by DeJoy who took over as postmaster general in June 2020. They also reflected a long-running trend of USPS consolidating its mailboxes and facilities to reflect falling volumes of paper mail.

These run-of-the-mill changes however were happening at an unusual time: the 2020 election season when partisan attitudes were running high and the country as a whole was gearing up‚Äîfor the first time thanks to the pandemic‚Äîfor mass voting by mail. Adding fuel to the fire both USPS officials and Trump made statements that gave the impression that the agency was either not up to the task of handling ballot mail or alternatively being deliberately sabotaged.

On the same day of Kennedy's misleading viral tweet for example The Washington Post revealed that the Postal Service had in July sent 46 states letters warning that it couldn't guarantee that all mail-in ballots requested or cast by state-set election deadlines could be delivered by USPS in time to be counted. During his daily pandemic press briefing two days prior Trump had said that he would continue to oppose $25 billion in emergency funding for the USPS without which the agency likely would not be able to ensure universal mail-in voting.

Days after Trump's comments the Postal Service announced it would stop removing mailboxes‚Äîan apparent attempt to tamp down the controversy. It didn't work. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D‚ÄìCalif.) and then‚ÄìSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D‚ÄìN.Y.) publicly demanded that Trump ""immediately cease his assault on the Postal Service."" Reps. Ted Lieu (D‚ÄìCalif.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D‚ÄìN.Y.) asked the FBI to investigate whether the postmaster general had committed any actual crimes. And several Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop DeJoy's operational changes.

An injunction granted in that suit by a U.S. district judge in Washington state restricted the Postal Service's ability to make further changes in the run-up to the election. It also required that the USPS treat all election mail by first-class delivery standards.

In the end worries that Trump would sabotage the election via the mail proved overblown. The movement of ballots and voter registration forms was one of the bright spots in the USPS' performance during the pandemic: The agency managed to deliver 93.8 percent of election mail on time.

That was a better record than all other types of first-class mail for which on-time delivery rates ranged from 91 percent for overnight mail to 78 percent for three-to-five-day deliveries last fall and winter. It was also an 11 percentage point improvement from its delivery of election mail during the 2018 midterms.

A USPS OIG report chalks up the agency's success to ""high-cost efforts such as extra transportation and overtime to improve delivery performance."" But the prioritization of ballots meant other types of mail ended up delayed sometimes severely.

Late Edition

One byproduct of the lawsuit against DeJoy's overhaul of USPS' operations was a court order requiring the agency to release granular weekly data on its record delivering first-class mail on time. That data painted a bleak picture.

The Postal Service had given itself a performance goal of delivering about 95 percent of first-class mail to its destination on time in fiscal year 2020. Beginning in July it had started to fall short of that goal according to The New York Times' parsing of USPS data. By December only about a third of first-class mail was arriving on time on much of the East Coast.

A USPS quarterly performance report covering October through December 2020 found that on-time rates for package service were 80 percent well below the agency's 90 percent on-time goal for packages in fiscal year 2020. (Yearly performance targets for fiscal year 2021 have yet to be established.)

Faring even worse were periodicals. Their on-time performance dipped to 69 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 down 16 percentage points from last fiscal year and a solid 21 percentage points below last year's on-time goal.

These national numbers mask a lot of regional variation. The post office in Seattle was able to get 82.29 percent of periodicals to their destinations on time during the week of December 26. The Western New York District managed an on-time rate of 1.63 percent that same week.

One printer tells Reason that 30 percent of its customers reported delayed deliveries of at least 10 days and some had their materials arrive as much as 80 days late. Barcodes that were supposed to let the printer track orders routinely went unscanned and inquiries to the USPS about missing shipments only returned boilerplate apologies about how the postal service was ""experiencing delays.""

Weekly papers in particular make heavy use of the mail given the difficulties of keeping a dedicated delivery team around for just one day a week says Brett Wesner of Wesner Publications a publisher of 12 small-circulation weekly newspapers in Oklahoma Texas and New Mexico. The years leading up to the pandemic had already seen service standards decline for out-of-state and out-of-county deliveries he says. The pandemic was disastrous across the board. Papers that were supposed to arrive in November 2020 didn't show up until April in some cases. Other times subscribers wouldn't receive papers for several weeks in a row and then have them all show up at once.

Murray the greeting card maker was able to cope with worsening delivery times by giving customers longer delivery dates for their orders. No such option exists for mailed periodicals that are supposed to reach customers on a regular date.

Delayed newspaper delivery also caused problems with advertisers which include local governments publishing required public notices and event promoters says Wesner who also chairs the board of the National Newspaper Association. ""In some circumstances papers got delivered after the event that was being advertised so obviously these advertisers were not interested in paying for advertising after the event"" he says.

His company heavily relies on rural post offices which were even more acutely affected by USPS staffing issues than were other locations. When employees at these branches had to ""quarantine or someone got COVID"" Wesner says ""they didn't have 50 people to rely on. At one post office we actually had the janitor running the front desk because she was the only one with a key to the front office.""

Reason itself saw a significant uptick in subscriber complaints about delayed or undelivered issues with some people reporting bundles of magazines addressed to several other subscribers arriving at their doors.

Back to the Black?

The new year has eased the immediate crisis. As of early March the weekly on-time rate for first-class mail had reached 84 percent up from a weekly low of 62 percent during the Christmas season last year. But nothing has been done to resolve the USPS' longer-running issues.

Those include chronic deficits a growing number of packages entering a system financially and logistically designed to handle traditional paper mail and mounting unfunded retiree and health care benefits.

In March DeJoy released a 10-year plan designed to put the agency in the black by 2024 through a mix of service cuts rate hikes and shifting of employee compensation costs from the USPS' balance sheet onto taxpayers. (He also wants to open more package sorting annexes and to revamp the agency's vehicle fleet to handle more parcels.)

Under the plan the Postal Service would have mail sent cross-country on USPS-owned trucks instead of privately owned planes. That would save the agency money but lengthen delivery times.

At the same time the plan calls for raising postage rates. In 2006 the last year the postal service made a profit sending a letter cost 39 cents. Prices have ticked up almost every year since including a 10 percent jump from 50 to 55 cents in 2019 (the largest price increase since 1991).

The postmaster general has thus far declined to say exactly how much he wants to raise rates this time around. His 10-year plan says the agency can claim $24 billion more in revenue from expanded package delivery the introduction of new products and ""price changes."" Industry officials interviewed by The Washington Post predicted rate hikes of up to 9 percent.

The USPS has about $120 billion in unfunded retiree benefit obligations including $50 billion in unfunded pension obligations and $70 billion in retiree health care benefits. Now the postmaster general is asking Congress to end the requirement that USPS ""pre-fund"" its pension and health benefits (meaning it saves current revenue to cover future retirees' costs) and to start requiring retired postal workers to enroll in Medicare. Currently they can choose to keep the private health coverage they had while employed by the USPS.

If the USPS stops putting money down today to cover tomorrow's retiree benefits there are obvious risks for both postal workers whose pensions would be less secure and taxpayers who could be called on to cover the costs of these unfunded obligations whenever the bill comes due.

The plan has landed with a thud for big senders of traditional flat mail. ""I have not seen a business model like his that promises worse service for higher prices succeed"" says Wesner.

USPS' plan to shift its emphasis to parcel service also concerns Kosar. ""Do we really want the Postal Service to compete increasingly with the private sector?"" he asks. ""We do have private companies that deliver parcels‚Äîlots of them.""

Dreams of Laissez Faire

Falling volumes of first-class mail and a growing package delivery market that's already well-served by the private sector might lead some to ask whether we need a government-run postal service at all. Going back at least to the 19th century the agency's poor execution of its core mission has provoked complaints from customers for its slow service and high prices. Libertarians too have been at work on this issue for as long as we've been around.

The individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner one of the earliest and most loquacious critics of a publicly run postal service sought to set things right with his 1844 founding of a private postal competitor the American Letter Mail Co. The U.S. government none too thrilled with the downward pressure the company put on its monopoly prices shut him down in 1851.

The company's spirit nevertheless lives on in private package delivery services like FedEx and UPS whose on-time rates were head-and-shoulders above USPS during the worst of the pandemic. (Part of the reason for this is that private carriers can hand off their hardest-to-deliver parcels to the USPS which is legally required to serve every part of the country even when it's nowhere close to cost-effective to do so.)

Reason has been dreaming of a laissez faire postal system since its inception. A 1988 issue of the magazine explored how and how quickly we could turn the bloated subsidized agency over to the free market before the fax machine destroyed it entirely. By 2009 Reason even suggested selling the USPS to Netflix which could use its expertise shipping DVDs to customers' doorsteps to cut down on persistent postal delays.

The unprecedented circumstances of the last year have exacerbated many of the post office's problems. But Kosar says there's still a lot of traditional mail that needs to be sent from ballots to jury summons. And some rural parts of the country he argues are just not going to be adequately covered by a private company that has to turn a profit.

Voters themselves aren't in a hurry to get rid of the agency either. A survey by the USPS OIG found that 91 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Postal Service in 2020 an increase from previous years. The explicit inclusion of mail delivery in the U.S. Constitution meanwhile makes complete elimination even more difficult than it would be for other federal agencies (which history suggests are also not particularly easy to eliminate).

All of which means that most any vision for reform is likely to run into serious challenges. An overhaul intended to prioritize handling more packages would risk alienating the large customers most invested in the USPS' flat mail services. Focusing on ever-declining paper mail would make the agency both less relevant to the public and more dependent on public subsidies. A host of countries not known for radical free market experiments including the U.K. Germany and the Netherlands have either privatized their postal services or opened them up to private competition. But polling suggests trying something similar in the U.S. would be politically difficult.

Kosar argues it's time for a rethinking of what we actually want from a government-run postal service. ""We need to have a public conversation to get clear on what that would be"" he says. ""We have to estimate the cost and we have to figure out how to pay for it.""

But no matter which direction the Postal Service goes from here the vision of an agency that provides a valuable service while sustaining itself without taxpayer subsidies appears doomed.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: JPMORGAN PEPSICO GOLDMAN SACHS

JPMorgan: The New York City-based multinational investment bank and financial services holding company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $3.16 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 128% from $1.38 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company has delivered earnings surprise all four times with of over 32%.

‚ÄúJPM has less excess capital as a % of the market cap relative to other names in the group which drives a lower benefit from buybacks. We are valuing the group on normalized 2023 EPS. We expect a V-shaped recovery will drive higher reserve release and share buybacks over the next 2 years with ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù post-recession earnings beginning in 2023‚Äù noted Betsy Graseck equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúWe see more upside elsewhere in the group particularly in consumer finance stocks which have been under more pressure. This drives our Underweight rating.‚Äù

PEPSICO: The Harrison New York-based global food and beverage leader is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 15% from $1.32 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The U.S. multinational food snack and beverage corporation would post revenue of $17.91 billion. In the last four consecutive quarters on average the company which holds approximately a 32% share of the U.S. soft drink industry has delivered an earnings surprise of over 6%.

GOLDMAN SACHS: The New York-based leading global investment bank is expected to report its second-quarter earnings of $9.52 per share which represents year-over-year growth of over 52% from $6.26 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

It is worth noting that in the last two years the world‚Äôs leading investment manager has surpassed market consensus expectations for profit and revenue most of the time. The better-than-expected number would help the stock hit new all-time highs.

‚ÄúOur 2Q EPS est. increases to $10.05 from $9.53 on positive markets and higher equity investment revs. The equity investment line will likely again be a meaningful rev. swing factor (we model $1.4B vs. $3.1B in 1Q21). Post-DFAST GS indicated that the dividend will increase to $2.00/qtr. from $1.25/qtr. but did not provide specifics on buybacks. We model 2Q share repurchase of $1.5B (vs. $2.2B cons.) and $2.5B/qtr. (vs.$2.3B/qtr. cons.) for the remainder of this year‚Äù noted Daniel T. Fannon equity analyst at Jefferies.

As a licensed psychologist and the founder of Therapy For Black Girls Dr. Joy Harden Bradford has committed herself to creating a safe space in which Black women can address mental health. With July marking BIPOC Mental Health Awareness Month the mental health expert and podcaster tells Yahoo Life that given the trauma of the past year it is important for Black people to have access to therapists that will not invalidate their lived experiences.

""[In light of] some of the experiences that we have seen on top of the pandemic ‚Äî [such as] continuing concerns related to racial injustice and the trauma that can come from racism ‚Äî you don't want to have to go to someone who's not going to take you at your word for how you're feeling or somebody who [has] not necessarily been personally impacted by what we've seen happen this year"" she explains. ""And so I think for a lot of people they take comfort in going to a therapist who looks like them who they know will get the experience of what they're talking about and they won't be questioned.""

Here she opens up about what practices have helped in her own life and how fellow Black women can protect their own mental health.

What are your go-to techniques for fighting stress and anxiety?

Getting outside typically is very helpful. [Also] deep breathing. I have different playlists on Spotify that are like people playing sound bowls and those kinds of things. They tend to be really helpful as well. The other thing that can be helpful is like holding a couple of ice cubes in your hand because it can really help you to kind of detach from whatever emotions you feel like are overwhelming you.

Do you have any small self-care rituals that you use to brighten your day?

I typically like to stay up later than everybody else in my house because that feels like an opportune time for me to kind of just be alone with my thoughts [and] typically that is when I get my journaling done. I would say that's probably the only thing I have that is a regular part of my day.

[And] with journaling a lot of people kind of try to make it like this big process that has to be done when really it could just be you taking a couple of notes in your notes app. It doesn't have to be [involve setting] a candle although those can be beautiful sessions but it doesn't have to be [like that].

What impact has taken care of your mental health had on your life and overall health?

I really think that you can‚Äôt really separate those things. Mental health is something that we all have to take care of which I think has been a huge misconception. I think people tend to think about mental health only in a crisis but mental health is something that we can proactively take care of as well. So paying attention to your sleep and how much physical activity you're getting in eating the right kinds of foods ‚Äî all of those things also impact our mental health. I don't think that you can really separate your mental health from how it impacts the rest of your body.

Why was it important for you to create Therapy for Black Girls?

My background is in college student mental health and on every campus that I was on I would always run a group for the Black women on campus. Just given the stigma related to mental health it has felt really important to me throughout my career to make sure that Black women were able to access all of the different kinds of tools and strategies we can use to take care of our mental health. [This has been] a way of decreasing some of the stigma and making it OK to talk about those things that our families have told us have not been OK to talk about and really just creating a space for people to be able to do that.

What effects have that stigma had on mental health among Black women in particular? How can we combat it?

So I think one of the biggest ones is the superwoman syndrome ‚Äî this idea that as a Black woman that we kind of always have to have it together. You know ""Black don't crack"" like all of these different things that you hear kind of just thrown around. I think it probably came from a good place. A lot of things that become a part of the culture served a purpose at one time but now we have to look at whether those kinds of ideals are really helping us or harming us. And I think [superwoman syndrome] is actually causing more harm because we are not superwomen; we're human just like everybody else. And so that means looking at how we can prioritize taking care of ourselves as opposed to prioritizing taking care of everybody else. And that doesn't mean that you completely cut yourself off from your community it just means that you are supporting your own cup before you give to other people [because] you can't keep giving from an empty cup.

Aside from stigma what obstacles can get in the way for Black women struggling with mental health?

We don't have any universal health care and that includes mental health care so the cost of seeing a therapist can sometimes be prohibitive for a lot of people. People don't always have insurance and even if they do through a job or something sometimes mental health services are not included. So the cost can be really difficult for people who need services and can't access it. And lots of community clinics and other governmental support things have been closed down so we don't even have the same level of community resources.

The other thing is that there are not enough therapists of color to go around so for a lot of Black people they want to see other Black therapists [but] less than 5 percent of all psychologists are actually Black. If everybody wanted a Black therapist there would not be enough of us to go around. So that's another thing that can be a barrier for people is that when they're looking for help they want to find help in the form of people who look like them and sometimes that can't happen.

Why is it important that Black women prioritize their mental and emotional health?

Us taking care of ourselves allows us to keep taking care of other people. I think in addition to self-care we also have to look at community care. Another thing that we have seen this year is that a lot of the systems that we thought would be there to take care of us and support us in the time of a crisis were not. And so I think that means we have to do that for ourselves. We cannot do that if we are not well. The other part of it is that in order for us to continue to be successful in our careers and continue to raise families and do all of the things that we want to do we have to be well to do those kinds of things and a lot of that starts with prevention.

What tips do you have for Black women who are struggling to make themselves a priority?

This is often really hard because we are not often socialized to do that. It starts with very small steps sometimes so a lot of this work looks like setting boundaries for how you interact with other people and how they interact with you. [Another thing] you can do is make a list of all the things that you do in a day and then look at what actually can be checked off on that list like who can you delegate a responsibility to [and] whose responsibilities are you adding to your plate and then their plate is empty. If you make some lists and kind of figure out how you're spending your time it'll give you a good indication of where some boundaries need to be set.

Another thing that you can look at is when you see a phone number pop up on your screen or a text message from somebody and your first reaction is ""Oh what do they want?"" that is a good indication that there's a boundary that needs to be set because if you don't then you run the risk of becoming very resentful in your relationships. People often think about [boundaries as] really hard and fast and mean like ""I can't be in relationship"" but boundaries are actually what would help the relationship continue. It says that I can still respect myself and kind of give myself what I need and I can do the same for you. And it's a more reciprocal kind of an experience.

What hopes do you have for mental health awareness in the Black community?

I just hope that we continue to talk about it. I hope that we continue to make space for one another to say that we're not OK because I think that there is the perception within the community and then the perception we try to give outside of the community. And so there are often these masks that we have to wear in the workplace [and] in different areas of the community. But I think with one another we have to really be able to create spaces where we can take those masks off and really talk about how we're struggling. And so we can only do that if we're taking care of ourselves and then making sure that we're engaging in community care as well.

The victory ensured that President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador (AMLO) will have a legislative majority for the rest of his six-year presidency as well as see the party he founded govern a much larger swath of the country at the state and local level. The task now facing MORENA is how to convert the momentum of the recent victories into a transformative agenda that rejecting the temptation to leave its best game in the first half moves forward in those areas where it has so far fallen short. Following is a (non-exhaustive) list of areas where action is urgently needed.

Tax Reform The government‚Äôs own figures tell the story of a rigged tax system where the rich pay pocket change and leave everyone else to cough up. While large earners paid an effective income tax rate of 1.3 percent in 2020 ‚Äî even less than the year before ‚Äî everyone else wound up on the hook for an average rate of 25.4 percent. And while the AMLO administration has made progress in getting corporations to pay back taxes and thus succeed in increasing revenues the president himself has continued to double down on his refusal to raise taxes despite longstanding rumors of a fiscal reform to come in the second half of his presidency. What he has promised instead is an addendum to this year‚Äôs budget that closes loopholes and increases enforcement measures. While welcome this is nowhere near enough. What must be considered is a gamut of measures including an increase in the top income tax bracket wealth and estate taxes and the risible capital-gains rate of 10 percent. To make these measures even more popular the proceeds generated can be earmarked for specific policy proposals like national health care or a massive investment in solar technology (see below). And if the executive refuses to take the initiative the MORENA majority in Congress should cease being the rubber stamp for the president‚Äôs agenda it has been up to now pass tax reform on its own and dare him to veto it. Against the backdrop of a 20 percent increase in wealth by Mexico‚Äôs top fortunes during the pandemic the need to take action becomes all the more pressing lest MORENA conclude its term with the dubious distinction of leaving behind a nation more unequal than the one it inherited.

Banking Where the mining industry drains the country of its minerals Mexico‚Äôs banking cartel does the same with its money fleecing its clients through fees commissions charges and eye-popping interest rates the proceeds from which flow to corporate coffers in London Madrid New York and Toronto (or rather their respective tax havens). In the first five months of 2021 banks in Mexico have raked in net profits of some $65 billion pesos (US$3.25 billion) ‚Äî a 27 percent increase compared to the same period in 2020 ‚Äî while offering 12.4 percent less in credit. In the short term MORENA must pass the banking reform bill that died in the last session of Congress without letting either the banking lobby or AMLO‚Äôs belief in financial self-regulation water it down or block it. In the medium term it must fully equip the Bank of Well-Being (El Banco de Bienestar) so that it represents a genuine public option instead of playing patsy to the private system by picking up the clients it chooses to neglect. Meanwhile MORENA should be laying the groundwork for a fundamental restructuring of finance and credit in the public interest that breaks the back of the cartel of financial institutions 80 percent foreign-owned that has turned banking into a private game of exclusion and enrichment.

Prosecutions On August 1 Mexico will head back to the polls to vote in a referendum as to whether former presidents and other members of previous administrations should be investigated and as appropriate brought to trial for their crimes. This first-ever plebiscite under the nation‚Äôs public consultation law is set to pass overwhelmingly although ‚Äî in large part due to the foot-dragging and obstruction of the National Electoral Institute which will be opening barely a third of the precincts in use for the midterms ‚Äî it is not clear whether it will achieve the participation rate of 40 percent needed to be legally binding. Whatever the case the vote should serve as a spur for a governmental prosecution machine that despite a number of high-profile arrests has so far moved with frustrating slowness in punishing the corruption of the past. At heart is a tension between AMLO‚Äôs stated desire to put a punto final or ‚Äúfull stop‚Äù to the crimes of his predecessors and a public clamor for perpetrators of crimes of the state from Acteal to Ayotzinapa to finally be brought to justice. To the president‚Äôs credit he made the official request for the referendum to take place and has since been outspoken about the need for former presidents from Carlos Salinas de Gortari to Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to face the law. In the face of an international press that reflexively labels any Latin American leader who refuses to toe the Washington Consensus as ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù AMLO‚Äôs desire to place distance between himself and the process is understandable. But that does not make the process itself any less necessary: in the most practical of senses failure to dismantle the criminal mafia that brought the country to the brink of ruin will simply allow this mafia to reconstitute itself in a future administration more seasoned ruthless and less willing to lose its grip on power ever again.

Energy and Climate AMLO‚Äôs energy reforms constitute the necessary first steps to clawing back public control over an energy grid that has been deliberately and systematically denuded in order to justify opening the door to corporations and foreign multinationals. Now the MORENA majority must take the next step. The Federal Electricity Commission‚Äôs strategic plan for the next four years is inadequate to tackle the crisis of climate change: in a country where three hundred‚Äìplus days of sun a year is the rule in large regions of the country a fundamental logic cries out for a massive investment in solar technology. Recent plans to create a public federally financed solar park in Sonora a joint solar project between the Electricity Commission and the National Institute for Indigenous Peoples in Santa Mar√≠a del Mar Oaxaca and the largest urban solar installation in the world on the roof of the Central de Abasto market in Mexico City represent promising steps forward but they must be scaled up and combined with a reform of the much-abused autoabasto or ‚Äúself-supply‚Äù provision of the law in order to allow individuals and collectives to feed clean energy into the grid.

State and Local Governance Most people‚Äôs first and most lasting contact with government comes at the state and local level and with MORENA now governing half of Mexico‚Äôs states and a large chunk of its municipalities it is an area it needs to master. This begins with attending to basic infrastructure needs that have been neglected thanks to decades of indifference and corruption. Millions of Mexicans cannot drink water from their taps have no access to parks or green spaces do not separate their garbage for lack of recycling programs breathe the foul emissions belched by trucks and buses and must walk daily by waterways that are little more than open sewers. Renters suffer from unregulated rental markets and in many cities from forces of gentrification that push them farther and farther out to the periphery. In state prisons across the country moreover thousands upon thousands of impoverished prisoners languish in pretrial detention for months and sometimes years in a modern-day version of debtors‚Äô prison. In addition to reforming and expediting an often inhumane justice process MORENA legislatures have an excellent opportunity to enact a penal reform in order to release those incarcerated for having or performing abortions political prisoners nonviolent drug offenders and members of Indigenous nations who were refused the right to a trial in their own language. As most crimes are classified and punished at the state level this would have a much greater practical effect than the federal amnesty law enacted in 2020.

Health Care With AMLO‚Äôs plan to provide national health care to all Mexicans temporarily derailed by the pandemic the next Congress would be an ideal time to bring this life-and-death issue back to the fore. The administration has taken some important steps in the meanwhile completing the construction of hospitals left abandoned by previous governments eliminating fees in federal hospitals and arranging ‚Äî despite the opposition of multinationals like Bayer and a savage counter-campaign at home ‚Äî to purchase medications from the UN in order to break up the cornering of the national market by a handful of unscrupulous distributors. But no national plan will ever fully work without addressing the elephant in the room: the fragmented nature of Mexican health care whereby private-sector workers in the formal economy are treated in one system (IMSS) public-sector workers in another (ISSSTE) and everyone else ‚Äî in theory ‚Äî in a far-inferior third system (INSABI). The MORENA Congress should take advantage of the expansion of hospital capacity fostered by the pandemic and the success of the national vaccination campaign to do what no one else has dared: unify the nation‚Äôs health care into a single universal system that covers everyone equally.

Women‚Äôs Rights In 2020 the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill to establish the constitutional right to dignified care based on the co-responsibility of men and women to be guaranteed by the state by means of the National Care System. The goal is to address the yawning inequality experienced by women in Mexico who perform the vast majority of the most precarious jobs while also having to shoulder the care of children the elderly and the disabled. So far so good. But another article of the proposed legislation stipulates that no new entity or financial commitment be created as ‚Äúexisting institutions must be taken advantage of.‚Äù In the new Congress MORENA must go beyond these kinds of symbolic gestures and fully fund efforts to equalize and socialize care. It must also move to address the nation‚Äôs plague of femicides by providing legal protection and safe spaces for at-risk women such as the Puerta Violeta or ‚ÄúPurple Door‚Äù refuges centers of multidisciplinary assistance for women and their families. The government has been widely criticized for an initial cutoff of funds to refuges as part of an overall drive to no longer subsidize private organizations. Its desire to take these services in-house is the right one but it must follow through not only with maintaining the existing network but expanding it. At the same time the new Congress should follow the example of MORENA legislatures in the states of Oaxaca and Hidalgo and legalize abortion at the federal level. This will mean going up against the Catholic Church and the nation‚Äôs burgeoning evangelical movement but the recent legalization in Argentina has made the task easier for Mexico by showing how a progressive government can take on this historically taboo issue successfully.

Indigenous Rights Mexico has a long way to go to address its historic debt with its Indigenous peoples. Whereas Bolivia for example enshrined Indigenous rights and autonomy in its 2009 constitution that recognized its plurinational character Mexico has yet to ratify the San Andr√©s Accords negotiated following the Zapatista uprising a full quarter century ago in 1996. Ratifying the accords was a part of AMLO‚Äôs platform in each of his three runs for president and must occur without further delay. On a daily basis Indigenous communities are on the front lines against the environmental depredations of mining companies and private water interests; a proper approach to Indigenous policy then begins with basic ecological stewardship. This means restoring water rights to the Yaqui tribe in Sonora who have faced contamination of and lack of access to their own river. It means resolving the conflict that has kept the Mixe communities of San Pedro and San Pablo Ayutla without access to their local spring for four years due to threats of an armed group. It means resolving land disputes such as the ones that have led to the displacement of thousands of Tzotziles in the highland pueblos of Chiapas. It means halting the sell-off of communal lands ‚Äî made possible by the constitutional counter-reforms of Salinas de Gortari ‚Äî and writing AMLO‚Äôs executive order banning genetically modified corn and the toxic chemical glyphosate into law. But none of this will be enough without realizing that Mexico too is a plurinational state whose Indigenous nations have the right to autonomy self-government cultural expression and full access to justice in their own languages.

Security Instead of betting all of its chips on the army while militarizing police functions through the National Guard the MORENA majority in the new Congress should rethink its approach to the stubborn drug-related violence it has not managed to bring down over the first three years. As a first step it must finally pass its long-delayed marijuana legalization law which caught between competing versions in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate died at the end of the last session (the recreational use of marijuana has been approved separately by the Supreme Court). But it must look beyond this to a much wider decriminalization along the lines of the Portugal model. However unlikely this may appear in the context of a US-fueled ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù that has devastated the social fabric of country after country in Latin America it has its historical precedent in Mexico. In 1940 the government of L√°zaro C√°rdenas ‚Äî visionary in this as in other matters ‚Äî passed legislation decriminalizing all drugs creating a network of treatment clinics and public dispensaries for addicts to purchase controlled doses and releasing previous offenders from prison. Under pressure from the United States the short-lived experiment was rolled back but should be resurrected today with renewed vigor. Mexico has sacrificed far too many lives fighting the suicidal battles imposed on it by its northern neighbor; it‚Äôs time for it to go its own way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1bmN0aW9uaW5nLXByaW1hcnktaGVhbHRoLWZhY2lsaXRpZXMtZmlyc3Qtc3RlcC10b3dhcmRzLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtcmVmb3Jt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Functioning primary health facilities first step towards healthcare reform - The Sunday Guardian Live,"When the primary healthcare system is not functioning optimally it increases the pressure on the tertiary health facilities. Overloading the country‚Äôs tertiary medical institutions the second wave saw 50% of its caseload coming from rural India.

Health is not everything but without health everything is nothing.

Arthur Schopenhauer

FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA US: As SARS-CoV-2 continues to plague even our largest economies India is no exception. After making groundbreaking progress in global vaccine contribution through Covishield and Covaxin the country had the highest per-day positive cases in the second wave. It is not likely that over a billion Indians will be vaccinated sufficiently to stop the spread properly or in time for the next wave. What can India do to combat this? The answer lies in how healthcare is currently provided and how it can be reshaped to address fundamental issues at the heart of providing quality care.

Each state must provide universal access to healthcare services but many states find themselves lacking the resources to make this possible. Out of the total medical visits in India nearly 86% of them are being made by individuals from rural communities who travel more than 62 miles. Expenses are paid out of pocket leaving these individuals in poverty. A report based on a study of 143 public facilities in India found a lack of doctors unpredictable hours and essential equipment and medicines. Therefore addressing resources and infrastructure issues is necessary at the national level.

One of the biggest challenges is the lack of functioning primary health facilities. Although the numbers of these facilities continue to increase there is not enough staff for these facilities to function. If more facilities were opened they would also suffer from the same staffing shortages and essentially be inoperable.

When the primary healthcare system is not functioning optimally it increases the pressure on the tertiary health facilities. Overloading the country‚Äôs tertiary medical institutions the second wave saw 50% of its caseload coming from rural India.

Ineffectiveness throughout primary healthcare has left a breach in the referral system which should be serving as an entry point and then providing continuous comprehensive coordination at all healthcare levels. A sub-health centre is where vaccinations and testing for Covid-19 should be occurring but many of these sub-health centres are neglected and lacked even essential personnel to run them.

The truth is that while the healthcare system deals with Covid-19 other aspects of healthcare are being ignored or neglected. Parents are not bringing their children in for routine vaccinations. Prenatal checkups are being missed. Patients are not picking up medicines for chronic illnesses. The fact that India‚Äôs healthcare system is failing to run routine functions during the pandemic indicates a change is vital to protecting the future health of our people and nation. Structural and functional reforms throughout the healthcare system can be critical to managing the next wave while improving the healthcare system for decades to come.

India cannot continue to respond to emergencies with this Band-Aid approach. There must be investments of time and funding to stabilize the foundation of healthcare throughout this country. States managing their healthcare has led to a piecemeal approach and a federally guided system is key to providing equitable healthcare to all and addressing infrastructural issues.

URGENT NEED FOR INVESTMENT

The public healthcare system in India is chronically unfunded. The latest available data before the pandemic showed India was spending about $73 per person annually on healthcare while the United States was spending $11582 per person. US healthcare spending alone is $4.1 trillion per year which is higher than the entire Indian GDP of $2.9 trillion. India currently spends about 1% of GDP on health among the lowest for any major economy.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman‚Äôs proposal to increase healthcare spending to 2.2 trillion Indian rupees ($30.2 billion) to help improve public health systems and fund a colossal vaccination drive to immunize 1.3 billion people is a good start but merely a drop in the bucket for what is needed for structural reform.

STATUS OF RURAL PUBLIC HEALTHCARE

To understand how Indian healthcare can be better prepared to manage the third wave of Covid-19 one must understand the historical problems faced by the Indian healthcare system especially in rural India. Under India‚Äôs decentralized healthcare delivery approach the states are primarily responsible for organizing health services. Because of severe shortages of staff and supplies at government facilities many households seek care from private providers and pay out-of-pocket.

The Constitution of India obliges the government to ensure the ‚Äúright to health‚Äù for all. Each state is required to provide free universal access to healthcare services. However healthcare in India has been chronically underfunded. Systemic barriers to access include long wait times in hospitals the perceived low quality of public health services and substantial workforce and infrastructure shortfalls.

Reports continue to emerge of sub-optimal functionality of several PHCs in villages. Most of these reports reflect more significant issues including workforce shortages absenteeism and poor infrastructure leading to a more inferior quality of care.

Controlling Covid-19 often starts with early detection and management. Community-based management of this pandemic is necessary to reduce the burden on the tertiary health facilities. Yet the ability of the primary healthcare system to do this is limited at best and non-existent at worst. The result is individuals flooding cities and overwhelming a fragile system with limited resources available including oxygen.

Systemic barriers to access include long wait times a perception of low quality of public health services and the shortfalls of both workforce and infrastructure. Changing this will require the political will to invest in the Indian people through technology building relationships and increasing the number of doctors nurses and staff at all levels of the system. The question is how to build a workforce to meet the needs of the Indian people both in the rural and urban areas of the country mainly when there are shortages of people facilities equipment and more.

NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTHCARE CIVIL SERVANTS

Government hospitals are currently managed by doctors promoted based on their seniority and not based on their training in hospital management while professional hospital managers manage the private hospitals. Managing a public health system for the largest population in the world is not an easy task even for the best doctor with decades of experience in patient care.

Indian civil services select and train senior bureaucrats who lead the Indian government. India currently has several IAS and IFS officers with MBBS training. I propose the Government of India create an Indian Health Service (IHS) Branch. India will need 742 ‚ÄúIHS‚Äù officers one per district who are ranked equal to the IAS officers to coordinate the public health system of the district. By creating a civil service branch to manage healthcare centres and increasing medical and nursing colleges to one per district a large workforce could be made available to staff these facilities adequately.

Work in rural areas could also be mandated allowing for communities and villages to receive quality care. For instance part of a doctor‚Äôs training could include a year or more service in a rural village working in a primary care centre. Other options include incentives to reduce educational costs in exchange for time served in a primary healthcare centre.

TELEMEDICINE AND SMART PHCS

With the crisis pushing us to innovate investing up to 5% of India‚Äôs total gross domestic product could be vital in building a telemedicine-capable primary health centre or sub-centre in every Indian village. Smart PHCs could be managed by collaboration with charitable institutions or NGOs. India will also need to increase technology and healthcare educational opportunities for individuals looking for a healthcare career. Creating a medical college/district hospital in every district linked by a telemedicine network for referrals and specialty consults to the smart PHC or a sub-centre in every village will be vital to providing state-of-the-art healthcare access to rural India.

THE WAY FORWARD

With one of the largest populations in the world India could lead the world in providing quality healthcare to all its citizens. All the pieces are there from technology to manufacturing. Implementing these changes will take Investment and planning but it is not out of reach. Multiple scientific advances in the 21st century have given us a lifeline in nature‚Äôs arms race. The world however remains in turmoil over SARS-CoV-2 which is continuing to plague even our largest economies with India being no exception.

The biggest democracy in the world needs urgent investment in the health of all its citizens and reform the public healthcare system.

El auge exponencial en Miami ayuda a explicar el porqu√©,"Casas que duran apenas minutos en el mercado colas de interesados para poder ver una propiedad y viviendas por las que ofrecen miles de d√≥lares m√°s de lo que hab√≠an pedido sus due√±os en ocasiones con el dinero en efectivo sobre la mesa. Algunas ciudades de Estados Unidos viven un nuevo boom en el mercado del real estate... y en Miami ha sido ""10x"".

A nivel nacional a√±os de un lento crecimiento en los inventarios de propiedades disponibles y tasas de inter√©s hist√≥ricamente bajas ‚Äîdebido al inesperado golpe econ√≥mico de la pandemia‚Äî ayudan a explicar la escasez de viviendas en venta y la fuerte demanda por comprarlas.

En Miami se han sumado otros factores a la ecuaci√≥n como por ejemplo personas que se han mudado a Florida por sus impuestos m√°s bajos y porque la pandemia del covid-19 les permiti√≥ trabajar de forma remota explic√≥ a Univision Noticias Alexis Guini corredor de bienes ra√≠ces basado en esa ciudad del sur de Florida.

""En 10 a√±os que llevo trabajando en la industria es la primera vez que veo algo as√≠"" agreg√≥. ""Las propiedades est√°n volando obviamente las propiedades que tienen un muy buen retorno para inversi√≥n vuelan rapid√≠simo y vuelan con efectivo"".

El auge abunda se observ√≥ en los primeros meses de la pandemia con la mayor b√∫squeda de las propiedades 'single-home' o viviendas independientes construidas en terreno propio.

""La gente empez√≥ a buscar porque ten√≠a que trabajar desde la casa necesitaba espacio y necesitaba moverse. Familias que ten√≠an quiz√°s dos ni√±os y una propiedad de dos cuartos ahora ten√≠an que trabajar desde la casa m√°s tener a los dos ni√±os en ella. El tema de las propiedades 'single-family' se empez√≥ a mover mucho y empez√≥ a haber escasez"" dijo.



Hubo una especie de tormenta perfecta de personas llegando a Miami desde otros estados y propietarios que decidieron sacar temporalmente sus viviendas del mercado porque tem√≠an mostrarlas y que alguien llevara el coronavirus a sus casas.

Los esfuerzos de vacunaci√≥n y la ca√≠da de los casos de covid-19 han aliviado recientemente esa escasez de casas pero la demanda sigue sin ""concordar"" con los inventarios disponibles cont√≥ Guini.

Ventas que crecen a un ritmo de tres d√≠gitos

La demanda en una ciudad como Miami ‚Äîque ya ten√≠a un contexto intenso en su mercado inmobiliario‚Äî ha sido brutal en los √∫ltimos meses. Las ventas en ese sector alcanzaron un crecimiento r√©cord de tres d√≠gitos en mayo de acuerdo con cifras de la Miami Association of Realtors que mostraron en el siguiente gr√°fico.



Y en un efecto domin√≥ el boom en las ventas ha arrastrado los precios al alza.

El precio promedio de las viviendas 'single-family' hab√≠a subido sostenidamente por casi una d√©cada en el condado de Miami-Dade de acuerdo con cifras de la Miami Association of Realtors. Pero en mayo pasado se dispar√≥ un 33.1% frente al mismo mes del a√±o previo. Ahora una casa 'single-family' se empina hacia el medio mill√≥n de d√≥lares.

Tanto personas que buscan casas para vivirlas o como inversi√≥n est√°n colocando el dinero constante y sonante sobre la mesa muchas veces ofreciendo m√°s de lo que pidieron los vendedores.

El resultado de eso es que se est√° saltando un paso clave en la compra y venta de propiedades: la contingencia de tasaci√≥n o la cl√°usula que permite a un comprador desistir de un contrato de compra si la propiedad que le interesa es valorada con un precio inferior al que ofreci√≥.

""¬øQu√© significa eso? Que si el banco te dice que te va a financiar $100000 aunque est√©s bajo contrato en $120000 el banco no te va a dar $120000 te va a dar lo que considere de acuerdo a la tasaci√≥n que hizo y los vendedores dicen 'yo lo pongo a la venta pero no me importa lo que diga el banco'"" explic√≥ Guini.

Las consecuencias para las personas de bajos recursos

Ese escenario puede afectar a quienes tenga un presupuesto ajustado para comprar una vivienda tanto para poner un pie inicial como el pr√©stamo que pueden obtener en un banco para adquirirla.

""El √∫nico problema es que mucha gente no est√° aceptando un appraisal (tasaci√≥n) entonces las personas de bajos recursos no tienen esa facilidad financiera para poner los $10000 que el banco no le financia sobre la mesa. La recomendaci√≥n ser√≠a seguir ahorrando y buscar la oportunidad en la que uno no tenga que sacar de sus ahorros o de sus reservas para sacar esa diferencia"" consider√≥ Guini.

Tendr√≠an que continuar arrendando lo que a su vez elevar√≠a m√°s los precios de las rentas.

Pasado un tiempo la diferencia entre los precios a los que se est√°n vendiendo las propiedades y las tasaciones deber√≠a comenzar a achicarse dijo Guini. Tambi√©n vislumbr√≥ un 'alivio' gradual en la escasez de casas y departamentos en venta especialmente cuando algunos se vean alentados a venderlos al ver los fuertes precios a los que han sido adquiridas las propiedades cercanas a las de ellos.

""Si encuentras la propiedad ahora y te cierran los n√∫meros (en tu presupuesto) es momento de comprar porque uno hace la buena transacci√≥n cuando compra la propiedad no cuando le vende. La recomendaci√≥n ser√≠a no volverse loco y pagar mucho m√°s de lo que la propiedad vale sino pagar lo que la propiedad vale y esperar la oportunidad indicada"" agreg√≥.



Algunos desarrolladores de proyectos ‚Äîo 'developers'‚Äî tambi√©n comenzar√≠an a acelerar pronto sus proyectos. ‚ÄúEso va a hacer que se abran tambi√©n las opciones de compra no solo en propiedades antiguas sino en propiedades nuevas‚Äù afirm√≥ el corredor.

Las zona metropolitana conformada por Miami Fort Lauderdale y Palm Beach es seg√∫n un informe reciente encomendado por el grupo National Association of Realtors la quinta que m√°s sufre una escasez de nuevas viviendas en todo el pa√≠s con una brecha de 67600 unidades. Las otras tres √°reas metropolitanas afectadas por la misma raz√≥n est√°n en California y la restante en Michigan.

Ese mismo informe mostr√≥ que a nivel nacional los inventarios de viviendas han crecido apenas un 0.7% en la pasada d√©cada y que se deben construir 5.5 millones de unidades en los siguientes 10 a√±os para suavizar la escasez y que los precios no sigan subiendo a un ritmo tan acelerado.

""El ritmo significativamente m√°s r√°pido del alza de los precios de las casas ha significado que muchas familias no puedan sufragar los pagos mensuales necesarios para comprar una casa que cuesta el precio promedio"" dijo el reporte. ""El incremento en los hogares con ingresos ajustados registrado de 2001 a 2019 fue significativamenye mayor entre las minor√≠as: el mayor incremento ocurri√≥ entre los hogares hispanos con un 81.4%"" precis√≥.

Adem√°s seg√∫n la Asociaci√≥n Internacional de Publicidad en Punto de Venta (POPAI) el 76% de las decisiones de compra se toman impulsivamente en el punto de venta relacion√°ndolo a la posibilidad de tocar sentir y probar el producto como el principal motivo para comprar en la tienda f√≠sica.

En este sentido las marcas aprovechan las estrategias de music branding ya que el 73% de las personas piensa que el uso de la m√∫sica mejora la imagen de marca mientras que el 62% afirma que una melod√≠a les hace sentirse m√°s comprometidos con una empresa seg√∫n la encuesta realizada por Havas Group.

Incrementar las ventas gracias a una adecuada m√∫sica ambiente

De la misma manera que el orden de los pasillos o la colocaci√≥n de los productos tienen una organizaci√≥n muy estudiada para incrementar las ventas una buena elecci√≥n musical consigue el mismo efecto. Dependiendo de la elecci√≥n de la pieza musical se ve un impacto en la concentraci√≥n del consumidor el ritmo de trabajo o las ventas en un comercio. Las empresas invierten muchos recursos en potenciar la experiencia que ofrecen a los clientes e intentan diferenciarse de la competencia y tener una personalidad de marca buscando siempre aumentar las ventas.

‚ÄúCada vez m√°s se cuidan los detalles en los establecimientos pero la m√∫sica no recibe la misma atenci√≥n. Una mala elecci√≥n musical puede alterar negativamente la experiencia de la misma manera que si creas un ambiente acogedor invitas a consumir m√°s al cliente‚Äù revelan fuentes de Deusto Formaci√≥n centro de formaci√≥n continua online especializado en programas formativos de empresariales y nuevas tecnolog√≠as: ‚ÄúHay veces que el comercio necesita agilizar al cliente para aumentar el n√∫mero de ventas y en otros momentos es necesario crear un ambiente tranquilo y agradable para generar una experiencia que invite al cliente a consumir m√°s‚Äù. Y esto es precisamente uno de los puntos clave del Curso Superior de Neuromarketing.

Neuromarketing para entender el proceso de toma de decisiones del consumidor

Esta relaci√≥n entre la m√∫sica y el incremento de ventas es el objetivo del neuromarketing esta disciplina que une el Marketing y la Neurociencia. Es imprescindible estudiar el proceso de toma de decisiones con el objetivo de descubrir c√≥mo el cerebro humano reacciona ante los est√≠mulos de compra tanto para ayudar al vendedor como al comprador.

‚ÄúNo hay evoluci√≥n sin innovaci√≥n. Son muy pocas las organizaciones que aplican t√©cnicas de Neuromarketing en la definici√≥n de su estrategia. Formarse en Neuromarketing es un requisito diferenciador que facilita el acceso a las verdaderas motivaciones de los consumidores y los sesgos cognitivos que los llevan a tomar decisiones‚Äù a√±aden fuentes de Deusto Formaci√≥n con relaci√≥n al curso de Neuromarketing que imparten a distancia.

No he's surely not the first nor the last.

He's also not the first nor the last to have had a similar contretemps with any of the remaining phone carriers.

I feel however that Kevin's solution to his customer service problem was markedly more ingenious than most could create.

Kevin is a long-time friend. A highly intelligent deeply nerdy and once in a while gregariously opinionated friend.

He was going on vacation and he'd heard that AT&T's signal was poor at his remote east coast destination. He needed to ensure he had Wi-Fi as he had an important meeting with extremely celebrated people. So he bought the most advanced Verizon jetpack and disappeared on his travels.

Sadly the jetpack failed to function just before his big meeting started. But Kevin tried to be sanguine.

On his return he received an email from Verizon. It told him to register for My Verizon in order to view his bills. It said in order to enjoy paper-free billing he must be registered.

""Registration is quick and easy"" said the email. But when he clicked on ""Sign up now"" nothing happened.

Let's have Kevin take up the story: ""So I called Verizon customer service and I couldn't talk to anyone because I didn't have a Verizon phone account.""

It's likely that his Jetpack came with a phone number but Kevin had been unaware.

""I thought all I would need was my social security number my credit card address and all that"" he told me.

He was therefore a touch frustrated.

""So I tried using chat"" he said. ""And I got through five people who didn't seem helpful.""

""Why didn't they seem helpful?"" I asked.

""They said I needed the account number and location number"" he explained. ""That's when I explained I didn't have them and repeated that I went to them trying to register my damn device.""

To be clear Kevin may have been at some fault here and knows it. He hadn't been aware enough to note the phone number attached to the Jetpack. You'd think though offering a few personal details would have got the process rolling.

The chatline he said went through sales and had only one recommendation -- to call customer service. So back there went Kevin.

It's currently true that many companies have long customer service wait times and often blame COVID-19 for this. Rather than say a lack of customer service employees.

When Kevin called customer service he said he was on hold for more than an hour.

That's when he had an idea. As it turned out it was the sort of clever idea that companies hope too many people don't have.

""I called collections"" he told me.

""You did what?""

""Collections was a lot more responsive than customer service"" he said. ""I went to them and even though I wasn't in collection I knew someone would answer the phone.""

""How could you be so sure?"" I wondered.

""They have people standing by to get money"" he explained quite pleased with himself.

""But didn't they send you straight back to customer service?""

""No they were all too happy to register my device"" said Kevin. ""They were just disappointed that the money wasn't in arrears.""

There's a certain poetry to the notion that the people who actually gave Kevin fine customer service were the same people who are there to try and get money out of him if ever he was slow to pay.

Could it be that they work in collections because they have a surfeit of charm? And how was it that collections could register his device when the sales people on the chatline couldn't?

Of course this could have happened with any carrier and with any number of other service companies. This just happened to be Verizon.

Then again over the last year I've heard from quite a few current and former Verizon customer service employees who aren't entirely happy with the way things are going at the company. Those who work in stores told me they think Verizon is trying to move all customer service online. I wonder how that'll go.

Ultimately I marvel at Kevin's instinct that if customer service is slow -- or even entirely AWOL -- there's always collections who'll pick up the phone.

I wonder if the collections staff get a bonus for performing customer service duties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtbnkuY29tL25ld3MvdmVyaXpvbi10cmlhdGhsb24tcmV0dXJucy10by1ueWMtdHVybnMtaW50by1kdWF0aGxvbi1hZnRlci1oZWF2eS1yYWluZmFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon NYC Triathlon returns after long hiatus with 3000 participants and a lot of running,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news updates and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

After more than a year of big sporting events facing cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Verizon NYC Triathlon was back on track on Sunday morning.

The renowned test of endurance returned on July 11 for the first time since 2018 and saw more than 2000 triathletes put through their paces ‚Äî but not everything went according to plan.

The athletic extravaganza was originally set to begin with a swim in the Hudson River off West 81st Street but due to continuous heavy rainfall bacteria levels in the waterway rose to nine times higher than safety precautions would allow. Instead the now two-event competition began with a foot race first with the male professionals followed closely by the female professionals and then the amateurs who sped away two at a time.

With athletes advised to ditch their swimsuits and arrive in run gear the event was altered into a duathlon which consisted of a one-mile sprint followed by a 24.8-mile bike ride and then a second run over a 10K course.

Along the way. supporters lined the Central Park West roadways to cheer on athletes with signs and bells as they made the grueling trek toward the finish line located at the Naumburg Bandshell. It took male pro Jason West one hour and 35 minutes to cross the finish line in first place and female pro Amy Sloan one hour and 48 minutes both of whom held up the finish line banner triumphantly.

‚ÄúI am exhausted it was pretty tough out there‚Äù Sloan told amNewYork Metro after grabbing a bottle of water. ‚ÄúThe crowd was incredible! I didn‚Äôt expect to see so many people because of COVID but the crowd really just took me home.‚Äù

While Sloan fellow competitors and spectators were happy to see the NYC Triathlon back putting the pedal to the metal; others were disgruntled regarding the last-minute announcement cancelling the swimming portion of the event pivoting the experience to a duathlon.

According to Verizon NYC Triathlon organizers the Hudson River‚Äôs lab results were given to them extremely late in the day while they awaited health and safety guidance from officials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndreXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTEvbGV4aW5ndG9uLWJhc2VkLWxhbmRzY2FwaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktdXNlcy1uZXctdGVjaC1yZWNvdmVyLXN0b2xlbi10cnVja3Mv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2t5dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMS9sZXhpbmd0b24tYmFzZWQtbGFuZHNjYXBpbmctY29tcGFueS11c2VzLW5ldy10ZWNoLXJlY292ZXItc3RvbGVuLXRydWNrcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lexington-based landscaping company uses new tech to recover stolen trucks,"LEXINGTON Ky. (WKYT) - A Lexington-based landscaping company helped track down thieves who took an entire fleet of trucks from one of its Kentucky facilities.

The thefts happened at the end of 2020.

‚ÄúIt puts you in a bind to call your customer and say ‚ÄòI know we have a Monday schedule but we‚Äôre not gonna be able to be there until Thursday.‚Äô‚Äù said Diamond Landscapes Owner Chris Trower.

Trower said someone had welded through the hinges of the gate at the company‚Äôs Louisville facility.

10 trucks were stolen from the facility in the middle of the night. Luckily all of those trucks had some new technology in them to help track them down.

‚ÄúThe thieves open the hood noticed there was a GPS and they ripped those out‚Äù said Trower. ‚ÄúBut the Verizon Connect is connected in a different way that‚Äôs a lot more secure so our mechanics had left that there just as a decoy. And they had no idea that we were tracking every one of the trucks.‚Äù

Trower used the Verizon app to help police locate and recover all ten vehicles in just a few hours.

‚ÄúIt was so interesting because the cops were like ‚Äòyou have GPS and it‚Äôs very accurate down to four feet or six feet or something like that.‚Äô‚Äù he said.

Trower said all four suspects were arrested. They‚Äôre all facing charges.

After the incident Trower said he increased security at all of his facilities to keep operations moving along this summer.

A new year is what it felt like for the philanthropic organizations that had been on hiatus for the past year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

And that is how it has felt to me.

A year has gone by since I‚Äôve reported on the local nonprofit experiences. Like the party-goers we‚Äôre excited and enthusiastic to be back ‚Äî to highlight these important charity events. And what a way to return with a Big Bang!

Major domo John Morris who created the spectacular ‚ÄúBig Bang on the Bay‚Äù a decade ago announced this year‚Äôs event ‚Äî on July 3 instead of the actual holiday ‚Äî was a sell out weeks ago with more than 2000 attendees. It was the largest crowd since the event‚Äôs inception. It may have been the most enthusiastic crowd yet as guests mingled and enjoyed seeing so many friends again after months apart.

Heather Moro Children Today board member estimated the amount raised to be $140000. That money she said will help support not only Children Today but the Autism Partnership Foundation Ground Education the ASK Foundation and the Press Telegram‚Äôs recently concluded Send a Kid to Camp campaign.

She also thanked the event‚Äôs major sponsors including Curtin Maritime F&M Bank Free Conference Call City National Bank UPS Port of Long Beach Virgin Orbit Synergy Oil & Gas LLC Anchors Away Long Beach Convention & Visitors Bureau and the three local yacht clubs Long Beach Alamitos Bay and Seal Beach.

The evening began as a block party with a delicious barbecue dinner prepared by Naples Rib Co. The day‚Äôs events included a sailing regatta; prayer by Bruce McCrae; an American flag flyover Zack Gianformaggio singing the national anthem and an appearance by a U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue boat.

Dennis Lord arranged for a spectacular air show as he has done for all prior Big Bang events. The air show featured Powered Para Gliders two pilots performing a duet in 1943 and 1969 planes and a Tiger Squadron flying in a ‚ÄúMissing Man‚Äù formation to honor Tory Carlon 44 a Los Angeles County Fire Department engineer who was fatally shot by a fellow firefighter on June first at Station No. 81 in Agua Dulce. As the sun grew dim there was lively dancing to the music of DJ Ron.

The excitement overflowed amid the spectacular fireworks.

It was truly a night to remember.

Committee of 300

The Committee of 300 held its annual kickoff party late last month celebrating the forthcoming 46th Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach and their successful membership drive at Jade restaurant. The 250 attendees were thrilled that the race will happen this year; the three-day event which draws thousands from around the region to downtown Long Beach is set for Sept. 24 to 26. Limited to 300 members thus the name the Committee of 300 is the hospitality arm of the race. They help with bleacher seating and other duties.

Ten gorgeous automobiles provided by the Sultan Car Club greeted the guests.

‚ÄúThe car club is really supportive of the C-300‚Äù said Sultan President Brandon Riddle. ‚ÄúThey bring cars to the Paddock Club for display during the race and help in any way possible.‚Äù

Trish and Bunn provided the entertainment and music for dancing.

The guest of honor was Grand Prix CEO Jim Michaelian who shared his pleasure that the race will happen after the coronavirus pandemic canceled last‚Äôs years. And because the race moved from its traditional April schedule to September Long Beach will be the final venue for the IndyCar Series season Michaelian said.

‚ÄúThis will guarantee a lot of anticipation and excitement for the racing community‚Äù he added.

Per Entertainment Weekly DiCaprio once got into a fight over Elizabeth Berkley who starred as Jessie Spano in the '80s and '90s sitcom ""Saved by the Bell.""

According to the New York Post ""Porky's"" star Roger Wilson sued DiCaprio in May 2003 for $45 million after ""The Revenant"" actor ordered his ""Pussy Posse"" to attack him at a nightclub in 1998 over Wilson's then-girlfriend Berkley. DiCaprio allegedly hit on Berkley after meeting her at the premiere for his movie ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and asked his then-publicist Karen Tenzer to invite her out for drinks without Wilson per Vulture. Berkeley declined and told Tenzer and DiCaprio to stop calling her.

Upon hearing about Berkeley's troubles Wilson then confronted DiCaprio and his posse at a nightclub in Manhattan during which the argument got heated and moved outside and DiCaprio reportedly instructed his friends to ""kick his a**.""

WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9zZWNvbmQtb3BpbmlvbnMvOTM1MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Walmart's Low-Price Insulin Is a Band-Aid on a Broken System,"Walmart just announced a new low-priced insulin for patients with diabetes.

Is this good news?

Yes for some patients. Walmart already offers an older formulation of human insulin ReliOn Novolin for $25 per vial. Adding a low-cost rapid-acting analog insulin -- ReliOn Novolog -- to the Walmart ReliOn brand should help patients who are better treated with this modern analog insulin and who would otherwise be paying the full list price.

Yet this lower cost option is not enough to fully address the issue of insulin affordability and it highlights the systemic problems we face in the U.S. regarding the high costs of needed prescription drugs.

This is still too high a price for a needed drug. While Walmart's ReliOn Novolog is priced at a significant savings off the list price -- $73 per 10 mL vial compared to $289 for branded NovoLog -- this price is still high compared to the rest of the world. It is many times higher than the $6 to $13 per vial consumers pay for rapid-acting analog insulin in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries outside the U.S. It is also significantly higher than the $6 to $7 per 10 mL vial studies have estimated it costs to manufacture this type of insulin and bring it to market. A typical patient using two vials of rapid-acting insulin per month will spend $1749 per year for Walmart's ReliOn Novolog. While much less than the $6945 full list price this is still a very high price for an essential drug.

Comprehensive insulin-dependent diabetes treatment is still unaffordable for many. Access to insulin can be a matter of survival for many patients. Yet rapid-acting analog insulin such as Walmart's ReliOn Novolog is only one component of an insulin replacement therapy regimen. Most people who use a rapid-acting analog insulin need to pair it with a long-acting analog formulation which is not yet included under Walmart's ReliOn brand. Studies have also shown that out-of-pocket spending on the supplies required for delivering insulin and monitoring blood sugar can be equal to or even higher than the costs of the drug itself. Thus even with this new option total medical costs for patients needing to manage their insulin-dependent diabetes remains unaffordable.

This is not a replacement for better health insurance. The purpose of health insurance is to protect people from the high costs of healthcare services when they need them. Yet the U.S. system does not always ensure that all Americans have the access they require to these types of drugs. Being uninsured or facing high co-pays deductibles and co-insurance while insured creates barriers to access. Walmart is offering a stop-gap solution but these broader coverage challenges remain unaddressed.

We need market and policy-based strategies to improve prescription drug access and affordability. Pharmaceutical companies claim they need to fund innovation to justify the high prices of their drugs. Yet a government report released Thursday exposed that the company that makes brand Novolog and its competitor spent more in stock buy backs and dividend payments than on research and development in each of the past five years. The real cause of high prices among these drugs is simply pharmaceutical company greed.

What this country needs are systematic reforms that promote both increased health insurance coverage and benefit generosity and diminish the power of pharmaceutical companies to charge any price the market will bear without regard to the financial stability of American families. There are a range of strategies for making insulin affordable for patients and payer. These include policies that increase competition among pharmaceutical manufacturers such as patent reform and payment policies that promote biosimilar use. But these policies are not enough; indeed there is competition in the insulin market today and yet prices remain too high. What we need is to allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices on behalf of all Americans and ensure that the resultant savings benefit patients currently struggling to afford needed medical care.

Guaranteeing affordable and equitable access to all Americans who need rapid acting insulin and other needed medical care should not be just a corporate initiative by one pharmacy but a priority policy of the White House and the U.S. Congress.

A 17-year-old Walmart worker is charged with aggravated battery for allegedly assaulting an elderly customer at the Mount Pleasant store on July 7.

The Mount Pleasant Police Department identified the 17-year-old as Jazareia Velasquez. Due to her age police said she can be charged as an adult and was jailed for disorderly conduct in addition to battery after the incident.

When police arrived at the Walmart they spoke to the 70-year-old victim. The victim said she asked to speak with a manager after an interaction with an employee since determined to be Velasquez.

A criminal complaint states that after speaking to the manager the victim sought out Velasquez in the store in an attempt to get her name. When she found Velasquez the complaint states she didn't have a visible name tag so the victim took out her phone to try to take a picture and send it to Walmart corporate.

The victim said while she was trying to take the picture Velasquez tried to grab the phone and said ""don't take my picture."" The victim said Velasquez then punched her in the head multiple times according to the complaint. The assault continued until another employee pilled Velasquez off the victim.

Officers noted a lump forming on the victim's head as well as bruising. Officers viewed surveillance which showed the victim holding up her phone as if to take a picture. Velasquez was then seen moving quickly toward the victim raising a fist and striking the victim multiple times.

Also seen on surveillance according to the complaint was the victim raising an umbrella in an attempt to defend herself before losing her balance and then nearly falling to the floor as Velasquez continued to strike her.

Velasquez and the victim both indicated the incident began over an initial verbal exchange according to a police news release.

A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for July 15.

MOUNT PLEASANT Wis. -- The elderly woman who police say was repeatedly punched by a 17-year-old Walmart employee on Wednesday July 7 is speaking out about the incident saying this situation could have been avoided.

""It has been quite a journey and why anyone would do that? I don't know. And why no one helped is even more especially in a Walmart store"" said P.K. Shader the victim.

The Mount Pleasant Police Department responded to the store on Oakes Road and Durand Avenue around 7:06 p.m. for reports of a 70-year-old woman who was punched multiple times in the head by a cashier WDJT reported.

Police say Shader a resident of Racine County sustained injuries to the head and face but did not require immediate medical attention. Shader still has bruising in her face and says this kind of behavior from employees is unacceptable.

Both the employee and Shader indicated that the incident arose over a verbal argument. According to the criminal complaint Shader asked to speak to a manager after having negative interaction with the employee Jazareia Velasquez.

""The manager was right there watching the interaction. She (Velasquez) left and I looked at the manager and I said do you let her talk to all your customers like that? I didn't get a reply. As I was leaving I thought I really want to know what her name is because I want to send it to corporate"" said Shader.

Shader said she didn't see her name tag and attempted to take a picture of Velazquez to report her.

""She went crazy she flew and she punched me fist right here (in the face) over and over again"" said Shader.

Velasquez of Racine was arrested and later charged with aggravated battery to an elderly person and disorderly conduct.

Shader says what took her by surprise the most is the lack of people stepping in to help her at the time and employees apparently knowing of Velazquez's temperament.

""What if it was your grandmother what if it was your mother? The managers knew she was a loose cannon. The first manager said nothing. The second one told me. So why did they keep an employee like that? That's a bigger problem than not having security"" said Shader.

As she recovers Shader wants people to know that if they ever see an incident like this break out to step in and help in whatever way you can.

""I just want to tell people pull out your phone give somebody a break. No one's asking you to dive in and be hurt but pull out your phone and document it and yell and call the police"" said Shader who plans on filing a restraining order against Velasquez.

""I'm never walking into Walmart again that's for sure but we shouldn't have to be afraid. If it was my business and I had an employee treating the customer like that I would hope to god someone would tell me because that's crazy"" said Shader.

Shader says she and her attorney are exploring options to send a message so this never happens to anyone again. Shader adds that she won't live in fear from this incident.

""The biggest part of this is not allowing myself to be afraid. I refuse I refuse to be afraid"" said Shader.

Walmart released the following statement on the incident:

""We want all of our customers to have a pleasant shopping experience in our stores. The associate involved has been suspended and we continue to assist law enforcement in the ongoing investigation.""

When the cop in question showed -- who has since been ID'd as Rory Spain -- he tried separating the quarreling parties ... and ended up restraining the lady he ultimately punched Tyreana Edmonds with handcuffs. As he attempted to lead her away things escalated.

In the video you see Edmonds apparently try and bite Officer Spain's arm ... after which he cocks his arm back with his fist balled up and unloads on the front of her neck. The punch lands and Edmonds is tossed back ... falling hard to the ground after absorbing the blow.

Hosted by Architects David Lee and Marina Bourderonnet it features different creative professionals in unscripted conversations that allow for thoughtful takes and personal discussions.

A variety of subjects are covered with honesty and humor: some episodes are interviews while others are tips for fellow designers reviews of buildings and other projects or casual explorations of everyday life and design. The Second Studio is also available on iTunes Spotify and YouTube.

This week David and Marina are joined by Mike Ross the Architectural Design Studio Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering to discuss the design and construction of theme parks and theme park buildings the Disney design process technology's impact on how they build creating theme parks in other countries and much more.

Mike holds a Bachelor of Design in Architecture and a Master of Architecture from the University of Florida. With over 30 years of experience Mike has had important roles in numerous projects which include: Overall Theme Park Project Architect & Director Shanghai Disneyland; Senior Land Project Architect Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom; Land Project Architect & Design Manager Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge.

Highlights & Timestamps

Mike discusses how he first became interested in architecture and working at Walt Disney Imagineering.(00:00)

The complexities of the jobs is absolutely amazing. We like to say that we take the most complex thing on the outside like a hospital with all the systems and all the electrical we take a building like that then we run a roller coaster through it. The nature of the work was just so unbelievably exciting and the people I‚Äôm working with day in and day out these are super smart cutting-edge rocket-science-type people. Once I got into it I never had any desire to do anything else. (01:40)

Mike explains what the Walt Disney Imagineering department is and how it works and recalls one his first projects The Tower of Terror.(06:42)

[During the design of the Tower of Terror] we reached out to an elevator company and gave them the pitch and they were like ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way. There‚Äôs no way! You guys are describing this crazy rickety elevator that falls faster than if you jumped out of a building so it‚Äôs actually being pulled down and then pulled up. Everything that we‚Äôve tried not to do in the design of elevators for the last 100 years you guys want us to do. Thank you but no thank you!‚Äù I mean the size of the motors that we were talking about were huge. the only elevator motors of the size that we were going to need for this attraction were use in diamond mines in South Africa that go down a mile-and-a-half to mine diamonds. (13:40)

Mike discusses how immersive story-telling is the most important part of what he does and Walt Disney‚Äôs four principles for immersive story-telling.(17:22)

Mike talks about how theme park structures are designed to meet various building codes and working with building department officials.(25:17)

We engage with the building departments around the world really early. Once we‚Äôre kind of conceptually at the point where we know the project has legs and it‚Äôs going to take off we bring the building officials in right away and start to have initial conversations with them. [‚Ä¶] When you go into Hong Kong and Shanghai these are new notions for those building officials they‚Äôve never run into these sorts of needs before. They haven‚Äôt put roller coasters through buildings. So we‚Äôve actually partnered with them and brought building officials from those jurisdictions to the US and allowed them to talk with building from California form Florida. (27:36)

Mike talks about working on Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge and designing the two identical ‚Äòlands‚Äô to meet the more stringent building codes of the Florida and California.(31:17)

Mike discusses the heavy research they do to inform the designs of their structures.(37:26)

Mike discusses the construction materials and details of their more sculptural structures.(39:35)

One of our biggest quivers in our thematic package is plaster themed plaster. We have a number of facility art directors who are absolute geniuses shown it comes to making plater look like just about any material you can think of. [‚Ä¶] We developed a methodology for building rock work we call it chips and tabs. [‚Ä¶ for example] This shape probably starts as a foam carve in our model shop. We build that up to a 1/2‚Äù scale and then we will scan that foam carving physical model in high-definition detail bring that shape into a software package and do an offset for the thickness of plaster that the Art Directors think we need. And then we will set a lathe plane and rebar plane and whatever shape you get as you cut through that 3d model it basically sends out individual slices at 6‚Äù or 8‚Äù on center and sends that profile to rebar bending machine that will automatically take a straight rebar bend it to the shape necessary tag it with an RFID tag and then bundle it. (40:12)

Mike talks about technology how has changed their process and construction techniques and how their teams are formed.(44:37)

Mike discusses the challenge of designing theme parks and structures for different cultures and creating Shanghai Disneyland.(56:45)

How much Western cuisine is the population [in Shanghai] going to expect? Are they expecting hamburgers and French fries or are they expecting dimsum? It‚Äôs a really interesting conundrum. We have market research teams to survey the public and we try to gain as much information as we can but you kind of never really know for sure until you get the park open. Oddly enough one of the things that was the most popular food in the entire park was turkey legs! There was a little turkey leg hut that was probably a couple hundred square feet it was really meant to be fast food [stand] but people were waiting in line for like 3 hours to get turkey legs.‚Äù (57:33)

Mike talks about working Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge and using projection technologies in attractions.(01:19:51)

Tower of Terror is a complex attraction but it‚Äôs nothing compared to complexity of the two attractions that make up Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge. I mean one attraction has a free ranging vehicles that moves into an elevation shaft sits on to of an elevator platform that allows the vehicle to drop but not only is the vehicle sitting on a moving elevator platform it‚Äôs sitting on top of a motion simulator base that‚Äôs moving the vehicle as the vehicle is dropping. So you have three different ride systems coming together just to make up one scene in the attraction. It‚Äôs a level of technology that beyond anything that we‚Äôve tried recently at all. (01:23:15)

Mike summarizes the big difference between working as an Architect as Disney versus at conventional offices.(01:37:08)

Mike discusses the back of house architecture required for attractions. (01:39:45)

Here are the top 10 Disney and Disney-inspired must-dos this summer from where to get a real Dole Whip to the National Park where Walt and Lillian Disney honeymooned.

Dole Whip in the PNW

The Dole Whip has become synonymous with Disney Parks. The iconic pineapple soft serve is dairy-free (and vegan) yet totally creamy. But you don't have to venture to Anaheim or Orlando to get this frozen treat. Disney doesn't own the Dole Whip. It just has a license to serve it. And in the International District has the license too and the real Dole Whip. It's the exact same soft-serve formula as the parks. Even sweeter? It's $2 cheaper. Like Disneyland's The Tropical Hideaway can do Dole Whip floats. But what makes this Seattle spot unique compared to Disney Parks is the Hawaiin Frost and Dole Whip swirl. This hybrid coconut soft serve/shave ice concoction is only licensed in three places by the Dole Food Company and goPoke is one of them. The coconut-pineapple combination is the one Dole Whip to rule them all. Regular Dole Whips in the parks will never taste as good.

Ice Cream a la Downtown Disney



Seattle has another popular frozen treat found at Disneyland: Salt & Straw. The Portland ice cream company known for its unique flavors opened a location in Downtown Disney in 2018 and another location is opening in Disney Springs at Walt Disney World in 2022. But Seattleites don't have to wait or travel for these craft scoops. There are in Seattle one in Ballard and one in Capitol Hill as well as a third shop in Kirkland.

Monorail History 101



The monorail is the quintessential Disney transportation. The parks would feel so empty without these mid-mod trains zipping about. And so would Seattle Center. Not only does Seattle have its own monorail it has the OG monorail: Alweg. The German company pioneered the straddle-beam monorail and built the original monorail system at Disneyland in 1959. However Disneyland's monorail was a five-eighths scale version. For the Seattle World's Fair in 1962 the train was built to scale and it was also the nation's first full-scale monorail system.

Today Disneyland's monorail trains have been updated with a signature sleek cone nose. But you can still ride the original 1962 red and blue Alweg cars via the . There's no sleek nose. These train cars are more flat-faced like pugs. But there's something magical about riding in a piece of history and holding onto an original design that so many including Walt Disney believed to be the transportation of the future.

'UP' House IRL



Remember the house from ""UP"" that was surrounded by new developments and high rises? It's a real house ‚Äî and it's in Ballard. Many speculate the home in the Pixar film was based on the . And the resemblance is uncanny. As the story goes Macefield was offered one million dollars for her home but she refused. So a development was built around the home. Macefield died in 2008 but the now vacant home is still standing. It's common to see colorful balloons tied to the front fence by Disney fans who come to visit.

Disneyland and Disney World are great but Tokyo Disneyland is continuously praised for its design and unique merchandise. From the over-the-top mega Disney stores in downtown Tokyo to rare licensed characters that you won't find stateside Tokyo is a Disney collector's ultimate destination. And while vacation travel to Japan isn't possible just yet you can get a small fix at Daiso with its collection of Disney wares from stationery to rugs. Known as the Japanese dollar store Daiso shops in Tokyo are massive with floors and floors of IKEA-meets-kawaii designed products. There are  and although these US offerings aren't as big and flashy the stores are packed with tons of Disney stuff you won't find in the theme parks or US Disney stores. The Daiso store in the International District has a great selection of Disney kitchen items from sponges shaped like Mickey shorts to Winnie the Pooh honey jars.

There are even a couple of Mickey telephones in great condition as well as some mugs and merch from The Mickey Mouse Club. And Star Wars fans will enjoy the store's steep stairwell mural. The walls feature iconic characters and personalities from pop culture such as R2-D2.

Walt Disney Archives on Display



You can't talk about pop culture without running into a Disney brand or story fairly quickly and MoPOP's latest exhibit takes a deep dive into the art of costuming classic Disney films. "" "" is basically your chance to snoop through The Walt Disney Archives' most-prized costumes props and accessories. With 70 items on display it's a massive new attraction. Some items have been on display at Disney Parks in the past but others such as the original Mary Poppins costume rarely ever come out of high-security storage.

You can't go into a Disney Parks gift shop and not see a display of Pop! figures or a wall of Loungefly backpacks. The two Funko brands make the hottest collectibles in the Disney fan world and it all started in Everett Washington. Founder Mike Becker wanted to create a ""fun company"" and thus Funko. Funko is now known around the world for its pop-culture partnerships but the official headquarters are still in downtown Everett and . Even if you don't collect Disney Funko Pop! figures or

There's also a Pop! vignette for Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe with some hidden gems and surprise sounds.

Retracing Disney's Steps



Disney trivia buffs know that Walt Disney and Lillian Disney loved to travel and many original theme park attractions and designs were inspired by their adventures. But before Disneyland and even before Mickey Mouse Walt and Lillian went on their first big trip in July 1925: their honeymoon. And they chose to visit . Not much is known by the National Park Service about the Disneys' trip or what sights or trails the Disneys visited as this was before their celebrity status and fame. But if the couple visited in July they likely saw the beautiful wildflower meadows.

Some historian accounts suggest that the Disneys only as Walt Disney had a bad toothache and the Disneys headed to Seattle so that he could have the tooth pulled. According to Leonard Mosley's biography Disney's World Disney spent his entire visit to the Evergreen State ""with a scarf wrapped around his face."" And Lillian Disney describes it as Disney ""looking like a bear and just as grumpy as one.""

WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZW50aHVicy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2p1bC8xMC9uZXRoZXJyZWFsbS1kZXZlbG9wZXItc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rumor: Warner Bros. looking into selling off NetherRealm Studios and Lego game developers,"They may fall outside of the scope of the Discovery merger

The future of NetherRealm Studios remains a bit of a question mark following the recent merger announcement between Warner Media and Discovery though they may soon end up at a new home entirely.

A reported document connected to said acquisition alleges AT&T and Warner Bros. are interested in selling NetherRealm Studios and Lego game developer TT Games outside of the multi-billion-dollar deal.

Jez Cordon a Senior Editor for Windows Central said he had acquired the document on the latest Xbox Two podcast when talking about potential studio buyouts.

""This document I've got seems to suggest that among the studios [Warner Bros. / AT&T is] potentially looking to spin of are NeatherRealm and [Traveler's Tales]"" said Corden.

Interestingly he continues that other WB-owned developers like Rocksteady Studios Avalanche Software and Monolith Productions will be included in the Discovery merger.

The only reason stated in the alleged document came down to NetherRealm and TT Games not being ""in the scope"" of the studios staying with Warner Bros through the transition.

Cordon speculates the move may stem from the recent Mortal Kombat film not living up to WB's box office expectations so they're looking to focus more on multimedia slam dunks like Batman and Lord of the Rings.

If the rumor does end up ringing true then the makers of Mortal Kombat and Injustice may soon find themselves under new ownership.

Both Microsoft and Sony have been going in with large studio acquisitions as of late so a successful AAA fighting game team could be a sweet pick up for either PlayStation or Xbox first party though Corden says he hasn't heard any talk of either pursuing a deal.

This all comes just a week after NeatherRealm themselves revealed that Mortal Kombat 11 would be receiving no further DLC support and that the team had moved on to their next project.

Corden's information does seemingly line up a bit with what early reports on the Warner Media and Discovery merger reports suggested with only some of WB's gaming arm joining the new company while the rest will remain with AT&T.

It's not the first time we've heard of the tech giant looking to offload some of its video game division as well considering just last year they were reportedly shopping around offers worth around $4 billion before pulling them back off of the market ‚Äî perhaps to help seal the deal with the eventual Discovery merger.

The new company at the head of this $43 billion agreement will be called Warner Bros. Discovery which includes HBO DC Comics and CNN along with everything Discovery owns though no official mention has been made as to the fate of the gaming divisions.

Warner Bros. Discovery is scheduled to close the merger by mid-2022 so there is likely a lot of paperwork that needs to be signed before anyone moves anywhere at this point.

Since we can't see and verify these documents for ourselves this talk still remains in the realm of rumors so take it all with a healthy grain of salt.

NetherRealm's next project remains a secret though it is rumored to be a fighting game for Marvel Comics.

You can find the discussion surrounding the NRS and TT Games spin off below around the 45-minute mark.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS93Yi1nYW1lcy1zdHVkaW9zLXNvbGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Confirmed: Mortal Kombat and LEGO Star Wars devs aren't being sold,"Following the big Warner Bros Discovery merger this year a big concern was regarding the fate of the various WB Games studios ‚Äì which include Netherrealm (Mortal Kombat) Rocksteady (Suicide Squad Batman Arkham) TT Games (LEGO Star Wars) and Avalanche (Hogwarts Legacy). Rumours continue to spring up suggesting some would be sold but Warner Bros has now confirmed that won‚Äôt be the case ‚Äì with one exception.

Earlier this month Warner Bros announced it would merge with Discovery but the one thing left off in the massive press release was the fate of its games division ‚Äì other than a brief mention. The reports were that WB Games would keep some studios but not all with that finally coming true this week with the news that WB was selling Golf Clash developer Playdemic to EA for $1.4 billion in cash.

Hidden at the end of the press release was a note suggesting that Playdemic will be the only WB Games studio sold which states that the remaining studios are ‚Äúincluded in the recently announced WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction and will become part of the combined media and entertainment company.‚Äù

Since then the rumours focused on NetherRealm and TT Games with Windows Central‚Äôs Jez Corden claiming to have documents to prove this. In a statement to TheGamer Warner Bros‚Äô Remi Sklar refutes this confirming that NetherRealm Studios and TT Games ‚Äúwill continue to remain a part of Warner Bros. Games‚Äù before adding ‚Äúall are included in the Warner Media Discovery merger‚Äù suggesting that WB‚Äôs other studios are safe too.

Furthermore Warner Bros isn‚Äôt just keeping the studios working on its franchises it‚Äôs doubling down on them. ‚ÄúWhile we have great respect for the Playdemic team‚Äù said WB Games president David Haddad ‚Äúour decision to divest is a part of our overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.‚Äù

While NetherRealm and TT Games are confirmed as safe this seems like Warner Bros developers such as Rocksteady Monolith Avalanche Software WB Games Montreal and more will still be a part of the new Warner Bros Discovery ‚Äì so any rumoured titles in development at one of these studios may be safe too for now. This is good because most of WB Games‚Äô announced titles should be out next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1zZWxsLW5ldGhlcnJlYWxtLXN0dWRpby10dC1nYW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros.

Rumors have swirled on and off for the past year that AT&T and Warner Bros. were looking to sell off some of their video games division but now there's some official wording on that matter.

Following reports that a document alleged NetherRealm Studios and Lego game developer TT Games were planned to be spun out from their Discovery merger Warner Bros. issued a statement that there will be no such sale happening currently.

In a written statement to The Gamer WB Games representative Remi Sklar revealed the makers of Mortal Kombat and Injustice will remain under their umbrella for the foreseeable future.

""I can confirm NetherRealm Studios and TT Games will continue to remain a part of Warner Bros. Games and all are included in the Warner Media Discovery merger"" said Sklar via The Gamer.

They did not comment on the legitimacy of the supposed document however so there still may have been a point when the media giant was interested in shopping around two of their biggest studios before changing their minds.

Credible rumors began to circulate last summer alleging AT&T was looking to offset some of its debt by selling / splitting apart Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for a price tag of around $4 billion before pulling them off the table ‚Äî perhaps because the Discovery merger was on the horizon.

While AT&T certainly could have made a quick buck by shipping off NRS to the highest bidder they likely stand to gain more from keeping them considering the studio is arguably the most successful fighting game developer around.

Each of NetherRealm's releases in the past decade have been multi-million copy sellers with Mortal Kombat X reaching a staggering 11 million sold while Mortal Kombat 11 quickly hit 8 million units ‚Äî and is likely much higher now.

Another recent event that appeared to work in the rumors favor was NetherRealm themselves announcing that MK11's development was complete and the title would be seeing no more new content after the studio had been silent on the matter for more than seven months.

NetherRealm's new production is still unknown but rumors say they're working on a fighting game based on Marvel Comics now ‚Äî though we just saw how this rumor played out.

Warner Bros. Discovery's $43 billion merger is scheduled to be finalized in 2022 where NRS will still have easy access to WB's various properties including DC Comics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uZXRoZXJyZWFsbS1zdHVkaW9zLXR0LWdhbWVzLXN0aWwtd2l0aC13YXJuZXItYnJvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Report: NetherRealm Studios And TT Games Will ""Remain Part Of Warner Bros.""","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uZXRoZXJyZWFsbS1zdHVkaW9zLXR0LWdhbWVzLXN0aWwtd2l0aC13YXJuZXItYnJvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Anna Maria is the only city on Anna Maria Island serviced by Waste Management. Waste Pro services Bradenton Beach and Holmes Beach. According to Bradenton Beach Public Works Manager Tom Woodard Waste Pro serviced that city on Tuesday and Wednesday.

During the Thursday July 8 city commission meeting Murphy gave a positive report regarding the city‚Äôs response to the storm with one exception: ‚ÄúThe biggest faux pas we had was garbage collection. Holmes Beach had their garbage collected and somehow Waste Management decided to not pick up our garbage because the landfill was closed.‚Äù

Murphy was referring to the Manatee County landfill being closed on Tuesday after being closed on Monday in recognition of the Fourth of July holiday.

At 11:46 a.m. on Monday July 6 Manatee County Utilities Department Strategic Affairs Manager Amy Pilson sent an email to the public works directors in the Manatee County cities but her email was not sent directly sent to the Island‚Äôs city mayors.

‚ÄúDue to the anticipated impacts of Tropical Storm Elsa the Manatee County Landfill will be closed and all collection services in the unincorporated areas will be suspended tomorrow Tuesday July 6‚Äù Pilson stated in her email.

Murphy said no one from the county or Waste Management contacted him directly to explain the situation but Public Works Manager Dean Jones was initially notified by Waste Management of the additional service disruption.

‚ÄúDean couldn‚Äôt even get ahold of them to find out what‚Äôs going on. The word coming from Waste Management was basically non-existent. I‚Äôve asked Dean to schedule an appointment with Waste Management because I‚Äôm very dissatisfied with their communications. It was a fiasco. They obviously had no plan for an emergency especially following a three-day weekend when the garbage is already piling up‚Äù Murphy said.

‚ÄúIf you can send me an email every time my bill is due then why can‚Äôt you send me an email and tell me you‚Äôre not going to provide service? I also know they have the capability to do robocalls. Why wasn‚Äôt that employed?‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúThe call came after the fact‚Äù Commissioner Carol Carter noted.

Contract talks

The city of Anna Maria extended its contract with Waste Management in 2019. At that time Waste Pro also submitted a bid to provide those exclusive citywide services. When presenting the Waste Pro proposal company representative Bob ten Haaf noted Waste Pro has its own trash processing company and is not dependent on the landfill. The commission ultimately voted 4-1 to enter into another contract with Waste Management.

Murphy said there‚Äôs a clause in the Waste Management contract that allows the city to renegotiate if the city is dissatisfied with their performance.

‚ÄúMaybe we can resolve it. My intent is we have in place a good emergency plan even when there‚Äôs a holiday which impacts the garbage pickup. There‚Äôs no excuse for what took place‚Äù Murphy said.

If Murphy feels the need to renegotiate after his pending meeting with Waste Management representatives he will seek that commission authorization on July 22.

Commissioner Jon Crane said he was frustrated because he couldn‚Äôt find one reliable source of information regarding the impacted collection dates including the Waste Management website.

Commissioner Mark Short said he was out on Willow Avenue picking up bottles and cans that were floating in the water because the uncollected bottles and cans were placed in boxes rather than trash bags trash cans or recycle bins. Murphy said there were also failures with the side-yard pickups required of non-homesteaded residential properties.

Waste Management response

When contacted by The Sun on Friday Waste Management regional spokesperson Dana McCormick said ‚ÄúDue to the closure of the Manatee County landfill on Monday July 5 in observance of Independence Day Waste Management could not provide service to Anna Maria. Our scheduled make-up day was Tuesday. Then due to the approach of Hurricane Elsa Manatee County made the decision to close the landfill again on Tuesday. Therefore Waste Management could not service Anna Maria on Tuesday. Our safety protocols do not allow garbage to remain in our trucks overnight.

‚ÄúWhile our senior leadership was in frequent contact with the city of Anna Maria staff on service changes due to the closure of the Manatee County landfill we understand our communications did not meet the city‚Äôs expectations and we will commit to do better in future storm events‚Äù McCormick said.

‚ÄúWe provided service to our customers on Wednesday and Thursday upon the opening of the landfill and we‚Äôll be back on our regular schedule next week. We look forward to our meeting with Mayor Dan Murphy‚Äù she added.

Online updates

McCormick said during regular non-storm events property owners can go to www.WM.com and enter their address to check on current or anticipated service disruptions.

‚ÄúDuring a tropical storm or a hurricane we have a special website in Florida: www.WMFloridaStorm.com‚Äù McCormick said noting the website did contain collection information related to Manatee County and Anna Maria‚Äôs service interruptions.

Regarding the possibility that many Anna Maria property owners may not have been aware of Waste Management‚Äôs storm website McCormick said ‚ÄúWe will certainly make sure during the next potential storm that both the city and its residents are better informed of that website. If there was a miscue with the Anna Maria residents we want to make sure that is corrected before the next storm.‚Äù

In response to McCormick‚Äôs responses Murphy said ‚ÄúNo matter what Waste Management‚Äôs perception of their communication plan is our streets had overflowing garbage cans for several days. They didn‚Äôt pick up trash after a holiday weekend and that‚Äôs what they get paid to do. The end result was totally unacceptable.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFscGVuYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3L2FzLWFscGVuYS1hcmVhLWxhbmRmaWxscy1maWxsLXVwLWxlYWRlcnMtcHVzaC1mb3ItYmV0dGVyLXJlY3ljbGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Alpena-area landfills fill up leaders push for better recycling,"ALPENA ‚Äî Alpena County residents threw away more garbage in 2020 than the year before and the landfill that holds that garbage could run out of room in 14 years state officials say.

While Michiganders and out-of staters dumped less garbage statewide Alpena County sent 72500 cubic yards ‚Äî 5% more than the previous year ‚Äî to the Montmorency-Oscoda-Alpena Solid Waste Management Authority in Atlanta.

Dumping by Alpena County residents and businesses which account for most of the trash at the landfill increased by a third since 2015. Other counties contributing to the Atlanta landfill have increased their dumping as well.

As of the end of 2019 the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy estimated the landfill would last another 21 years.

But after the 200000 cubic yards of waste added to its hills in 2020 the state now predicts the landfill will fill in 14 years.

By agreement between Alpena Oscoda and Montmorency counties all garbage originating in those counties must go to the Atlanta landfill. Most Presque Isle County garbage goes to the GFL Northern Michigan Landfill south of Onaway and Alcona County garbage ends up either in the Atlanta landfill or other landfills.

The Onaway landfill should last until about 2026 by state estimates.

Hampered by inadequate storage space and a lack of cost-effective places to send recyclables current county recycling programs can‚Äôt stop the swell of garbage shortening the life of the landfill.

But state officials have hope for the future.

Northeast Michigan leaders hoping to expand recycling services have studied other regions‚Äô successes in keeping trash out of landfills according to Matt Flechter recycling market development specialist for EGLE.

‚ÄúI really do see growth on the near horizon for Alpena County‚Äù Flechter said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a success story in the making.‚Äù

GROWING PILES

The Atlanta landfill increased capacity by opening new holes to hold garbage ‚Äî called cells ‚Äî twice in the past decade: first in 2013 ‚Äî after the state estimated it would fill within three years ‚Äî and again in 2017 buying it another 10 years of life.

Landfill workers try to turn every three cubic yards of raw garbage into one a bulldozer shoving dumped trash up and down garbage hills while a compactor drives over it repeatedly tamping it down.

‚ÄúSpace is expensive around here‚Äù said Doug Baker operations manager at the landfill.

The landfill reports ‚Äî and pays for ‚Äî every new cubic foot of garbage. Money paid by the three counties that jointly own the landfill covers some of that cost as do dumping costs charged to commercial haulers construction companies and residents.

GROWING HILLS

Though some items brought to the landfill couldn‚Äôt end up anywhere else the giant hills of dirt-covered garbage ‚Äî and often the surrounding trees according to Connie Gerrie landfill administrator ‚Äî also contain bottles jars cardboard boxes and other items residents could have recycled.

The Atlanta landfill at one time took recyclable goods but a lack of companies to buy the products made the practice not cost-effective Gerrie said.

Michiganders throw away about $368 million-worth of recyclable materials each year especially plastic packaging cardboard and paper according to a 2016 state report that looked at the content of landfills.

Bills currently before the Legislature would promote new recycling and composting requirements that backers say would increase recycling opportunities and enforcement in the state.

The bills seek to increase Michigan‚Äôs 18% recycling rate ‚Äî compared to the national average of 34% ‚Äî by requiring counties to create recycling plans increasing regulation and the cost of dumping in landfills and encouraging development of new uses for recyclables.

The bills passed the state House in April and now await a vote by a state Senate committee.

‚ÄòA BUILDING ENERGY‚Äô

Northeast Michigan‚Äôs increase in waste in the past year even as the state threw less away might correspond to fewer recycling options in the region than downstate according to John Ozoga assistant district supervisor for the EGLE Materials Management Division.

Flechter the recycling specialist for EGLE said a statewide analysis showed a need for improved collection and processing opportunities in the region.

The Alpena Resource Recovery facility where workers sort the region‚Äôs recyclables and send them to processors is the smallest such facility in the state according to NextCycle Michigan an EGLE initiative focused on reducing the 6.8 million tons of recyclable material in Michigan landfills.

Recycling generated in the county long ago outgrew the facility on M-32 West near the Alpena airport according to Diane Rekowski who oversees waste planning for the Alpena region as executive director of the Northeast Michigan Council of Governments.

Check out the interactive graphics below showing details of Northeast Michigan waste management. Story continues below graphics.

Alpena County commissioners approved a request from the Resource Recovery board to use land at the Alpena County Regional Airport for a new recycling facility pending approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. The building would occupy space on the west side of the property away from the airfield.

A project 20 years in the making a new building would provide space for mechanized sorting and set Alpena up as a hub for recycling from area counties Rekowski said.

The state and other sources would help pay for such a building according to Flechter.

Northeast Michigan has caught the eye of the state as an area ‚Äúripe for investment in the recycling system‚Äù he said.

A lack of processing facilities ‚Äî which turn plastics and other goods into new products ‚Äî within easy reach of Alpena drives up the cost of recycling here.

However Flechter reported ‚Äúa building energy‚Äù among Northeast Michigan government leaders eager to solve the problem.

Government officials and other leaders have visited a processing facility in Emmet County that Flechter called a ‚Äúshining star‚Äù in recycling learning how a similar system might work in the Alpena area Flechter said.

Such interest could keep local landfills from filling fast and give residents a better option than throwing their trash away he said.

When it comes to trash ‚Äúthere is no ‚Äòaway'‚Äù Flechter said. ‚ÄúLandfills are just storage places for our children‚Äôs children to take care of after we‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

BAINBRIDGE Pa. (AP) ‚Äî Piled in thousand-ton heaps garbage was a putrid mountain stacked about two stories tall in a concrete pit last month in rural Conoy Township where the rubbish is seen as more than just discarded trash to be landfilled.

Instead trash piled at Lancaster County‚Äôs Waste-to-Energy Facility has served as fuel for three decades feeding a process that generates usable electricity saves landfill space and reduces related greenhouse gas emissions

That‚Äôs according to officials at the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority which is celebrating the plant‚Äôs 30th year.

To date 10.7 million tons of trash has been combusted at the facility authority officials said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best way to process on a mass scale at this place and time‚Äù authority CEO Bob Zorbaugh said referring to the trash-related needs of the county‚Äôs more than half a million residents.

That‚Äôs true Zorbaugh claims even though the combustion process is not pollution-free.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to pretend that the facility doesn‚Äôt have any emissions. It does‚Äù he said before weighing that against the alternative.

‚ÄúYou know most communities in the United States have just a landfill‚Äù Zorbaugh said. ‚ÄúDo you just want to landfill everything or do you want to do something different with the technology available?‚Äù

The authority has a landfill too ‚Äî the 96-acre Frey Farm site in rural Manor Township that began operating in 1989. However the county likely would have needed two more landfills of the same size if it wasn‚Äôt for the waste-to-energy program said Katie Sandoe an authority spokeswoman.

Space is saved because the process turns trash ‚Äî mostly the kind of rubbish that‚Äôs put out for collection at the curb ‚Äî into ash reducing its volume by 90 percent before it‚Äôs sent to the landfill.

Over the facility‚Äôs 30 years that equates to a reduction of 17.8 million cubic yards of waste enough to fill Penn State University‚Äôs Beaver Stadium 12 times Sandoe said.

1800 degrees

Authority officials shared those figures before showing off the process last month leading the way into the facility as garbage clattered to the floor from the back of a filled tractor-trailer before being pushed into the pit where as much as 9000 tons of rubbish can be piled.

Overhead crane operators used massive claw-like grapples to scoop trash from the pile before lowering it into chutes that feed the site‚Äôs three boilers which burn at a minimum of 1800 degrees to each incinerate 400 tons of trash a day.

The heat warms water-filled tubes surrounding the boilers to create pressurized steam which drives a turbine to generate electricity.

Running continuously the process generates 36 megawatts of electricity at a given time. The facility itself consumes six of those megawatts and the other 30 are sold into the local power grid ‚Äî enough to power more than 20000 homes Sandoe said.

Energy-related revenue from the facility‚Äôs output amounted to about $9 million in 2020 Sandoe said.

Discarded metal items not burned up in the process can be recovered from the ash and sold into recycling markets Zorbaugh said. He showed off piles of the reclaimed metal during the tour pointing out dumbbells lugnuts tin cans gears and mattress springs.

‚ÄúWe are able to extract and recycle thousands of tons of metal a year‚Äù he said noting that those materials would have been landfilled without the combustion process.

Annually metals recovered at the facility generate an average of about $700000 in revenue Sandoe said.

Environmental impacts tradeoffs

But for all of those reported benefits Sandoe acknowledged that there are environmental drawbacks of running a 24/7 waste-to-energy facility including emissions of harmful gases ‚Äî mostly carbon dioxide which causes climate change and poisonous nitrogen oxides that contribute to air pollution.

In an average year those nitrogen oxides emissions total about 530 metric tons and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions total about 161198 metric tons Sandoe said.

She cited U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data to compare the facility to the nearby Brunner Island power plant in York County which in 2019 produced 2158706 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions or about 13 times more than the Waste-to-Energy Facility.

The average passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year according to the EPA.

Plans were controversial

Critics have long expressed fears about the potential release of other toxic pollutants including dioxins toxic chemical compounds that can negatively impact human health.

Those concerns have existed locally since even before the $115 million facility was formally dedicated in June 1991 according to LNP/LancasterOnline archives.

‚ÄúLet us not leave to our children and our children‚Äôs children an inheritance of bad air contaminated water‚Äù one letter writer wrote opposing combustion at the site ahead of its opening.

Steven Mohr chairman of the Conoy Township Board of Supervisors recalled that opposition. He was on the board when the facility site between River Road and the Susquehanna River near Bainbridge was first announced as a potential location.

‚ÄúThey just wanted to come up with anything they could to stop it‚Äù Mohr said adding that police were asked to attend at least one related township meeting so ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt get out of hand.‚Äù

To Mohr it‚Äôs the ideal location tucked away from most developed areas on a rural road that can handle the hundreds of trash trucks that drop off waste at the facility.

The thousands of tons of smelly trash inside are barely detectable outside of the building‚Äôs footprint he said an assurance authority officials gave him prior to the build.

‚ÄúIt lived up to the sales pitch‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt any negative.‚Äù

Currently there are no active local opposition groups to the waste-to-energy facility Sandoe said.

Mohr said the per-ton host fee the authority pays to be sited in the township has been a major benefit to Conoy. Amounting to about $60000 to $70000 in revenue a month the fee has allowed the township to eliminate local taxes he said.

‚ÄúNow all of those people that were against it they want to help spend the money‚Äù he said with a laugh.

Still the potential for pollution problems exists according to the EPA which notes a number of related regulations standards and controls that were implemented to combat harmful emissions during the 1970s to 1990s.

Emissions monitored in real time

As he led a tour of the facility last month Zorbaugh moved outside to the back of the plant where he pointed toward a collection of structures and stacks all designed he said to control pollutants and ensure compliance with federally mandated standards.

Readings from those control systems are transmitted live to state regulators and any interruption or violation of that process comes with consequences Sandoe said.

‚ÄúSome of the misunderstanding around modern waste-to-energy facilities comes back to this public memory of old incinerators of the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s that did have a negative impact on the environment‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not exactly what we are doing here.‚Äù

Sandoe also touted the process as an environmental benefit pointing out that burning trash for electricity eliminates the amount of raw waste left to rot in traditional landfills. Decomposing waste releases methane gas a significant contributor to climate change.

While officials could not provide methane-specific numbers it‚Äôs been reported that every ton of waste processed in a waste-to-energy facility offsets a ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions Sandoe said.

Zorbaugh said he hopes the authority will remain innovative especially when it comes to new opportunities for recycling and reuse in the waste stream.

‚ÄúBut until that happens we need to do something with this waste‚Äù Zorbaugh said guessing that waste-to-energy will remain a viable option.

In fact the facility was designed with the future in mind built with extra space to allow for population growth.

‚ÄúThirty years later we still have capacity‚Äù Zorbaugh said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIxMDEwNjQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 and waste production in households: A trend analysis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721010640 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIxMDEwNjQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The business landscape in Luce County has changed again.

On June 30 the Falls Hotel building sold to new owners who will be announced soon. Former owner David Kenny and his wife Rebecca (Bjorklund) Kenny bought the hotel building in 2013 and lived on the second floor while operating the Great Waters Coffee Company on the main level.

They restored the face of the building using historic photos updated the main floor prepared an event space and rented it out including for Engadine prom one year and Rebecca used the space for photography. They used the outside area for block parties. For photography services Dallas Video Production can be checked out!

Companies have been using product renderings in marketing campaigns for years now. But as rendering tech advances so has access to these services ‚Äî and everyone sees the benefits. 3D rendering like the ones at https://www.fuseanimation.com/consider-3d-rendering/ makes the impossible a reality especially for marketers. Nothing gives you control over every aspect of a digital asset like 3D rendering.

As their photography business grew and often pulled them down to Traverse City they made the decision to relocate and put the hotel back on the market.

It remained there for years.

‚ÄúWe had a couple close calls with certain people interested within and outside the community‚Äù David said. But they fell through usually because of the amount of work involved in restoring and giving new life to the iconic Newberry hotel.

The Kennys prepared to give up. They were actively meeting with the Luce County Economic Development Corporation and local and state representatives to get backing for a new plan that would bring life back to the whole building.

According to tworldfranchise.com/get-started before they could seal the deal a viable offer came through. The buyer wanted to use the whole building again creating a vibrant business much like the Kennys were making plans to do. They accepted.

‚ÄúThere were a lot of things in common with what we wanted to do with the building that they were doing. We saw the amount of money they were putting in even before it [the sale] closed to make sure they could do their plans with the building. That made us feel really good about it‚Äù said David.

The Kennys are looking forward to returning to the renewed Falls Hotel to once again spend the night.

In Helmer Taylor Market sold on June 23 from Steve Taylor to Chad Ketola. The transition from Taylor to Ketola took several months so many shoppers have already had the opportunity to meet the new owner.

Ketola is a 2005 graduate from Newberry High School. He served in the Marines for 10 years and is currently in his sixth year with the National Guard.

There won‚Äôt be any changes inside the store immediately but come fall expect to see some exciting developments as Ketola adds his signature to the place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYmlnLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzLWFyZS10b28tZXhwZW5zaXZlJUUyJTgwJTk0LWl0LXRpbWUtYmFieS1jYXJyaWVycy0xODk0OTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Big Aircraft Carriers Are Too Expensive‚ÄîIs It Time for ""Baby"" Carriers?","But smaller and cheaper means reduced capabilities and could prevent the Navy from fighting in hostile waters or providing the air support for ground operations.

Here's What You Need to Know: Carriers that have less capabilities would affect how the U.S. wages war such as relying on carrier-based air support when operating far from U.S. airfields and land-based aircraft.

The bottom line of a new study on U.S. aircraft carriers: you can't get something for nothing.

The Navy can buy smaller cheaper carriers rather than the $13 billion Ford-class behemoths it is currently constructing according to a new study by RAND Corporation. But smaller and cheaper means reduced capabilities and could prevent the Navy from fighting in hostile waters or providing the air support for ground operations.

The RAND study is a public version of a classified study conducted in 2016 at the behest of the U.S. Navy which was ordered by Congress to examine cheaper options than the Ford-class carriers.

RAND looked at four options:

- The CVN-8X: A slightly stripped-down version of the 100000-ton Ford-class carriers. It would be powered by forty-year nuclear reactors that couldn't be replaced rather than the current twenty-five-year reactors on the Fords that can replaced to extend the life of the ship. It would also be equipped with three rather than four catapults.

- The CVN LX: A 70000-ton carrier closer to the old Forrestal-class ships of the 1950s the Navy's first ‚Äúsupercarriers.‚Äù They would be propelled by hybrid nuclear-conventional engines with one reactor instead of the two on the Nimitz- and Ford-class ships. It could still carry a large air wing and would still be more capable than the Nimitz carriers but it would slower and less survivable than the Fords nor could its air wing generate as many sorties.

- The CV LX: A 43000-ton conventionally-powered variant of the new America-class amphibious assault ships/helicopter carriers. Lacking catapults they could only carry twenty-five F-35B and only generate around fifty sorties a day. Without airborne early warning or electronic warfare aircraft it would ""require support from either a legacy carrier or land-based joint assets. It can operate in areas where air defense threats are not significant or in company with a battle force. The CV LX is not the capability of choice as a first on-scene responder because it lacks an integrated air wing and in particular lacks AEW and EA [airborne early warning and electronic attack].‚Äù

- The CV EX: A small 20000-ton baby carrier that would be conventionally powered and could only accommodate six to ten short take-off aircraft similar to the Italian carrier Cavour. The CV EX would be the cheapest option at $2.5 billion a vessel but RAND estimates that four CV LX carriers would be needed to generate the same capability as a single Ford-class ship. ‚ÄúThe CV EX has all the limitations of the CV LX with a much smaller flight deck fuel and magazine capacity and would therefore have to be used either as a responder to low-level contingencies or in conjunction with a legacy CVN‚Äù RAND concludes.

RAND was careful not to endorse a particular option. But the report makes clear that less capability is the price tag for lower shipbuilding costs. For example to launch conventional fixed-wing aircraft such as the F-35C a carrier must be large enough to have space for catapults and arresting gear. A smaller carrier could launch short take-off F-35Bs and helicopters but then it wouldn't be able to launch E-2 radar aircraft or EA-18 electronic warfare planes.

In turn carriers that have less capabilities would affect how the U.S. wages war such as relying on carrier-based air support when operating far from U.S. airfields and land-based aircraft. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that getting what‚Äôs in the Ford-class capability requires Ford-class investment‚Äù Brad Martin a retired Navy captain and one of the RAND researchers who wrote the study told TNI. ‚ÄúThe alternatives are offered as less costly but we are clear that there is diminishment in capability that Navy would need to evaluate. Some losses of capability might not be critical‚Äîa lower sortie generation rate for example‚Äîbut others might be much more so.‚Äù

Opting for either of the large nuclear carriers described by RAND probably wouldn't result in too drastic a change for the Navy. Not so for the two smaller conventionally-powered carriers. ‚ÄúThe conventionally-powered alternatives we looked at‚Äîthe two smallest variants‚Äîwould if selected as replacements for the Nimitz class as these ships reach service life significantly impact Navy operational concepts‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúThis is primarily because they lack the ability to support an integrated air wing. They could generate some portion of the strike and defensive counter air sorties required in campaign plans but they would have to rely on some off-ship alternative for other capabilities (airborne early warning and C2 in particular) now provided organically.‚Äù

So what's the best option? There isn't one. Either the Navy ends with large carriers that aren't that much different than a Ford or small carriers with radically less capabilities.

Backwash residents said from a clogged drain outside the Seville Meadows Phase Three perimeter fence in St Catherine.

It is a hard reminder of the knee-high floodwaters home-owners of this section of the housing scheme have had to wade through at least twice with last year‚Äôs passage of Tropical Storms Zeta and Eta. Another harsh reminder is the cement blocks nearby used to hoist furniture from flood waters inside their homes.

It is a simple fix they argued ‚Äì the powers that be need to clear the drain at the end of a gully that runs through the community. Yet after letters to their Member of Parliament Dr Andrew Wheatley the St Catherine Municipal Corporation and Prime Minister Andrew Holness nothing has come of their pleas.

Not even a visit from the MP who confessed Friday that he heard of the issue during the heavy rainfall but said that the problem is for the municipal corporation to solve. Nothing also from Mayor Norman Scott who absolved himself Friday pointing to Wheatley and the councillor of the Homestead Division for remedy.

Alarmingly though Scott like the residents was also dumbfounded as to whether Mark McLean or Owen Thompson was the councillor for the Homestead division.

‚ÄúListen while I‚Äôm the mayor and chairman of the council I can‚Äôt go into a councillor‚Äôs division to do things. They have their funds that they get and so they use it to their own priority. There is a councillor who is elected to that geographical space!‚Äù Scott responded curtly to Sunday Gleaner queries adding that he has not seen any letter to his office on the issue.

‚ÄúThese are some of the reasons why I don‚Äôt want to have these discussions. You are making it appear as if I don‚Äôt care about what is happening. I have overall responsibility yes but the councillor must say why is it‚Äù he said noting that any letter to himself or others at the municipal corporation would have been forwarded to the councillor.

PROMISE TO VISIT

Wheatley continued similar rhetoric when contacted.

‚ÄúThe MP is not the local planning authority. All of who do development works for the parish council‚Äù he quipped before relenting Friday when told that the blocked drainage is located outside the gated community.

‚ÄúI was made aware of the situation about Sunday/Monday; some flooding and drainage issues. I‚Äôve not seen the letter. I have not visited the area ... I was told second-hand I have not confirmed it. I have not been around there as yet and that‚Äôs all I can say on the matter‚Äù the MP said.

‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm going to go around there. I soon go around there go see what‚Äôs going on. It is a part of my job‚Äù he said promising that his visit no later than Wednesday will be accompanied by a team from the National Works Agency (NWA).

CAN‚ÄôT TAKE ANYMORE

The MP‚Äôs promise came as comfort last weekend but residents of Seville Meadows are hoping they will not be fooled. After all they have paid contractors $60000 a day and have themselves worked tirelessly to clear debris from other communities washing through the gully. But unless the area at the end of the waterway outside the fence is cleared their efforts are in vain.

Three years ago Kurt McLaughlin purchased his home for just over $7 million. Now he is thinking of selling the property and relocating.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt deal with this. Me roof not leaking and me house still a flood out. Furniture everything a wet up. Block me have to put the things on so them nuh damage‚Äù said McLaughlin.

‚ÄúIt is a terrible situation star‚Äù he added noting that like neighbour Terron Brown he frets whenever there is heavy rains and he is not there to hoist the furniture.

Shada Morgan-Robinson gets the most sympathy from the affected residents. Her home is the first to flood when the water backs up. Worse is that she has a 10-month-old baby.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm frustrated. If I‚Äôm home and the rain is falling I cannot leave home because I‚Äôm terrified of what could happen. And if I‚Äôm on the road it makes it even worse‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhen that happens I get panic attacks because I don‚Äôt know what is going to happen. Last year October when it rained water came in on me and all my furniture were damaged. Everything became waterlogged. I don‚Äôt know how much of this I can take.‚Äù

The announcement comes at a time when the people are doubting whether the KMTP in Sangem mandal touted as a fibre-to-fabric integrated textile cluster would really take off.

Although the government had promised to develop the KMTP with an estimated cost of Rs 1552 crore the project is a nonstarter even after more than three years.

After the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has acquired 1200 acres for the park a few top companies such as Korean Textile major Youngone Corporation have come forward to set up their units in the park. According to officials work on internal roads and power lines is completed.

Efforts are on to ensure drinking water supply through Mission Bhagiratha. A dedicated pipeline will be laid from Chalivagu to address the needs of industrial waters.

Youngone Corporation proposed to invest Rs 1000 crore to set up manufacturing units of synthetic jackets boots track suits and other apparel used in trekking was allotted 290 acres. This apart Ganesha Ecopet Private Limited manufacturer of polyester staple fibre is likely to invest Rs 500 crore in 50 acres.

Despite all these proposals none of them have got forward so far. Adding more to it the State Government also made no mention about the park in the budget. Against this backdrop the Kitex Group's announcement to invest Rs 1000 crore appears to be a ray of hope for the locals who were expecting livelihood opportunities to at least 10000 people directly and indirectly.

With the initiative taken by the Telangana Government a delegation led by Sabu M Jacob managing director of Kitex Group visited KMTP on Friday evening. Later the MD announced Rs 1000-crore investment in the first phase over the next two years.

The investment is expected to generate nearly 4000 jobs. It's learnt that the Kitex Group has expressed its willingness to set up its unit if it was given more than 150 acres to which the government had given a nod."

The states decided late Wednesday to drop their opposition to Purdue‚Äôs bankruptcy reorganization plan in exchange for a release of millions of documents and an additional $50 million from members of the Sackler family the company‚Äôs owners.

The agreement was contained in a late-night filing by a mediator in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains N.Y.

The settlement extracts concessions that will be added to a comprehensive proposal now being voted on by more than 3000 plaintiffs including cities counties tribes and states who sought to hold Purdue and its owners responsible for their role in the opioid epidemic.

DARRINGTON ‚Äî Hampton Lumber a Portland-based company has purchased 145000 acres of timber land to supply its sawmill in Darrington.

‚ÄúI think it just really reflects our long-term commitment to operating in the area‚Äù Hampton Lumber spokesperson Kristin Rasmussen said. ‚ÄúIn forestry we think in decades not necessarily weeks months or years.‚Äù

Hampton Lumber owns and operates nine sawmills in Washington Oregon and British Columbia. The Darrington mill is that town‚Äôs largest employer.

‚ÄúThis land acquisition brings stability to the operations here in Darrington‚Äù said Mayor Dan Rankin who noted he sees the purchase as a positive for the city.

The population is less than 1500 and 160 people work at the mill.

Darrington is still considered a timber town Rankin said but it has far fewer sawmills than it did in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the mills today are one-person operations.

Rankin said he learned the purchase was in the works about a month ago.

‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt change anything at the mill today‚Äù he said.

Rasmussen said the Darrington mill won‚Äôt see many changes in the short term. Hampton isn‚Äôt hiring more people at the mill or expanding operations.

The company relies heavily on private landowners as well as state forests to supply the operation in Darrington Rasmussen said. In the long term this means the mill has a more stable supply of timber.

‚ÄúThis will be a small part of what the mill consumes as far as timber goes‚Äù Rasmussen said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs so important to have our own land to help provide a more stable supply.‚Äù

Hampton Lumber purchased the land from Weyerhaeuser the Seattle-based timber giant that owns more than 12 million acres in the U.S. The 145000 acres Hampton Lumber purchased are in Whatcom Skagit Snohomish King Chelan and Kittitas counties.

Hampton Lumber is based in Portland but owns and operates three mills in Washington. It is a fourth-generation family-owned company.

‚ÄúThis purchase reflects our ongoing commitment to wood manufacturing in Washington‚Äù Hampton Lumber CEO Steve Zika said in a news release.

The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission voted Friday to reclassify the marbled murrelet‚Äôs status from threatened to endangered under the Oregon Endangered Species Act. The decision comes five years after a 2016 petition to ‚Äúuplist‚Äù it from its 1995 classification as threatened.

While it signals Oregon‚Äôs official position that the bird needs greater protections to avoid extinction the commission‚Äôs 4-2 vote triggers only voluntary conservation measures on the part of private landowners.

The marbled murrelet has been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 1992. The latest studies by federal researchers show significant population decline in one range of its habitat. US. Fish and Wildlife Service

Marbled murrelets spend much of their lives at sea just off the coast. But they nest in the canopy of coastal old-growth. That places the birds among the Northwest‚Äôs more controversy-stirring species caught between the drive to conserve the region‚Äôs diversity of wildlife and their natural habitat and the economic benefits of resource-extracting industries.

The commission however was barred from considering economics in determining whether to reclassify the marbled murrelet. Friday‚Äôs action represents an acknowledgment that marbled murrelets are in danger of extinction within Oregon and that coastal state-owned and managed forests can help with their conservation. The vote also signals the need for greater protections for the murrelets than those currently in place at the state and federal levels.

Commissioner Greg Wolley said the decision ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt strike fear in people‚Äôs hearts‚Äù given that all it does is require the Department of Fish and Wildlife to work collaboratively with other state land management agencies to develop and agree on guidelines to prevent marbled murrelet extinction

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like some rules or regulations are coming down on high from somewhere and telling everyone what to do‚Äù said Wolley a program manager with the city of Portland.

Most of the robin-sized seabird‚Äôs population is currently limited to the northernmost reaches of its historic breeding range which extends south along the Pacific coastline from Alaska‚Äôs Aleutian Islands to Central California.

Murrelets‚Äô survival depends on old growth; they build their nests in mossy depressions in the branches of large trees ‚Äî the kind of trees the logging industry prizes. Densely-packed smaller trees in replanted forests have not provided the kind of habitat that murrelets need to survive.

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife‚Äôs biological assessment of the marbled murrelet‚Äôs status found its population trend and forest habitat conditions have improved modestly but other factors bode against the bird‚Äôs survival. One of these was the impact of climate change on ocean temperatures resulting in a drop in fish for murrelets to prey on.

Friday‚Äôs action repeats an uplisting vote taken in 2018 by the commission which reversed course before the bird was officially reclassified.

The Center for Biological Diversity which pressed for the uplisting praised Friday‚Äôs vote.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre relieved that after so many missteps the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission will finally move forward with extending marbled murrelets the full protection of endangered status under state law‚Äù said Quinn Read Oregon policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

But others including a state lawmaker whose district includes the southern Oregon coast and nearby forests where marbled murrelets nest were critical.

‚ÄúThe data clearly supports that the murrelet is rebounding and moving forward with regard to their population‚Äù said Rep. David Brock Smith R-Port Orford who argued that uplisting was not warranted.

Meghan Tuttle a manager with Weyerhaeuser said that even if private land owners like her corporation aren‚Äôt required to increase conservation efforts the uplisting was unnecessary and would have negative impacts on rural communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZHlzbWl0aG5ld3MuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wY2ZlYzZkNi1lMjQ2LTExZWItOWI5Ny0yNzFlYWJlZWMwNmEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wayne Kostka | Obituaries | ladysmithnews.com,Wayne Michael Kostka of rural Osseo died at home on Wednesday July 7 2021.

Fans of the South African billionaire‚Äôs electric cars say rats mice and rodents are chomping down on their Teslas. And despite having dropped tens of thousands of dollars to buy the pricey vehicles Tesla refuses to cover the damage.

Sarah Williams a 41-year-old physician who lives in Manhattan and uses her Tesla to commute to work in the Bronx told The Post of an alarming incident when she took her 2018 Model 3 into Tesla‚Äôs Paramus NJ dealership in mid-May after her air conditioner had stopped working.

‚ÄúThey opened the glove compartment and a rodent fell out‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

The pest apparently found its way into Williams‚Äô Tesla and gobbled through several internal wires that were insulated with soy rather than oil which critics claim makes them more appealing to rodents.

5 The dead rat in Sarah Williams‚Äô Tesla.

When Williams ‚Äî who paid $59200 for her car ‚Äî complained the company refused to help. The repair has taken more than a month and estimated costs have soared over $5000 she said.

Despite repeated promises that the pricey vehicle will be ready soon Williams was unable to pick up her Tesla at the time of this publication ‚Äî almost two months later.

‚ÄúMost auto manufacturers use the soybean vs. oil in their wire insulation for newer vehicles because it is less expensive and better for the environment‚Äù Tesla service adviser Jose Solis wrote in an email to Williams that she shared with The Post. ‚ÄúThe use of this material would not be considered a ‚Äòdefect‚Äô in design or use ‚Ä¶ Considering there are too many factors outside of Tesla‚Äôs control we cannot cover this under a warranty or repair.‚Äù

Solis is right that it‚Äôs not just Telsa.

5 Rat damage in Sarah Williams‚Äô Tesla.

Automakers have been getting slammed for years with complaints of their allegedly rat-friendly soy-based wiring. And like Tesla they have all refused to cover the damage claiming that rats chewing on car innards is the result of nature and therefore not their problem.

‚ÄúIt is a long-established fact that rodents are drawn to chew on electrical wiring in homes cars or anywhere else they may choose to nest‚Äù Honda told the Chicago Sun-Times in June about an Illinois man‚Äôs efforts to bring a class-action case against it.

Tesla so far only appears to be unique in having escaped legal action tied to its use of soy materials. But that could change as complaints about rats in Teslas appear to rise along with the popularity of the brand now valued at $632 billion.

Toby Bateson a UK-based inventor who came up with a product designed to keep rats out of vehicles said his company has seen special interest from Tesla drivers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a lot of inquiries from Tesla owners because they seem to be vulnerable to the problem‚Äù he said adding that his company has been contacted by about 150 Tesla owners with rodent issues over the past year.

Bateson sells a product called the RatMat which he describes as a ‚Äúhorizontal electric fence‚Äù that keeps rodents from entering vehicles. In New York the RatMat is distributed by a Kips Bay company called HoneyDoBoys which charges about $1500 to $1700 for a single parking spot-size system the company‚Äôs owner Paul Turzio told The Post.

Bateson said that in addition to wiring damage some Tesla owners had told him their brake cables were chewed by rodents ‚Äúto the point of the car becoming unusable.‚Äù

Other Tesla owners who have complained of rats include a user of the Tesla Motors Club forum who griped that his 5-month-old electric vehicle went ‚Äúhaywire‚Äù after a mouse chewed through the coolant hose which may also be made from soy-based materials although it‚Äôs unclear if this is the case for Tesla.

‚ÄúApparently this is not uncommon especially with electric cars‚Äù the user lamented.

And this year an apparent Tesla owner complained on Reddit that his brand-new Model 3 was undrivable just two weeks after it was delivered due to rat damage. Several other users have complained about damage from mice and squirrels on the forum as well.

The Post did not immediately receive a reply to a request for comment from Tesla which is owned by Elon Musk who went by the nickname ‚ÄúMuskrat‚Äù as a child according to a 2009 New Yorker profile.

The complaints come as concerns about rats have risen generally.

The number of rodent complaints to New York City‚Äôs 311 hotline surged by 80 percent in March as the economy reopened to 2906 ‚Äî over and above even March 2019 levels of 2395 Bloomberg recently reported.

One reason may be that rats were forced to change their habits during the pandemic when their normal sources of food dried up including by moving into emptied-out office buildings according to Pest.co.uk.

5 The news comes as more and more Teslas hit the rat-infested streets of New York City. AFP via Getty Images

‚ÄúWe are gearing up for a busy year in 2021‚Äù Jenny Rathbone of Pest.co.uk said.

Meanwhile more Teslas are being introduced to rat-infested areas like the Big Apple. At least one Model 3 is currently in use as a yellow cab ‚Äî and hundreds more are expected to enter service in the coming years according to Business Insider.

Williams says she would not recommend any other New Yorkers buy Teslas until the company rodent-proofs its vehicles.

‚ÄúFor me if I‚Äôm going really fast on the highway and I reach for something in my glove compartment and a rat crawls out it could be a catastrophe‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWho cares if you have this great technology if a rat is in there eating the wires?‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2NhbmFsLXN0cmVldC13YXMtZG93bnRyb2RkZW4tZm9yLWRlY2FkZXMtbG9vay1hdC13aGF0cy1kcml2aW5nLWl0cy1yZXZpdGFsaXphdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlX2FhZmI3OGI0LWUwMGUtMTFlYi05MmI2LTNmOTEyODBkNDVkMi5odG1s0gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vbGEuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FuYWwtc3RyZWV0LXdhcy1kb3dudHJvZGRlbi1mb3ItZGVjYWRlcy1sb29rLWF0LXdoYXRzLWRyaXZpbmctaXRzLXJldml0YWxpemF0aW9uL2FydGljbGVfYWFmYjc4YjQtZTAwZS0xMWViLTkyYjYtM2Y5MTI4MGQ0NWQyLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canal Street was downtrodden for decades; look at what's driving its revitalization,"Canal Street‚Äôs status as the grand thoroughfare of New Orleans had long given way to tawdry storefronts and vacant upper floors when the Downtown Development District published a 1996 report that pointed a way forward.

The agency added 182.15 acres to the El Sereno Open Space Preserve that formerly belonged to the San Jose Water Company. The agency paid just over $1 million for the land with funding from the California Wildlife Conservation Board.

El Sereno sits just south of Saratoga and west of Los Gatos in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It‚Äôs a public preserve open to hikers cyclists and horseback riders.

The district has owned El Sereno since 1975 and in that time has expanded the public green space to more than 1600 acres.

Land acquisition is an important part of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District‚Äôs mission. The agency aims to form a greenbelt or protected natural space outside of the urban sprawl of the South Bay.

This acreage is an important puzzle piece said Mike Williams real property manager for the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District. It was largely surrounded by preserve land before the purchase and the acquisition connects a 3.7-mile trail through the preserve.

‚ÄúIt is a property we‚Äôve had our eye on ever since we bought the initial property that started the El Sereno Preserve‚Äù Williams said.

For years the water company held onto the land that had previously housed a small dam. The land hadn‚Äôt been used for public water in decades so it was no longer being regulated by the Public Utility Commission.

When the district decided to buy the land it needed some more time to secure funding so the Peninsula Open Space Trust (POST) stepped in and purchased the land later selling it to the district once they obtained grant funding.

‚ÄúThis expansion of El Sereno Preserve‚Äîone of Midpen‚Äôs oldest preserves‚Äîis an excellent example of how Midpen and POST have collaborated for more than four decades to creatively meet the community‚Äôs collective conservation goals‚Äù Midpen General Manager Ana Mar√≠a Ruiz said in a statement.

The recently purchased acreage was relatively inexpensive due to the area‚Äôs remoteness. There are no major roads along the ridge so private buyers aren‚Äôt necessarily looking to own land there. If someone wanted to purchase the land for development they‚Äôd likely have to jump through countless hoops to get roads and other services to the property Williams said.

‚ÄúIf there was a public road along there that would have been a more hotly contested property‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe would likely be competing with private parties who would want to potentially build a house on it.‚Äù

July 11 2021 Chad Holloway PR & Media Manager

Last week PokerNews offered live updates from the $10000 buy-in $10000000 GTD Wynn Millions which saw Andrew Moreno top a 1328-entry field to win $1460106 in prize money.

Throughout the tournament there were some memorable hands including a brutal cooler involving Bryn Kenney and Alex Foxen as well as Ari Engel winning with straight flush over straight flush.

In this article we rewind it back by looking at some of the biggest and most-influential hands Moreno play on his way to victory.

Moreno Hits Every Out to Send Opponent Packing

On Day 1c of the tournament in Level 10 (1000/1500/1500) when action folded to the player in the cutoff who raised all in for 16000. Moreno called from the small blind.

Andrew Moreno: A‚ô£7‚ô¶

Opponent: Ax9x

Moreno was dominated but he had luck on his side as the flop fell 6‚ô•7‚ô•7‚ô† giving him trips. Things got better for Moreno as the case 7‚ô£ dropped on the turn giving him quads leaving his opponent drawing dead to the 8‚ô• river. That hand helped Moreno reach 200000 in chips.

Moreno Sets Up Two Opponents

On Day 3 in Level 18 (5000/10000/10000) Moreno had around 225000 when he looked down at KxKx and raised to 16000 from early position. The player in the cutoff called with what turned out to be Kx8x and the big blind came along with 4x4x.

When the flop fell Kx8x4x with two diamonds both the player in the big blind and Moreno checked. The cutoff bet 22000 the big blind check-raised to 60000 and Moreno jammed.

The big blind re-jammed for around 800000 while the cutoff called off for approximately 600000.

A 10x bricked on the turn followed by a Jx on the river and Moreno tripled on the hand to 670000.

Moreno Calls River For His Tournament Life

On Day 5 in Level 27 (40000/80000/80000) action folded around to Andrew Moreno who limped in the small blind. Anthony Huntsman raised to 250000 out of the big and Moreno came along.

The flop came 7‚ô†8‚ô£2‚ô†. Both players checked.

The turn was the J‚ô¶. Moreno led with a bet of 390000 which Huntsman called.

The river came the 10‚ô†. After a Moreno check Huntsman shoved all in to put Moreno to the test.

""I‚Äôm going to put the chips in and if I have to leave here back home to San Diego at least I know that I went with my gut.""

Moreno took off his sunglasses and looked up getting ready for a long tank. He studied Huntsman and replayed the hand in his head while looking at the board. After a few minutes he placed a few chips in the middle for the call.

Huntsman immediately indicated ""good call"" and turned over the K‚ô†7‚ô£. Moreno then tabled the winner which was the Q‚ô•10‚ô• for second pair enough to take down a pot worth 4.1 million.

""Once I check and my opponent moved all in after I put the hand together what I thought about how my opponent would play his value hands I really thought I needed to call with my hand"" Moreno told PokerNews. ""However putting all the money in was really difficult for me. Most of the time I was thinking was me just being really sure I wanted to do it.""

He continued: ""I just said I have to do this for myself I think this is right. I‚Äôm going to put the chips in and if I have to leave here back home to San Diego at least I know that I went with my gut.""

Andrew Moreno & Clayton Maguire heads-up.

The Triple-Barrel Bluff

On Day 6 in Level 33 (150000/300000/150000) it was heads-up against Clayton Maguire and Hand #201 on the final table when Maguire limped. Moreno raised to 1600000 and Maguire called.

The flop came 5‚ô•A‚ô£A‚ô¶. Moreno bet 900000 Maguire called. The turn was the J‚ô•. Maguire called a bet of 2600000 from Moreno.

The river was the A‚ô† to put three aces on board. Moreno loaded up for a third barrel grasping chips from his stack and this time fired for a whopping 4800000. Maguire took his time but eventually he folded.

Moreno tabled the 9‚ô¶2‚ô£ bluff and took in the pot.

Moreno Catches Ten For Huge Double

On Hand #210 in the same level Moreno limped the button and Maguire raised to 1500000. Moreno three-bet to 5400000. Maguire then four-bet over the top all in. Moreno checked his cards and kind of raised his eyebrows before calling.

Moreno was suddenly at risk and behind holding the A‚ô†10‚ô• vs the A‚ô•Q‚ô£ of Maguire who had to fade the board to take home the title.

The flop hit Moreno as it came the K‚ô£10‚ô£7‚ô¶. The turn was the 2‚ô¶ and the river the K‚ô† to give Moreno the massive double and snatch the win from Maguire's grasp.

Moreno Closes It Out

In what would be the final hand of the tournament which was #215 on the final table Maguire would once again be on the receiving end of bad luck. It happened when Maguire moved all in for 5.5 million from the button and Moreno called.

Clayton Maguire: A‚ô£K‚ô£

Andrew Moreno: A‚ô†Q‚ô†

Maguire was on the better end of the big-ace cooler though the K‚ô†5‚ô†Q‚ô¶ flop made things interesting by not only giving him top pair but also giving Moreno a pair and flush draw.

The Q‚ô• turn vaulted Moreno into the lead with trips and he closed out the tournament after the 8‚ô¶ completed the board on the river.

Moreno shook hands with Maguire who finished as the 2021 Wynn Millions runner-up for $1443757.

Whether we‚Äôre talking about the needs of central Minnesota or northern Minnesota where we live it can be hard to make our voices heard. This is especially true on the topics of climate and energy policy when utilities (and the news outlets covering them) resort to the simple and easy soundbites we‚Äôve all heard before: It‚Äôs always liberal urban environmentalists versus conservative rural pragmatists. Or hopeful calls for 100% clean energy versus the practical energy needs of Minnesota‚Äôs manufacturing industry. Or naive youth activists versus down-to-earth workers.

We reject these simple binary stories and we hope you will too.

Did you know that more than two out of every three Minnesotans think there should be strict limits on how much carbon dioxide perhaps the most-common greenhouse gas gets emitted from coal-fired power plants? In fact the Yale Climate Opinions Map found a majority of Minnesotans in every county in the state in support of limiting carbon-dioxide emissions including in Itasca County home of Minnesota Power's Boswell coal power plant.

Similarly a MN350 poll found that ‚Äúroughly two-thirds (66%) of Minnesotans (who are registered voters) think the No. 1 goal of Minnesota‚Äôs energy policy should be transitioning 100% of the state‚Äôs energy to clean renewable sources.‚Äù

Fortunately we don‚Äôt have to choose between addressing the climate crisis or championing Minnesota workers. The alternatives are not transitioning to clean energy or supporting Minnesota businesses. We are not faced with protecting our natural resources or receiving reliable and affordable electricity. We can do all those things and more.

But we can‚Äôt do those things if Minnesota continues to throw money at fossil gas. Fortunately Xcel Energy Minnesota‚Äôs largest utility recently announced it will not be building a new gas plant in Becker Minnesota as had been proposed. Instead the utility is expanding its investment in clean renewable energy. It took advocates and community members from across Minnesota to help convince Xcel Energy to change its plans.

Unfortunately Minnesota Power Minnesota‚Äôs second-largest utility still wants to partner with Dairyland Power and build a new fossil gas plant in Superior. This would be a bad deal for Minnesota and could cost customers hundreds of millions of dollars commit us to burning fossil fuels for decades to come and threaten both our air and our health. Not only would this plant threaten our future (and blatantly contradict the promise Minnesota Power has made to shift to renewable energy by 2050) it would threaten our present: The climate crisis is here and is hurting people right now especially marginalized communities like the disability community.

While the climate crisis is here right now we can still change our future. We still have time to choose clean energy instead and commit to what Minnesotans want: renewable reliable affordable energy that costs less than burning fossil fuels that boosts our green-energy economy that is better for our environment and health and that will continue to show the Midwest and the world that Minnesota is a clean-energy leader.

Nelson 74 sold his majority interest in commercial real estate firm Nelson Tietz & Hoye to senior management in 2017.

He looked forward to joining Nancy in an active retirement around family friends travel and volunteerism.

They met at West High in Madison Wis. in the 1960s.

""I was shocked when she got sick"" Russ Nelson said. ""She ran a half-marathon at 65. Here she was at 71 with cancer. She never smoked. Ate well drank moderately. But pancreatic cancer doesn't care.

""I think I got really emotional only once and crawled into the corner. She got kind of mad at me about that. But we lived in hope. And she told us to find our joy.""

Through the ups and downs of treatment Nancy focused on her good fortune. She wrote a book called ""Joy!"" in 2019 illustrated with her own photographs. It helped a time of struggle also be a ""very rich and full year"" her husband said. In 2020 she compiled a second book of photos and thoughts called ""Gratitude"" for ""the success of the treatments and the extra time I have been given.""

In 1989 she founded the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting later renamed Teenwise Minnesota.

Nancy started her social service career with the Family Partnership which works with low-income families and vulnerable kids. She served as an employee or board member for 35 years. The newly refurbished headquarters of the Family Partnership is at Bloomington Avenue and E. Lake Street.

The facility includes the ""Four Directions"" preschool and early-childhood learning center predominantly serving American Indian families. Russ Nelson and other generous donors he solicited helped acquire and redevelop an old commercial building that will benefit hundreds of low-income families annually.

The board wanted to name the preschool's main room for Nancy Nelson. She didn't want that. Nancy loved loons and so it became the ""Loon Room.""

The couple also were volunteers and funders with the St. Paul Public Schools Foundation Como Park Zoo and other causes. Nancy told Russ that he needed to stay busy after her death.

""Nancy told me 'I want you to find your joy every day'"" Nelson recalled. ""Your family friends and community needs you and you will need them. I am guided by that.

""I had a successful career at NTH and all those real estate projects. On the home front and in nonprofit work she was the lead. I did what she wanted. She had good judgment and common sense. And she touched a lot of people in meaningful ways.""

Nelson and NTH managed transactions that involved new headquarters for U.S. Bancorp Xcel Energy and the former Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis; Health Partners in Bloomington; and Ecolab in St. Paul. There were many more deals over 30 years that changed the Minneapolis and St. Paul skylines.

A onetime chairman of the Minneapolis Downtown Council Nelson helped create the Minneapolis Downtown Improvement District and the district ambassadors who increased hospitality and safety and also cleanliness and recycling. He's still a volunteer.

He established a mentoring program for real estate students with Prof. Mary Daugherty at the University of St. Thomas business school. He's helping the University of Minnesota with real estate issues. And he's working with the schools and industry to attract more minority talent. He doesn't take any money. He appreciates the opportunity and thanks.

Nelson father of three and grandfather of seven has been gratefully sober for 35 years. You need to be sharp when you hang out weekly with 5-year-old twin grandchildren.

Nelson is helping granddaughter Sylvie who lives in England write a book about the last year. It's called: ""Marvelous Ms. Mabel: How Our Golden Doodle Helped Us Get Through the Pandemic."" It's being published by Minnesota Children's Press of Grand Marais the publisher of Nancy Nelson's two books.

Richard Leider author and senior fellow at the University of Minnesota's Center for Spirituality and Healing talks about the importance of ""purpose"" in life and retirement.

And Dr. Balkrishna Jahagirdar Nancy's cancer doctor at St. Paul's Regions Hospital told Russ that surviving spouses who do the best have purpose. Nelson also has long served that public hospital as volunteer director and fundraiser.

""He said he was proud of me"" Nelson said. ""It didn't take the sting [of Nancy's death] away. But I've got my kids and grandchildren. And it's about helping others.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3Rtai5jb20vd3Rtai1jb252ZXJzYXRpb25zLzIwMjEvMDcvMTEvd3Rtai1jb252ZXJzYXRpb25zLWNoZWxsc2llLW1lbW1lbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WTMJ Conversations: Chellsie Memmel,"Wisconsin native Chellsie Memmel was a member of the United States women‚Äôs gymnastics team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

A portion of the conversation was transcribed by eCourt Reporters Inc.

LIBBY COLLINS: You went back to normal life. You got married you had two kids.

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yep. Yep.

LIBBY COLLINS: And here this year you said ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to try it again.‚Äù

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yeah.

LIBBY COLLINS: Ten years away from competition almost. How did you make that decision?

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: It was not one I made lightly. And it just ‚Äî it started as wanting to get in shape after my kids and then just was having so much fun doing it and doing gymnastics again. And you know I was the last one to say all right I‚Äôm going to come back I‚Äôm going to try to actually compete instead of just you know playing around in the gym. That ‚Äî it was a lot and it was very you know emotional signing up as an athlete again. And then emotional again like oh my gosh my sister signed me up for my first competition and I was like okay I‚Äôm like doing this. So it was ‚Äî it was a lot but it‚Äôs been quite the journey.

LIBBY COLLINS: But how many other 30-year-olds are doing that?

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Not too many. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs many in our country that are trying to be at you know at the elite level. There are some more internationally that are doing it but ‚Äî but yeah.

LIBBY COLLINS: But I mean a lot of them are half your age literally.

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yes. Yes.

LIBBY COLLINS: What‚Äôs that emotion as you‚Äôre kind of looking at them saying yeah I remember when I was 15 16 years old doing this?

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yeah.

LIBBY COLLINS: And here you are 32 at the time.

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yes I was. You know I try not to look at an age too much but it is I‚Äôm like yep you were not alive when I was at my first world championship and that‚Äôs fine.

LIBBY COLLINS: Do you think it would have been different had the Olympics been held last year instead of this year? If they hadn‚Äôt been delayed for the pandemic do you think it might have had a little different outcome for you?

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Oh absolutely. I don‚Äôt even think I would have even given it a shot. There was not enough time.

LIBBY COLLINS: Oh really. So ‚Äî

CHELLSIE MEMMEL: Yes.

LIBBY COLLINS: ‚Äî now you‚Äôve got three more years to think about it do you think you‚Äôll try to come back one more time?

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it goes when art‚Äôs in your genes‚Äù he said.

Born in Pleasant Grove to artist parents Moton became one of the early pioneers of the city‚Äôs graffiti scene in the 1990s before going on to work on projects with brands like LIDS Playboy and the Dallas Mavericks.

What was more unlikely was that the Dallas native would take on one of the world‚Äôs most powerful brands in the U.S. Supreme Court ‚Äî and live to tell the tale.

Moton is the founder and designer of YUMS an Arlington-based streetwear brand first launched in 2007. YUMS ‚Äî an acronym for You Understand My Style ‚Äî recently relaunched its signature combinations of hats and shoes after an eight-year recovery from a legal battle with Nike that went all the way to the highest court in the land leaving the brand nearly broke.

From graffiti to sneakers

As a teenager growing up in Pleasant Grove in the early 1990s Moton found himself drawn to graffiti art and the community of other young artists working in Dallas. The pre-internet age meant that Moton and his fellow artists didn‚Äôt have many references or resources leading to the development of a style that was unlike the tags that adorned New York City subway cars or walls in Los Angeles ‚Äî it was a style Moton describes as uniquely Dallas.

‚ÄúWe were just smart kids‚Äù Moton said. ‚ÄúWe found our way through it and eventually got pretty good.‚Äù

Soon the art was good enough to transform the kids‚Äô weekend entertainment into a series of more serious projects leading to the formation of Infinity Crew one of Dallas‚Äôs first graffiti crews. Combining clean lines and bright colors art by Tex and the rest of Infinity Crew became well-known both in the Dallas street art community and beyond.

In his work with Infinity Crew Moton continually reimagined what graffiti could be. Why not do the same for shoes?

A self-described foodie Moton remembers Dallas institutions like Gonzales Tex-Mex in Pleasant Grove and Elaine‚Äôs Jamaican Kitchen in South Dallas bringing a smile to his face with their delicious food. Moton wanted to connect the initial excitement of receiving a new pair of sneakers to the thrill of opening a favorite snack or seeing a delicious meal arrive at the table.

Instead of focusing on traditional colorways Moton‚Äôs line would be centered around different flavors combining fashion and food to create a new way for fans to relate to sneakers.

In 2007 Moton launched YUMS with its Sweet Series collection which quickly became a hit in the streetwear world. Each YUMS flavor has the brand‚Äôs signature clear sole which displays graffiti-inspired art designed by Tex that celebrates the flavor‚Äôs inspiration.

How does a flavor get from the pantry shelf to the sole of a YUMS sneaker? Moton deconstructs all the elements of a snack ‚Äî including flavor texture and color ‚Äî and puts them back together again thinking about how the elements of the food translate to the elements of a shoe.

‚ÄúIt really embodies that item that we‚Äôre expressing in that moment from rainbow sherbet to a classic cupcake to a mixed berry tart ‚Äî all of that is really represented in the shoe itself‚Äù Moton said.

Moton reaches to pick up the brand‚Äôs unreleased chicken and waffles flavor displaying a red and white pattern on the sole of the shoe reminiscent of classic checkered tablecloths at chicken shacks. On the top of the shoe yellow represents a crisp buttery waffle and tan suede calls to mind the texture of crunchy fried chicken. (Moton‚Äôs Dallas go-to for chicken and waffles? Jonathon‚Äôs in Oak Cliff.)

Moton saw the marriage of fashion and food as a natural one. ‚ÄúI just have always found pleasure happiness and comfort in certain foods and I think a lot of people really relate to and can connect with food‚Äù he said.

Nike battle

Despite the early success of YUMS things haven‚Äôt always been sweet for the brand.

In July 2009 Nike sued Already LLC YUMS‚Äôs parent company alleging that the silhouette of YUMS shoes violated the trademark for Nike‚Äôs popular Air Force 1 sneaker. Later that year Already filed a counterclaim against Nike arguing that Nike‚Äôs trademark negatively affected YUMS‚Äô ability to sell its shoes and attract investors. The counterclaim sought to invalidate Nike‚Äôs trademark for the shoe and move the trademark for the Air Force 1 into the public domain.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard‚Äù Moton said of the lawsuit. ‚ÄúNike is a giant in that industry.‚Äù

Moton had been a fan of Nike‚Äôs classic styles when he was growing up but he said the lawsuit was a devastating blow for him as well as for Already and YUMS. ‚ÄúIt sucks to get attacked and told to burn all your shoes by someone you admire so much‚Äù he said.

Fortunately Nike backed down. While the suit was pending Nike sent a March 2010 letter to Already that promised a covenant not to sue meaning that Nike would not attempt to bring any further trademark claims against YUMS for any of its products. Nike moved to dismiss both its original claim and Already‚Äôs counterclaim but Already appealed the dismissal of its claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and continued to press for the dismissal of Nike‚Äôs trademark.

Both the district court and the appeals court held that the counterclaim was invalid because no ‚Äúsubstantial controversy‚Äù remained given that Nike had promised that it would not bring any further claims against Already and YUMS under the covenant not to sue.

In January 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the rulings of the lower courts unanimously finding in favor of Nike and determining the case was moot. In the court‚Äôs opinion Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that it would be unlikely that YUMS could produce designs that would infringe upon Nike‚Äôs trademark and were not already protected under the covenant.

‚ÄúIf such a shoe exists the parties have not pointed to it there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it and we cannot conceive of it‚Äù Roberts wrote. ‚ÄúIt sits as far as we can tell on a shelf between Dorothy‚Äôs ruby slippers and Perseus‚Äôs winged sandals.‚Äù

Although the ruling was in favor of Nike Moton and the YUMS team don‚Äôt view the outcome as a loss.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just happy to be able to make our shoes again without being threatened by Nike‚Äù Moton said.

YUMS isn‚Äôt the first streetwear brand to get caught in Nike‚Äôs crosshairs. In March of this year Nike sued Brooklyn-based MSCHF over its ‚ÄúSatan Shoes‚Äù modified Nike Air Max 97s that featured a drop of human blood and a pentagram charm and were promoted by rapper Lil Nas X. As part of a settlement agreement with Nike MSCHF agreed to offer refunds and accept returns of the 666 pairs of limited-edition shoes which sold out online less than a minute after their launch.

Looking forward

While the extensive legal battle meant that YUMS needed time to recover financially Moton never stopped creating. In the years between the court‚Äôs ruling and the relaunch of YUMS Moton continued his work as chief creative officer of Arlington-based Already Design Co. which designs apparel accessories and digital media for high-profile clients including LIDS Playboy Gas Monkey Garage and Discovery Channel. Moton also continued to stay involved in the Dallas graffiti scene and worked on projects with local institutions like Dallas Love Field and the Dallas Mavericks.

Moton designed the Mavs‚Äô 2019-20 City Edition jersey celebrating Deep Ellum and the artistic culture that originally nurtured his talent. While graffiti may not be typically connected with Dallas Moton says it‚Äôs a special recognition for those who have been a part of the city‚Äôs street art culture.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so rich for people who are here and grow up seeing it and being a part of it‚Äù he said.

As the YUMS relaunch continues Moton is looking forward to a delicious ‚Äî and hopefully lucrative ‚Äî holiday season with new flavors inspired by the familiar comfort foods of Thanksgiving and Christmas. He credits the survival of YUMS to the perseverance and commitment of his team members. Although he views himself as the underdog Moton‚Äôs lifetime of innovation has prepared him well to persevere through tough times.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to still be standing after taking some blows‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you stay in something long enough and if you believe in it wholeheartedly and just keep pushing forward you‚Äôll see the other side of things.‚Äù

Where to find YUMS

YUMS products can be purchased from the brand‚Äôs website at yumslife.com. Shoes from YUMS Collection 1 are $125 and hats are $30.
