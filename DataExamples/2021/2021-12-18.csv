The best face masks for use against COVID-19 [Updated],"With a new surge in COVID-19 cases looming and many people gearing up to travel for the holiday season we've refreshed our face mask buying guide with updated recommendations and guidance.

This past March we updated this face mask buying guide with the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) including new science on the increased effectiveness of double-masking. Vaccinations had just started rolling out and we were on the verge of what many hoped would be a ""return to normal"" only for the public to be swiftly reminded that SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 continues to circulate mutate and claim lives.

The omicron variant is the latest variant of concern following late-summer and early-winter surges in US COVID cases spurred by the highly contagious delta variant. Early studies of omicron indicate that it’s even more transmissible—and potentially more likely to cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. The Biden administration has released new plans to combat rising infections and the emergent omicron variant. Naturally proper masking is key.

Heading into the holidays with all of this in mind—and with generally improved conditions in the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE)—we thought now would be a good time for a booster on mask knowledge. Our newly updated mask guide includes information on how to double-mask effectively how to reuse KN95 and N95 masks safely how to maximize a surgical mask's effectiveness how to choose and clean great cloth masks and more. Below are our latest picks based on product availability and long-term testing.

The TL;DR version

Our picks for N95 KN95 surgical and ASTM-certified masks

With the crisis-level global mask shortage back from the brink nonsurgical N95 masks are no longer emergency-approved for medical use by the Food and Drug Administration. As former CDC Director Tom Frieden told The Washington Post it was never entirely clear if buying N95 masks from retailers took away supply from health care professionals although he cautioned that it might. At this point we can be more confident that it won't: medical institutions are seeing replenished stock of surgical N95 masks which they're instructed to use.

Nonsurgical N95s are available for the public to purchase and provide those at high risk of developing severe illness with the highest level of protection possible. KN95s tested to the same filtration standard are the next best thing but they lack the same fit standards incorporating ear loops rather than tighter-fitting head straps for example. Our ASTM-certified picks (which similarly use ear loops) also achieved greater than 95 percent filtration in certified testing and right now they're generally easier to purchase than KN95s. One of our picks by 3M can be picked up at your local Target for instance.

Our favorite N95 mask

Fangtian N95 Respirator Face Mask 10-Pack (Foldable): $13 at Amazon (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)

Still finding legitimate NIOSH-approved N95 masks at reasonable prices can be tough. Suzhou Fangtian's N95 masks first came to our attention early in 2021 as one of the few reasonably priced N95 masks available for purchase at the time. Apart from the approachable cost they also stood out for being fully certified NIOSH-approved N95 masks. Referencing both NIOSH's own approved list of N95 manufacturers and models and the FDA's list of known counterfeits  we can say that these are solid legitimate N95 masks. The third-party seller doling out the masks has a 99 percent positive feedback rating on Amazon after more than 80000 lifetime reviews.

Being N95s the Fangtian masks use head straps as opposed to ear loops and they provide a snug fit for medium to large face sizes. This fold-flat ""duckbill"" style makes for easy storage and an excellent fit for a wide variety of facial contours thereby minimizing unfiltered airflow. The nose wire is malleable yet sturdy and it has a thin foam lining along the inside of the mask for better comfort along the nose bridge. This also helps to stop the gapping that often occurs with masks around the nose area. The end result is a glove-like fit around the face with no noticeable leaks.

These masks are a particularly great deal now at $13 for a pack of 10 down from $40 when we first recommended them thanks to increased PPE supplies.

A great KN95 mask

KN95 Respirator Face Mask 20-pack: $30 at Amazon (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)

KN95 masks have often been called the Chinese equivalent of N95s. Although filtration efficacy may be similar fit durability and many other factors separate the two mask types. Still KN95s can be a worthy alternative for public use since the FDA no longer authorizes their use in health care settings.

For the public they're a great alternative to the more fixed nature of N95s as their ear loops make them much easier to take on and off than the head straps of an N95 allow. Even better they're much lower on the list of masks that could be called on again for emergency use in health care settings. KN95s from various manufacturers have been tested by NIOSH for filtration efficacy; the main challenge is finding quality KN95s to buy.

Dongguan Arun's KN95s have been on our list since the prior update to this guide in March. Not only is their nose wire sturdier than those of most other KN95s we've tested but the shape and less rigid construction of the mask itself allows for a better seal than most competing options. Arun's masks were previously tested and included in the FDA's (now revoked) emergency-approved non-NIOSH respirators for health care workers. The tests showed a maximum filtration efficacy of 100 percent and a minimum of 95.22 for this model.

The fit on these tends to favor somewhat larger face types so if you're on the smaller side our pick for an ASTM-certified disposable mask might suit you better while offering the same protective properties.

A high-filtration ASTM-certified mask

3M Advanced Face Filtering Mask 5-pack: $11 at Amazon (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)

Among the masks tested to the new ASTM F3502-21 Standard for Barrier Face Coverings 3M's Advanced Face Filtering Mask rises to the top for its 99 percent particulate-filtration efficiency. It's important to remember that unlike N95s that are tested for leakage and fit ASTM's F3502 standard tests only for the filter materials' efficacy and breathability. Thus the 99 percent figure isn't representative of real-world use as an N95 mask's minimum filtration measurement of 95 percent (which does account for differential pressure fit leakage and more). Furthermore the filtration tests themselves differ slightly so this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. Still the new ASTM standard provides useful results for efficacy in blocking submicron particulates the figures of which are listed on the CDC's website.

Like KN95s 3M's mask uses ear loops rather than head straps. Each mask includes a plastic hook that can hold the ear loops together behind your head to create a similar fit to a head strap-equipped mask however. I preferred wearing mine that way as it enhanced the mask's seal around my face. Compared to N95s that use head straps to achieve a better fit this hook is much easier to undo and redo when I'm in situations where easier removal is needed.

The nose wire is sturdy and malleable although the angle at which it bends is rather sharp. It may take a bit of molding to achieve an ideal fit along the nose bridge. These masks aren't a great choice for larger face sizes either but they should fit well on small to medium face types.

ASTM-certified US-made surgical masks (with a mask brace)

Armbrust’s Better Mask High Filtration System helps you to use a single surgical mask at its highest efficacy. Generally it’s recommended to use a surgical mask in tandem with a more form-fitting cloth mask over it (see our section on double-masking below). This improves fit and adds another layer of protection from liquids. But using a surgical mask with a mask fitter is another option for creating a tight seal and bolstering surgical masks’ filtration properties.

Manufactured at and sold from the company’s Texas-based facility Armbrust’s system comes with 30 masks and one mask fitter made by Fix the Mask another US-based manufacturer. Surgical masks use non-woven hydrophobic materials that have been lauded for their filtration efficacy and the Armbrust system is no exception. Their masks were able to achieve 97 percent filtration of particulates under 1 micron according to ASTM F3502-21 results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXJwcmVzcy5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tc3AwNDY2MTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry L.

The press conference took place in front of the first phase of the wall being built on state land managed by the Texas General Land Office (GLO).

The Governor was joined by GLO Commissioner George P. Bush and Texas Facilities Commission (TFC) Chairman Steven Alvis who spoke of the progress made to secure our southern border by building the Texas border wall. Senator Kelly Hancock Representative James White Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw and Texas Military Department Adjutant General Tracy Norris and Deputy Adjutant General Monie Ulis were also in attendance.

On June 16 Governor Abbott announced the State of Texas' plan for the border wall and authorized the transfer for $250 million as a down payment to launch construction. He also directed the TFC to hire a program manager to oversee its construction. In September a program manager was selected to lead the process of planning and executing the border wall. The Governor also signed House Bill 9 into law that month providing an additional $1.8 billion in state funding for border security including border wall construction.

""The State of Texas has taken comprehensive action to secure our southern border and address the border crisis while President Biden has sat idly by"" said Governor Abbott. ""In June I promised Texans that we would step up in the federal government's absence and build our own border wall. We have wasted no time in the six months since that promise was made and I am proud to announce that construction of the Texas border wall is now underway. Today not only represents the first phase of the Texas border wall but it also serves as a major milestone in our efforts to combat illegal immigration stop the smuggling of drugs and people and keep our communities safe.""

Abbott Commissioner Bush Say Construction Of Border Wall On State Lands Has Begun,"RIO GRANDE CITY Texas (CBSDFW.COM) - Today Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush and Governor Greg Abbott said construction of the border wall on government-owned lands in Starr County had begun.

Bush and Abbott's announcement was made at the same location where Bush announced late last month that the General Land Office (GLO) and Department of Public Safety (DPS) had reached an agreement to begin construction on the proposed wall.

Bush thanked Abbott for supporting the wall's construction and called it an important safety measure for Texas.

""We will not stop until this wall is built and our border is secure. Fighting for border security requires a team effort and I thank Governor Abbott the state legislature and our other partner agencies for their support of this cause"" Bush said.

The wall's construction has been a point of controversy for years after being proposed by then-candidate Donald Trump before the 2016 election. One of Trump's electoral promises was to begin building the wall.

However he was unable to deliver on those promises. After Joe Biden was elected in 2020 and ordered a halt to the construction process Texas officials took it upon themselves to see the wall to completion.

Texas' plans also proved controversial. Some families refused to allow their private land to be used for the wall sparking a battle over Texas' use of imminent domain laws to seize land for its construction.

Democratic officials in Texas were critical of the plan including El Paso State Representative Mary Gonzalez who called the wall a waste of money and an ""abuse of executive authority.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3RleGFzLWdvdi1hYmJvdHQtYm9yZGVyLXdhbGwtc292ZXJlaWdudHktc3RhdGXSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS91cy90ZXhhcy1nb3YtYWJib3R0LWJvcmRlci13YWxsLXNvdmVyZWlnbnR5LXN0YXRlLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Gov. Abbott shows completed section of state-made border wall pledges to protect state's sovereignty,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott debuted the first part of the state-made border wall Saturday which he labeled a sharp rebuke of Biden’s ""failure to do his job.""

Abbott authorized the building of the wall six months ago and then authorized $3 billion funding for the Texas Facilities Commission to bolster the building effort. Abbott stressed that the wall stands on either state land or land that private owners agreed to hand over for the wall.

""Texas is taking what truly is unprecedented action: A state to build a wall on our border to safeguard the sovereignty of our state and of our nation"" Abbott said during Saturday's press conference.

""Already this year there have been over 1.2 million people apprehended coming over the border illegally"" Abbott said noting the number did not include those who entered undetected.

He also raised the fentanyl crisis saying that state authorities have seized ""enough fentanyl to kill every man woman and child in Texas California New York Illinois and Florida combined.""

Texas has therefore deemed it necessary to take action and establish a border wall which is composed of steel bars. A TFC official said the materials and labor will come from local sources including the steel used to produce the bars.

BORDER CRISIS CONTINUES NOVEMBER ENCOUNTERS UP 140% OVER SAME TIME LAST YEAR

Abbott pointed to billions of dollars worth of material from the federal wall project that remains unused which he said the Biden administration has not agreed to turn over to help with the project.

Abbott described the wall as just one part of a ""multi-pronged"" strategy which will include efforts by the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety to apprehend individuals who illegally cross the border. Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush praised the speed with which building started and progressed pledging to continue that pace.

To demonstrate the building capability Abbott ordered a section of the wall raised after the press conference - a process that took only around 10 minutes as a crane slowly erected the wall segment then workers secured it at the base.

""Once it is completed it will have multiple detection devices"" Abbott said adding that the additional detection will allow swift apprehension.

""People we apprehend will be charged with trespassing to the state of Texas and those charges will lead to them going to jail"" he explained. Texas has researched a ""pre-defense"" for any criminal proceedings to ensure that ""all procedures will be followed.""

Greg Abbott launches construction of state border wall,"In this June 8 2021 file photo Texas Gov. Greg Abbott speaks at a news conference in Austin Texas. AP Photo/Eric Gay File

Texas appropriated approximately $1 billion in funding for the construction of a border wall.

Gov. Greg Abbott said many Texas landowners along the border are donating their property for the wall.

The Texas wall comes after Biden paused all federal border wall construction projects.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott traveled Saturday to Starr County on the US-Mexico border to launch the construction of a border wall funded by $1 billion in state appropriations and $54 million in private donations the Texas Tribune reported.

The Texas wall follows an executive order issued by President Joe Biden on his first day in office that paused federal border wall construction and called for a review of the projects. Biden went on to cancel multiple border wall contracts.

The lack of progress on the border wall prompted Abbott a Republican to take matters into his own hands announcing plans in June to build a wall along Texas's southern border without funding from the federal government.

""While Biden does nothing we are stepping up to protect our communities"" Abbott said in a tweet Saturday. ""The Lone Star State is securing the border.""

The engineering firm Posillico Civil Inc. which was awarded a $162 million contract from the Texas Facilities Commissioners in November had installed 880 feet of barrier by Saturday afternoon according to the Tribune.

In an interview with Fox News on Friday Abbott said some of the construction crew enlisted for the project previously worked on the Trump administration's border wall but added his wall will be built at a faster pace than the former president's.

""There are so many large landowners on the border who are so fed up with the Biden administration they are allowing Texas to build the border wall on their property"" Abbott told host Tucker Carlson. ""We have 100 miles or so of land that's being donated to the state of Texas for us to build the wall to better secure our border.""

From deploying National Guard soldiers to repurposing shipping containers into a makeshift border wall Abbott has authorized additional support in an effort to increase border security over the last several months. In September he signed a nearly $1.8 billion border security bill into law which earmarked $750 million for the border wall project.

Fjord Trends which is focused on customer behaviour and its resulting impact on society culture and business for the coming year is crowdsourced from across Accenture Interactive’s global network of 2000+ designers and innovators in more than 40 locations.

According to the report newly identified behaviours will challenge businesses to rethink their approach to design innovation and growth as a result of the shifts in employee expectations and mindset scarcity caused by disrupted supply chains and new virtual environments such as the metaverse.

“Don’t underestimate the degree of relationship change we are seeing – or the role of business in responding to it” says Mark Curtis head of global innovation and thought leadership at Accenture Interactive.

“The choices that businesses make next might affect our world and its structure in more ways than we can imagine and it all points to shifts in people’s relationships – with colleagues brands society places and with those they care about. “There are challenging times ahead but also great opportunities for businesses to stitch together positive relationships to create a fabric of life that is good for people society and the planet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvbWFyay10by1tYXJrZXQvYXR0cml0aW9uLWZhbGxzLWF0LWFjY2VudHVyZS1jYW4taXQtaGVhdmUtYS1zaWdoLW9mLXJlbGllZi0xMTYzOTkzNTczMjU5MS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvbWFyay10by1tYXJrZXQvYXR0cml0aW9uLWZhbGxzLWF0LWFjY2VudHVyZS1jYW4taXQtaGVhdmUtYS1zaWdoLW9mLXJlbGllZi9hbXAtMTE2Mzk5MzU3MzI1OTEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Attrition falls at Accenture; can IT heave a sigh of relief? | Mint,"There were two main takeaways for Indian information technology (IT) services investors from global IT company Accenture’s Q1FY22 earnings report released last week. One there are signs of attrition easing. Two Accenture’s management points out that demand conditions are extraordinary and robust.

To start with Accenture’s attrition rate fell by 200 basis points (bps) sequentially to 17% in Q1FY22. This was at a multi-quarter high of 19% in Q4FY21. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The company’s fiscal year ends in August and the quarter ending November is its first.

The sequential drop in attrition rate indicates that regular compensation increases and promotions are helping Accenture retain talent according to analysts. It also points to receding talent crunch pressures. In Q1FY22 the company added 50000 employees taking the total headcount to 674325.

The fall in attrition is a surprise given the hot labour market said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. “We note that a few Indian IT companies had indicated attrition levelling off in the September quarter while continuing to be at elevated levels for a few quarters. Accenture’s attrition figures emphasize the same and point to gradual easing of attrition to more manageable levels a positive for Indian IT"" said Kotak’s analysts in a report on 17 December.

The decline in Accenture’s attrition in Q1FY22 supports the brokerage house’s view that attrition risk is receding said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. It suggests some moderation in the supply crunch the brokerage firm said.

Attrition is pronounced at the lower end of the pyramid in India and the company has significantly lower attrition at the executive-and-above levels noted Accenture’s management.

The company’s management has guided for a 10-30bps improvement in margin in FY22 over FY21 levels despite supply-side pressures not being completely out of the way.

Accenture expects its operating margin for the full fiscal year to be in the 15.2–15.4% range. This would be driven by benefits from operating leverage and pricing improvements.

Accenture’s revenue growth performance was robust. Revenues increased by 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $14.97 billion in Q1FY22 ahead of its own guidance of $13.9 billion–$14.35 billion. With this the company exceeded revenue growth estimate by $600 million at the upper end of its guidance range.

Further Accenture’s management has raised its guidance for FY22 revenue growth from 12–15% to 19–22%. It also said that demand remains high. In FY22 it expects strong double-digit growth in consulting and double-digit growth in outsourcing. Earlier the Accenture management was expecting high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the outsourcing vertical where the company competes with Indian IT firms. Further it also reported record deal bookings of $16.8 billion in Q1FY22 up 30% y-o-y.

This bodes well especially for tier-I technology companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd as Accenture’s results are often seen as an indicator for the sector’s future performance. FY23 guidance of these companies will be closely watched as demand is likely to remain strong analysts said.

As such Indian IT stocks seem to be capturing the robust demand environment adequately. The Nifty IT index has risen as much as 51% so far this calendar year exceeding the 21% gain seen in the Nifty 50 index.

“We believe that a strong demand environment sustained acceleration in revenue growth and robust order booking will back higher valuations"" said analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on 16 December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL3NwZWNpYWxzL21vc3QtcG93ZXJmdWwtd29tZW4taW4tYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RvcnkvcmVraGEtbS1tZW5vbi1odW1hbml0eS1hdC1oZXItY29yZS0zMTYxMTMtMjAyMS0xMi0xOdIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9zcGVjaWFscy9tb3N0LXBvd2VyZnVsLXdvbWVuLWluLWJ1c2luZXNzL3N0b3J5L3Jla2hhLW0tbWVub24taHVtYW5pdHktYXQtaGVyLWNvcmUtMzE2MTEzLTIwMjEtMTItMTk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rekha M. Menon: Humanity at Her Core,"Year 2021’s only entrant into BT’s Most Powerful Women Hall of Fame (an exclusive club of seven-time winners of the MPW awards) Rekha M. Menon never loses sight of the most critical component in business—the people. “Compassion and putting our people first served as the North Star for all decisions during the toughest phases [of the pandemic]” says Menon Chairperson and Senior Managing Director of Accenture in India. In the second wave of the pandemic Menon introduced several initiatives such as medical care at home and hospitalisation support for Accenture’s employees and was among the first in its industry to announce vaccination cover for all 250000-plus employees and eligible dependents.

But it wasn’t all about Accenture. In May 2021 she worked with Accenture’s global CEO Julie Sweet to get a $25-million investment commitment for supporting India in its battle against Covid-19. “We are partnering with 15 NGOs to use this investment for impacting lives in remote and rural areas that need it the most—building healthcare infrastructure supporting the healthcare ecosystem including NGOs and vaccinating people in our communities” says Menon.

On the business front she helped clients navigate the financial and operational challenges and accelerated the company’s shift to digital thus providing business growth. Globally Accenture’s fiscal year ended August 2021 saw it clocking revenues of $50.5 billion and growth markets—of which India is a part—contributed $10.08 billion with revenue growth of 13 per cent.

Menon is also the first woman to be appointed as the Chairperson of NASSCOM this March. “Two of my goals are to strengthen the policy environment that aids growth of our industry and to establish India as the digital talent capital of the world” she says. Menon drew attention to the industry’s needs at the highest levels of government besides using public platforms and drove programmes and initiatives to move the needle.

After graduating with an honours degree in chemistry from Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne Justin Gray worked first as a scientist for the Australian Government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation then spent more than 21 years with global IT and services company Accenture eventually becoming managing director in New Zealand. In March 2020 he moved to Datacom as head of the firm’s New Zealand public sector (government services) group and eight months later became MD of technology services across both the public and private sectors.

I grew up on the other side of the ditch although I'm a New Zealand citizen now. I came from a family of a couple of cultures. Mum was from a very working-class Australian family. My dad is from Sri Lanka and moved to Australia when he was 17. For us Sunday lunch was a curry at one grandparents’ house and then it was a roast dinner at another grandparents’ house.

I think there were elements where dad and the family tried to subdue some of the Sri Lankan side to fit in. It's always easy to look back but I think I missed some of the opportunity to embrace it as much as I did when I was a bit older. It’s an important part of me.

One of my happiest childhood memories is of this little town on the south coast of New South Wales. One year my grandparents were driving through it towing their caravan and they broke down. The caravan got left there and that became the place we went for our holidays every Christmas and Easter. I still take my kids to that part of the world when we're in Australia.

My parents taught me my work ethic. When I was a kid my dad worked in an insurance office. Then he’d wait until everyone went home and he cleaned the office at night. He had the cleaning contract for the building. He did that so we’d have enough money to go on holiday.

One thing that sticks in my mind is my mum saying “There are no degrees of honesty.” I repeat that phrase all the time.

Justin Gray on his first visit to New Zealand in 1994 posing with former All Black Sean Fitzpatrick.

For the longest time I wanted to be a marine biologist but I realised it meant you would dedicate your life to investigating the reproduction of a sea slug or something so I ended up going into chemistry instead.

What drives me is curiosity. I like to unpack how things work. I started my career working for the CSIRO in Australia. I was developing biodegradable plastics. There were elements of that I really loved but I struggled with the slow pace of it. But if I could I’d still be a mad scientist.

When I look back at my career at some of the people I may have helped in some way to build a skill or to find a path or even given them a chance to do something that was a step up for them that’s what I’m proud of. I love that opportunity to do that.

I think my biggest mistake was that for a decent amount of my career I always looked up at people and felt like there was something I needed and something I was missing. Because it's easy to look at people who have more material things or have a bigger role. I felt that I needed to strive for that. And I think that was a big mistake. I realised I didn’t need a big house by the water I don't need a fancy car and I'm really at peace with that.

My best business advice is to be open-minded to have the curiosity and flexibility to take an opportunity that pops up.

It's rare that I'll lose sleep over something. I try to keep perspective. My sister is an intensive care nurse. If I've got something going on in my life that's really stressful it generally pales into insignificance when I compare it to what she does on a day-to-day basis. It puts my problems in a pretty small box.

I get up every morning and ride my bike to the gym do functional training or F45 and ride my bike back home. It switches my mind on and I'm energised for the day. I'm pretty regimented about it.

We've got a little property on the coast and on weekends I love doing practical things. I bought a Bobcat skid-steer loader and I drive it around and pick stuff up and move dirt. I like that because it's so different from what I do in my day job.

My secret passion is drones. I used to carry this big suitcase around when they first came out but they’ve got progressively smaller. It probably ties back to the curiosity thing and seeing the world from a different perspective. I’ve got my eye on a new one that came out about a week ago. I always want to fly the flashiest fastest one that can go the highest.

This article explains how to use Photoshop's Save for Web tool to optimize images for use on the web. This information applies to Photoshop 20.0.10 and later. Commands and menu options may differ between versions.



How to Save for Web in Photoshop

Graphic designers web designers and others who create content for the web also create web-ready images such as photos for websites and banner ads. Before uploading these images they optimize the images to download and display quickly in a web browser.

Here's how to use the Save for Web tool in Photoshop to get the right balance of image quality and file size for your images.

Open the image you want to save in Photoshop. Select Image > Image Size. Or for PC press Alt+Ctrl+I for macOS press Command+Option+I on the keyboard. In the Width field enter a new width select Pixels then select OK. Resize the photo to a small size that can be used on a website. Select File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy). Or use the keyboard shortcut: Alt/Option+Command+Shift+S. In other versions of Photoshop the path is File > Export > Save for Web. The item may be called Save for Web or Save for Web and Devices. In the Save for Web window go to the Original Optimized 2-Up and 4-Up tabs. These tabs switch between a view of the original photo the optimized photo with the Save for Web settings applied to it or a comparison of two or four versions of the photo. Choose 2-Up to compare the original photo with the optimized photo. This shows side-by-side copies of the image. Change the Quality value. As you lower the quality the image looks muddier and the file size goes down. Smaller files mean faster-loading web pages. Find a happy medium between file size and quality. A quality between 40 and 60 is a good range. Use the preset quality levels (JPEG Medium for example) to save time. Change the file type if needed to JPEG GIF PNG-8 PNG-24 or WBMP. Change the size of the image if needed. Enter a width or height or scale it by a percentage. Click the chain link icon to change the proportion of the image. Otherwise enter a different width or height to change the other value in proportion. The values below the image preview display the file type size and how long the image will take to open on a website. These numbers update as you make changes. When you're satisfied with the photo select Save. Type a name for the photo then click Save.

Above all no-one wants their work to be described as “low quality” – but the concept of “quality” has such a wide scope that there’s plenty of room for confusion ambiguity and lots of resentment.

This video has been on my to-do list for many years originally inspired by a client who demanded that their project was delivered as an uncompressed TIFF sequence – because some Google searching had suggested it was the only truly uncompressed format. While I’ve covered the topic of codecs compression and so-on before the point of this article is that the notion of “quality” extends far beyond the type of codec used. I still come across people who think that using a JPEG file is inconceivably awful while remaining blissfully ignorant of topics such as bit depth high-dynamic range and so on.

The thorny issue of “Quality” is definitely not restricted to After Effects users – but even in our broader industry it’s common to see cameras judged by their resolution with no regard paid to the lenses used or how well a scene is lit. Even more generally again there are countless films and series which look gorgeous but are let down by bad writing and possibly bad acting too.

Within After Effects itself there are many small details and overlooked settings which can have a bigger effect on the “quality” of the final render than simply choosing which codec you’re rendering too. This video demonstrates 14 tips to help your After Effects projects look as good as they can.

The findings published in Environmental Science & Technology also partly explain how PFAS get into the atmosphere and eventually precipitation. The study which collected samples from two Norwegian sites also concludes that the pollution “may impact large areas of inland Europe and other continents in addition to coastal areas”.

“The results are fascinating but at the same time concerning” said Bo Sha a Stockholm University researcher and study co-author.

PFAS are a class of chemicals used across dozens of industries to make products resistant to water stains and heat. Though the compounds are highly effective they are also linked to cancer kidney disease birth defects decreased immunity liver problems and a range of other serious diseases.

The study highlights the chemicals’ mobility once they’re released into the environment: PFAS don’t naturally break down so they continuously move through the ground water and air and their longevity in the environment has led them to be dubbed “forever chemicals”. They have been detected in all corners of the globe from penguin eggs in Antarctica to polar bears in the Arctic.

The Stockholm research team collected aerosol samples between 2018 and 2020 from Andøya an Arctic island and Birkenes a city in southern Norway. It found correlating levels of PFAS and sodium ions which are markers of sea spray. The chemicals’ transfer occurs when air bubbles burst as waves crash and the study found that PFAS can travel thousands of kilometers via sea spray in the atmosphere before the chemicals return to land.

Some regulators and the chemical industry have long claimed that dumping PFAS into the ocean is an appropriate disposal method because it dilutes the waste to a safe level. The study concluded that the approach isn’t safe because the chemicals are returned to land which can pollute drinking water sources among other issues.

“The common belief was that PFAS would eventually wash off into the oceans where they would stay to be diluted over the timescale of decades” said Matthew Salter a co-author of the study and researcher at Stockholm University. “But it turns out that there’s a boomerang effect and some of the toxic PFAS are re-emitted to air transported long distances and then deposited back onto land.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

What to know before becoming a guest or host,"Airbnb takes a unique approach toward lodging. Part of the “sharing economy” Airbnb offers you someone’s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. On Airbnb you can find places to crash on your backpacking trip through Europe or a spot to rent for a month during your internship in Los Angeles. It’s also a great way to explore a town you’re thinking about moving to or finding an alternative to traditional hotel options in 2022 if you’re just around for a weekend. If you want to rent out extra space in your own home you can host through Airbnb and make money for allowing a guest to stay the night.

This all sounds pretty simple but there’s much more to Airbnb than you might imagine. What is Airbnb exactly? Here’s what you need to know about the popular home-sharing site before you book a stay or become a host.

Airbnb’s originås

Airbnb founders Joe Gebbia Brian Chesky and Nathan Blecharczyk developed the business in 2008. Initially Gebbia and Chesky started off using their own place as a bed-and-breakfast to make a few extra bucks to pay rent. With a big design conference coming to the San Francisco area and a city full of sold-out hotels at the time they saw a potential market for the idea and developed a website called airbedandbreakfast.com.

The startup experienced several ups and downs and it went through at least three separate launches. Finally with new funding Air Bed & Breakfast became Airbnb in 2009 and that was the company’s turning point. Airbnb went public in 2020 under ABNB.

Here’s how Airbnb works for guests

Airbnb does not own properties. It acts as an intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent. Creating an account on Airbnb is free and it is relatively simple. To do so you enter your name email address birthday and a password. Airbnb also asks that you agree to treat everyone equally regardless of race religion sex or other factors. Once you agree your account is active. You also have the option to sign up through Facebook or Google.

Airbnb has listings all over the map  from Savannah Georgia to Honolulu Hawaii to international listings. The service currently has more than 5.6 million listings in roughly 220 countries around the world. Once you click on a listing you can see a range of information about that listing including the size of the space and its amenities check-in and pricing information a detailed description of the space house rules safety features and availability. You will also see reviews from other guests and information about the hosts. For instance the hosts of a listing in Honolulu say they “love surfing scuba diving kite surfing running and hiking the beautiful nature trails on Oahu.”

If you like the listing you can request to book it. The site prompts you to go through a few more steps like entering in more of your information. Once you complete those steps you can complete your request and pay for your room. After your first booking the process is much quicker and easier.

Before your reservation is final however you must wait for approval from the host unless your listing is an “instant book” listing as those listings don’t require host approval.

For non-instant book listings Airbnb also recommends that guests message hosts before booking to double-check availability. If you don’t hear back from the host in a timely manner you can continue to message other hosts in the area until you find one you like. Under the host information section of each listing you can see the host’s response rate and response time to get an idea of how quickly a host will respond to your message.

Airbnb also offers a higher “tier” of homes called Airbnb Plus an elite selection of properties that stand out for their excellent ratings or because of something particularly special about (part of a local landmark etc.). The average price for these is typically higher.

Airbnb hosts and guests do not exchange money in person. Guests pay for everything on the Airbnb site when they make their reservation even having the option to split costs between friends and hosts receive pay from Airbnb. Airbnb uses PayPal direct deposit and other payment methods.

Here’s how Airbnb works for hosts

Airbnb has different hosting options — you can rent out the extra space in your home you can rent out your entire home or you can host experiences in your area.

To rent out extra space in your home you must first create a free Airbnb account. You’ll also want to look into any fees or restrictions the areas you live in may require. Then click on “become a host” in the upper right corner of the page. After that you’ll need to create a listing for the space. A listing is a lot like a profile page for the space you want to host; just like a social media profile the nicer your page looks the more attention it will draw. It’s a good idea to make your space look as nice as possible and take flattering pictures of the space with good lighting. How much should you charge? Airbnb helps you set the pricing by indicating the averages for your area.

You can also make money on Airbnb by hosting an experience. “Airbnb experiences are activities designed and led by inspiring locals. They go beyond typical tours or classes by immersing guests in a host’s unique world” says the Airbnb site. If you want to host an experience review Airbnb’s quality standards which indicate requirements for experiences. Basically the guest must be gaining access to something participating in something and offered an original perspective. After reviewing the quality standards design an experience and submit it to Airbnb for approval. Once approved you are ready to publish and host your experience.

Airbnb fees and room pricing

In addition to the cost of the room Airbnb charges a guest service fee that typically maxes out at 14.2%. Hosts also pay a service fee of around 3% which Airbnb adds to each transaction. Hosts who offer experiences are subject to a 20% service fee.

The price of a room on Airbnb depends on a variety of factors including location the quality of the listing and the amenities. Prices are also subject to market inflation (something particularly notable in 2021) and may vary greatly depending on local demand. Currently the lowest room prices are around $50 which is usually less expensive than a hotel but these can be difficult to find depending on the area.

Average daily rates on Airbnb in 2021 are a good example of how much location matters. For example in the top 50 Airbnb cities prices ranged from an average of $646 per night in Key West Florida to $200 per night in Bend Oregon. Popular destinations will always cost significantly more on the service.

Airbnb safety and security

You may have heard reports of a guest destroying a host’s home a host endangering a guest’s safety or an Airbnb host watching a guest through a hidden camera. Airbnb has taken some actions to help promote safety and security for hosts and guests such as having users provide identification improving profile and review systems and implementing a host guarantee that reimburses eligible hosts for damages up to $1 million. Airbnb may also conduct public records checks such as sex offender registries to see if a user has a past record.

While safety issues exist with Airbnb hotel and motel guests also have safety and security concerns such as theft or fire. Because guests are entering someone’s home however the risks are a little different with Airbnb. The company offers safety tips for both hosts and guests . Other important safety additions include:

People under 25 may be banned from renting houses in their specific area: If someone is under 25 and has fewer than three positive reviews from past renting they won’t be able to rent whole houses period. Airbnb made this change to crack down on a trend of younger people renting Airbnbs for house parties. This situation was causing a lot of damage and in some unfortunate incidents even deaths so Airbnb changes its policies. The company has also issued a broad ban on any parties at any location.

Cleaning requirements and certification: In response to 2020 and COVID-19 Airbnb has instituted a new cleaning protocol that hosts can sign up for and earn certification in to both stay safe and help guarantee a safer experience for guests. This includes waiting 24 hours to go into a room after a guest has checked out and cleaning all the surfaces with approved disinfectants. Those who can’t follow these rules can use a 72-hour blackout period between guests to help ensure safety.

New rules specifically banning disruptive New Year’s Eve parties: These rules generally ban guests without a history of positive reviews from renting one-night Airbnbs on New Year’s.

Airbnb controversies

Airbnb isn’t all underwater aquarium rooms. It has invited its share of controversy and while Airbnb has been attempting to find ways to compromise with places that are yearning to see more regulation and order it’s an ongoing process. Critics have accused Airbnb of exacerbating the housing crisis in certain locations and lawsuits have been filed in some cases. Overall the number of Airbnb listings has fallen in the past couple of years as the company has been forced to pull many from the market.

This has also led to another important phenomenon: City laws specifically banning or limiting Airbnb rentals to help keep local housing and rental prices under control. Dozens and dozens of cities around the world have passed these restrictions with more on the way. In New York renting a home as a holiday Airbnb is illegal. In Berlin Airbnbs need approval from the Berlin Senate first. In San Francisco hosts must register with the city and be full-time residents of the house. Santa Monica makes them sign up for a business license and actively live in the home while it is being rented. Honolulu and New Orleans simply don’t allow any rentals for less than 30 days which tends to eliminate most Airbnb use. And so on.

Airbnb has also been accused of deleting negative reviews in the past. The company regularly updates its terms of service to deal with new issues and create new guidelines for hosts.

Should you use Airbnb?

One big benefit of using Airbnb is the lower cost as you can legitimately find a cheap place to stay on the site. It’s also useful because you are able to access a lot of detailed information about where you’ll be staying before you book and you can communicate with your host before your stay. If you are comparing Airbnb vs. a traditional hotel some things to think about are:

Privacy and access: Hotels are generally located centrally but Airbnb allows you to pick cabins cottages and rooms off the beaten path. These offer more privacy and may be closer to the outdoors allowing for a very different experience.

Hotels are generally located centrally but Airbnb allows you to pick cabins cottages and rooms off the beaten path. These offer more privacy and may be closer to the outdoors allowing for a very different experience. Amenities: Hotels have a variety of guaranteed amenities and food options but Airbnb rentals do not. Check the details to see if a rental offers Wi-Fi coffee and even electricity. If you want to make food while staying there check for a kitchen as well. If you are visiting a particularly hot or cold area check for heating and cooling too.

Rewards programs: Hotels can offer rewards programs and discounts and may partner with larger companies. These aren’t options with Airbnbs.

Hotels can offer rewards programs and discounts and may partner with larger companies. These aren’t options with Airbnbs. Pets: Pet hair can be an issue in Airbnbs especially if you rent a room that’s part of a larger house. On the other hand Airbnbs also make it easier to travel with your beloved pet.

Hosts should keep themselves well informed of the laws in their area. Renting a room in a home without a permit is a bit of a legal grey area in some places and doing so is completely illegal in others. Hosts should always review local laws and obtain the necessary insurance coverage before renting out space in their properties. In addition to potential legal issues there are also obvious safety concerns to worry about. When you book your stay make sure you know what you’re getting yourself into by reading the terms and conditions (including the fine print) as well as the reviews.

Guests booking a stay in an Airbnb property should follow the company’s best practices for staying safe. It’s never a bad idea to let a trusted friend or family member know the details of your stay too just in case.

Apache said version 2.16 ""does not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation"" and explained that it is vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105 a denial of service vulnerability. They said the severity is ""high"" and gave it a CVSS score of 7.5.

""Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example $${ctx:loginId}) attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. This is also known as a DOS (Denial of Service) attack"" Apache explained.

They added that the latest issue was discovered by Akamai Technologies' Hideki Okamoto and an anonymous vulnerability researcher.

Mitigations include applying the 2.17.0 patch and replacing Context Lookups like ${ctx:loginId} or $${ctx:loginId} with Thread Context Map patterns (%X %mdc or %MDC) in PatternLayout in the logging configuration. Apache also suggested removing references to Context Lookups in the the configuration like ${ctx:loginId} or $${ctx:loginId} where they originate from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input.

They noted that only the Log4j-core JAR file is impacted by CVE-2021-45105.

On Friday security researchers online began tweeting about potential issues with 2.16.0 with some identifying the denial of service vulnerability.

Discussion about Log4j has dominated conversation all week. CISA released multiple advisories mandating federal civilian agencies in the US apply patches before Christmas while several major tech companies like IBM Cisco and VMware have raced to address Log4j vulnerabilities in their products.

Security company Blumira claims to have found a new Log4j attack vector that can be exploited through the path of a listening server on a machine or local network potentially putting an end to the assumption that the problem was limited to exposed vulnerable servers.

Other cybersecurity firms have found that major ransomware groups like Conti are exploring ways to take advantage of the vulnerability.

Google released a security report on Friday where Open Source Insights Team members James Wetter and Nicky Ringland said they found that 35863 of the available Java artifacts from Maven Central depend on the affected Log4j code. This means that more than 8% of all packages on Maven Central have at least one version that is impacted by this vulnerability the two explained.

""The average ecosystem impact of advisories affecting Maven Central is 2% with the median less than 0.1%"" Wetter and Ringland said.

So far nearly 5000 artifacts have been patched leaving more than 30000 more. But the two noted that it will be difficult to address the issue because of how deep Log4j is embedded in some products.

""Most artifacts that depend on log4j do so indirectly. The deeper the vulnerability is in a dependency chain the more steps are required for it to be fixed. For greater than 80% of the packages the vulnerability is more than one level deep with a majority affected five levels down (and some as many as nine levels down)"" Wetter and Ringland wrote.

""These packages will require fixes throughout all parts of the tree starting from the deepest dependencies first.""

The two went on to say that after looking at all publicly disclosed critical advisories affecting Maven packages they found less than half (48%) of the artifacts affected by a vulnerability have been fixed meaning it may take years for the Log4j issue to be solved.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ARE,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2Z5aW1ieS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9yZW5kZXJpbmdzLXJldmVhbGVkLWZvci1taWxsYnJhZS1vZmZpY2UtYW5kLWxpZmUtc2NpZW5jZXMtY2FtcHVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renderings Revealed for Millbrae Office and Life Sciences Campus,"New renderings have been revealed for the proposed life sciences campus in Millbrae San Mateo County. The project will add over half a million square feet with space for over two thousand employees across from the mixed-use Gateway at Millbrae Station development. Greystar is partnering with Alexandria Real Estate Equities a major investor in biotech projects across the nation.

Across the whole campus five structures will contain 928330 square feet. Among the 557300 square feet of office space 30 Rollins Road will yield 162740 square feet 201 Adrian Road will yield 160900 square feet and 101 Harriet Tubman Road will produce 233630 square feet. The amenity building will contain 11030 square feet and the garage will span 360000 square feet with a capacity for 927 vehicles. The garage will rise nine levels up shaded on the roof with solar panels and extend one level below ground.

Building Two

Building Three

Amenity Building

Parking Garage

Initial plans suggest that sixty percent of the space will be for laboratory use and forty percent for offices. The final composition of the floor area can be determined by the future tenants. At full build out as many as 2055 employees could be working from the campus.

While 927 vehicles is a lot for a transit-adjacent project such as this there could have been more. Because the project is located within the Millbrae Station Area Specific Plan (MSASP) the developer is able to add fewer than the minimum required parking. Otherwise the city code would require a minimum of 1244 parking stalls to be included.

WRNS Studio is the design architect BKF Engineers is the civil engineer and Bionic is the landscape architect.

At ground level stone walls establish the foundation enhancing the visual scale of the office buildings. Meanwhile the upper levels will be set back from the street to break up the massing create visual interest and produce open-air balconies for the office employees.

A linked paseo will run through the site offering a requiem of landscaped open space with public seating and gathering space. A plaza at the corner of Millbrae Avenue and Rollins Road will link the paseo to the open space establishing the welcoming connection to the mixed-use Gateway at Millbrae Station project rising across the street.

Each office building will rise six floors with generous ceiling heights pushing the rooftop to be 100 feet above grade. Each design will be of a similar style with curtain wall skin and terra cotta though distinguished by color palettes and materials used particularly the earthen-toned facade of Building Two.

The new life sciences campus will replace six existing low-slung commercial buildings and surface parking built between 1955 and 1963. The 4.7-acre property is situated between Highway 101 and El Camino Real and is across from the Millbrae station service by BART and Caltrain.

That transit station is also in a state of evolution as construction is wrapping up on The Millbrae Station Development. Led by Republic Urban Properties the over $400 million project is creating 320 market-rate homes 80 low-income homes a 164-room hotel 150000 square feet of office space and 45000 square feet of retail all beside the regional hub.

Alexandria is responsible for approximately nine million square feet across the Bay Area focusing on biotech and providing office space. As one of the nation’s largest biotech developers the company is responsible for nearly 50 million square feet. Facebook is the third-largest among its tenants nationally Moderna is the seventh-largest Uber is the ninth-largest and Roche is the tenth largest.

Alexandria is also partnered with Boston Properties to develop 1.7 million square feet in South San Francisco along Gateway Boulevard. An SFYIMBY site visit recently showed construction is underway for the 148-foot tall R&D building at 751 Gateway Boulevard.

Construction is expected to take 42 months from groundbreaking to completion. If approval can be achieved quickly the development could open as early as 2026.

But the outbreak of the pandemic was responsible for a dramatic shift in consumer expectations compelling retailers to integrate technology into multiple areas of retail operations where technology was yet to be utilized to its full potential. Though the retail market in India witnessed a slow down during the pandemic period investors pumped in 260 percent additional capital into local firms that offer tech solutions for online and offline retailers in 2021.

The pandemic saw retailers digitizing their operations at a massive scale. India’s e-retail market stood at 4.6 percent by the end of FY21. India’s e-commerce market is projected to record sales worth US$ 55 billion during 2021 with the addition of 40 million new online shoppers. But an e-commerce platform or a digital presence is no longer enough to deliver an optimized shopping experience. Technology has advanced and its definition and implementation in retail space have moved beyond just having a digital presence to shaping and delivering superior consumer experiences. This article discusses five technology trends that are touted to do just that.

Personalized Customer Engagement - Personalization is the key for retailers to survive and thrive in this competitive retail battlefield. Retailers are taking personalization to the next level personalized product recommendations discounts highly targeted product offers loyalty and reward programs.

At the core of this customization is data modernization the shift of data from isolated legacy databases to cloud-enabled data storage platforms. Data modernization is the first step of digital transformation as it allows for faster seamless access to data empowering efficient data analysis. With sophisticated cloud computing platforms accelerated with DataOps and DevOps processes retailers can rely on ‘always on’ data collection and processing to generate insights that can then help formulate consumer behavior patterns. Coupled with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence this data can be used to engage with consumers in a smarter and much more effective manner.

For example customers can receive an alert for free items on their birthday while shopping in a store. Or discount alerts can be sent via app notifications to less frequent customers when they pass by a store to motivate more purchases. With technology enabling better customer profiling personalization or rather hyper-personalization is the way forward for the retail industry.

Omnichannel Retail Experience - Omnichannel presence is critical to providing an integrated shopping experience. Easy access to a retail brand through any channel makes shopping easier and hassle-free. Seamless integration between online and offline worlds is the basis of the omnichannel approach.

Again enabled with efficient data modernization and cloud-based data storage retailers can leverage AI for a variety of smart tools to engage with consumers at various retail touchpoints. Further with the help of ChatBots and natural language processing tools it becomes easier for customers to use AI-powered tools and get instant customer support and thus an effective brand experience. Customers can use the retail brand’s app while in the store scan codes with their phones and gain detailed information on products displayed. In case a particular color or size of shoe/ clothing/ accessories isn’t available in the store an order can be placed then and there online through the app. The non-availability of a product or space constraints to display all products in-store need not translate into a lost sales opportunity.

Smart Inventory Management - Aimed at optimizing the inventory mix levels and locations smart inventory diagnosis helps optimize inventory. By ensuring the right product inventory is maintained based on data-driven insights of consumer demand and buying patterns. This is further optimized by location to capture new sales minimize excess and obsolete inventory and analyze inventory levels and demand by location on a regular basis.

Further leveraging AI and data analytics retailers can curate personalized messaging especially to capitalize on local store inventory by pushing information about product availability to online shoppers that is customized to their local stores. Additionally using customer data from its app or cloud platforms or digital wallets product relevant recommendations can be made such that when a product is out of stock at a local store the app makes it easy for the shoppers to seamlessly order the item from their smartphone/ online retail platforms.

Immersive In-Shop Retail Experience - Technology has significantly transformed the way consumers shop in stores. While the concept of immersive shopping was once limited only to digital platforms it has now expanded to physical stores as well. An immersive experience ensures consumers can interact with the products in the shop and understand them better.

And Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) enabled experiences are at the core of immersive retail experiences. With interactive displays that disclose more details about a product through videos or animation booths that interest and motivate consumers to stay longer and experience the stores AR and Mixed Reality have had a huge role to play in keeping retailers coming back for in-shop retail experience. In-store maps to navigate through the store coupled with interactive displays and virtual reality technology that gives a realistic idea of the product’s appeal enhances the decision-making process. Customers can visualize if a particular outfit shoe or accessory will look good on them resulting in quicker decisions and better satisfaction.

IoT-Powered Shopping Assistance - Again effectively leveraging data modernization cloud computing and legacy application modernization for effective data analytics retailers can engage with consumers to create personalization. This can further be applied to IoT-powered shopping experiences which respond to personalized consumer needs and shopping behaviors.

Consumers are now more inclined towards contactless checkouts owing to health concerns raised by the pandemic. An IoT network in-store can track the products customers have placed in their cart and automatically charge the credit card which is in the record.

IoT applications like RFID chips that track product movement can help with inventory management and give better insights into the products that make it to the store but fail to translate to a sale. Interactive mirrors can help customers with product information. Customers can request sizes and browse products through interactive mirrors. The mirrors can also recommend accessories to complete the look facilitating a more fulfilling shopping experience.

Wrapping Up

The definition of optimized consumer experience is constantly evolving with the advent of new technologies and retailers are embracing them at a faster pace to survive and make their voice heard in this competitive landscape. Around 52 percent of consumers would spend more for a better consumer experience and this stat alone proves why tech adoption is no longer a ‘nice to have’ but an imperative. However the right technology for e-commerce and retail solutions providers is vital in ensuring efficient cost-effective and personalized retail technology solutions for online and offline retail. If retail technology is to be made accessible and available across retail platforms it is important for brands and retailers to embark on a well researched and sustainable solution with the right IT services provider to build stronger digitization partnership that can help them to not only migrate but also sustain and scale up using the best in technology adoption.

WWE is slowly presenting the rivalries between these four women. ‘The Boss’ Sasha Banks and Shotzi’s story is something that took a while to build up and arguably the tension between them started before the Survivor Series PPV.

However the rivalry between Toni Storm and ‘The Queen’ abruptly started after the Survivor Series PPV when Flair was defeated by her fierce rival Becky Lynch.

Was it a botch or a reversal on WWE SmackDown between Sasha Banks and Charlotte Flair?

The match started and Shotzi started off with Storm and they quickly went to the ground. They locked up again and Storm applied a headlock.

The two wrestlers worked the first few minutes of the match and exchanged a few back-and-forth blows. However the crowd raised their voice when Storm and Shotzi tagged their partners in.

Some MBW sources close to the deal suggested the buyout announced Thursday (December 16) cost Warner approximately $400 million; others suggested the final price was just north of that figure.

Now we know for sure: Warner paid $400 million on the nose to acquire 300…. and paid it out in cash.

According to an SEC filing posted yesterday (December 17) Warner purchased a US-based company called Theory Entertainment LLC doing business as 300 Entertainment on the day of the announcement (December 16).

That deal was pursuant to terms and conditions of a merger agreement between Warner Music and various involved parties.

The filing reads: “On December 16 2021 Warner Music Group Corp. (the “Company”) purchased Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement of the same date among Warner Music Inc. and MM Investment LLC both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company the Buyer Representative Trifecta Merger Subsidiary LLC Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment and the Seller Representative.”

The filing further confirms: “The merger consideration was $400 million in cash subject to adjustment for working capital cash indebtedness and expenses.”

Warner says it will publish the full text of the merger agreement in its next quarterly earnings update to investors.

To fund the acquisition Warner appears to have used cash from a $535 million debt raise it announced last month.

Led by CEO Kevin Liles 300 Entertainment is one of the most successful modern independent labels in the United States.

The company was originally founded in 2012 by Liles alongside his former Warner Music and Def Jam colleague Lyor Cohen.

Their fellow co-founders at 300 were Roger Gold (now manager of Camila Cabello) and Todd Moscowitz who recently sold a majority stake in his own demi-indie label – Alamo Records – to Sony in a nine-figure transaction.

Google/Alphabet was an early minority investor in 300 but has since relinquished this equity.

Subsequent to the Warner acquisition 300 will continue to be run by Kevin Liles. In addition Liles becomes CEO and Chairman of Warner’s Elektra Music Group.

300 Entertainment’s biggest artist successes to date include Megan Thee Stallion Fetty Wap and Young Thug.Music Business Worldwide",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTE5Mjcvc3lzY28tZWxlY3RzLXRocmVlLW5ldy1kaXJlY3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sysco Elects Three New Directors,"HOUSTON Dec. 17 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sysco Corporation (NYSE: SYY) the leading global foodservice distribution company announced today that three new directors Ali Dibadj Jill M.

The filing was made after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) started reviewing allegations that Apple hurts competition by forcing app developers to use its proprietary system which can charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases.

Apple denied the allegations in its filing to the CCI and stressed that its market share in India is an ""insignificant"" 0-5% while Google commands 90-100% as its Android operating system powers most other smartphones.

""Apple is not dominant in the Indian market ... Without dominance there can be no abuse"" Apple said in the submission dated Nov. 16 which was signed by its Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer.

""It has already been established that Google is the dominant player in India"" it added.

Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Alphabet Inc's Google declined to comment when asked about Apple's assertions in the filing.

The complainant in the case a little-known non-profit group called ""Together We Fight Society"" said that Apple with iOS dominates the market for non-licensable mobile operating systems.

Apple countered that in its filing saying the entire smartphone market - which includes licensable systems like Android - is the market that should be taken into consideration.

Apple also described the Indian complaint as a ""proxy filing"" in its CCI submission saying that the complainant was ""likely acting in concert with parties with whom Apple has ongoing commercial and contractual disputes globally and/or that have complained to other regulators.""

The U.S. tech company did not give any evidence in its submission to support its claim. The non-profit told Reuters that Apple's remark was ""made to prejudice the mind"" of the CCI ""without any iota of proof.""

In the coming weeks the CCI will review Apple's response to the allegations and could order a wider investigation or dismiss the case altogether if it finds no merit in it. Details of CCI investigations are not publicly disclosed.

The CCI is separately conducting an investigation into Google's in-app payment system as part of a broader probe into the company after Indian startups last year voiced concern.

Apple's iOS powered about 2% of 520 million smartphones in India as of end-2020 with the rest using Android according to Counterpoint Research though it adds that Apple's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years.

GLOBAL ISSUE

Apple has been grappling with similar allegations in other parts of the world. In the United States it is locked in a legal battle with ""Fornite"" creator Epic Games over the issue and South Korea this year became the first country to ban dominant app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems.

In the European Union  regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's in-app fees for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.

Companies like Apple and Google say their fees cover the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.

In its CCI filing Apple argued that the in-app commissions it charges are ""not unfair or excessive"" and have decreased over time adding that it charges lower rates from small developers.

""Only a small number of large developers many of which are multi-billion-dollar conglomerates pay the headline rate of 30%"" Apple said.

""Competing platforms have charged similar or higher commissions as Apple. Particularly Google has charged a 30% commission on its app store"" it said.

Some MBW sources close to the deal suggested the buyout announced Thursday (December 16) cost Warner approximately $400 million; others suggested the final price was just north of that figure.

Now we know for sure: Warner paid $400 million on the nose to acquire 300…. and paid it out in cash.

According to an SEC filing posted yesterday (December 17) Warner purchased a US-based company called Theory Entertainment LLC doing business as 300 Entertainment on the day of the announcement (December 16).

That deal was pursuant to terms and conditions of a merger agreement between Warner Music and various involved parties.

The filing reads: “On December 16 2021 Warner Music Group Corp. (the “Company”) purchased Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement of the same date among Warner Music Inc. and MM Investment LLC both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company the Buyer Representative Trifecta Merger Subsidiary LLC Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment and the Seller Representative.”

The filing further confirms: “The merger consideration was $400 million in cash subject to adjustment for working capital cash indebtedness and expenses.”

Warner says it will publish the full text of the merger agreement in its next quarterly earnings update to investors.

To fund the acquisition Warner appears to have used cash from a $535 million debt raise it announced last month.

Led by CEO Kevin Liles 300 Entertainment is one of the most successful modern independent labels in the United States.

The company was originally founded in 2012 by Liles alongside his former Warner Music and Def Jam colleague Lyor Cohen.

Their fellow co-founders at 300 were Roger Gold (now manager of Camila Cabello) and Todd Moscowitz who recently sold a majority stake in his own demi-indie label – Alamo Records – to Sony in a nine-figure transaction.

Google/Alphabet was an early minority investor in 300 but has since relinquished this equity.

Subsequent to the Warner acquisition 300 will continue to be run by Kevin Liles. In addition Liles becomes CEO and Chairman of Warner’s Elektra Music Group.

300 Entertainment’s biggest artist successes to date include Megan Thee Stallion Fetty Wap and Young Thug.Music Business Worldwide",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTE5Mjcvc3lzY28tZWxlY3RzLXRocmVlLW5ldy1kaXJlY3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sysco Elects Three New Directors,"HOUSTON Dec. 17 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sysco Corporation (NYSE: SYY) the leading global foodservice distribution company announced today that three new directors Ali Dibadj Jill M.

The filing was made after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) started reviewing allegations that Apple hurts competition by forcing app developers to use its proprietary system which can charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases.

Apple denied the allegations in its filing to the CCI and stressed that its market share in India is an ""insignificant"" 0-5% while Google commands 90-100% as its Android operating system powers most other smartphones.

""Apple is not dominant in the Indian market ... Without dominance there can be no abuse"" Apple said in the submission dated Nov. 16 which was signed by its Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer.

""It has already been established that Google is the dominant player in India"" it added.

Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Alphabet Inc's Google declined to comment when asked about Apple's assertions in the filing.

The complainant in the case a little-known non-profit group called ""Together We Fight Society"" said that Apple with iOS dominates the market for non-licensable mobile operating systems.

Apple countered that in its filing saying the entire smartphone market - which includes licensable systems like Android - is the market that should be taken into consideration.

Apple also described the Indian complaint as a ""proxy filing"" in its CCI submission saying that the complainant was ""likely acting in concert with parties with whom Apple has ongoing commercial and contractual disputes globally and/or that have complained to other regulators.""

The U.S. tech company did not give any evidence in its submission to support its claim. The non-profit told Reuters that Apple's remark was ""made to prejudice the mind"" of the CCI ""without any iota of proof.""

In the coming weeks the CCI will review Apple's response to the allegations and could order a wider investigation or dismiss the case altogether if it finds no merit in it. Details of CCI investigations are not publicly disclosed.

The CCI is separately conducting an investigation into Google's in-app payment system as part of a broader probe into the company after Indian startups last year voiced concern.

Apple's iOS powered about 2% of 520 million smartphones in India as of end-2020 with the rest using Android according to Counterpoint Research though it adds that Apple's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years.

GLOBAL ISSUE

Apple has been grappling with similar allegations in other parts of the world. In the United States it is locked in a legal battle with ""Fornite"" creator Epic Games over the issue and South Korea this year became the first country to ban dominant app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems.

In the European Union  regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's in-app fees for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.

Companies like Apple and Google say their fees cover the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.

In its CCI filing Apple argued that the in-app commissions it charges are ""not unfair or excessive"" and have decreased over time adding that it charges lower rates from small developers.

""Only a small number of large developers many of which are multi-billion-dollar conglomerates pay the headline rate of 30%"" Apple said.

""Competing platforms have charged similar or higher commissions as Apple. Particularly Google has charged a 30% commission on its app store"" it said.

Amazon has consolidated its healthcare efforts under one central organization and tapped a former Prime executive to run the businesses.

The tech giant elevated Neil Lindsay to the new role of senior vice president of health and brand within Amazon's worldwide consumer business an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Fierce Healthcare.

CNBC's Annie Palmer and Bertha Coombs first reported the executive move Thursday. Lindsay a former senior vice president in Amazon's Prime business took on the new role in November while continuing to run the company's global brand and fixed marketing businesses the spokesperson said.

He has been transitioning out of his current role gradually over the fourth quarter.

Lindsay's responsibilities include overseeing Amazon's combined health efforts including Amazon Pharmacy Amazon Care and Diagnostics.

The consolidated healthcare structure will help Amazon as it works to develop ""more customer-centric ways for patients to get the healthcare services products and medications they need"" the spokesperson said.

Lindsay has 11 years of experience leading teams at Amazon and his product and business building and leadership experience will help Amazon ""develop and grow an even more compelling set of healthcare programs making customers' lives easier better and even healthier"" the spokesperson said.

Axios' Erin Brodwin reported Friday that as a result of Lindsay's promotion to oversee Pharmacy and Amazon Care TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen the entrepreneurs behind PillPack were quietly shifted to consultant roles. Citing a source familiar with the matter. Brodwin reported that Amazon Pharmacy employees who reported to Parker who had been a vice president of pharmacy will now report to Amazon Alexa VP John Love.

However an Amazon spokesperson told Fierce Healthcare that Parker and Cohen remain Amazon employees and are in fact taking on bigger roles and were shifted to ""strategic positions helping to shape Amazon’s broader healthcare vision and strategy.""

Amazon shook up the retail drugstore market when it acquired PillPack three years ago and then again when it rolled out Amazon Pharmacy last year.

Amazon bought PillPack for a reported $1 billion in cash.

Amazon has been pushing deeper into healthcare not just through its pharmacy business but also by expanding its virtual care program.

This year the company began to expand its Amazon Care telehealth service from an in-house employee benefit to a widescale service available to employers throughout the U.S.

Amazon piloted its healthcare business in 2019 to provide virtual urgent care services to its employees. In March Amazon Care announced it would begin serving other Washington-based businesses. The company also added in-person care and prescription delivery to its virtual services.

The company now plans to roll out its hybrid care model which combines virtual care services as well as in-home care to Dallas Chicago Philadelphia Boston and Los Angeles.

During the HLTH 2021 conference in Boston in October Kristen Lloyd Helton Ph.D. teased that Amazon Care might be expanding to other markets beyond those five cities this year as well. The company is committed to eventually expanding the full Amazon Care service including in-person services to all 50 states she said.

Amazon also is making a major medical diagnostics play. It developed a proprietary COVID-19 test to screen its own workers during the pandemic and has now made its at-home sample collection kit available to the public online. Amazon’s direct-to-consumer coronavirus test received emergency use authorization from the FDA at the end of May.

The tech giant also is dabbling in wearable devices with the launch of its Halo device in August and also is striking deals to get its Alexa voice assistant into healthcare organizations. In October it launched a new service for hospitals that will embed its voice technology deeper into clinical settings at scale.

And Amazon's cloud business also plays a key role in its healthcare strategy. It recently rolled out AWS for Health a set of services and partner solutions for healthcare genomics and biopharma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRlZC13aXRoLWNoaW5hcy1wcm9wYWdhbmRhLWFybS10by1ib29zdC1zYWxlcy1yZXV0ZXJzLTIwMjEtMTLSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZWQtd2l0aC1jaGluYXMtcHJvcGFnYW5kYS1hcm0tdG8tYm9vc3Qtc2FsZXMtcmV1dGVycy0yMDIxLTEyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon collaborated with China's propaganda arm to boost sales - Reuters,"An employee handles packages at the Amazon's Bretigny-sur-Orge warehouse in France.

Amazon worked with the Chinese government to restrict reviews on texts by the Communist Party leader.

Reuters revealed this is part of the US e-commerce giant's mission to expand its reach in China.

They created the portal China Books a partnership with the Chinese government to sell approved literature.

Amazon agreed to cooperate with Chinese propaganda after the government issued them an ""edict"" Reuters found an investigation.

In 2019 Amazon was selling a collection of texts by President Xi Jinping — including ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" — when Beijing demanded the US e-commerce giant turn off their rating and comments feature after a negative review surfaced.

These elements are used on the vast majority of Amazon's products but they complied with the Chinese government's demands and removed them from their Chinese site.

Now on Amazon.cn the government-published book has 0 customer reviews and one cannot post a comment.

Reuters news agency said it had spoken with more than two dozen people who have been involved in Amazon's China operation. The special report reveals ""how the company has survived and thrived in China by helping to further the ruling Communist Party's global economic and political agenda.""

In their investigation Reuters revealed that Amazon's compliance with the Chinese government instruction was a part of a ""decade-long effort"" by Amazon to win support from Xi's regime and grow their presence in one of the world's biggest markets.

Amazon had historically struggled to sell some products in China an internal 2018 briefing document revealed Reuters reports.

""Ideological control and propaganda is the core of the toolkit for the communist party to achieve and maintain its success"" the briefing document said according to Reuters. ""We are not making judgement on whether it is right or wrong"" it added.

In response to this Amazon launched the 'China Books' project. Outlined in the 2018 briefing document the project between the Chinese Government and Amazon created a portal to specifically sell books by the government.

China Books eventually offered more than 90000 publications for sale but did not generate significant revenue said the report.

In the 'Chinese Governance' section of the site the series of books ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" compilations of speeches by the Chinese President are the only titles available.

Many books on the site are apolitical and focus on geography or cooking for example. However many take a political stance: all in support of China's Communist Party.







They include ""Incredible Xinjiang: Stories of Passion and Heritage"" describing life in Xinjiang where the UN has stated one million Uyghur Muslims have been forced into totalitarian re-education camps.

However the book claims ethnicity is ""not a problem"" in the province regurgitating the message of the Chinese government which denies any mistreatment or abuse of ethnic minorities.

In responding to questions from Reuters Amazon said it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations wherever we operate and China is no exception."" It added that ""as a bookseller we believe that providing access to the written word and diverse perspectives is important. That includes books that some may find objectionable.""

We simplified this further with the launch of AWS Fargate where customers no longer have to manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for their Amazon EKS / ECS clusters. Customers have started adopting event-driven deployment which is the ability to activate a Kubernetes deployment (i.e. no pods to a single pod) and subsequently to more pods based on events from various event sources.

By implementing eventdriven deployment andautoscaling customers can achieve cost savings by providing on-demand compute and autoscale efficiently based on application logic. Kubernetes supports cluster level autoscaling using cluster autoscaler and application level autoscaling using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler can scale pods based on observed CPU utilization and memory usage. For complex scenarios like eventdriven autoscaling customers rely on metrics related to application logic.

KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler) lets you drive the autoscaling of Kubernetes workloads based on the number of events such as a custom metric scraped breaching a specified threshold or when there is a message in the Kafka queue. KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added into any Kubernetes cluster. It works alongside standard Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler  and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. KEDA lets you explicitly map the apps you want to use event-driven scale while other apps continuing to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside any number of other Kubernetes applications or frameworks.

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for container metrics that makes it easier to securely monitor container environments at scale. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus lets you use the same opensource Prometheus data model and query language that you use today to monitor the performance of your containerized workloads and also enjoy improved scalability availability and security without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

In this post we will show you how you can use KEDA to autoscale Amazon EKS Pods by querying the metrics stored in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

Prerequisites

You will need the following to complete the steps in this post:

The following diagram shows the complete setup that we will walk through in this blog post

Figure 1: Architecture diagram

Step 1: Create an Amazon EKS Cluster and KEDA operator

First create an Amazon EKS cluster for running the sample application and the KEDA operator. The eksctl CLI tool will deploy the cluster using the eks-cluster-config.yaml file:

export AMP_KEDA_CLUSTER=AMP-KEDA-CLUSTER export AMP_ACCOUNT_ID=<Your Account id> export AWS_REGION=<Your Region> cat << EOF > eks-cluster-config.yaml --- apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5 kind: ClusterConfig metadata: name: $AMP_KEDA_CLUSTER region: $AWS_REGION version: '1.20' iam: withOIDC: true serviceAccounts: - metadata: name: keda-operator namespace: keda labels: {aws-usage: ""application""} attachPolicyARNs: - ""arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonPrometheusQueryAccess"" managedNodeGroups: - name: default-ng minSize: 1 maxSize: 3 desiredCapacity: 2 labels: {role: mngworker} iam: withAddonPolicies: certManager: true cloudWatch: true cloudWatch: clusterLogging: enableTypes: [""*""] EOF

Execute the following command to create the EKS cluster:

eksctl create cluster -f eks-cluster-config.yaml

This creates an Amazon EKS cluster named AMP-KEDA-CLUSTER and a service account named keda-operator that the KEDA scaler will use.

KEDA performs two key roles within Kubernetes: The Agent activates and deactivates Kubernetes Deployments to scale to and from zero on no events. This is one of the primary roles of the keda-operator container that runs when you install KEDA. KEDA also acts as a Kubernetes metrics server that exposes rich event data such as queue length or any custom metric to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to drive scale out. It is up to the Deployment to consume the events directly from the source. This preserves rich event integration and enables gestures like completing or abandoning queue messages to work out of the box. The metric serving is the primary role of the keda-operator-metrics-apiserver container that runs when you install KEDA.

Next use the following commands to install the keda operator in the Keda namespace:

helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts

We will create the values.yaml for the KEDA operator to set the right security context:

cat << EOF > values.yaml operator: name: keda-operator podSecurityContext: fsGroup: 1001 securityContext: runAsGroup: 1001 runAsUser: 1001 serviceAccount: create: false name: keda-operator EOF helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda -f values.yaml

We can describe the pods in the Keda namespace to verify:

Admin:~/environment $ kubectl get pods -n keda NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE keda-operator-6d74df9577-vc6gs 1/1 Running 0 48s keda-operator-metrics-apiserver-fc6df469f-vlf9r 1/1 Running 0 48s

Step 2: Create an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace

The Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace ingests the Prometheus metrics collected from envoy. A workspace is a logical and isolated Prometheus server dedicated to Prometheus resources such as metrics. A workspace supports fine-grained access control for authorizing its management such as update list describe and delete as well as ingesting and querying metrics.

aws amp create-workspace --alias AMP-KEDA --region $AWS_REGION

Next optionally create an interface VPC endpoint to securely access the managed service from resources deployed in your VPC. This makes sure that data ingested by the managed service won’t leave your AWS account VPC. Utilize the AWS CLI as shown here. Replace the placeholder strings such as VPC_ID AWS_REGION  with your values.

export VPC_ID=<Your EKS Cluster VPC Id> aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \ --vpc-id $VPC_ID \ --service-name com.amazonaws.<$AWS_REGION>.aps-workspaces \ --security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_IDS> \ --vpc-endpoint-type Interface \ --subnet-ids <SUBNET_IDS>

Step 3: Deploy sample application and scrape metrics using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

In this post we will use a sample application called ho11y which is a synthetic signal generator letting you test observability solutions for microservices. It emits logs metrics and traces in a configurable manner.

To install the application execute the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes.git cd ./aws-o11y-recipes/sandbox/ho11y/ docker build . -t ""$AMP_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ""$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com"" aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ho11y docker push ""$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest"" kubectl create namespace ho11y cat << EOF > holly.yaml --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: frontend spec: selector: matchLabels: app: frontend replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: frontend spec: containers: - name: ho11y image: ""$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest"" ports: - containerPort: 8765 env: - name: DISABLE_OM value: ""on"" - name: HO11Y_LOG_DEST value: ""stdout"" - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIB value: ""frontend"" - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT value: ""adot:4317"" - name: HO11Y_INJECT_FAILURE value: ""enabled"" - name: DOWNSTREAM0 value: ""http://downstream0"" - name: DOWNSTREAM1 value: ""http://downstream1"" imagePullPolicy: Always --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: downstream0 spec: selector: matchLabels: app: downstream0 replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: downstream0 spec: containers: - name: ho11y image: public.ecr.aws/mhausenblas/ho11y:stable ports: - containerPort: 8765 env: - name: DISABLE_OM value: ""on"" - name: HO11Y_LOG_DEST value: ""stdout"" - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIB value: ""downstream0"" - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT value: ""adot:4317"" - name: DOWNSTREAM0 value: ""https://mhausenblas.info/"" imagePullPolicy: Always --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: downstream1 spec: selector: matchLabels: app: downstream1 replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: downstream1 spec: containers: - name: ho11y image: public.ecr.aws/mhausenblas/ho11y:stable ports: - containerPort: 8765 env: - name: DISABLE_OM value: ""on"" - name: HO11Y_LOG_DEST value: ""stdout"" - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIB value: ""downstream1"" - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT value: ""adot:4317"" - name: DOWNSTREAM0 value: ""https://o11y.news/2021-03-01/"" - name: DOWNSTREAM1 value: ""DUMMY:187kB:42ms"" - name: DOWNSTREAM2 value: ""DUMMY:13kB:2ms"" imagePullPolicy: Always --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: frontend spec: ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 8765 selector: app: frontend --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: downstream0 spec: ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 8765 selector: app: downstream0 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: downstream1 spec: ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 8765 selector: app: downstream1 --- EOF kubectl apply -f holly.yaml -n ho11y

This will create three deployments: frontend downstream0 and downstream1 and 3 services for each deployment.

Admin:~/environment $ kubectl get deployments -n ho11y NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE downstream0 2/2 2 2 4d2h downstream1 1/1 1 1 4d2h frontend 1/1 1 1 4d2h Admin:~/environment $ kubectl get svc -n ho11y NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE downstream0 ClusterIP 10.100.6.63 <none> 80/TCP 4d2h downstream1 ClusterIP 10.100.8.55 <none> 80/TCP 4d2h frontend ClusterIP 10.100.83.92 <none> 80/TCP 4d2h

Next we will have to deploy a collector that can scrape the application metrics emitted by ho11y. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus does not directly scrape operational metrics from containerized workloads in a Kubernetes cluster. You must deploy and manage a Prometheus server or an OpenTelemetry agent such as the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT) or the Grafana Agent to perform this task. The ADOT-AMP pipeline lets us use the ADOT Collector to scrape a Prometheus-instrumented application and then send the scraped metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

This post will also walk you through the steps to configure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to send Prometheus metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. We install the ADOT collector on the Amazon EKS cluster and forward metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

Configure permissions

We will be deploying the ADOT collector to run under the identity of a Kubernetes service account “amp-iamproxy-service-account”. IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) lets you associate the AmazonPrometheusRemoteWriteAccess role with a Kubernetes service account thereby providing IAM permissions to any pod utilizing the service account to ingest the metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

You need kubectl and eksctl CLI tools to run the script. They must be configured to access your Amazon EKS cluster.

eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name adot-collector --namespace ho11y --cluster $AMP_KEDA_CLUSTER --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonPrometheusRemoteWriteAccess --approve export WORKSPACE=$(aws amp list-workspaces | jq -r '.workspaces[] | select(.alias==""AMP-KEDA"").workspaceId') export REGION=$AWS_REGION export REMOTE_WRITE_URL=""https://aps-workspaces.$REGION.amazonaws.com/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/api/v1/remote_write""

Now create a manifest file amp-eks-adot-prometheus-daemonset.yaml with the scrape configuration to extract envoy metrics and deploy the ADOT collector. This example deploys a deployment named adot. The adot deployment collects metrics from pods on the cluster.

cat << EOF > amp-eks-adot-prometheus-daemonset.yaml --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: adot-collector labels: app: aws-adot component: adot-collector data: adot-collector-config: | receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 http: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:55681 awsxray: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:2000 transport: udp prometheus: config: global: scrape_interval: 15s scrape_timeout: 10s scrape_configs: - job_name: kubernetes-service-endpoints kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: endpoints relabel_configs: - action: keep regex: true source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape] - action: replace regex: (https?) source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scheme] target_label: __scheme__ - action: replace regex: (.+) source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_path] target_label: __metrics_path__ - action: replace regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)?;(\d+) replacement: $$1:$$2 source_labels: - __address__ - __meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_port target_label: __address__ - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+) - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace] target_label: k8s_namespace - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name] target_label: k8s_service - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name] target_label: k8s_node - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name] target_label: k8s_pod - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name] target_label: k8s_container - job_name: adot kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: pod relabel_configs: - action: replace regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)? replacement: $${1}:8888 source_labels: [__address__] target_label: __address__ - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace] target_label: k8s_namespace - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name] target_label: k8s_pod - action: keep source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app] regex: adot - job_name: ho11y kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: pod relabel_configs: - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace] target_label: k8s_namespace - action: replace source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name] target_label: k8s_pod - action: keep source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app] regex: frontend|downstream(.*) processors: batch/traces: timeout: 1s send_batch_size: 20 batch/metrics: timeout: 10s exporters: awsxray: awsemf: awsprometheusremotewrite: endpoint: ""$REMOTE_WRITE_URL"" aws_auth: region: ""$REGION"" service: ""aps"" logging: loglevel: debug extensions: health_check: pprof: zpages: service: extensions: [pprof zpages health_check] pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp awsxray] processors: [batch/traces] exporters: [awsxray] metrics: receivers: [prometheus] processors: [batch/metrics] exporters: [logging awsprometheusremotewrite] --- kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: adot-collector rules: - apiGroups: [""""] resources: - nodes - nodes/proxy - services - endpoints - pods verbs: [""get"" ""list"" ""watch""] - apiGroups: - extensions resources: - ingresses verbs: [""get"" ""list"" ""watch""] - nonResourceURLs: [""/metrics""] verbs: [""get""] --- kind: ClusterRoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: adot-collector-binding subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: adot-collector namespace: ho11y roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: adot-collector apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: adot labels: app: aws-adot component: adot-collector spec: selector: matchLabels: app: adot replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: adot spec: serviceAccountName: adot-collector containers: - name: adot-collector image: public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector:v0.11.0 command: - ""/awscollector"" - ""--config=/conf/adot-collector-config.yaml"" - ""--log-level=DEBUG"" ports: - containerPort: 55681 - containerPort: 55680 - containerPort: 4317 - containerPort: 8888 env: - name: AWS_REGION value: ""$REGION"" volumeMounts: - name: adot-collector-config-vol mountPath: /conf livenessProbe: httpGet: path: / port: 13133 readinessProbe: httpGet: path: / port: 13133 volumes: - configMap: name: adot-collector items: - key: adot-collector-config path: adot-collector-config.yaml name: adot-collector-config-vol --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: adot labels: app: aws-adot component: adot-collector spec: ports: - name: receiver-http port: 55681 - name: receiver-grpc-legacy port: 55680 - name: receiver-grpc port: 4317 - name: metrics port: 8888 selector: app: adot --- EOF kubectl apply -f amp-eks-adot-prometheus-daemonset.yaml -n ho11y

After the ADOT collector is deployed it will collect the metrics and ingest them into the specified Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. The scrape configuration is similar to that of a Prometheus server. We have added the necessary configuration for scraping the ho11y metrics.

Step 4: Configure sigv4 authentication for querying Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and setup autoscaling using KEDA scaled object

AWS Signature Version 4 is a process to add authentication information to requests made to AWS APIs using HTTP. The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the AWS SDKs already use this protocol to make calls to the AWS APIs. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus requires the API calls to have sigv4 authentication and since KEDA doesn’t support sigv4 we will be deploying a sigv4 proxy service to act as a gateway for KEDA to access the query endpoint of the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

Execute the following commands to deploy the sig-v4 proxy:

cat << EOF > keda-sigv4.yaml --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: app: keda-sigv4 name: keda-sigv4 namespace: keda spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: keda-sigv4 template: metadata: labels: app: keda-sigv4 name: keda-sigv4 spec: serviceAccountName: keda-operator containers: - name: aws-iamproxy image: public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-sigv4-proxy:1.0 args: - --name - aps - --region - $REGION - --host - aps-workspaces.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ports: - containerPort: 8080 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: keda-sigv4 namespace: keda spec: ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 8080 selector: app: keda-sigv4 --- EOF kubectl apply -f keda-sigv4.yaml

Let’s create the ScaledObject that will scale the deployment by querying the metrics stored in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

A ScaledObject represents the desired mapping between an event source such as a Prometheus metric and the Kubernetes Deployment StatefulSet or any Custom Resource that defines /scale subresource.

Behind the scenes KEDA acts to monitor the event source and feed that data to Kubernetes and the HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) to drive the rapid scale of a resource. Each replica of a resource is actively pulling items from the event source.

KEDA also supports the scaling behavior that we configure in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. This means that we can configure pollingInterval cooldownPeriod fallback configuration and make your scaling even more powerful.

The following commands will deploy the scaledobject named ho11y-hpa that will query the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus query endpoint for a metric called holly_total .

holly_total metric represents the number of invokes of the application and the threshold is specified as 1. Depending on the value over a period of one minute you can scale in/out the downstream0 deployment between 1 and 10 pods.

cat << EOF > scaledobject.yaml --- apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1 kind: ScaledObject metadata: name: ho11y-hpa namespace: ho11y spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: downstream0 pollingInterval: 30 cooldownPeriod: 300 fallback: failureThreshold: 3 replicas: 2 minReplicaCount: 1 # Optional. Default: 0 maxReplicaCount: 10 # Optional. Default: 100 triggers: - type: prometheus metadata: serverAddress: http://keda-sigv4.keda.svc.cluster.local/workspaces/$WORKSPACE metricName: ho11y_total awsRegion: ""us-east-1"" identityOwner: operator threshold: '1' # Note: query must return a vector/scalar single element response query: rate(ho11y_total[1m]) --- EOF kubectl apply -f scaledobject.yaml

Once we deploy the scaledobject the KEDA will also create a HPA object in the ho11y namespace with the configuration specified in the scaledobject.yaml:

Admin:~/environment $ kubectl get hpa -n ho11y NAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE keda-hpa-ho11y-hpa Deployment/downstream0 0/1 (avg) 1 10 1 43m

Let’s put some load on the application by running the following command:

frontend_pod=`kubectl get pod -n ho11y --no-headers -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'` loop_counter=0 while [ $loop_counter -le 300 ] ; do kubectl exec -n ho11y -it $frontend_pod -- curl downstream0.ho11y.svc.cluster.local; echo ; loop_counter=$[$loop_counter+1];done

Describing the HPA should show something such as the following:

$ kubectl describe hpa -n ho11y Name: keda-hpa-ho11y-hpa Namespace: holly Labels: app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=keda-operator app.kubernetes.io/name=keda-hpa-ho11y-hpa app.kubernetes.io/part-of=ho11y-hpa app.kubernetes.io/version=2.4.0 scaledobject.keda.sh/name=ho11y-hpa Annotations: <none> CreationTimestamp: Fri 12 Nov 2021 17:49:24 +0000 Reference: Deployment/downstream0 Events: Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal SuccessfulRescale 40m horizontal-pod-autoscaler New size: 2; reason: external metric prometheus-http---10-100-166-65-workspaces-ws-597472e4-0868-4752-a5d5-9b654b86b9a5-ho11y_total(&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{scaledobject.keda.sh/name: ho11y-hpa}MatchExpressions:[]LabelSelectorRequirement{}}) above target

This confirms that the KEDA could successfully scale the application using the metrics ingested into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

Clean-up

Use the following commands to delete resources created during this post:

aws amp delete-workspace --workspace-id $WORKSPACE eksctl delete cluster $AMP_KEDA_CLUSTER

Conclusion

This post demonstrated how we can utilize KEDA operator to autoscale deployments based on some custom metrics stored in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. This helps customers provide on-demand compute by provisioning the pods only when they must have them. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus lets you store the metrics reliably and KEDA can monitor and scale the workloads out/in efficiently based on the events as they occur.

TRAIRÃO Brazil—Jaim Teixeira surveys his property from the back of a motorcycle wearing jeans and a long-sleeved sun-proof shirt to shield him from the jungle’s breathtaking heat.

It’s the end of the dry season and like everything and everyone in this part of the Amazon the lean 51-year-old rancher is covered in a fine brick-red dust.

Nearby a plume of smoke rises at the edge of the jungle canopy heading skyward until it blurs into an indistinct haze. Burning trees crackle and spit. One falls with a whack. Then another.

Teixeira lit the blaze the previous day to clear grazing land for his cattle. Brazil’s ranchers and rainforest frontiersmen call this limpeza. Cleaning. It’s the most expedient way to tame a jungle that stretches for thousands of miles in every direction.

“I know it’s illegal” he says gesturing toward the smoke. “If I had a salary I wouldn’t need to do it. But how else can I feed my family?”

No license allows a person to burn the Amazon’s ancient trees.

“For virgin forest” Teixeira said “you have to do it illegally.”

So people do.

The Amazon is enveloping and lush a place of stupefying richness. But a powerful web of extractive forces is also at work here.

Every day thousands of miners loggers farmers and ranchers burn or cut roughly 10000 acres of forest working to satisfy a growing demand for the resources it contains. They are tiny cogs in a sprawling global machine that has destroyed nearly one-fifth of the Brazilian rainforest—an area about the size of California—over the last 35 years driving more than 10000 plant and animal species toward extinction.

The Amazon is the biggest in a belt of forests that wraps the planet’s midsection. It is a jungle so hot and humid it makes its own rain. Its web of rivers is the largest in the world and contains about one-sixth of the world’s fresh water.

The rainforest is home to more than 10 percent of all plant and animal species with new ones being discovered on average every other day. Under its canopy insects fly around looking like Pixar characters; rare tiny mammals with humanly earnest faces scamper along branches bird song rings through the leaves. Everything is pulsing and oxygenated cycling through life and death and back to life.

Within this cycle the Amazon’s soils and vegetation store between 150 billion to 200 billion tons of carbon—roughly five times the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions helping to stabilize the atmosphere and provide a counterweight to global warming.

If the planet loses the Amazon it will be almost impossible to maintain that balance.

“A vast amount of carbon would be converted from organic matter into carbon dioxide and that would add to the carbon dioxide we’re already putting into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels” said Scott Denning an atmospheric scientist with Colorado State University. “That would be a catastrophe for humanity and for everything else.”

Parts of the Amazon are spread across nine countries from Bolivia in the south to Venezuela and Colombia in the north but Brazil has by far the largest piece with 60 to 70 percent of the rainforest. Brazil also suffers from some of the highest rates of rainforest destruction and degradation in the tropics.

For about a decade beginning in 2009 deforestation rates declined and then stabilized after the Brazilian government imposed stronger protections for the rainforest. But in 2019 with the election of President Jair Bolsonaro a far rightwing former military captain that trend quickly began to reverse. Since he took office the annual rate of deforestation has risen sharply increasing nearly 60 percent from 2020 according to a Brazilian research institute. Bolsonaro has called government data on deforestation a “lie.”

In November at the United Nation’s annual climate negotiations held in Glasgow Brazil promised to end illegal deforestation by 2028 but a new government report revealed that deforestation had risen—yet again—over the previous year.

The reversal has been so stark so convincingly tied to Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental policies and rhetoric his critics say that advocacy groups Indigenous tribes and some of the world’s most prominent human rights lawyers believe the president should be prosecuted. Bolsonaro’s role in destroying the Amazon they believe makes him a criminal on a par with genocidal dictators or the architects of war crimes.

In October the day before Teixeira set his forest ablaze and as thousands of small fires burned across the Amazon an Austrian environmental group became the latest to accuse Bolsonaro of crimes against humanity in a complaint filed with the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The complaint follows three others filed on behalf of Brazilian Indigenous groups.

The complaints could help persuade the international court to adopt a new crime—ecocide—as the fifth in the list of the world’s gravest offenses along with genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and waging illegal war. It would be the first crime to be added since the trial of the Nazis at Nuremberg after World War II and the first to make nature not humanity the victim. The crime of ecocide was officially defined this year by an independent legal panel as “unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and widespread or long-term damage to the environment.”

The complaints to the court will take years to play out if they ever do. But they bring to the world’s legal stage a longstanding conflict between industries that have exploited the Amazon’s resources—and are the foundation of the modern Brazilian economy—and the Indigenous people who’ve lived in the rainforest for millenia.

The outcome of that conflict now has consequences for the entire planet.

Indigenous tribes in the Amazon are on the frontline of the climate battle in ways that the rest of the world’s population is not and increasingly scientific research demonstrates that Indigenous land rights are critical for solving the climate crisis. When tribes have clear ownership of their land the forest remains intact. And when the forest remains intact otherwise dangerous carbon stays locked away in roots and soils leashed by Indigenous stewardship

“Without the forest we Indigenous people cannot live and humanity cannot live” said Chief Almir Narayamoga Suruí one tribal leader represented in the complaints in an interview at his village in the Sete de Setembro reservation. So he added Bolsonaro “is making genocide against the world.”

‘Beef Bibles and Bullets’

Hundreds of thousands of Jaim Teixeiras live across the Amazon and share a similar story.

Like Teixeira many came from the south from Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo to escape lives of crushing urban poverty. In the 1970s and 1980s the Brazilian government gave more than 1 million Brazilians plots of land along new army-built roads that opened the Amazon up to development. The one-room houses of these settlers are everywhere still overgrown with vines abandoned after their owners sold their land.

Teixeira remembers the day he arrived in the north from Rio July 18 1980 the date his modest success story began to take shape.

As a young man he bought some land. Then he bought some more. He got married and had three kids. He built a house with a clay-tile roof and electricity. Teixeira now has 140 cattle on 500 acres—small compared to some but an accomplishment for a guy who never went to high school. He’s carved a life out of the jungle.

Teixeira doesn’t know where his cattle end up. He sells them in town to a man who brings them north to Santarem or Itaituba. His ranch is just one of tens of thousands that provide cattle for the Brazilian meat industry with JBS—the world’s largest meat company headquartered in São Paulo—at the top.

Since the 1960s when government policies pushed the agricultural frontier deeper into the Amazon the number of cows in the country has exploded. Back then on the outskirts of Brasilia the modernist planned capital city JBS was a small ranching operation but it grew quickly as it fed the appetites of the new city. The Amazon was home to about 5 million cows. Today it has nearly 90 million beef cattle nearly half of Brazil’s total 200 million—more than any other country in the world. This explosion of cattle propelled by a demand for burgers and steaks is the main driver of the Amazon rainforest’s disappearance. Brazilian ranching is the largest source of deforestation-related greenhouse gas emissions in Latin America.

For poor farmers like Teixeira the meat industry has meant a living. To raise cattle all you need to do is burn some forest and let a few cows graze off the grasses that grow in the newly-cleared soil. You don’t need equipment or much capital. You need land but there’s plenty of it. Many ranchers just start clearing and grazing on land they don’t officially own. More than half the current deforestation in the Amazon occurs on public land that’s been illegally grabbed.

The big Brazilian meat companies—JBS along with Marfrig and Minerva—have promised to stop buying cattle from deforested land.

A spokeswoman for Marfrig said the company aims to eliminate deforestation throughout its supply chain by 2025 in the Amazon and 2030 in the neighboring Cerrado region. A spokeswoman for Minerva said “100 [percent] of purchases made by Minerva Foods are monitored in all operating regions” of Brazil and pointed to a government audit showing high rates of compliance with its deforestation efforts. A spokesman for JBS said the company has “no tolerance for illegal deforestation” and intends to “achieve a completely illegal deforestation-free supply chain by 2025.”

But critics say the supply chain is stubbornly murky and these commitments don’t add up to much. A rancher moves his cows to another rancher who raises the animals on pasture that was not recently cleared earning the cattle a clean record.

Across the vastness of the eastern and southern Amazon—the so-called Arc of Deforestation—white cows cover every green field and gather for shade at the bases of the trees left behind. From the sky they look like grains of rice.

Many of the cows are raised by wealthy ranchers with thousands of acres. Some of them are mayors of towns or members of the Brazilian congress. Some are just small-scale ranchers like Teixeira. As a whole they are Bolsonaro’s rural power base the ruralistas who believe in “beef bibles and bullets” as the saying goes.

The Bolsonaro administration did not reply to requests from Inside Climate News for comment for this article.

Bolsonaro’s pro-development anti-environment rhetoric has emboldened ranchers along with loggers and miners to clear more rainforest with seeming impunity. But burning and cutting virgin forest is still illegal and federal agencies though weakened under Bolsonaro try to punish violators. Agents from IBAMA the government’s environmental agency can destroy farm machinery and levy fines on ranch lands making them impossible to sell.

For Teixeira and thousands like him it’s worth the steep risk. Tomorrow or the day after when the flames die down he’ll plant grass seeds in the ashes and soon his cows will graze there.

“We have no education. We don’t have anything” he said. “This is what we have to do.”

‘An Island of Trees’

When João Cohen moved to his patch of the Amazon 30 years ago he killed 36 deadly vipers as he cleared land to plant manioc. The place was wild and tangled with no one around. He reached it on foot walking a narrow path a couple miles from the main road that leads to the port city of Santarem. Sometimes jaguar footsteps were so freshly printed in the path’s red soil he swore they were still warm.

Now his property is an island of trees surrounded by soybean fields that stretch to the horizon a green export-bound sea. Cohen 78 spends most of his time these days either fending off offers to buy his land or making sure his neighbors are not encroaching on it.

“This little piece of forest is protected” he said sitting stern-faced on the porch of his bright blue house. “It’s not for sale. It’s not for sale. How many times can I say ‘No’?” When the brother of a local mayor made an offer and with it an implied threat Cohen asked his daughter to call twice a day to check on him.

João Cohen lives alone on his small farm near Santarem where he raises crops for local markets. He’s routinely pressured to sell his land by farmers who want to grow soybeans there. Credit: Larry C. Price

After buying the land decades ago Cohen cleared just enough of it to make a living for himself growing black pepper mostly. He has a desirable freshwater spring and a running creek to water his crops. But deforestation to make room for the massive soybean farms has changed not just the landscape but the climate. Now sometimes the creek runs dry.

“When I first came here the weather was so different. There was so much forest” he said. “The chainsaws ate everything.” Now the rain barely comes and when it does the storms are so violent they scare him.

Science backs up what Cohen is experiencing firsthand. With more forests cut down for soy and cattle droughts are getting worse in the Amazon; rains are becoming more erratic and intense.

The soybean boom in Brazil has transformed the country into the world’s biggest producer of soy overtaking the United States. In the process soybean growers have gobbled up giant swaths of the Amazon. An agreement signed in 2006 by the major grain traders to stop buying soy from recently deforested land was successful in decreasing deforestation in the Amazon. But critics say that pushed soy production into the Cerrado a savannah biome that’s critically important for climate stabilization but gets less attention than its jungly neighbor. Roughly half of the Cerrado has been destroyed much of it for soy and much of it illegally.

Most of Brazil’s soy goes to China—more than $20 billion in sales a year—as animal feed for that country’s ever-expanding hog industry sold to the Chinese by American companies including Bunge ADM and Cargill the biggest privately-held company in the United States.

There is a pattern in the Amazon: The loggers come first often followed by miners who use the inroads that loggers have cut in the jungle. Then ranchers move in and graze on the pasture where the trees stood and farmers plant soy and corn in those pastures. More recently demand for soy has become so great that parts of the Amazon and the Cerrado are being converted directly to soy.

“It was beautiful dense forest five years ago. In this area there were no gigantic farms” said Iza Maria Castro Dos Santos Pueblo Tapuia an Indigenous activist who lives in Santarem. “Today there are giant bulldozers. It used to be chainsaws. What they used to chop down in a day they can do in an hour.”

A spokeswoman for ADM said the company does not source its products from any newly deforested areas in the Amazon. A spokeswoman for Cargill said the company is committed to eliminating deforestation from its supply chains “in the shortest time possible” and that it “will not source from farmers who clear land illegally or in protected areas.” The company has “the same expectations of our suppliers” she said. Bunge did not respond to requests for comment for this article but has said in past statements that it will eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2025.

The pressure will only ramp up experts say. Soy farming across Brazil is predicted to grow even more in the coming years with new “agricultural frontiers” opening up especially in northern parts of the country. There are plans in process for more ports along more rivers and a new railway to move grain to the waterways.

That means more virgin forest and savannah converted to farmland and more small-scale landowners standing in the crosshairs of an expanding industry.

Santarem near the confluence of the Tapajós and Amazon rivers sits at the terminus of BR 163—the so-called Soybean Highway—which runs 2200 miles north through the Cerrado and the Amazon basin. During the dry season from May to October a disjointed convoy of double-hulled 90-foot-long tractor-trailers move grain northward along its potholed deeply rutted surface. They pass by frontier towns that have formed along this artery with their journeyman hotels chainsaw dealerships and slaughterhouses between them an unrelenting panorama of soybean fields with each grain elevator poking up into the sky like a giant Oz-ian Tin Man.

The road stops at the edge of the Tapajós where a towering grain terminal built by Cargill shuttles soy off to the rest of the world. Tourists walk along the river promenade at night eating ice cream with the terminal lights on the roller coaster-shaped Cargill facility twinkling in the near distance. If this wasn’t the Amazon you might mistake it for a seaside amusement park.

But the facility is not a popular place with some. Cargill built it on a public beach near an archeologically important Indigenous site say critics who took the company to court and lost.

“It’s like a monster over there” said Tapuia who was part of the effort to derail the Cargill terminal plan.

That monster has helped to make Santarem a prosperous place with schools hospitals and infrastructure—a place where an old man like Cohen might be safer than alone on an island of trees surrounded by soybean fields. His daughter wants her father to move to the city away from the pressures of the jungle.

He won’t.

“There’s no way anyone will touch my forest” he said. “I want to build a house under the mango tree and live there forever in my eternal home. No one will ever buy this land. I’ll scare them off like a lost ghost.”

‘It’s an Ecocide’

Chief Suruí leader of the Paiter-Suruí tribe emerges from his concrete house into a blaring sunny morning and sits on a bench under the shady palm-thatched roof of his tribe’s ceremonial living area.

He is holding a basket of worms called gongo which he pops into his mouth like peanuts. Damon the little white dog that follows him everywhere sits by the chief’s feet.

Suruí is famous in Brazil and beyond for his political activism and considered a hero by his people for appealing to government leaders for support that has helped the tribe survive. He is often whipsawed by the demands of his position—one day speaking to the United Nations in New York City the next living a modest life in his village of tin-roofed houses about 800 miles south of Manaus in the state of Rondônia.

Suruí connected with a team of Paris-based lawyers last year to file the complaint against Bolsonaro because he said he believes the president has put his allies in positions of power allowing them to run agencies that have steamrolled Indigenous rights and weakened environmental protections.

“The government has an important role to guarantee the future” he said. “If the government doesn’t accept this duty it’s an ecocide.”

Suruí is not just angry at Bolsonaro who he said has opened the door to more agribusiness mining and logging on public and Indigenous land. He is also angry with the corporations that are taking advantage of Bolsonaro’s leniency and funding lobbying groups that are pushing laws to dismantle Indigenous and environmental protections.

“Illegal things happen because there’s a big market. Business gives us profit right away” Suruí said. “People don’t think of the consequences.”

He said he hopes the international court by making ecocide a crime can step in but he knows the court moves slowly.

“I know it will take a long time and I don’t have much hope” he said. “But I know with this filing the world will learn how unhappy we are with Brazilian politics.”

Walking through the rainforest surrounding the village he points out a huge tract of forest that was burned by loggers in 2019 in retaliation for the tribe’s resistance to their trespassing. Now coffee manioc cupuacu and cacao plants grow there.

“It’s possible to produce responsibly” he said. “We don’t need to deforest another inch of the Amazon.”

‘The Dream of All Miners’

Odacir “Gringo” Leseux has gone to jail three times for mining illegally in the Amazon rainforest.

“They caught me with diamonds in my hands. The feds got me in my house” he said matter of factly. “But that was my job. I could feed my family. I bought that house.”

In a suede-brimmed hat polo shirt and jean shorts Leseux looks like someone who used to bet on greyhounds at a dog track in Miami. Like someone who relies on a little luck.

“Mining is an illusion” he said. “You only make coins but you talk about millions. That’s the dream of all miners. It’s all about dreams.”

Leseux is traveling along a road called the Transgarimpeira or “Trans-miners” that stretches west off the BR 163 about a 20-hour drive northeast of the Suruí territory. It’s familiar terrain for him: He has mined here for years and keeps a few of his things in a dormitorio near Boa Esperança one of the mining settlements along the route.

Like thousands of small-scale miners—known as wildcat miners or garimpeiros—he has no plans to stop looking for gems in the rainforest.

Fabrizio Schwingle a restaurant owner from the city of Cuiabá several hundred miles to the south is looking for gold near Boa Esperança where he spends most of the year living under a tarp in a makeshift camp in the jungle. A generator hums from the edge of the forest running a sluicing machine that looks like a Steampunk prop. Chickens peck around amid the trash and empty plastic bottles that cover the forest floor. One hen has left her eggs next to a generator that died months ago.

“I have a churrascaria in Cuiabá” Schwingle said sweat dripping off his face. “But gold is an addiction.”

That addiction is enabled by growing global demand and soaring prices for gold.

In the last several years a gold rush in the Amazon has led to more incursions on tribal lands and more rainforest destruction. One recent study found that about 30 percent of the gold mined in Brazil is extracted illegally and from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2020 new mining areas destroyed more than 80 square miles of forest. A bill introduced by Bolsonaro would allow more mining on Indigenous land and if it passes the Brazilian congress researchers estimate deforestation could rise another 20 percent.

“Bolsonaro’s father was a wildcat miner” said Raoni Rajão a researcher with the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and a co-author of the study. “He has this perception that wildcat miners are entrepreneurs and heroes.”

Mining doesn’t drive the same high levels of deforestation as soy or cattle Rajão noted but it poisons water and is leading to escalating conflicts with Indigenous tribes. “You have violence. The suffering of the Indigenous population” he said. “That’s the most concerning issue.”

The Transgarimpeira passes clusters of settlements known as currutela and small towns that look like Amazonian “Deadwoods.” They have names that promise fortune like the Jardim do Ouro or Garden of Gold and they offer all the usual distractions and necessities: boarding houses bars with pool tables churches and “black beetles”—one-room improvised brothels wrapped in black plastic sheeting. Prostitutes are paid in gold.

“I know one lady who sold her house in Manaus and goes for 20 days to one currutela then on to the next” Leseux said.

Above his open pit mine at Boa Esperança José Nascimento who has been mining the Amazon for decades walks along a tall dirt embankment peering down at two young employees who are spraying high-pressure streams of water onto slopes of dirt. The water goes into a trough and is pushed by the water pressure onto a ramp where the solids drop into a rustic catchment system. Later using mercury and a rag Nascimento will squeeze these solids pressing out tiny amounts of gold and mercury. In a very good week he will end up with about 200 grams of gold.

“When we produce some gold I get so happy” he said looking up from the brim of a baseball hat bearing the words “Amazon Gold.” “Sometimes I work one or two years—nothing. Then boom!”

Nascimento is optimistic about the future. “I still have virgin forest back there” he said pointing to the chunk of the rainforest that he’s arranged with the landowner to cut down and mine. “That area? It’s all gold.”

Asked if he worries that mining is destroying the rainforest he brushes it off. “My impact is low compared to the wealth I produce” he said. “Do you know how much a farmer destroys? Five thousand acres.”

“This will be very different” he said because the trees will grow back.

His fellow miner Leseux was a farmer for a little while but was lured into gold and diamonds in the late 1980s. Sometimes he wishes he’d stuck with farming Leseux said.

“I was in Mato Grosso planting soy and rice. I came to visit a mine in Juina and never left” he said referring to a city in that state. “I know if I had never left grains I’d be a rich man today.”

But the thrill of illicit mining is now in his blood. Soon he’ll be leaving for the state of Roraima farther north. He’s heard rumors of big paydirt there.

“It’s a huge adrenaline high” he said. “All the time you’re running from the police. But then you get far into the forest and you’re free.”

A Territory Under Threat

On a cloudy October morning Chief Juarez Munduruku gathered with his family at a table in his palm-thatched house. One of his grandchildren fed crackers to a green parrot. A tamarin looked down from a water tower. A macaw swooped in circles around the village called Sawré Muybu which is about 300 miles south of Santarem.

The chief looked worried.

Through a YouTube channel that Amazonian tribes subscribe to for information about political developments and events in Indigenous lands the chief had learned that members of another tribe the Kaingang had been killed in a territory to the south. The killings he said stemmed from a disagreement between Kaingang members over leasing some of their lands to soy farmers. Demand for new land to grow soy has become so great that agribusinesses are seeking to expand into Indigenous territories creating conflicts within some tribes over allowing the leases and distribution of the proceeds.

The chief blames these rising tensions squarely on Bolsonaro who has made it clear that developing more of the Amazon goes hand-in-hand with removing protections for Indigenous lands.

“Land leasing is something that originates with the government” he says. “Sooner or later it will be problematic. It will divide the tribes. Division is not good.”

Asked if his own tribe is in agreement over whether to allow development in its lands he hesitates for a beat: “I think so.”

The Amazon is home to more than 400 Indigenous groups 80 of which are “uncontacted” and live in voluntary isolation from the modern world. But the Munduruku tribe like the Paiter-Suruí and others live a kind of hybridized life close to nature and the rainforest but entwined with a modern economy.

The pressures from the outside world have meant they have been forced to engage with it to defend their land and rights. Like Chief Suruí Munduruku has become a prominent political force drawn into activism because of mounting illegal incursions on his tribe’s land.

In Sawré Muybu RoseAnnie Munduruku lives with her four children and grandchild in a modest house where hammocks swing above concrete and dirt floors and a television plays cartoons with the sound off. She’s known as the village cook able to deftly transform local fish including piranha into nightly spreads.

Her children go to the village school housed in a rusty-roofed shack where the students have drawn lessons and characters on the walls. Some of them are pro-Indigenous graffiti conveying the anger that has riled this and other Indigenous communities since Bolsonaro took office.

Over the course of the summer an unprecedented wave of Indigenous protests swept across the country mostly on Brasilia’s “Monumental Axis”—akin to the National Mall in Washington D.C.—where thousands of people marched against Bolsonaro’s proposals or those supported by industries allied with the president.

RoseAnnie Munduruku rarely leaves the village but this past August she traveled by bus—two days and two nights—to attend a protest in Brasilia against one of Bolsonaro’s proposals that would weaken Indigenous rights to their lands.

“What I do best is cook” the 48-year-old grandmother said defiantly as she collected dishes from the dinner table. “I wasn’t there to cook.”

A Risky Job

On a wall inside the offices of an Indigenous rights advocacy group called Kanindé is a giant image: a black-and-white photo of a 4-year-old girl wearing a headdress of feathers her smiling face turned up toward the sun.

Twenty years after the photo of her was taken Txai Suruí sits in the room where it hangs tapping away at her laptop. A member of the Paiter-Suruí tribe she is now a climate and Indigenous rights advocate one member of an upwelling of youth activists across the Amazon.

“If you look at a map you see where there’s forest is where the Indigenous people are” Suruí said. “The rest is destroyed.”

Being an activist is a risky job in Brazil. A recent report found that 20 Indigenous and environmental activists were killed here last year. The Kaninde employees are well aware of this. The modest office is wired with security cameras and guarded with metal bars.

Ivaneide Bandeira who is Suruí’s boss and founded the group in 1991 said she receives threats from people she believes are tied to local politicians and industry groups. “I can’t go outside by myself” she said.

In October Suruí traveled to Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference known as COP26. There she met with global leaders spoke on a panel about the role of Indigenous youth in tackling the climate crisis and marched in the street with a sign that read “Stop Bolsonaro for the Future of the Planet.”

The presence of Amazonian Indigenous groups in climate talks isn’t new but research behind their role in forestalling the climate crisis is growing. In the weeks leading up to COP26 advocacy groups released a new report saying that Indigenous peoples were not only the best stewards of forest conservation—as research has shown before—but that this stewardship translated to significant and specific amounts of carbon storage.

One study found that Indigenous lands and community territory contain roughly 250 billion metric tons of carbon across 24 tropical countries but also noted that these communities only have legal rights to less than half of that area. That the authors say weakens Indigenous communities’ ability to protect the land and the carbon stored in its forests and soils.

Another study found that Indigenous communities in 64 countries stored more than 290000 million metric tons of carbon roughly 33 times global energy emissions in 2017. In the Amazon a more recent study found 94 percent of Indigenous lands were carbon sinks compared to non-Indigenous lands in the Amazon which were net carbon emitters.

“The communities in these forests are completely connected to nature” she said. “They’re the solution.”

‘They Lie’

Chief Munduruku rides down the Tapajos river in a jon boat through the valley his ancestors have lived in for hundreds of years. A cluster of machetes rests in the boat’s bow. The chief his wife and a few relatives sit in the back drinking coffee from a thermos.

They make outings like this every once in a while to check on the tribe’s lands which occupy thousands of acres on either side of the river a major tributary of the Amazon.

Over the last 10 years or so more miners and loggers have crept in setting up camps and digging for gold or gems or coming with chainsaws taking a mahogany tree here an ipe tree there eating into the rainforest like termites. The river unpolluted seven or eight years ago is now filled with silt churned up by barges dredging the river bottom for gold. The water feels and looks like milky tea.

The land is so vast and thickly vegetated that the Munduruku people don’t have enough eyes to patrol it. Government agencies don’t have the bodies either—or the will—and under Bolsonaro the monitoring has become yet more anemic.

“The destruction—we know it’s going on everywhere” the chief said before the excursion. “Deforestation is coming from one side fire from the other.”

The boat arrives at the river’s edge. A man approaches explaining that he’s an evangelical Christian and there to gather supplies from a camp about 30 miles (50 kilometers) away. He apologizes to the chief for being on his land. Later the group sees the contents of the man’s pick-up truck: a chainsaw engine oil diesel and salt used to preserve food during long stays in the jungle. At the base of some trees nearby is a stack of palm hearts—harvested illegally.

The chief is a mild-mannered man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair that suggests business. When he laughs which he does easily a fan of wrinkles spreads at the corner of his eyes. But as his boat pulls away from the landing his normally placid face turns cloudy. He bites down on a macaw feather-turned-toothpick that twitches angrily in his teeth.

“They’re stealing” he said.

In the past couple of years the chief and his fellow tribal leaders have found bulldozers and trucks in spots up and down the river. The intruders were clearly trespassing on tribal land but the chief simply asked them to leave. The next time he finds them he said he’s going to set their equipment on fire.

“They say things. They say they’re not going to come back” Chief Munduruku said. “They lie.”

One of the complaints filed with the international court says that there have been 41 recent incursions into Munduruku lands which have been “subject to an evident increase in violations by wildcat miners palm-hear(t) gatherers and loggers encouraged by President Jair Bolsonaro.” The complaint also notes that the headquarters of a Munduruku women’s association was torched earlier this year.

The Munduruku are still awaiting a formal demarcation of the boundaries of their territory which would confer stronger protections on their land. When they started the process of getting the demarcation seven years ago the chief and other members of the tribe started getting threats from miners and loggers allied with local politicians.

“Just down from the village five guys came looking for me” Chief Munduruku recalled. “The guys came very close to me. One turned as they were leaving and took a picture. Their behavior was hit-men behavior. I took it as a threat. I didn’t sleep after that.”

He said he has been followed in Itaituba the nearest big city and as he went to the landing at Burbure where boats depart for Sawré Muybu.

There gold barges sit at the river’s edge waiting for repairs amid vultures and garbage as techno music blares into the jungle from a nearby bar. The miners in Burbure glare at the Munduruku who always travel with at least two other tribe members for safety.

“If I was scared I couldn’t be in this fight” the chief said. “I’m fighting for what’s mine. We’re not trying to steal.

Munduruku was appointed chief in 1999 and is now in his early 60s. He’s the father of eight; grandfather of 22. Like Suruí he spends much of his time traveling appealing to corporate and government leaders in Brazil and beyond to stop the destruction of his tribe’s swath of the rainforest.

“I miss my family a lot. My grandkids” he said talking about his travels. “The sounds of the howler monkeys in the morning the birds. I get truly homesick for my people. The wildlife surrounding the tribe—the tapirs hogs paca. We see things we don’t even know what they are. All this is the Amazon for me.”

Loggers or miners who cut the forest either clearing it wholesale or a few trees at a time and farmers who “clean” it with flames often insist that the trees will grow back. Bolsonaro makes the same argument: The forest is renewable and will bounce back from what his administration calls “economic utilization.”

But science says otherwise. The towering hardwoods—mahogany ipe and kapok—will take centuries to reach their full height. One square yard of rainforest might contain seven or eight tree species millions of microbes countless insect and animal species that depend on a network of interactions with the vegetation rainfall and soil that has evolved over millions of years.

It is infinitely complex and interconnected.

“If it’s deforested the forest will grow back again” the chief said. “But not like it was.”

Being a landlord is one of the oldest ways to earn a passive income. And these days you don’t have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.

Check out real estate investment trusts which are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.

REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants fixing damages or chasing down late payments. Instead they simply sit back and enjoy the dividend checks rolling in when they pick a winning REIT.

Of course the COVID-19 pandemic did impact some commercial real estate. And not all REITs are the same. If you are a landlord for e-commerce giant Amazon for instance you should have no problem collecting a steady stream of rental income.

With that in mind let’s take a look at two REITs paying oversized dividends to investors — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash.

Amazon’s landlord

The first one is STAG Industrial (STAG) a REIT that owns and operates single-tenant industrial properties throughout the U.S. Its biggest tenant is Amazon.

The company’s portfolio consists of 517 buildings totaling approximately 103 million rentable square feet across 40 states.

Note that 434 of the 517 properties are warehouses which happen to be an essential part of e-commerce.

Moreover a tenant survey in 2020 revealed that around 40% of the REIT’s portfolio handles e-commerce activity.

To see how solid STAG Industrial is take a look at its dividend history.

Since the company went public in 2011 it has paid a higher dividend every single year.

While most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule STAG Industrial pays shareholders every month. The monthly dividend rate stands at 12.08 cents per share which translates to an annual yield of 3.2%.

STAG Industrial shares are up 50% year to date. If you don’t feel comfortable picking individual stocks in this elevated market you can always build a diversified passive income portfolio automatically just by investing your spare change.

When it comes to paying monthly dividends one company stands out above all — Realty Income (O).

Realty Income has been paying uninterrupted monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That’s 616 consecutive monthly dividends paid.

Better yet since the company went public in 1994 it has announced 114 dividend increases.

Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of nearly 11000 commercial properties located in all 50 states Puerto Rico the UK and Spain. It leases them to around 650 tenants operating across 60 industries.

This means even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn the impact on company-level financials will likely be limited.

For instance while Realty Income rents some properties to AMC Theaters — whose business was hurt by COVID-19 — it also has Walgreens FedEx and Walmart as some of its top tenants. And these businesses turned out to be largely pandemic-proof.

Earlier this week the REIT increased its monthly cash dividend to 24.65 cents per share giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 4.4%.

To put things in perspective the average dividend yield of S&P 500 companies is just 1.3% today.

Looking beyond REITs

Of course stocks are volatile. And even the best REITs are not immune to the market’s ups and downs.

Diversification is key — and you don’t have to stay in the stock market to get it.

If you want to invest in something insulated from stock market swings take a look at some lesser-known alternative assets.

Traditionally investing in sectors like exotic vehicles or multifamily apartment buildings or even litigation finance have only been options for the ultrarich.

But with the help of new platforms these kinds of opportunities are available to retail investors too.

The land housed the former Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad corridor and will soon be developed into a trail system for Missouri State Parks.

Missouri Department of Natural Resources took ownership of the donated land from Missouri Central Railroad Company a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameren Missouri Tuesday at no cost to the state.

""It's an exciting time on the state park system"" said David Kelly director of Missouri State Parks.

DNR entered into an Interim Trail Use Agreement with the railroad company in 2019 to railbank this section of the corridor. This means they had a voluntary agreement between the railroad company and trail agency to use as a trail system land that would otherwise have been abandoned according to DNR's news release.

“We’re excited to officially transfer the ownership of the Rock Island Trail to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources bringing the state one step closer to transforming the corridor into a world-class recreation destination” said Mark Birk senior vice president for customer and power operations at Ameren Missouri.

Prior to the Rock Island Corridor takeover DNR bought and now operates the Rock Island Spur of the Katy Trail which spans 47 miles of multi-use trail from Windsor to Pleasant Hill.

""The Katy Trail is the longest developed rail-trail in the nation"" Kelly said. ""It's in the Rail-Trail Hall of Fame. It is a destination for people from all over the United States and we get people from all over the world to come to Missouri because of this rail-trail system.""

With the addition of the Rock Island 144 as Kelly called it Missouri will have more than 400 miles of rail-trail when all is said and done. More trails bode well especially with the increased attendance the state parks saw since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""One thing we saw during the pandemic we have a lot of people discovering our state parks"" Kelly said. ""We had record attendance on the Katy Trail with record attendance to state parks. As people got outdoors we saw a lot of new people.""

Once developed the 100-foot wide corridor will pass through several communities like Versailles Eldon Eugene Meta Argyle Freeburg Belle Bland Owensville Rosebud Gerald Leslie and Beaufort.

""It gives one more opportunity for people to get outdoors of course but it also provides the economic impact to those communities elevating the small towns that the corridor goes through"" Kelly added.

The planning process has yet to start and there's no set date for when the corridor will be fully developed. The rail company Ameren Missouri already took out the ties and trails across the 144 miles so there's almost a clean slate to work with.

For now Kelly said there's ample opportunity to create something ""spectacular.""

The carrier along with the operator of LGA's Terminal B LaGuardia Gateway Partners opened the final phase of construction in the Western Concourse on Thursday.

In addition to the four new gates with floor-to-ceiling windows modernized seating and new concessionaires the Western Concourse is now home to American's new Admirals Club in LaGuardia.

TPG went for a first-look tour of the new spaces on Friday — and can confirm that Santa was indeed very generous this year.

Inside the new Admirals Club

The highlight for American flyers will undoubtedly be the new Admirals Club.

Located one floor above the gate level the lounge is accessible via a pair of escalators.

Once at the top you'll find the entrance to the lounge on the left.

As you enter the lounge you'll be greeted by a large living area with a variety of seating options ranging from individual recliners to couches and more.

This is also where you'll find a hallway that will connect to the rest of the lounge when it opens next summer. Once complete the lounge will span more than 20000 square feet with room for over 350 passengers.

Until then the lounge is on the small side and will likely get quite crowded during peak departure windows.

In addition to the living area there are a handful of two-person tables lining the perimeter of the lounge which leads to the bar and dining area.

Along the way is a media room with eight seats facing a large TV.

The dining area has a few tables along with three two-person booths that are built into the wall.

The buffet is along the edge of the lounge and features American's pandemic-era light bites service including crudites hummus cheese cubes and hard fruits.

Note that the bar is currently closed as the lounge is waiting to receive its liquor license which should happen in the next few days according to the staff.

There's a tree in the center of the space which helps add a sense of tranquility to an otherwise hectic airport experience.

The new lounge trades apron views for an open-air aesthetic overlooking the terminal and taxiways in the distance — which might be the only downside for some aviation enthusiasts.

All in all though the new space is a massive improvement compared to the old one.

New gates and retailers complete the Western Concourse

The Western Concourse now has four additional gates in operation each with plenty of seating and access to power outlets.

Even more gates have been built but they won't become operational until the old concourse is demolished and jetbridges are installed.

The new gates are designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing ones — most travelers won't even be able to tell that the concourse opened in phases.

Along with the new gates is a kids' play area that's designed to resemble the New York City skyline.

What's still to come

To coincide with the completion of the Western Concourse the last remaining ""old"" gates in Terminal B are now officially closed marking the end of the leaking ceilings narrow hallways and long bathroom lines that LaGuardia flyers used to experience.

However there's still just a little bit more work that needs to get done in Terminal B. For one the old central concourse must be demolished in order to make way for additional gates in Western Concourse.

Additionally work on the pedestrian bridge that connects the headhouse with the Western Concourse is still underway with completion scheduled for early next year.

Until then you can still catch one final glimpse of the old terminal as you walk through an old hallway to get between the two buildings.

Last Updated 2 years ago

The leading biometrics company CLEAR and popular transportation app Uber has formed a partnership that looks to make getting to the airport on time for a flight a stress free experience for travelers in the US. With travel being a stressful experience at the best of times – let alone during a global pandemic where rules and regulations change almost daily – the partnership will help eliminate some of those stresses and ensure travelers don't have to worry about being late for flights.

The new feature has been launched just in time for the holiday travel period during which millions of Americans are expected to travel domestically – despite the growing threat of the Omicron variant. Here's everything you need to know about the partnership between the two companies and why it will help to make travel a walk in the park for millions of Americans.

New Airport Transfer Solution – What Travelers Should Know

When it comes to traveling to an airport there are several reasons why using taxis is so popular amongst Americans. From not having to worry about the drive to avoiding those pricey airport long term parking fees millions of Americans each year choose to start their trips with a taxi journey. Prior to the pandemic 22% of Uber users said that they used the platform most often for trips to the airport – and with the new partnership between CLEAR and Uber that figure could be set to rise.

The new partnership between the two companies will see Uber's travel platform integrated with CLEAR's “Home to Gate” feature. By combining the two travelers will be able to find out exactly when they should leave for their flight and it will give them the ability to reserve an Uber ride ahead of their departure date – creating a travel experience that is much more streamlined easier and worry-free for travelers.

The “Home To Gate” feature assesses a number of factors such as traffic levels security screening time and distance needed to walk through the airport to provide travelers an extremely accurate time that they should leave in order to arrive at their gate on time for their flight. By adding the ability to book an Uber ahead of time the stresses of working out when to book a taxi for are taken out of the traveler's hands – leaving them free to only worry about what they should pack.

A free feature of the CLEAR app here's how travelers can use it:

Open the free CLEAR App and tap the “Home to Gate” tile

Share location and flight details and – using data driven insights – Home To Gate will tell the traveler the best time to leave for their flight

Tap the “Get A Ride With Uber ” button and the Uber app will have a ride reservation ready to go with all the trip details

Speaking about the new partnership Uber's Head of Mobility in the US & Canada Dennis Cinelli said:

“We're thrilled to partner with CLEAR to alleviate some of the holiday travel stress. As we look to a busy holiday season we're focused on getting travelers where they need to go as quickly and easily as possible. Our integration with CLEAR will take the guesswork out of travel and give users peace of mind knowing they'll get to the airport on time.”

This isn't the first time that companies have sought to enhance journeys to the airport during the pandemic. Back in February United Airlines made a significant $1B investment in a company that was developing electric-powered VTOL aircraft that would be used to ferry passengers to their airport. However with production of the aircraft not expected until 2023 travelers will have to make do Uber for their airport transport means for the time being.

(SWEPCO) a utility of Columbus Ohio-based American Electric Power (AEP) recently released its Integrated Resource Plan that included timelines for coal plant retirements and renewable energy capacity additions. However they aren’t happening soon enough according to environmental group Sierra Club.

Sierra Club took issue with several elements of the plan including SWEPCO’s decision to continue to operate coal-fired Flint Creek Power Plant until 2038 without providing an economic analysis of retiring it. However the group noted SWEPCO removed plans to build a natural gas-fired plant from the draft plan.

“SWEPCO’s plan lacks the type of thorough economic analysis that could have found cost savings in retiring its coal plants and adding solar resources faster” said Josh Smith staff attorney for Sierra Club. “It’s disappointing that SWEPCO refused to study the economics of retiring Flint Creek more quickly and simply assumes without justification that customers should pay for this plant through 2038. SWEPCO needs to change course at Flint Creek soon and avoid wasting further customer money on this plant. Sierra Club will urge regulators to stop issuing blank checks for SWEPCO’s wasteful spending at Flint Creek. The good news is that SWEPCO plans to add a large amount of wind energy while we’ll continue to compel the utility to add solar and storage resources sooner.”

In response SWEPCO spokesman Peter Main explained that “the 516-megawatt plant in Gentry is an essential part of the Northwest Arkansas power grid with ongoing upgrades that comply with stringent federal environment regulations.” Main also said SWEPCO completed “an analysis to compare the merits of retiring Flint Creek in 2028 versus retrofitting the plant to comply with recent regulations and operate through its original retirement date of 2038.” The analysis was completed to support its compliance plans filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in November 2020.

“Along with Flint Creek SWEPCO’s IRP includes the addition of 4000 megawatts of solar energy and 2450 megawatts of wind in a resource mix that continues our move toward more renewable energy and ensures reliability and affordability for our customers” Main added.

The Integrated Resource Plan provides a 20-year energy portfolio outlook and must be submitted to the Arkansas Public Service Commission every three years. “SWEPCO has selected a plan that balances the key factors of customer affordability rate stability maintaining reliability and sustainability” Main said. The report shows how the company plans to meet the four objectives over the 20-year planning period.

According to the plan the company will need new capacity in 2023 as a result of the retirement of its coal-fired Pirkey 1 plant. The need expands in 2028 and 2030 with the planned retirements of SWEPCO’s coal-fired Welsh plant and natural gas-fired Wilkes plant respectively. The Welsh plant will be converted to run on natural gas in 2028 and operate through 2037. On Dec. 2 SWEPCO decided to delay the planned retirement of the natural gas-fired Lieberman plant units No. 3 and No. 4 from December 2022 and December 2024 respectively to no later than Dec. 31 2026.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) coal plant operators plan to retire 28% or 59 gigawatts of the coal-fired electricity generating capacity currently operating in the United States by 2035. As of September 212 gigawatts of the capacity were in operation. The average age for coal-fired plants operating in the United States is 45 years old. As of September no plans have been posted to install new coal-fired power plants in the United States.

By 2041 SWEPCO plans to add 4000 megawatts of new solar and 2450 megawatts of new wind generation capacity. Over the next five years SWEPCO plans to add 550 megawatts of solar capacity. The majority of the new additions in solar capacity will be made from 2027-2033 after solar costs are expected to fall and the capacity need rises. Also SWEPCO expects to add 2160 megawatts of natural gas-fired capacity between 2036 and 2040 as the Welsh plant is retired along with the coal-fired Flint Creek plant and the Wilkes plant.

From 2023 to 2024 between 270 and 280 megawatts of short-term capacity purchases will be made as new resources are phased into the portfolio. However the amount of purchases is expected to be re-evaluated as a result of the decision to delay the Lieberman plant retirements.

Over the next 20 years SWEPCO expects customer count to increase by 0.2% per year. Retail sales are projected to grow by the same amount over that period as stronger growth from the residential and industrial sectors offsets a decline in commercial sales.

By 2030 the utility expects to reduce emissions by 80% compared to its 2000 baseline consistent with the goals of parent company AEP. SWEPCO also expects to reduce NOx emissions by 85% and SO2 emissions by 96% over the next decade.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) may have delivered a final blow to the United States’s best chance to take action on the climate crisis this decade.

After months of negotiations with the White House and Democratic leaders Manchin announced on Fox News that he will be a “no” vote on the centerpiece of the president’s domestic agenda in its current form. That agenda — known as the Build Back Better Act — would have invested $555 billion in clean electricity electric vehicles and reducing methane emissions. Although the $1.75 trillion bill has already passed the House of Representatives a no vote from Manchin would ensure the bill does not have a path forward in the Senate. That’s because Democrats were relying on a budget process that requires 50 Senate votes to get it to President Joe Biden’s desk.

As Vox’s Andrew Prokop wrote it’s possible that Manchin’s Sunday comments were just another negotiating tactic and he could be convinced to support a revised version of the Build Back Better plan that delivers on what he wants.

But if the bill truly is a goner it will be much more than a political setback for the Biden agenda. It will be a colossal tragedy for the planet and future generations which are depending on the US government to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels this decade with major legislation like this bill to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The bill also contains funding for adapting to climate change and helping the most vulnerable communities; without it the US will be far less prepared to face escalating climate disasters here at home.

It’s unlikely Democrats will have exactly the same set of political circumstances — in control of both the presidency and Congress — to pass a similarly ambitious climate agenda in the next decade. “We won’t be acting on the climate crisis if we don’t pass this bill and there’s not a decade left to waste” said Leah Stokes a climate political scientist at UC-Santa Barbara who has been advising Democrats. “Senator Manchin talks a lot about that and what he owes to his grandchildren and the number one thing he owes to his grandchildren is a livable planet.”

Democrats probably won’t get a second chance after next year’s midterms to act. And the next time they do have a chance it may be too late to limit some of the worst effects of warming.

The US can’t reach its climate goals without congressional legislation

If passed the Build Back Better Act would deliver the largest injection of federal funds into clean energy and emissions reductions that the country has ever seen. It would tackle the two biggest sources of US pollution that come from the transportation and electricity sectors by boosting clean energy electric vehicles and charging stations.

The US is responsible for the largest share of global warming so serious federal action is essential to closing the gap. Climate scientists have warned that once the atmosphere warms more than 1.5 degrees Celsius we will live in a drastically changed world. If countries corporations and individuals don’t take immediate action to reduce pollution the world may hit that grim milestone in just 10 years.

The bill would also literally save lives. For example its clean energy funding would help close the nation’s last coal plants eliminating an energy source that releases particulate matter that contributes to asthma heart attacks and other diseases. One Harvard estimate found that reaching 80 percent clean electricity by 2030 would save 9200 lives in 2030 alone and another 317500 through 2050.

Finally the bill would dedicate hundreds of millions of dollars to helping communities prepare for worsening floods heat and fires in the name of climate justice. One program would help tribes relocate away from areas threatened by climate change and other investments would help disadvantaged communities improve their water and physical infrastructure.

By the time the bill passed the House of Representatives progressive Democrats had already made some concessions that weakened some of the key provisions. They scaled down the overall cost of the bill and cut some proposals including setting a national standard to reach 80 percent clean energy by 2030. All of that was to appease Manchin. It just didn’t work.

“Utter nonsense” a “catastrophic failure”: The climate community reacts

Manchin released a statement after his Fox appearance elaborating on why he said “I just can’t” vote for the legislation. Several of his complaints targeted the climate provisions in the bill. He said the Build Back Better Act would harm the electric grid and increase dependence on foreign supply chains. He worried a faster energy transition “will have catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California in the last two years”— likely a reference to power outages and volatile energy rates from extreme weather the past few years. (In fact a major reason his West Virginia constituents have faced higher utility rates in recent years is coal is getting more expensive.)

Climate advocates who helped Democrats design the Build Back Better plan were grieving Sunday over what the loss would mean for both the planet and public health. Jesse Jenkins a Princeton expert on the electricity sector and adviser to the White House on the Build Back Better plan called Manchin’s news “devastating” and his excuses “utter nonsense.”

Sam Ricketts co-director of the advocacy group Evergreen Action who has advised Democrats on the bill called Manchin “duplicitous” for leaving “the important needs of the country unfulfilled.” He countered Manchin’s claims saying “The Build Back Better act would reduce Americans’ energy costs not increase [them]. It would enhance American economic competitiveness not decrease it. It would increase the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid not the opposite.”

Ricketts suspected Manchin had it backward because he said the senator was more informed “by corporate donors or by ignorance.” Manchin’s son is a leader in the coal industry and Manchin himself has made $4.5 million from his investments in coal over the course of his Senate career. Over the past year Manchin has reaped more campaign donations from the oil gas and coal industries than any other senator.

Climate activists are also dismayed because Congress has promised action for years but failed to deliver. And they point to a larger pattern of how obstructionists — both in the Republican and Democratic parties — have sunk the US’s best chances of action again and again. Longtime climate activist and writer Bill McKibben noted that Manchin’s obstruction fits the long legacy of a Congress that can’t pass climate legislation to meet the scale of the crisis.

Joe Manchin preserves Congress's perfect record: no real climate legislation in the 33 years they've been debating the issue. — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) December 19 2021

There are still plenty of unanswered questions after Manchin’s announcement.

Will Congress be able to salvage a smaller deal that still delivers on climate cuts? In a statement Sunday Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) advocated for that path. “Major climate and clean energy provisions of the Build Back Better Act have largely been negotiated scored for ten years and financed” he said. “Let’s pass these provisions now. We cannot let this moment pass.”

Another question: Could Democrats find another legislative vehicle that will finally win Manchin’s support? Progressive lawmakers have already pointed fingers at the White House and Democratic leadership for their political failure but some have hinted there may still be a path forward.

We are facing unprecedented challenges and #BuildBackBetter is about tackling them head on: addressing the climate crisis fighting inflation and giving hard working Americans a shot at prosperity. To walk away from those challenges is the height of irresponsibility and betrayal. — Rep. Veronica Escobar (@RepEscobar) December 19 2021

Grieving climate activists also echoed that this isn’t a moment to give up. “This is the last best shot we’re really going to have to enact national policy that deals with the climate crisis in the scope and scale that’s necessary” said Ricketts. “We still have a Democratic president in the White House who has claimed that climate is a top priority for his administration. Now let’s see them deliver.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvdXMtaGFpdGktaW50ZXJ2ZW50aW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As U.S. Navigates Crisis in Haiti a Bloody History Looms Large (Published 2021),"In September 1994 the United States was on the verge of invading Haiti.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide the country’s first democratically elected president had been deposed in a military coup three years earlier. Haiti had descended into chaos. Gangs and paramilitaries terrorized the population — taking hostages assassinating dissidents and burning crops. International embargoes had strangled the economy and tens of thousands of people were trying to emigrate to America.

But just days before the first U.S. troops would land in Haiti Joseph R. Biden Jr. then a senator on the Foreign Affairs Committee spoke against a military intervention. He argued that the United States had more pressing crises — including ethnic cleansing in Bosnia — and that Haiti was not especially important to American interests.

“I think it’s probably not wise” Mr. Biden said of the planned invasion in an interview with television host Charlie Rose.

He added: “If Haiti — a God-awful thing to say — if Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean or rose up 300 feet it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTgvbnVjbGVhci13YXN0ZS13aHktdGhlcmVzLW5vLXBlcm1hbmVudC1udWNsZWFyLXdhc3RlLWR1bXAtaW4tdXMuaHRtbNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzEyLzE4L251Y2xlYXItd2FzdGUtd2h5LXRoZXJlcy1uby1wZXJtYW5lbnQtbnVjbGVhci13YXN0ZS1kdW1wLWluLXVzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The feds have collected more than $44 billion for a permanent nuclear waste dump — here's why we still don't have one,"This undated image obtained 22 February 2004 shows the entrance to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository located in Nye County Nevada about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. AFP | AFP | Getty Images

The federal government has a fund of $44.3 billion earmarked for spending on a permanent nuclear waste disposal facility in the United States. It began collecting money from energy customers for the fund in the 1980s and the money is now earning about $1.4 billion in interest each year. But plans to build a site in Yucca Mountain Nevada were scuttled by state and federal politics and there's been a lack of political will to find other solutions. The result is that the U.S. does not have the infrastructure to dispose of radioactive nuclear waste in a deep geologic repository where it can slowly lose its radioactivity over the course of thousands of years without causing harm. However with the effects of climate change becoming more obvious investors and some political activists are renewing interest in nuclear as a source of energy that does not emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. That is forcing proponents to confront the thorny problem of waste again.

How Nevada became the nexus of the waste story

Congress established the Nuclear Waste Fund in 1982 requiring anyone who was getting some of their electricity from nuclear energy to pay a small amount of money to deal with the waste. From 1982 through 1987 the Department of Energy explored nine sites for permanent waste disposal and eventually whittled that list down to three. Yucca Mountain in Nevada was the first choice with sites in Washington and Texas rounding out the top of the list. Some members of Congress were concerned that analyzing multiple sites would cost too much and so in 1987 Congress amended its 1982 law to focus all of its attention on Yucca Mountain. ""Some would say Congress made a prudent choice but other would say that Yucca was prematurely down-selected because the Nevada delegation had the least political clout on the Hill"" Rod McCullum the senior director of decommissioning and used fuel at the Nuclear Energy Institute told CNBC. ""Over time the latter view tended to prevail and the 1987 Amendment is now commonly referred to as the 'screw Nevada' bill"" McCullum said. The 1987 amendment also established a program to find a interim storage solution Steve Nesbit the President of the American Nuclear Society told CNBC. Some of the Nuclear Waste Fund money was spent on that effort but that project shut down in 1994 because it wasn't working Nesbit said. In 2002 then-President George W. Bush signed a resolution establishing the Yucca Mountain repository but Barack Obama campaigned against it and ended up cutting funding for Yucca Mountain in his 2010 budget. The political opposition in Nevada ""probably wouldn't have made a difference if Senator Reid had not become such a powerful political figure but he did and he used his influence to stop the project"" Nesbit told CNBC. ""Unfortunately Yucca Mountain like so many things has become a partisan issue which makes it that much harder to get anything done."" After 2014 the federal government was forced to stop collecting money for the Nuclear Waste Fund because of a legal ruling. Owners and operators of nuclear power plants had challenged Department of Energy's collection of fees arguing that ratepayers should not be paying into a fund when the United States had no viable options for where the used fuel permanent disposal should go. Amid all the stops and starts the money in the Nuclear Waste Fund has been put back into the general fund and is being used for other purposes Frank Rusco of the Government Accountability Office says. To use the funds for their original purpose would require new authorization and appropriation by Congress he said. ""This will potentially cause a difficulty in getting a repository built"" Rusco said.

Reasons for optimism

Since the federal government has not established a permanent repository for its radioactive nuclear waste it's had to pay utility companies to store it themselves. Currently nuclear waste is mostly stored in dry casks on the locations of current and former nuclear power plants around the country. So far the system is working and in 2014 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) the lead oversight body for the industry has said that current storage technology would be sufficient for 100 years. ""We've loaded over 3000 of these systems since 1986. And we haven't had we haven't had a problem. And nothing's gone wrong. No radiation has been released"" McCullum told CNBC. ""It should be noted that just because NRC assumed the storage systems would be replaced at 100 years doesn't mean they necessarily would be"" McCullum said. If a utility applies for a license from the NRC to go beyond 100 years the NRC would have to revisit its analysis. ""Fortunately we have until 2086 to figure that out. I certainly hope that disposal will be available by then."" As of Sept. 30 the government has paid $9 billion to utility companies for their interim storage costs and the Department of Energy's Agency Finance Report estimates it will cost another $30.9 billion until a permanent waste disposal option is completed in the United States. That estimate could prove to be low Rusco said. However the tide may be turning back toward finding longer-term solutions. On Nov. 30 the Office of Nuclear Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy put out a formal ""request for information"" for a temporary but consolidated nuclear waste storage in the U.S. Unlike a permanent storage facility which involves digging deep into the ground a temporary facility would simply keep all the dry casks together in one place as opposed to distributed around the country. In some cases the local nuclear plants have been completely disassembled — but the waste is still stored on site. Consolidating it would at least save on costs. ""Then it just takes one security force and one maintenance crew and one operations crew and on it it would just be much more efficient"" Nesbit told CNBC. ""What they're doing is they're trying to start small and eat the elephant one bite at a time instead of all at once."" McCullum of the NEI says the slow pace of progress on a permanent storage solution is not a problem. ""You're designing something that's going to be protected for millions of years. It's okay if we take decades to figure it out"" he said. Meanwhile the surge in concern about climate change has created new momentum for advanced nuclear reactors which promise to be safer and more efficient than conventional designs. That means there's also renewed interest in figuring out the waste problem. ""The timelines for these things are quite long compared to what we're used to an instant gratification world. But in general I'm optimistic"" says Rob Howard the national technical director for Integrated Waste Management based out of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. He spent two decades of his career working on the technical side of Yucca Mountain which had been the most widely touted potential site for permanent disposal. Further some of the extreme antipathy toward nuclear power seems to be dissipating Nesbit said. ""That visceral concern associated with all things nuclear is something that primarily arises from folks who grew up in the Cold War era and the time frame of the 1970s where the anti-nuclear movement was really feeling its oats"" Nesbit said. Younger people are ""a lot more open to new and innovative ideas.""

More stalling against Yucca Mountain?

Other experts believe DOE's request for information on an interim solution is nothing more than showboating bureaucracy to forestall the inevitable creation of a permanent geologic waste repository in Yucca Mountain. ""It is all politics sadly. This can be done. If it wasn't for Nevada's 6 electoral votes and Harry Reid we would be building the repository now"" said Andrew Kadak a former professor in the department of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consultant for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners a non-profit organization representing the state public service commissions who regulate the utilities brought the stalled investigation of Yucca Mountain to court arguing that DOE and NRC needed to complete the formal assessment they had started political machinations not withstanding. In Aug. 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision directing the NRC to resume the licensing process for Yucca Mountain. In May 2016 the NRC issued a final supplemental report on Yucca Mountain finding that that risks associated with proposed fears of groundwater contamination one of Reid's points of contention would be ""small."" The recent move by the DOE to solicit feedback for finding a new location is a delaying tactic said Kadak. ""Even if the consent-based-siting processes started I don't see any state volunteering"" Kadak said. Yucca Mountain is the logical and best solution Kadak said. ""If I was the president I would suggest restarting Yucca Mountain because it's an acceptable site it's had the technical reviews by the NRC it's ready for licensing hearing"" Kadak said. For now however Department of Energy is standing firm that Yucca Mountain is a no-go. ""The Administration has made clear that Yucca Mountain is not a workable solution. Congress has not provided any funding for Yucca Mountain in over 10 years"" a spokesperson for the Office of Nuclear Energy told CNBC. Nesbit doesn't expect that to change: ""No telling what a Yucca Mountain vote would be today but it's a moot point — the political leadership would never allow such a vote."""

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change.

This contract the largest for land mail service that had yet been given was authorized by an act of Congress in March 1857.The Pinery Station site commemorates his achievement in transporting the first regular overland mail to California from Missouri in the record-breaking time of 23 days 23.5 hours.

Born at Berne New York in 1801 Butterfield grew up on a farm amidst the revolutionary changes of the first steamboat the Erie Canal the steam locomotive and the electric telegraph. His ambition was to become a professional stage driver which he did at the age of 19. He diligently saved his earnings and soon owned and operated a livery business. Butterfield convinced Henry Wells and William Fargo to consolidate their express company with the Butterfield Express Company and form the American Express Company which Butterfield then directed. He was a natural organizer with an incredible memory and a generous spirit to share his success. He filled his life with challenging business ventures that were not only profitable but that also gained him respect and benefited the public.

Although his appearance was stern he generated a current of enthusiasm all around him demanding the highest quality of service from his employees in a just and fair manner. He was reserved except for his fashionable dress which particularly on western journeys set a trend across the country. Butterfield coats shirts boots and hats became the rage.

In 1857 most prominent men of his day retired from business at about the age of 56 and Butterfield could have enjoyed the same with his great wealth reputation and unimpaired health. He must have realized that a stage mail route was doomed since the locomotive had already appeared and taken over much of the mail and passenger service in the East. However he was anxious to see a letter move from east to west by means other than a steamship sailing around South America. Perhaps it was his inborn love of horses the feel of the reins and the lure of the open road that motivated him to begin the most outstanding achievement of his career – the Butterfield Overland Mail Route.

Butterfield had never been farther west than Buffalo New York so he hired St. John a young man who had made three trips west and experienced the limitless plains deserts barren mountains and the cry of raiding Indians. He instructed St. John and his crew to prepare stations and water storage tanks every 30 miles because “speed is what we want.” He sent a steady stream of coaches west over this southern route each carrying 12000 letters as well as passengers.

The stress and strain of the venture the rerouting of the first route and the cancellation of the Butterfield Overland mail contract due to the Civil War caused John Butterfield’s physical breakdown at age 59. He then retired to his home in Utica New York where he later suffered a paralyzing stroke. He had established an amazing mail route the longest in the world which provided a regular line of communication for Americans separated by almost 2000 miles of undeveloped wilderness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2RlYWxzL2FtZXgtYXV0aG9yaXplZC11c2VyLWJvbnVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great Deal: Amex 20K Points Authorized User Bonus,"In the interest of full disclosure OMAAT earns a referral bonus for anyone that’s approved through some of the below links.

Not only do credit card issuers often have lucrative welcome bonuses when applying for cards but sometimes there are also lucrative bonuses for adding authorized users especially on Amex cards. I’ve just been targeted for such an offer and taking advantage of it seems like a no-brainer.

Amex Business Platinum 20K authorized user bonus

This morning I was paying some Amex bills online and noticed a special offer on The Business Platinum Card® from American Express (review). The following message was listed at the top of the account summary page:

Earn 100000 Membership Rewards points. Add up to 5 new Employee Cards and earn 20000 points after each new Employee Card Member spends $4000 in eligible purchases on the new Card in their first 6 months of Card Membership up to 100000 points. Terms apply.

Presumably this offer is targeted though here’s the link the page goes to so you can check for yourself if your account might be eligible. The terms state that authorized user cards have to be approved by December 31 2021 in order to earn the bonus.

Keep in mind there are several options for adding authorized users on the Amex Business Platinum:

Adding authorized users with full Amex Business Platinum perks costs $300 each (Rates & Fees)

However you can also add Amex Business Gold authorized users for $45 each (Rates & Fees) or you can add Amex Business Green authorized users for no additional annual fee (Rates & Fees).

Any type of authorized user seems to qualify for this offer so you could add a no annual fee Amex Business Green card

This is a pretty awesome deal!

If eligible taking advantage of this seems like a no-brainer:

Spending $4000 would earn you a minimum of 24000 Amex points (20000 bonus points plus one point per dollar spent); I value Amex points at 1.7 cents each so to me that’s like an ~11% return on spending

Since authorized users are being added to a business card this shouldn’t in any way impact their 5/24 status if that’s something that matters

Note that while you don’t need the date of birth or social security numbers of authorized users at the time you request a card you do need to provide it within 60 days of having added them

Even beyond credit card bonus categories having improved so much in recent years it’s amazing how many additional bonuses there are on spending as I feel like I’m constantly spending towards them from the Hilton Amex free night award promo to the Marriott Amex PayPal promo.

Bottom line

It’s always worth checking your credit card accounts to see what targeted offers you’re eligible for especially with Amex. I’m seeing an offer on my Amex Business Platinum for 20000 bonus Amex points when adding an authorized user and having them spend $4000 within six months. This is an excellent bonus and one I look forward to using assuming I’m not missing anything.

Were you targeted for this offer or any other Amex authorized user offer? Would you take advantage of this offer?

Hawaii is the destination many Americans envision when they think of vacation. It's a beautiful segment of Polynesia that those of us in the continental U.S. have the privilege of visiting without even needing a passport. Yes it's touristy — that's because it's spectacular.

Depending on when you travel airfare to Hawaii can be prohibitively expensive. But if you know the best ways to get to Hawaii using points and miles you'll be impervious to price gouging.

Let's look at one exceptional sweet spot between the West Coast and Hawaii using Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles. They're extremely easy to earn as they partner with the following transferable points programs:

By using this tactic you can stretch the rewards you earn from the best travel credit cards into multiple trips to the tiny archipelago for the price of a single trip booked through competing loyalty programs.

Why it's special

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

Singapore Airlines doesn't sound like it would be as relevant to the free-travel strategy of U.S. travelers as the likes of American Airlines or United.

However you can book many of the same exact award seats with Singapore Airlines miles as you can with AA or United miles. The award price can even be significantly cheaper.

For example a flight from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD) to Honolulu (HNL) on United Airlines usually costs 45000 miles round-trip in coach (though it may occasionally be cheaper). But the same exact United Airlines seat booked through Singapore Airlines will only cost 35000 miles (PDF link).

There's an even sweeter deal buried in the Singapore Airlines loyalty program for travel to Hawaii — but you must fly Alaska Airlines to get this special price.

Here (PDF link) is Singapore Airlines' award chart for Alaska Airlines flights. As you can see flights from Zone 1 (California Oregon Washington) to Zone 5 (Alaska Hawaii) cost only 12000 miles one-way in coach. That is fantastic especially considering these flights can cost hundreds of dollars.

It's worth noting that these aren't the absolute lowest prices to Hawaii. You can book flights on United Airlines via Turkish Airlines for as little as 7500 Turkish miles each way in coach. But award space isn't nearly as accessible — and Turkish Airlines miles aren't as easy to earn as Singapore Airlines miles.

DAY 4 FINALS LIVE RECAP

High school senior Claire Curzan blasted a new American and World Junior Record while claiming the bronze in tonight’s 50 fly final in Abu Dhabi. The swim marks Curzan’s first senior level international individual medal and her first American Record after years of assaulting the USA Swimming National Age Group Records. The TAC Titans swimmer and Stanford commit breaks Japan’s Rikako Ikee‘s 2017 WJR and Madeline Banic’s American Record from last year’s ISL season.

Curzan: 2021 SC Worlds Banic: 2020 ISL Ikee: 2017 Toyko World Cup 24.55 24.80 25.14

Curzan’s swim this evening obliterated both the former records chopping nearly 6 tenths off of Ikee’s record and a quarter of a second off of Banic’s best. She also slips past France’s Melanie Henique to become the fourth fastest performer in history.

Interestingly the second and third fastest 50 butterfliers of all time also competed in tonight’s final with Ranomi Kromowidjojo taking the gold and Sarah Sjostrom taking the silver. Kromowidjojo blasted a new lifetime best tonight of 24.44 just off of Therese Alshammar‘s World Record of 24.38 while Sjostrom was just off of her lifetime best of 24.50 from last month’s European Championships.

All-time fastest performers in women’s 50 fly:

Together the two ports account for nearly 40 percent of the containers entering the United States. With the holiday season approaching extended port operations are intended to address disruptions in the global supply chain and help alleviate a growing backlog of shipping containers that has stretched the coast as far as San Diego. The logjam of goods at U.S. ports has not only contributed to fears over rising inflation but has also brought renewed attention to the critical role of the maritime shipping industry in the global economy.

Given that 90 percent of the world’s goods travel across the ocean to reach their destination the importance of the maritime shipping industry cannot be understated. Historically command over global shipping lanes has been a central goal of economic and military statecraft. Since the Age of Discovery maintaining reliable access to the world’s waterways has been understood as a key source of national power.

In 1616 English statesman Sir Walter Raleigh proclaimed “Whosoever commands the sea commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world and consequently the world itself.” Centuries later one of the most distinguished American naval strategists of the 19th century Alfred Thayer Mahan would echo this idea. In his 1890 magnum opus “The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660-1783” Mahan argued that national greatness is directly tied to control over the world’s oceans for commercial advantages in peacetime and strategic advantages in times of war. In particular Mahan stressed the importance of strategic locations such as chokepoints refueling stations canals and seaports.

In this light growing Chinese investment in the maritime shipping industry both domestically and abroad should be a major source of concern for geopolitical rivals such as the United States. In addition to its growing accumulation of shipping ports China is the leading manufacturer of shipping equipment producing 96 percent of the world’s shipping containers 80 percent of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes and receiving 48 percent of the world’s shipbuilding orders in 2020. China boasts the world’s second largest fleet of commercial shipping vessels and according to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence has now surpassed the United States as the world’s largest navy in terms of total battle force ships.

All of this serves as an indication of China’s increasingly assertive and expansionary posture. Focused inward for much of the 20th century China’s economic interests continue to expand farther and farther beyond its borders. The ascendancy of China in the commercial maritime space over the past decade has been nothing short of prolific. For Chinese officials however this development is not merely the result of fortuitous circumstances rather it is the consequence of careful and strategic planning.

A New Economic Strategy

In a 2013 speech at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan Chinese head of state and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping first announced plans for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This multi-trillion dollar investment strategy which spans three continents and nearly 60 countries is designed to strengthen regional connectivity and cooperation while positioning China as a focal point among regional trade routes. It has been promoted by members of the Chinese government including Xi as the “New Silk Road.” Some scholars have suggested that it follows a similar approach as the United States’ Marshall Plan which stimulated the economic reconstruction of Western Europe following World War II in addition to deepening economic ties and bringing Europe closer to the U.S. sphere of interest.

There are two main components of the BRI. The first component is a land-based economic belt meant to facilitate the flow of goods in and out of mainland China through the construction of highways railway networks gas pipelines oil refineries power plants mines and industrial parks throughout landlocked Central Asia. The second component is the maritime road which represents a string of ports and ocean corridors that direct trade to and from China via the waterways. In pursuit of the maritime road strategy China has demonstrated a growing interest in shipping port ownership. However this interest has not been limited to the Indo-Pacific region but extends globally.

China’s Global Investment in Shipping Ports

At present China is home to more shipping ports than any other country including seven of the 10 busiest ports in the world. In addition to its massive accumulation of domestic shipping infrastructure China also owns over 100 ports in approximately 63 countries. Over 80 percent of China’s overseas port terminals are owned by the “big three” terminal operators: China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) China Merchants Group (CMG) and CK Hutchison Holdings. The first two are state-owned enterprises while CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong with close ties to mainland China. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies combined state support for the shipping industry totaled $132 billion between 2010 and 2018.

In the Indo-Pacific major examples of Chinese port expansion include a 99-year lease at the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka a 40-year lease at the Gwadar port in Pakistan and a $350 million investment in the port of Djibouti. Djibouti is also the site of China’s first overseas military base located near a key strategic chokepoint between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.

In 2018 Chinese Harbor Engineering Company started construction on a port terminal at the Sokhna Port in Egypt near another major trade chokepoint the Suez Canal. Policy analysts have described these developments as being part of the “String of Pearls strategy.”

In Europe and the Mediterranean it is estimated that China now controls almost one-tenth of port capacity. Examples of this include France’s Le Havre and Dunkirk Belgium’s Antwerp and Bruges Spain’s Noatum port Italy’s Vado port Turkey’s Kumport port and Greece’s Piraeus port. A 25-year lease at Israel’s port of Haifa signed with China’s Shanghai International Port Group has raised concerns in the United States about potential espionage given that Haifa port is located less than 1 kilometer away from the docking port for U.S. warships.

In South America China is also expanding its influence via port ownership. In 2015 China Communications Construction Company loaned $120 million to Cuba to assist in the modernization of its second largest port Santiago de Cuba. In 2017 China’s CMG purchased 90 percent of shares for Brazil’s largest port TCP Participaccoes SA. In 2019 COSCO signed a $225 million deal with Volcan at Peru’s Port of Chancay for a 60 percent stake in the terminal. In El Salvador it is alleged that the government will privatize the La Unión Port in 2022 presumably to be set aside for Chinese management. There are additional reports of Chinese involvement in port projects in the Bahamas Trinidad and Tobago Panama Argentina Chile and Uruguay.

Implications for the United States

Interestingly the United States has also been a site of Chinese port investment. Two Chinese enterprises have held equity ownership stakes in five U.S. ports. However neither firm owns an effective majority stake nor fully operates these American terminals. Two of these ports involve CMG purchasing minority stakes of a French firm’s terminals at Houston Terminal Link Texas and South Florida Container Terminal in Miami. The three remaining ports – in Seattle Los Angeles and Long Beach – were partially owned by COSCO. However the Trump administration required China to divest its ownership stake in the port of Long Beach in 2019.

Beyond its direct investment in American ports which remains inconsequential China’s increasing dominance of the maritime shipping industry is raising alarm bells in Washington as Sino-American relations continue to trend in a downward direction. At the recent virtual summit between Biden and Xi the deterioration between the United States and China was particularly evident given the failure of the two countries to produce a joint statement after the meeting. In previous decades such declarations were considered little more than formalities. Moreover despite campaigning on overturning President Trump’s trade war with China Biden has left intact many aspects of the Trump era trade policy with China.

With an increasingly turbulent relationship China’s growing dominance over the maritime shipping industry may be a source of vulnerability for the United States and other geopolitical rivals moving forward. Just as OPEC used oil as a form of leverage during the oil crisis of the 1970s Chinese control over the shipping industry has the potential to expose vulnerabilities in access to critical goods. The recent backlog of containers at U.S. ports serves as a stark reminder of the United States’ dependence on global supply chains. Fortunately as this year’s holiday season approaches it may only be the timely delivery of gifts at stake. Looking toward the future however the consequences may be more serious.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL2ludGVyYWN0aXZlLzIwMjEvMTIvMTgvdXMvYWlyc3RyaWtlcy1wZW50YWdvbi1yZWNvcmRzLWNpdmlsaWFuLWRlYXRocy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hidden Pentagon Records Reveal Patterns of Failure in Deadly Airstrikes (Published 2021),"THE CIVILIAN CASUALTY FILES Hidden Pentagon Records Reveal Patterns of Failure in Deadly Airstrikes BY AZMAT KHAN

The promise was a war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs. The documents show flawed intelligence faulty targeting years of civilian deaths — and scant accountability.

This is the first part of a series. Part 2 examines the air war’s human toll.

اقرأ باللغة العربية

Shortly before 3 a.m. on July 19 2016 American Special Operations forces bombed what they believed were three ISIS “staging areas” on the outskirts of Tokhar a riverside hamlet in northern Syria. They reported 85 fighters killed. In fact they hit houses far from the front line where farmers their families and other local people sought nighttime sanctuary from bombing and gunfire. More than 120 villagers were killed.

In early 2017 in Iraq an American war plane struck a dark-colored vehicle believed to be a car bomb stopped at an intersection in the Wadi Hajar neighborhood of West Mosul. Actually the car had been bearing not a bomb but a man named Majid Mahmoud Ahmed his wife and their two children who were fleeing the fighting nearby. They and three other civilians were killed.

In November 2015 after observing a man dragging an “unknown heavy object” into an ISIS “defensive fighting position” American forces struck a building in Ramadi Iraq. A military review found that the object was actually “a person of small stature” — a child — who died in the strike.

None of these deadly failures resulted in a finding of wrongdoing.

These cases are drawn from a hidden Pentagon archive of the American air war in the Middle East since 2014.

The trove of documents — the military’s own confidential assessments of more than 1300 reports of civilian casualties obtained by The New York Times — lays bare how the air war has been marked by deeply flawed intelligence rushed and often imprecise targeting and the deaths of thousands of civilians many of them children a sharp contrast to the American government’s image of war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs.

The documents show too that despite the Pentagon’s highly codified system for examining civilian casualties pledges of transparency and accountability have given way to opacity and impunity. In only a handful of cases were the assessments made public. Not a single record provided includes a finding of wrongdoing or disciplinary action. Fewer than a dozen condolence payments were made even though many survivors were left with disabilities requiring expensive medical care. Documented efforts to identify root causes or lessons learned are rare.

The air campaign represents a fundamental transformation of warfare that took shape in the final years of the Obama administration amid the deepening unpopularity of the forever wars that had claimed more than 6000 American service members. The United States traded many of its boots on the ground for an arsenal of aircraft directed by controllers sitting at computers often thousands of miles away. President Barack Obama called it “the most precise air campaign in history.”

This was the promise: America’s “extraordinary technology” would allow the military to kill the right people while taking the greatest possible care not to harm the wrong ones.

The ISIS caliphate ultimately crumbled under the weight of American bombing. For years American air power was crucial to the beleaguered Afghan government’s survival. And as U.S. combat deaths dwindled the faraway wars and their civilian tolls receded from most Americans’ sights and minds.

On occasion stunning revelations have pierced the silence. A Times investigation found that a Kabul drone strike in August which American officials said had destroyed a vehicle laden with bombs had instead killed 10 members of one Afghan family. The Times recently reported that dozens of civilians had been killed in a 2019 bombing in Syria that the military had hidden from public view. That strike was ordered by a top-secret strike cell called Talon Anvil that according to people who worked with it frequently sidestepped procedures meant to protect civilians. Talon Anvil executed a significant portion of the air war against ISIS in Syria.

The Pentagon regularly publishes bare-bones summaries of civilian casualty incidents and it recently ordered a new high-level investigation of the 2019 Syria airstrike. But in the rare cases where failings are publicly acknowledged they tend to be characterized as unfortunate unavoidable and uncommon.

In response to questions from The Times Capt. Bill Urban the spokesman for the U.S. Central Command said that “even with the best technology in the world mistakes do happen whether based on incomplete information or misinterpretation of the information available. And we try to learn from those mistakes.” He added: “We work diligently to avoid such harm. We investigate each credible instance. And we regret each loss of innocent life.”

He described minimizing the risk of harm to civilians as “a strategic necessity as well as a legal and moral imperative” driven by the way these casualties are used “to feed the ideological hatred espoused by our enemies in the post 9/11 conflicts and supercharge the recruiting of the next generation of violent extremists.”

Yet what the hidden documents show is that civilians have become the regular collateral casualties of a way of war gone badly wrong.

To understand how this happened The Times did what military officials admit they have not done: analyzed the casualty assessments in aggregate to discern patterns of failed intelligence decision-making and execution. It also visited more than 100 casualty sites and interviewed scores of surviving residents and current and former American officials. In the coming days the second part of this series will trace those journeys through the war zones of Iraq and Syria.

Taken together the reporting offers the most sweeping and also the most granular portrait of how the air war was prosecuted and investigated — and of its civilian toll.

There is no way to determine that full toll but one thing is certain: It is far higher than the Pentagon has acknowledged. According to the military’s count 1417 civilians have died in airstrikes in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria; since 2018 in Afghanistan U.S. air operations have killed at least 188 civilians. But The Times’s analysis of the documents found that many allegations of civilian casualties had been summarily discounted with scant evaluation. And the on-the-ground reporting — involving a sampling of cases dismissed cases deemed “credible” and in Afghanistan cases not included in the trove of Pentagon documents — found hundreds of deaths uncounted.

The war of precision did not promise that civilians would not die. But before a strike is approved the military must undertake elaborate protocols to estimate and avoid civilian harm; any expected civilian casualties must be proportional to the military advantage gained. And America’s precision bombs are indeed precise: They hit their targets with near-unerring accuracy.

The documents along with The Times’s ground reporting illustrate the many often disastrous ways the military’s predictions of the peril to civilians turn out to be wrong. Their lessons rarely learned these breakdowns of intelligence and surveillance occur again and again.

Repeatedly the documents point to the psychological phenomenon of “confirmation bias” — the tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms a pre-existing belief. People streaming toward a fresh bombing site were assumed to be ISIS fighters not civilian rescuers.

Men on motorcycles moving “in formation” displaying the “signature” of an imminent attack were just men on motorcycles.

Often the danger to civilians is lost in the cultural gulf separating American soldiers and the local populace. “No civilian presence” was detected when in fact families were sleeping through the days of the Ramadan fast sheltering inside against the midsummer swelter or gathering in a single house for protection when the fighting intensified.

In many cases civilians were visible in surveillance footage but their presence was either not observed by analysts or was not noted in the communications before a strike. In chat logs accompanying some assessments soldiers can sound as if they are playing video games in one case expressing glee over getting to fire in an area ostensibly “poppin” with ISIS fighters — without spotting the children in their midst.

The military spokesman Captain Urban pointed out that “In many combat situations where targeteers face credible threat streams and do not have the luxury of time the fog of war can lead to decisions that tragically result in civilian harm.”

Indeed the Pentagon records detail how in Mosul in 2016 three civilians were killed when a bomb aimed at one car instead struck three — in part because the military official approving the strike had decided to save more-precise weapons for other imminent strikes. Yet The Times’s analysis of the documents and ground reporting showed that civilians were frequently killed in airstrikes planned well in advance.

Military officials often speak of their “over the horizon” long-range surveillance capabilities. But the documents repeatedly identify deficiencies in the quality and quantity of the video footage guiding intelligence.

Sometimes only seconds’ worth of footage was taken before a strike hardly enough to assess civilians’ presence. Often video shot from the air does not show people inside buildings people under foliage people under the aluminum or tarpaulin covers known as “quamaria” that shield cars and market stalls from the sun.

In more than half of the cases deemed credible by the military one or two civilians were killed entering the target area after a weapon was fired. Officials often describe these as awful but inescapable accidents. But while many might have been averted through additional precautions — widening the surveillance camera’s field of view or deploying additional drones — the phenomenon continued unabated amid the intense pace of battle and a shortage of surveillance aircraft.

Hassan Aleiwi Muhammad Sultan now 16 and in a wheelchair was hit by an April 29 2016 strike in East Mosul Iraq aimed at an ISIS recruiter. Ivor Prickett for The New York Times

And sometimes for reasons redacted in the documents the weapons simply miss. In April 2016 the military reported that it had killed a notorious Australian ISIS recruiter Neil Prakash in a strike on a house in East Mosul. Months later very much alive he was arrested crossing from Syria into Turkey. Four civilians died in the strike according to the Pentagon.

Yet despite this unrelenting toll the military’s system for examining civilian casualties rarely functions as a tool to teach or assess blame.

Not only do the records contain no findings of wrongdoing or disciplinary action but in only one instance is there a “possible violation” of the rules of engagement. That stemmed from a breach in the procedure for identifying a target. Full investigations were recommended in fewer than 12 percent of the credible cases.

In many cases the command that approved a strike was responsible for examining it too. And those examinations were often based on incorrect or incomplete evidence. Military officials interviewed survivors or witnesses in only two cases. Civilian-casualty reports were regularly dismissed because video showed no bodies in the rubble yet the footage was often too brief to make a true determination.

In his response to The Times Captain Urban said “An honest mistake on a strike taken with the best available information and in keeping with mission requirements that results in civilian casualties is not in and of itself a cause for disciplinary actions as set forth in the law of armed conflict.”

American officials had an opportunity to mine the documents for root causes and patterns of error in 2018 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Defense University undertook a study of civilian deaths. But one of the researchers who sought to analyze the documents in aggregate told The Times that almost all of his findings had been cut from the report. Another high-level study of the air campaign has never been made public.

In the end what emerges from the more than 5400 pages of records is an institutional acceptance of an inevitable collateral toll. In the logic of the military a strike however deadly to civilians is acceptable as long as it has been properly decided and approved — the proportionality of military gain to civilian danger weighed — in accordance with the chain of command.

Lawrence Lewis the former Pentagon and State Department adviser whose analysis for the 2018 study was quashed said in an interview that the military’s technological prowess and the highly bureaucratized system for assessing how it is employed may actually serve an unspoken purpose: to create greater legal and moral space for greater risk.

“Now we can take strikes in city streets because we have Hellfire missiles and we have fancy things with blades” he said. “We develop all these capabilities but we don’t use them to buy down risk for civilians. We just use them so we can make attacks that maybe we couldn’t do before.”

The Promise of Precision

The new way of war came to fruition in the wake of the 2009 surge of American troops into Afghanistan which brought some stability but never turned the war around.

By the end of 2014 with NATO’s mission also ending President Obama declared America’s ground war essentially done. Henceforth the United States would primarily provide air support and advice for Afghan forces battling the Taliban.

At roughly the same time as Islamic State fighters swept through Mosul and massacred thousands of Yazidi Kurds at Mount Sinjar Mr. Obama authorized a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS targets and in support of allied forces in Iraq and Syria.

The weaponry was hardly untested. This high-tech arsenal increasingly sophisticated had been critical to success in the 1991 Persian Gulf war in NATO’s 1999 campaign in the Balkans and more recently in Yemen and Somalia. By the time of the wars in the Middle East the MQ-9 Reaper drone outfitted with laser-guided Hellfire missiles had become the surveillance and attack vehicle of choice.

At an ever-quickening pace over the next five years and as the administration of Mr. Obama gave way to that of Donald J. Trump American forces would execute more than 50000 airstrikes in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan in accordance with a rigorous approval process that prized being “discriminate” “proportional” and in compliance with the law of armed conflict. Not only would this be the most precise air campaign ever; it would be the most transparent.

The only official accounting of that promise is the hidden Pentagon documents.

They were obtained through Freedom of Information requests beginning in March 2017 and lawsuits filed against the Defense Department and U.S. Central Command. To date The Times has received 1311 out of at least 2866 reports — known as credibility assessments — examining airstrikes in Iraq and Syria between September 2014 and January 2018. Requests for records from Afghanistan are the subject of a new lawsuit.

Each report is the fruit of a review process that begins when a potential civilian-casualty incident is identified by the military or more frequently alleged by an outside source — a nongovernmental organization a news outlet or social media.

Assessment experts classify allegations into two categories. A case is “credible” if it is deemed “more likely than not” that the airstrike caused civilian casualties. In the reports examined by The Times 216 cases were deemed credible. “Noncredible” cases fail to meet that standard — often because there is no record of a strike at the place and time in question or because the available evidence is considered insufficiently specific or simply weak.

Until now fewer than 20 of these assessments dating to late 2014 have been made public.

To assess the military’s assessments between late 2016 and this past June The Times visited the sites of 60 incidents deemed credible in Iraq and Syria as well as three dozen others deemed noncredible or not yet assessed. (It also visited dozens of strike sites in Afghanistan.) In 35 credible cases it was possible to locate the precise impact area and find survivors and witnesses on the ground. Then the reporting included touring wreckage; collecting photo and video evidence; and verifying casualties through death certificates government IDs and hospital records.

Frequently the reporting closely matched basic information from the documents. But the detailed accounts that ultimately emerged from the rubbled ground were often in stark contrast to what had been assessed from the air.

‘Play Time?’

In Erbil and in Doha Qatar a ground controller and aircrew members typed out messages helping fulfill the array of combat directives and rules of the strike process:

The war against ISIS heralded the dawn of “strike cells” — remote operations centers from which most airstrikes were directed and controlled. These war rooms synergized the myriad players — pilots sensor operators intelligence experts ground forces weaponeering specialists civilian-casualty-mitigation analysts lawyers even weather officers. Strike cells boasted at times that with their video feeds and surveillance aircraft they could understand what was happening on the battlefield as well as if they were there themselves.

As the war intensified and ground commanders won greater authority to call in strikes the cells expanded with a small number of Americans embedded with allies on the battlefield. The cells were seen as so successful that they made their way to Afghanistan too. And as the Trump administration sought to pressure the Taliban into a deal decision-making authority for airstrikes was often pushed further down the chain of command.

The cells conducted “dynamic strikes” — identified and executed within minutes or hours in the flow of war accounting for an overwhelming majority of the air campaign. “Deliberate” strikes which were preplanned — extensively vetted often filmed over weeks or months and analyzed by several working groups — decreased over time.

In both scenarios the targeting process essentially boiled down to two questions: Could the presumed enemy target be positively identified? And would any harm to civilians be proportional in line with the law of armed conflict — or would it exceed the “expected military advantage gained”?

For positive identification the officer designated with strike approval needed “reasonable certainty” that the target performed a function for the adversary. That could be relatively straightforward as when the target was a fighter firing directly on friendly forces. But a more ambiguous target like a suspected ISIS headquarters might require further surveillance.

To determine proportionality analysts evaluated whether the target was used exclusively by the enemy or might also be used by civilians then assessed civilians’ “pattern of life.” Ultimately they would calculate how many civilians were likely to be killed or wounded.

For deliberate strikes this generally entailed an exhaustive “collateral damage estimate” a computer calculation of the expected civilian casualty count based on a mix of factors: the pattern of life the population density the specific weapon being used the kind of structure being targeted — a concrete building an aluminum shed a mud hut. The officer approving the strike would weigh that estimate with other factors such as the potential for secondary blasts from explosive materials nearby.

For dynamic strikes the process could be vastly compressed. Especially if there was a threat to friendly forces or some other urgency strike cells were more likely to rely on an impromptu assessment of a video feed.

Either way based on that calculation the military was required to take “feasible precautions” to mitigate civilian harm. The greater the likelihood of someone being in the wrong place at the wrong time the more precautions taken — say by deploying more-precise weaponry to limit the blast radius or by attacking when the fewest civilians were predicted to be present.

The military does not provide a precise definition of what is proportional. Essentially the expected civilian toll was proportional if the officer making that determination reasonably believed it to be so and if it did not exceed a “noncombatant cutoff value.” Otherwise officials say the target would be discarded.

The final official step was a legal review. But efforts to protect civilians could continue until moments before a weapon was fired. From the cockpit pilots could select how a weapon detonated — upon impact or with a delayed fuse. Or they could call an “abort” if for example a civilian was spotted walking into the target area.

Under the right circumstances this process could result in a strike so precise that it would destroy the section of a house filled with enemy fighters and leave the rest of the building intact.

Children playing where the school sheltering Qusay Saad’s family stood before Jan. 13 2017 when a strike hit it. Ali Al-Baroodi for The New York Times

As Iraqi forces approached Qusay Saad’s home in East Mosul ISIS forced his family to move to an area still under its control. They found refuge in his brother’s abandoned house in al-Faisaliya.

Through a night of gunfire and explosions Mr. Saad and his wife Zuhour comforted their three children and prayed that Iraqi forces would reach them. Then ISIS ordered them to move again into an abandoned school next door with two other families. That was the building observed in the chat on Jan. 13 2017.

The first airstrike hit as the Saad family sat down to breakfast. Mr. Saad recalls concrete blocks pressing down on his head and his wife screaming. A man from one of the other families lifted away the blocks and he quickly wrested his 14-month-old daughter Aisha from the rubble and handed her to his wife.

The second strike came just as he turned to free his 7-year-old son Muhammad.

“The strike was unbelievable” he said. “An entire three-story house was just crushed.”

Three members of another family escaped. Mr. Saad could not find his wife their 4-year-old son Abdulrahman or Aisha. But Muhammad was alive his thigh split open. Bleeding from the head Mr. Saad picked up the boy and fled.

It would be two months before he could recover the bodies. The Iraqi government offered no help. So the family paid to excavate the site. Mr. Saad watched as his wife and two youngest children were lifted out. Aisha’s head was missing but her little body was in her mother’s arms.

Mr. Saad’s son Abdulrahman was killed along with his wife and young daughter. Azmat Khan

They were buried not far from their home which Mr. Saad has kept as it was when they all lived there. Sometimes his brother said he spends whole nights at the graveyard.

Last month The Times told him of the findings of the military’s assessment. It offers this account:

The target was a building assessed as harboring four ISIS fighters. A review of the imagery revealed that after the first strike which because of a “weapon malfunction” only partly collapsed the building four adults and four children could be seen moving in its center. The building was hit again and fully collapsed. Later three people emerged. The strike team did not report any civilians in the vicinity and because of the drone’s angle a view of the eight people in the building after the first strike “was obscured.”

The allegation was deemed credible with eight civilians killed but no further investigation was ordered. Eight “enemies” were also killed the document said.

When told of the Army’s findings Mr. Saad could not understand how a military with such a wealth of information could have failed to see them — or how the pursuit of fighters he never saw could justify leveling a building full of families. If the Americans would show him the video he said he would show them Mosul.

“They have to come here and see with their own eyes” he said adding “What happened wasn’t liberation. It was the destruction of humanity.”

How Deadly Failures Happen

Last May the Pentagon’s inspector general completed a classified report evaluating the policies for ensuring that “only valid military targets are struck” and that “damage to property and loss of civilian life is mitigated to the maximum extent possible.”

A redacted version echoing similar studies by other agencies in recent years declares the targeting process to be sound.

The Pentagon’s own assessments tell a far richer story.

The documents often do not articulate precise causes and in many cases several factors coalesced into a deadly failure. But The Times’s analysis of the 216 cases deemed credible together with its reporting on the ground reveals several distinct patterns of failure.

Misidentifying Civilians

Positive identification of the enemy is one of the pillars of the targeting process yet ordinary citizens were routinely mistaken for combatants.

In a dissenting footnote to the 2018 Joint Chiefs’ study Mr. Lewis and a colleague cited research showing that misidentification was one of the two leading causes of civilian casualties in American military operations. With few troops on the ground they wrote “it is reasonable to expect a systematic undercounting of misidentifications in U.S. military reports.”

Indeed according to the Pentagon records misidentification was involved in only 4 percent of cases. At the casualty sites visited by The Times misidentification was a major factor in 17 percent of incidents but accounted for nearly a third of civilian deaths and injuries.

At times the error involved quicksilver intelligence of an imminent threat. In The Times’s ground sample though misidentification occurred just as frequently in strikes planned far in advance — as in a January 2017 strike on an ISIS “foreign fighter headquarters” in East Mosul that killed 16 people in what turned out to be three civilian homes. Three ISIS buildings down the street were untouched.

Yet in case after case the misidentification appears to be less a matter of confusion than of confirmation bias.

That was what happened on Nov. 20 2016 after a Special Operations task force received a report of an ISIS explosives factory in a Syrian village north of Raqqa. In a walled compound operators spotted “white bags” assessed to be ammonium nitrate. Two trucks with a dozen men departed stopped at various ISIS checkpoints drove to a building “associated with previous ISIS activity” then returned to the compound. The first strike targeted one truck which caused “secondary explosions.” On the evidence of those blasts and the “white bags” operators received approval to strike three buildings. After impact two “squirters” fled the westernmost building. That building and another were struck again.

The findings of the military’s review begun after online reports that a strike in the same area had killed nine civilians and injured more than a dozen contradicted nearly all of the original intelligence.

NOV. 20 2016 — RAQQA SYRIA A military review showed that a target believed to be an ISIS explosives factory was actually a cotton gin. Nine civilians were killed. Further investigation was not recommended. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Examining scans of the compound analysts detected no ammonium nitrate. The presumed secondary explosions were actually reflections from a nearby building and one of the “squirters” was a child. Finally a six-month time lapse of imagery showed that the compound was “more likely a cotton gin than a factory” for explosives. Two civilians were killed the report said. (The task force continued to call the gin a legitimate target citing a news report that ISIS controlled three-quarters of Syria’s cotton production.)

Several months later in Iraq American forces received intelligence about a suspected car bomb — a dark-colored heavily armored vehicle moving through the Wadi Hajar neighborhood of West Mosul.

Scanning a surveillance feed an air-support coordinator quickly homed in on a possible match: a green vehicle whose windows appeared to be covered over. He did not see any signs of reinforced armor but positively identified both the green car and a closely trailing white vehicle as car bombs.

Both vehicles traveled away from the front line and stopped at an intersection where several people were gathered on a covered section of sidewalk. The driver of the first car got out and joined the group. The target authority approved the strike.

The targeted vehicle “sustained a direct hit” according to the military assessment. The group on the sidewalk “sustained weapons effects.”

But the review of the footage found no evidence that the vehicle was a car bomb. There was no telltale secondary explosion. Nor was the car heavily armored. And though the people on the sidewalk were visible in the footage they were never mentioned in the pre-strike chat.

FEB. 25 2017 — MOSUL IRAQ Based on a review of all available information the CIVCAS allegation is credible. Full motion video (FMV) shows that five individuals near the target vehicle were killed or injured by the strike and there is no information to indicate that those individuals had been or could be positively identified as combatants .

The full picture which the targeting team involved in the strike failed to see emerged when The Times visited Wadi Hajar earlier this year.

Ordered by ISIS to leave the neighborhood Majid Mahmoud Ahmed his wife and two children had piled into their blue — not green — Opel Astra station wagon. Following close behind in a white car were his brother Firas and his family. At an intersection where other fleeing residents had gathered Mr. Ahmed spotted his friend Muhammad Jamaal Muhammad waving and got out to say hello. As another neighbor approached the airstrike hit.

“I remember there was a big explosion and I fainted” recalled Abdul Hakeem Abdullah Hamash Al Aqidi an elderly man who had been standing by his door at the intersection. He lost an eye and had to have a plate implanted in his injured left leg. His son’s left leg had to be amputated.

In all seven local people — including the four members of the Ahmed family — were killed. Mr. Mohamed who had waved to Mr. Ahmed cannot banish from his mind the image of his friend’s wife Hiba Bashir burned into the seat still holding her infant son in her lap.

The military spokesman Captain Urban acknowledged that “confirmation bias is a real concern” citing the Kabul airstrike in August that killed the 10 members of a family. “There is more work to do on this” he said.

Failing to Detect Civilians

If the military often mistook civilians for enemy fighters frequently it simply failed to see or understand that they were there. That was a factor in a fifth of the cases in the Pentagon documents and a slightly smaller fraction of the casualties. However it accounted for 37 percent of credible cases and nearly three-fourths of the total civilian deaths and injuries at the sites visited by The Times.

Captain Urban said the targeting process had been vastly complicated by enemies who “plan resource and base themselves in and among local populace.”

“They do not present themselves in large formations” he added “do not fight coalition forces with conventional tactics and use geography and terrain in ways not conducive in every way to easy targeting solutions. Moreover they often and deliberately use civilians as human shields and they do not subscribe to anything remotely like the law of armed conflict to which we subscribe.”

Even so the documents show that frequently instead of extended surveillance analysts relied on brief “collateral scans” — as little as 11 seconds long — in determining that civilians were not in the area. The footage was often limited by shortages of surveillance drones particularly during the battles to retake Mosul and Raqqa.

In a number of cases targets that had been placed on “no-strike lists” because attacking them would violate laws of war — a school a bakery a civilian hospital — were removed after the military mistakenly judged that they were now used exclusively by the enemy.

In Mosul in February 2017 a hospital was taken off the list after the military concluded that civilians had left the area and that the building was being used only as an ISIS headquarters and propaganda center. The week before the strike according to the report analysts had examined still images of children “interacting” with the hospital but had determined that striking at night would “alleviate collateral concerns.” Four civilians were killed and six injured.

For the military’s analysts studying the “pattern of life” is a crucial step in predicting collateral damage. But to examine the documents and interview local people is to understand how often unseen civilians might have been seen or their presence at least suspected had the military had a more intimate knowledge of the war-torn fabric of everyday life.

In some documents as evidence of no civilian presence military officials state that people would leave their homes at the sound of approaching aircraft. The reality is starkly different: Neighbors would huddle together seeking communal sanctuary in a house or group of houses invisible to surveillance drones.

Many of the deadliest airstrikes happened this way. Among them was the strike at the Syrian hamlet of Tokhar.

In July 2016 a Special Operations task force identified a large group of ISIS fighters two kilometers from where U.S.-backed forces were fighting ISIS. They observed the fighters traveling in pickups known as “bongo trucks” to three “staging areas” where no civilians were present. The fighters they concluded were assembling for a counterattack. Shortly before 3 a.m. they bombed the three staging sites and five vehicles confident of killing 85 ISIS fighters.

July 19 2016 — TOKHAR SYRIA A military investigation concluded that as many as 24 civilians were “intermixed” with the combatants reported killed at three ISIS “staging areas.” The Times found that the targets were houses and that more than 120 civilians were killed. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Almost immediately reports of a vast civilian death toll surfaced online. The task force conducted a full investigation and determined that between seven and 24 civilians “intermixed with the fighters” might have been killed.

The Times visited Tokhar in December 2018. Surviving villagers gave this account:

That night as they had every night for a month some 200 villagers had trekked to the outer edge of the hamlet and taken shelter in four homes at the farthest remove from the quickening battle.

There was no evidence they said that ISIS had been near any of the four houses. In fact residents said drones had been flying overhead for weeks giving them solace that coalition forces knew they were there.

The Times documented the names of civilians killed in each of the four houses corroborating details with open-source information local journalists and others on the ground and determined that more than 120 people died. There were few young men left to pull bodies from the rubble. It took nearly two weeks and still some were never found. If the full death toll were acknowledged Tokhar would be the largest civilian casualty incident the United States has admitted to in the air war against ISIS.

Saif Saleh 8 years old at the time awoke that early morning to the collapsing walls his arm trapped under debris. His parents used up every favor to collect $6000 for surgery to graft skin from his leg.

Asked what he would like to tell the American military Saif’s father said “We want to say that you should be sure the area is empty or that there are no civilians before you bomb.”

The military investigation found that there was no evidence of negligence or wrongdoing; that the “policies procedures and practices” were “sufficient for continued operations”; and that “no further action” was necessary. No condolence payments were authorized.

Overlooking Flawed Intelligence

Often civilians were killed in strikes executed in the face of incomplete outdated or ambiguous intelligence. Several such factors came together in a strike that killed at least 10 civilians in Tabqa Syria in March 2017.

As American-backed forces prepared to recapture the city west of Raqqa military officials approved strikes on a group of ISIS targets: two headquarters a police station and a weapons factory. Each strike went as planned according to initial assessments. Then came reports of civilian casualties.

The military review found that the intelligence for both headquarters was based on single reports from months before. (The targets had been identified earlier but for strategic advantage commanders had decided to wait until Syrian Democratic Forces were pushing into Tabqa.) The intelligence package on the first building warned that there was “insufficient” evidence to corroborate the judgment relied on to remove the building from a restricted-targeting list that it was used solely by ISIS; the report said simply that an ISIS emir had frequented the site.

Similarly the review found that the intelligence did not support the view that the second headquarters was used exclusively by ISIS. What’s more even though both headquarters were in densely populated areas with residential structures nearby there was insufficient footage to assess the presence of civilians — one minute of video of the first target and less than two of the second.

The review also raised serious questions about the quality of intelligence for the two other targets.

Flawed Video

Sometimes the problem was less the quantity of video than the quality

Analysts at the military’s Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar saw this clearly when they reviewed 17 minutes of grainy footage that preceded a Nov. 13 2015 strike on an ISIS “defensive fighting position” in Ramadi. Using the center’s 62-inch high-definition TV they concluded that what had been identified as an “unknown heavy object” being dragged into a building was actually “a person of small stature” “consistent with how a child would appear standing next to an adult.”

Often the overhead surveillance camera missed people simply sitting or standing under something doing the most quotidian things.

June 15 2016: An ISIS fighter on a motorcycle turned onto a secondary road near Mosul University. It was Ramadan; the shops and stalls were teeming with people. Among the five civilians also killed and four wounded in the strike:

Walking Into Danger

More than half of the cases the military deemed credible involved someone entering the target frame in the moments between a weapon’s firing and impact as in a March 2017 strike in Mosul when shrapnel killed a man pushing a cart down a road near an ISIS mortar tube.

These deaths which account for 10 percent of acknowledged civilian casualties are often framed as unavoidable accidents. In the Mosul strike that killed the man with the cart operators had already twice aborted weapons releases because civilians had entered the frame — demonstrating concerted efforts to avert danger. Yet the systematic nature of the problem suggests the military could be doing more.

Indeed the review of a February 2017 strike on a “high value individual” at a funeral in Mosul that injured two civilians includes some recommendations. While noting that the civilians’ presence “could not be predicted to reasonable certainty” it adds that an additional surveillance aircraft could have provided a more encompassing view. (Because of the target’s importance two aircraft were used to zoom in rather than out on the wider scene.) Yet again surveillance drones were in short supply.

Secondary Explosions

In the late spring of 2015 as ISIS continued to prove resilient in carrying out attacks and retaining territory American targeteers and weapons specialists prepared a nighttime airstrike on a car-bomb factory in the industrial district of Hawija north of Baghdad. Occupied apartment houses ringed the area. But the nearest “collateral concern” was assessed to be a “shed.”

Not long before dozens of displaced families unable to afford rent had also begun squatting in the abandoned houses scattered through the industrial zone. Among them were Khadijah Yaseen and her family who had fled the fighting in their hometown Yathrib.

The night of June 2 was particularly hot so the family slept outside. They woke to screaming and the sound of the jets.

“There was fire everywhere” Ms. Yaseen recalled when The Times met her at a displaced persons camp in October 2016. Most of those killed were from squatter families like hers. “You couldn’t count them. There were so many people that died.”

As many as 70 a military investigation found. Ms. Yaseen lost three grandchildren: 13-year-old Muhammad 12-year-old Ahmed and a 3-year-old girl Zahra.

June 2 2015 — HAWIJA IRAQ Plans for a coalition airstrike on an ISIS car-bomb factory failed to account for the potential for secondary explosions. As many as 70 people were killed the military investigation found. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Hawija is among the deadliest examples of the failure to predict the collateral consequences of striking weapons caches or other targets with the potential for secondary explosions. Such explosions often reached far beyond the expected blast radius; they accounted for nearly a third of all civilian casualties acknowledged by the military and half of all civilian deaths and injuries at the sites visited by The Times.

Although the American military planned the Hawija strike the bombs were dropped by the air force of the Netherlands. There the case became a cause célèbre after it emerged that the defense minister had worked to suppress the findings of the military investigation.

In the report of the investigation targeteers and weapons experts describe the ultimately disastrous calculations taken to win approval for the strike. They worked and reworked the target carefully calculating what kinds of munitions to use until their model concluded — despite the fact that they would be striking a car-bomb factory with apartment buildings nearby — that there would be no civilian deaths. (The Dutch military would only carry out strikes with an expected civilian-casualty rate of zero.)

The document describes a secondary explosion that produced a “visible shock wave” extending more than 750 feet from the target.

“That is massive to be able to see a shock wave like that on a video” said a former high-level official involved in the air campaign against ISIS speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The only comparable explosion he’d seen he said was the 2020 blast that devastated the port of Beirut.

Among the sites visited by The Times at least half of the strikes with secondary explosions involved targets — like a power station or a factory for improvised explosive devices — that the military could have predicted would produce such blasts.

However at other times it was unaware of both a weapons cache and a civilian presence. That was the case in the largest civilian casualty incident the military has admitted in the war the March 17 2017 airstrike on two ISIS snipers in the Mosul al-Jadida neighborhood that killed at least 103 civilians.

Failures of Accountability

On Jan. 6 2017 Rafi Al Iraqi woke to the sound of a bomb close by. Another hit next door. Moments later his own house was struck. He could hear his oldest son Hamoody screaming in the wreckage. “I just gave him to some people to take him to the hospital” Mr. Al Iraqi recalled. “Then I went back in to find my other children.”

What happened next was captured on video taken by ISIS’ media agency which often visited blast sites for propaganda.

Rescuers emerged holding limp bodies. Mr. Al Iraqi’s daughter Nour was alive. “I took her with my own hands to the hospital” he recalled this past June in his most recent interview with The Times. “But by then she had died.” A nearby house for ISIS fighters was untouched.

Soon via the ISIS video and news reports word spread online that three families had been targeted in the Zerai neighborhood near Mosul’s Grand Mosque. In all 16 civilians were killed including three of Mr. Al Iraqi’s children and his mother-in-law. Hamoody’s leg was lacerated.

The military began a civilian-casualty assessment which found that there had been a single strike in Zerai that day — on a house assessed to be used exclusively as an ISIS “foreign fighter headquarters” and “artillery staging location.” The strike had been preplanned with no expected civilian casualties.

The post-strike footage showed no civilians killed or injured. The post-strike chat did not indicate the presence of civilians though it did mention a wounded man — judged to be an ISIS fighter — being helped from the ruins.

The footage was 1 minute and 22 seconds long. The allegation was deemed noncredible. Officially 16 people had not died that day in Zerai. (The Pentagon finally acknowledged the casualties in September 2020 after years of follow-up by The Times.)

Except for the rare instances of revelation and subsequent outcry the Pentagon’s brief published reports on the minority of cases it finds credible are the only public acknowledgment of the air war’s civilian toll.

The Times’s reporting in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan points to the broader truth.

In addition to the finding that many allegations of civilian casualties were erroneously dismissed The Times discovered that even when civilian deaths were acknowledged they were often significantly undercounted.

Roughly 37 percent of the allegations deemed credible stemmed from prior ground investigations by journalists or nongovernmental organizations; in those cases the acknowledged death tolls roughly tracked outside reporting. But in the other cases The Times’s own reporting found that the civilian toll was nearly double that acknowledged by the military. (That did not include ISIS fighters’ wives and children whose information was difficult to verify.)

The documents identify children killed or injured in 27 percent of cases; in The Times’s ground reporting it was 62 percent. In 40 percent of the sites visited survivors had been left with significant disabilities which were not tracked by the military.

Beyond the casualty count the structure and execution of the assessments do not encourage the regular examination of immediate lessons or deeper trends.

The records obtained by The Times some significantly redacted range from short first-impression reports to more formal credibility assessments. The reports generally contain a narrative drawn from the strike’s “target package” — including intelligence about the target the civilian-casualty estimate actions to mitigate civilian harm video footage and chat logs tracking each step of the process.

Not only was there no record of disciplinary action or full investigations in roughly 9 of every 10 cases but only a quarter included any further review recommendations or lessons learned. Even the architecture of the forms makes it difficult to analyze causes in aggregate; they do not have specific boxes for specific factors involved in a fatal error. There are a few places to record proximate causes or lessons learned but those fields are mostly empty or redacted. Records are often incomplete missing attachments or were only partially entered into shared databases.

In many cases the unit that executed a strike also ended up investigating it; their assessments often included minimal information. For example a Special Operations unit’s rationale for rejecting allegations that a December 2016 airstrike near Raqqa had killed as many as nine civilians consisted of a single paragraph stating that it had reviewed its strikes in the area and found “no evidence of possible civilian casualties.” There was no further information or detail from the footage.

The Times found that such omissions as well as redactions and missing documents were often associated with Talon Anvil the Special Operations unit that carried out the recently revealed airstrike that killed dozens of civilians in Syria in 2019.

The Video Evidence

Of the 1311 assessments from the Pentagon in only one did investigators visit the site of a strike. In only two did they interview witnesses or survivors.

Captain Urban the military spokesman said that in hostile territory investigators might be unable to visit a blast site and interview “personnel on the ground.”

Instead often the resounding piece of evidence studied was video recorded in the wake of a strike. Yet just as poor or insufficient footage frequently contributed to deadly targeting failures so did it hamstring efforts to examine them.

Often the footage was only seconds or minutes long in many cases too brief to see rescuers carrying survivors from a collapsed building. (Frequently rescuers would wait before approaching a bombed area for fear of being misidentified and provoking a second strike known in the military as a “double tap.”) Often images were obscured by the smoke of the blast.

In an interview — speaking anonymously because of a nondisclosure agreement — an analyst who captures strike imagery said superior officers would often “tell the cameras to look somewhere else” because “they knew if they’d just hit a bad target.”

And at times there was simply no footage for review which became the basis for rejecting the allegation. That was often because of “equipment error” because no aircraft had “observed or recorded the strike” or because the unit could not or would not find the footage or had not preserved it as required.

In a number of cases compelling allegations were dismissed because the claim’s details did not precisely match the imagery.

For example when Airwars — the leading source of civilian casualty allegations referred to the military — reported that a strike in East Mosul in April 2015 had killed dozens of civilian rescuers the allegation was rejected because of “discrepancies in eyewitness accounts.” Despite accurately testifying that three bombs had struck an electric substation a witness said the third had come a quarter-hour after the second and had not exploded; the document described that as “inconsistent” with the military’s imagery and strike report. (The allegation was later deemed credible after The Times visited the site and told the military that at least 18 civilians had been killed and more than a dozen wounded.)

Even when allegations were deemed credible the military often undercounted the toll because victims unseen by the overhead camera before the strike remained invisible in the aftermath. Case in point: the 2016 Ramadan bombing near Mosul University that killed five civilians and wounded four. The military reported injuries to two civilians who had been in the pre-strike footage.

Cases Closed

When the military receives an allegation of civilian casualties it runs through a checklist to determine whether the case merits further inquiry. Most never reach the point of video review. About a quarter of the noncredible cases were summarily closed because they lacked sufficient information or detail such as a specific location or 48-hour time frame. But more than half were rejected in some cases erroneously because the military could find no record of corroborating strikes in the geographic area identified in the allegation — or because there were too many potential matches and too little detailed information.

That information would be found in official logs maintained by different strike authorities. But The Times found numerous instances in which the logs were incomplete or inaccurate: Often records show the coalition knew its logs were flawed.

Frequently cases were closed because the military said it lacked the information to pinpoint the neighborhood in question. Sometimes that conclusion was rooted in misunderstandings of local custom and culture.

In January 2017 citing insufficient information an officer quickly closed a case based on social media reports that civilians had been killed in a strike on a funeral in the al Shifaa neighborhood of West Mosul. Fruitlessly the officer had searched logs for potentially corroborating strikes in the cemetery closest to that neighborhood.

However as reflected in a graphic video accompanying the initial reports the strike had not taken place at a cemetery: A thumbnail depicted the entrance to a house. In fact Muslim funerals are rarely held at cemeteries. What’s more Muslims bury the dead quickly and it had been four days since this man Col. Aziz Ahmed Aziz Sanjari had died.

The colonel’s death had brought many members of the Sanjari family’s tribe to their home to mourn. It was a sunny afternoon so more than a dozen people sat outside. They could hear a drone humming above but were unworried. It was a common occurrence. A few minutes later the bomb hit. Eleven people were killed The Times found.

‘Sometimes Bad Things Happen’

Captain Urban acknowledged that “In some cases our assessment of the numbers of civilian casualties does not always match that of outside groups and we acknowledge that those numbers may change over time as well.

“We do the best we can given the circumstances to understand fully the effects of our operations and the harm done to innocent life. That we sometimes do not always arrive at the same conclusion of outside groups does not diminish the sincerity with which we strive to get it right.”

Several Pentagon studies rendered in military bureaucratese have observed some of the failures of accountability. The April 2018 Joint Chiefs of Staff examination of civilian deaths from airstrikes in the Middle East and Africa found that “feedback to subordinate commands on the cause and/or lessons learned from a civilian casualty incident is inconsistent.” The recent Pentagon Inspector General report spoke of “omissions.”

Yet for the most part these reports do not speak to questions of how airstrikes repeatedly go wrong.

Mr. Lewis the co-author whose efforts to analyze the assessments in aggregate were excised from the Joint Chiefs’ study said the report instead relied primarily on interviews with assessment officers. They were able to detect certain patterns — especially casualties from secondary explosions and from people entering the target frame after a weapon’s firing — but few of the systematic reasons behind the bulk of civilian deaths.

The Times asked him why the military would develop such intricate procedures to prevent civilian casualties and then assess them but not prioritize documenting or studying causes and lessons learned. Not only does the system provide legitimacy for the military’s actions he said; it also allows the United States to boast of a process that is a global model of accountability.

The former high-level American official in the campaign against ISIS said the procedures served an additional purpose — to provide a “psychological veneer” for the people involved: “We did the process. We did what we needed to do. Sometimes bad things happen.”

He said that after returning from his post anguished by what he had seen he had started therapy. He pointed to Raqqa rendered a necropolis by American-led airstrikes and compared it to the ruins of Aleppo which was bombed by the Russians without the American military’s sophisticated considerations of proportionality — the collateral damage estimates no-strike lists or rules of engagement.

“Eventually I stopped saying that this was the most precise bombing campaign in the history of warfare” he said. “So what? It doesn’t matter that this was the most precise bombing campaign and the city looks like this.”

In Afghanistan

All the boys and men of Band-e-Timor knew that when the Toyota Hiluxes came you should run for your life.

People called them wegos. At the wheel were Afghan paramilitary forces who usually set out on full-moon nights at the fork in the road before Lashkar Gah charging through the village of Barang straddling the Kandahar-Helmand border and into other parts of Band-e-Timor “capturing everyone: old men young men everyone” said a resident named Matiullah.

U.S. officials said an Aug. 29 drone strike in Kabul destroyed a vehicle carrying bombs. The Times found that it had killed 10 members of one family. Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times

It did not matter if you were not Taliban people said. If you were male the Afghan forces would arrest you simply to collect a bounty for your release. If you were old or feeble the price was just over $500; a man in his prime would fetch twice that. “You would have to sell your cow or your land to get your relatives released” said Rahmatullah a village resident. Often it was the poorest who would run.

On the night of Jan. 31 2018 the moon was especially bright. The wegos as usual came accompanied by what villagers said were American aircraft. Hidayatullah a driver by profession three days from marrying knew he could not afford the bounty and the wedding so he drove out into the desert. Then an airstrike found him said Matiullah who is his cousin. Dozens of other civilians mistaken for Taliban as they fled on foot and motorbike across Band-e-Timor died in the raid as well.

The August drone strike in Kabul that killed an Afghan aid worker and nine of his relatives grabbed the world’s attention. But most American airstrikes in Afghanistan took place far from the cities in remote areas where cameras were not filming mobile lines were often cut and the internet was nonexistent.

America’s longest war was in many ways its least transparent. For years these rural battlefields were largely off-limits to American reporters. But after the Taliban returned to power in August Afghanistan’s hinterlands opened up.

The Times arrived in Barang a little over a month later visiting 15 households in this hamlet of mud homes and farmland and also interviewing tribal elders and others across Band-e-Timor. Most said they had never spoken to a journalist before. The accounts they gave — consistently and reliably in hourslong interviews — help explain how America lost the country how its war of airstrikes and support of corrupt security forces paved the way for the Taliban’s return.

On average each household lost five civilian family members. An overwhelming majority of these deaths were caused by airstrikes most during wego raids. Many people admitted they had relatives who were Taliban fighters but civilians accounted for most of those lost:

A father killed in an airstrike while running for the forest. A nephew killed as he slept with his flock of sheep. An uncle shot by American soldiers as he went to the bazaar to buy okra for dinner.

At the sound of helicopters Hajji Muhammad Ismail Agha’s sons had bounded for the desert. The “foreign helicopters” fired on them. One son Nour Muhammad was killed; the other Hajji Muhammad survived. “How could the planes tell the difference between a civilian and a Taliban?” the father asked. “He was killed just a little far from here. I watched it happen.”

None of these incidents were mentioned in Pentagon press releases. Few were tallied in United Nations counts. So isolated from the Afghan government were residents that when asked for their loved ones’ death certificates they asked where they might obtain them. Instead to verify deaths The Times visited tombstones in graveyards littered across the desert."

“If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you” is a phrase people throw around as an artful way of calling someone gullible.

It comes from the exploits of an American conman George C. Parker who in the early 1900s made a tidy living ‘selling’ landmarks to New York’s clueless and credulous.

He conned people into ‘buying’ Madison Square Garden the Statue of Liberty the Museum of Modern Art Grant’s Tomb and - most frequently - the Brooklyn Bridge.

So it’s surprising then that such a similar scam was run so successfully in London in the 1920s and 1930s and that the primary targets were American tourists.

Michael Corrigan was every inch the impeccably-dressed military man with fine manners and the glass-cut pronunciation of an upstanding well-educated gentleman.

Unfortunately it was all an act - Corrigan was from County Cork and made his living swindling and relying on his victims being too embarrassed to draw attention to their gullibility by prosecuting him.

One of his victims was the British government to whom he sold non-existent oil concessions under the guise of being a general in the Mexican army.

He convinced a jeweller in the West End that he was working undercover for the Canadian Police in conjunction with Scotland Yard in order to catch some Canadian thieves and convinced him to “lend” him his entire stock for a day for a sting operation.

Can you imagine the waterfall of embarrassment that crashed down on that jeweller’s head when the penny dropped?

But for the most part Corrigan’s victims were not Londoners but American tourists.

We only know about a fraction of the successes since the majority of reports went unreported to the police simply because of the sheer shame of having been conned.

And you can’t really blame them.

Honestly why would you think that as a holidaymaker you could get the actual Tower of London as a souvenir?

Corrigan managed to sell London Bridge twice (why would anyone even want London Bridge?!) and perhaps most astonishingly he even convinced people to put down deposits on 145 Piccadilly the London home of the Duke and Duchess of York.

Not just once did he ‘sell’ 145 Piccadilly but many times.

And each time he made off with large ‘deposits’.

Though Corrigan succeeded much more than he failed he faced imprisonment several times - the last time for trying to defraud a French arms dealer.

He was ‘selling’ non-existent armaments which when the 550 cases were opened turned out to be bricks and rubbish.

However it was the beginning of his undoing - they had him on the technical offense of signing a false customs declaration.

He was fined £500 and as he left the court he was arrested for fraud.

During his court hearing fraud after fraud was uncovered - as was the fact that he had bragged to the police obviously feeling untouchable that his fraudulent arms dealing made him £40000 a year.

It also emerged that witnesses had been offered thousands of pounds not to speak.

(Image: (Photo by Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images))

He only got two years in prison and when he emerged what else could he do but the only thing he was good at the only thing he had ever done the thing that had kept him in his Park Lane flat with a personal butler?

He carried on defrauding people.

In 1946 a victim he’d used as a cash cow for years swallowed a big lump of pride and went to the police.

How quickly Corrigan must have felt his life unravel: he was arrested at a fashionable West End hotel by police who were positively delighted to be locking him up.

He was thrown in jail and refused bail.

Corrigan was almost 60 and he must have known this was probably it.

The jail sentence would be long and then what? Come out as an elderly gent and carry on with the exhausting business of lie dodge run repeat?

Clearly in October that year he decided he was done.

A warder found him in his cell swinging from a noose.

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvc3BlY3Qub3JnL3dvcmxkL3RhbnphbmlhLWFuZC1uaWdlcmlhLXN0cnVnZ2xlLXdpdGgtd2F0ZXItYWNjZXNzLXF1YWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tanzania and Nigeria Struggle With Water Access Quality,"× Expand Sunday Alamba/AP Photo A young woman carries bags of sachet water in Baruwa Lagos Nigeria March 22 2017.

In mid-November Dar es Salaam Tanzania’s largest city responded to weeks of drought by rationing water to residents and businesses. But some sections of the city of nearly seven million people only have running water once a week—if at all.

With the developed world focused on decarbonization and the energy transition an ongoing water crisis in Africa and other regions of the Global South has not received the same level of concern. Even at COP26 a newly formed Water and Climate Coalition banded together with the mission to “raise awareness share experience and provide guidance” about the issues.

But with the climate emergency intensifying the critical importance of public control of water runs headlong into the sometimes debilitating role played by international financial institutions in funding water projects that fail to deliver.

Many African countries rely on Western governments and international financial institutional investment to build manage and maintain water infrastructure. As of 2019 the World Bank has funded $8.2 billion in water sector projects in sub-Saharan Africa the highest investment in any region representing over one-quarter of its entire Water Global Practice portfolio. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) a member of the World Bank Group has invested more than $1.4 billion globally in private water corporations since 1993 and has committed to major annual increases.

These investments would appear to benefit countries that cannot raise the tremendous sums needed to build manage and maintain water supplies. But water access remains poor and many African countries are given little to no opportunity to consider funding opportunities outside of privatization. Instead these life-altering decisions are made by private companies and by financial entities controlled by member governments in the developed world.

Like similar undertakings in the United States and Europe many African private water projects have failed repeatedly prompting national officials or local activists to press for remunicipalization.

“Corporations and institutions like the World Bank are trying to suck water and profits out of Africa as though they have a massive drinking straw” Akinbode Oluwafemi the executive director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) an influential Pan-African environmental organization told an international press briefing in October during the CAPPA-sponsored Africa Week of Action Against Water Privatization.

Like similar undertakings in the United States and Europe many African private water projects have failed repeatedly prompting national officials or local activists to press for remunicipalization the transfer of privatized assets that were once run by local or national agencies back to public control.

The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) was established after the Tanzania government stepped in to end its especially disastrous experience with water privatization. In 2003 City Water Services (CWS) a private utility company owned by Britain's Biwater International and Germany’s Gauff Ingenieure won a contract with the Tanzanian government to provide water to Dar es Salaam. But two years later the private utility had only invested less than half of the $8.5 million needed to update the city’s 50-year-old pipe network which led to water shortages and erratic services for city residents. Tanzania eventually won a lawsuit against Biwater.

For several years Tanzania and its international and private-sector partners tried to press forward with the contract before the government pulled the plug on the private company and set up DAWASCO in 2005. A report found that CWS officials were not able to rise to the immense challenges of rescuing a dilapidated water system collecting customers’ payments and navigating the political environment. Early on DAWASCO managed improvements in some areas such as repairing leaks and extending service connections. But current drought conditions have magnified the numerous water quality connection revenue and management issues. The reliance on international funding that comes with complex conditions which countries struggle to meet also complicates matters.

In Nigeria grassroots activists have been fighting privatization for decades. During the Africa Week of Action a group of women demonstrators unsuccessfully tried to enter a state government building in the state of Lagos to confront lawmakers and deliver petitions opposing further privatization. Like Dar es Salaam Lagos has struggled with aging infrastructure inconsistent supplies for users regulatory failures and budget difficulties. A 2020 investigation by CAPPA on waterworks in Lagos found many individual water distribution plants functioning inconsistently or not at all which left the nearly 15 million residents of one of the largest cities in the world vulnerable to COVID-19 and other diseases and forced to rely on private water sellers.

Beginning in the late 1990s the IFC encouraged the Nigerian government to support public-private partnerships and other investments such as privatizing the Lagos Water Corporation. However public and other reform efforts have largely collapsed one after another stoking years of protests over dismal water access and deteriorating water quality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbWV4aWNvZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L2Fjcm9zcy1tZXhpY28tZHJpbmtpbmctd2F0ZXItaXMtYmVpbmctcG9pc29uZWQv0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9tZXhpY29kYWlseXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTkvYWNyb3NzLW1leGljby1kcmlua2luZy13YXRlci1pcy1iZWluZy1wb2lzb25lZC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Across Mexico drinking water is being poisoned,"The uncontrolled extraction of water is making the wells a risk by intensifying the release of arsenic and fluoride into the liquid of millions of Mexicans. The analysis of a Conagua database reveals that what was a problem concentrated in La Laguna is expanding throughout the country. The government knows it but does not act.

“Your daughter is too young to be urinating arsenic” a doctor told Claudia González a community member from San Juan de Los Planes a town half an hour from La Paz Baja California Sur. It was 2012 Fernanda Ibarra González her daughter was 15 years old and an analysis reported 10.43 micrograms of arsenic per liter in her urine. Almost twice what is considered internationally as a level of risk of arsenic in the body.

Researchers had analyzed the urine of 275 people in that region. “Doña Leonarda had 301 micrograms per liter” Claudia González said in an interview about a neighbor; “Efrén his son 165” he read from an inconceivable list that the academics gave him and of which he still has photographs. They had been drinking arsenic water.

Mother and son exceeded 47 times she and 26 he the limit recognized by international scientific committees as the risk of tolerable intake for health. “It was clear to us why many relatives had died of cancer and why others are sick with cancer” said Juan Ángel Trasviña a specialist in environmental pollution. The population has never received any warning from local authorities about the levels of arsenic in the water supply González says.

Trasviña and González have gathered evidence that points to the residues of 100 abandoned mines in the area as a source of arsenic but this mineral which is also found naturally in the earth’s crust also reaches the water due to uncontrolled extraction according to investigations scientists in Mexico and the world. Arsenic and fluoride have already reached wells in most of the country in amounts higher than the maximum allowable level of the World Health Organization.

An analysis carried out by Data Crítica and Fifth Element Lab of an official database that has spent years almost unnoticed revealed that arsenic from being at high levels in 17 states during 2012 expanded to wells in 24 states in 2018 the last year of complete records. Although fewer water samples were taken in 2019 and 2020 than in previous years arsenic levels continued to show elevated levels. And the authorities have not informed the population.

According to data from the National Water Commission (Conagua) there have been high concentrations of arsenic in wells in Guadalajara Jalisco in La Paz Baja California Sur in Hermosillo Sonora; also in Villa de Cos Zacatecas and in Tlajomulco Jalisco which are the new faces of a crisis that was previously limited to certain places in La Laguna Hidalgo San Luis Potosí and Guanajuato. Data from the government of Mexico City reveal that it is also present in wells of 6 of the 16 city halls of the capital.

In 2018 the year in which the most samples were taken 41 percent of the wells sampled exceeded the international threshold of risk of health impact for arsenic (0.01 mg / L). And these places or their water sources are not close to mines and abandoned waste as is the case in Los Planes.

The Plans are obvious in this analysis. This town dedicated to agriculture construction and sport fishing is one of the towns with the most toxic levels of arsenic in the groundwater of La Paz. This municipality occupies one of the first places in a lethal ranking: the number of wells with high levels of this mineral more than doubled between 2012 and 2019 according to the data analysis carried out for this research.

The network that measures expansion

To obtain indicators of water quality in Mexico Conagua created the National Water Quality Measurement Network (Renameca) from which in 2012 it took samples at 3858 sites of which 3039 were surface waters ( rivers lakes dams coastal waters) and 819 groundwater sites (wells).

The database of this Network collects the results of the presence of various contaminants in 121 thousand samples taken between 2012 and 2020. The analysis of Critical Data and Fifth Element Lab focused only on the more than 11 thousand samples taken in wells that extract underground water; about 90 percent of the fresh unfrozen water in the world is underground.

The analysis revealed that in addition to arsenic another mineral whose presence expanded remarkably in high concentrations this decade was fluoride which like arsenic is also found in nature and has harmful effects on health. Consuming too much fluoride can cause bones to deform or make them brittle and brittle; It can also cause calcification of tendons and ligaments according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This organism indicates a guide of 1.5 mg / L but warns that to define national limits factors such as climate and the volume of water intake among others must be considered. In 2012 fluoride was above the limit considered the risk of dental fluorosis by Mexican scientists and international agencies (.7 mg / L) in 25 states; in 2018 it was 30. That year 41.

These elements reach the population’s drinking water because in Mexico only 257 water treatment plants are capable of removing arsenic or fluoride and only 173 are in operation according to a request for information made for this investigation to Conagua. There are 1256 water treatment plants in the country that is only 1 in 10 water treatment plants remove arsenic or fluoride.

From tap water arsenic passes into food that is cooked with it. The doctor Javier Morán discovered it in studies in beans salsa and literally even in soup. His colleague Dr. Javier García Salcedo explains that this mineral acts as a flame that “ignites the fuel” of any genetic predisposition to develop cancer explained Javier García Salcedo. The internist doctor has seen the evolution of this problem in Torreón and Durango.

According to the baseline analysis there are wells with fluoride concentrations that have exceeded 64 times the risk limit. It went from being present in 25 to 30 states from 2012 to 2018.

The Mexican standard for arsenic tolerates a risk more than double the international risk. “In the world the norm is 0.01 milligrams per liter. In Mexico 0.025. At the end of the day you can have only 0.01 it should be 0 because metals accumulate. It is going to hurt you it may take longer but it is going to hurt you anyway ” warns García Salcedo.

According to experts in some cases one of the first signs of exposure to arsenic in the development of large moles on the skin. Over time the effects worsen. “Their feet turn black until they are cut off” explained Dr. Javier García Salcedo. The doctor has treated around 300 cases of gangrene known as “black foot” in San Pedro and Francisco I. Madero since his years of study in 1973.

“In the case of arsenic the diseases appear at 10 15 20 years” explained Teresa Alarcón Herrera an academic at the Center for Research in Advanced Materials (Cimav) of the National Council of Science and Technology. Prolonged exposure to this heavy metal is associated with the development of different types of cancer cognitive deficiencies in children infertility and diabetes.

The arsenic water that is drunk in Mexico exceeds 70 times the permissible limit by the WHO. It went from being present in 17 to 24 states from 2012 to 2018.

Millions of people exposed

In Mexico more than 12 million are exposed to these toxic elements but unlike Claudia González they do not know it. Researchers such as Dr. Teresa Alarcón Herrera and other specialists from Mexican and American universities made a calculation: 8.81 million exposed to arsenic above the permissible limit according to the WHO and 3.05 million to fluoride according to one of the most recent investigations.

Other calculations such as those of the hydrogeologist José Joel Carrillo estimate the exposure to fluoride —only in the eastern part of the Sierra Madre Occidental— at about 15 percent of the population 19 million people. A study by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources obtained via transparency for this research recognizes the exposure figure of 14 million exposed to both toxins citing a study from the autonomous universities of San Luis Potosí and Guanajuato.

Exposure to arsenic could cause at least 13 thousand 70 additional cases of cancer concentrated in the northern and central states of the country the most affected according to Teresa Alarcón a researcher at Cimav. These states have higher concentrations of arsenic and fluoride due to being on a volcanic axis.

However this is not a complete photograph. These estimates are based only on the wells sampled by Conagua and not from all the wells operating in the country: “it is an underestimation of the real burden of exposure and disease for the country as a whole” added Teresa Alarcón. Therefore the projection of patients with cancer or other diseases due to the consumption of poisoned water could be higher.

But there is little that we can know. The information on the increasing levels of arsenic and fluoride in the water has not triggered the creation of an epidemiological surveillance program for the diseases they cause according to the response via Transparency of the National Center for Preventive Programs and Disease Control of the Secretariat of health. The government only monitors dental fluorosis the least harmful consequence of fluoride consumption. There is no monitoring program for diseases caused by ingestion of arsenic.

Furthermore as of 2018 the federal government has taken fewer water quality samples each year from the monitoring network which is the thermometer that allowed us to monitor the evolution of the problem. It went from 2260 wells sampled in 2018 to just over half (1192) in 2020.

Here nobody is saved

The wells of the monitoring network are located in the towns to monitor the quality of the water in the area. The presence of arsenic and fluoride has also expanded to regions such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area one of the most populated in Mexico. The San Juan de Ocotán 1 well which supplies the domestic network with water without first going through a water treatment plant exceeded in 2016 and 2017 between 1.5 and 2.5 times the maximum permissible level set by the WHO for arsenic and up to 5 times the level for fluoride.

The consumption of fluoride produces fluorosis which is manifested in stains on the teeth a phenomenon that was seen in marginalized populations of the cities where families drink water directly from the tap because they cannot afford bottled water and that can now be observed in neighbors from wealthy Guadalajara colonies such as Colinas de San Javier according to Kachadourian.

The municipalities of Los Altos de Jalisco have arsenic levels above the WHO limit except for Cañadas de Obregón Cuquío and Yahualica. Mexticacán Teocaltiche and San Juan de Los Lagos top the list with the highest levels according to research published in the Pan American Journal of Public Health. “In that area there are deformities due to the high concentrations of arsenic and fluoride” said Dr. Teresa Alarcón Herrera.

In Durango independent studies have already taken samples from bottlers and concluded that the population ingests arsenic even if they do not drink tap water. An analysis of the National Polytechnic Institute in 30 water purifiers found that in all of them the national and international norm in beverages for fluoride was exceeded and in 6 out of 10 that of arsenic despite the fact that most of them showed a reduction between 20 and 97 percent the levels relative to the source wells for fluoride and between 14 and 97 percent in the case of arsenic.

A database of the Mexico City Water System (Sacmex) obtained for this investigation indicates that in 2020 the international arsenic standard was violated in 28 wells distributed in Tláhuac Tlalpan Coyoacán Iztapalapa Iztacalco and Azcapotzalco.

In Mexico City the Chinamper territories of Xochimilco and Tláhuac have the highest levels of arsenic in surface waters in Mexico City recorded by the monitoring network. Although with comparatively lower levels than those seen in the rest of the country its waters irrigate vegetables from the chinampas that go to the Central de Abastos.

Research shows that despite the fact that arsenic remains mainly in the root and stem of crops such as lettuce or those of the jalapeño serrano and chilaca pepper a small part can reach the leaves.

According to the International Hydrogeology Association with data also from Sacmex between 2012 and 2017 the arsenic level increased in at least 57 wells in Mexico City in the central area of ​​Xochimilco and northeast of Milpa Alta.

Arsenic is even sold in stores. According to reports obtained via a request for information from the Federal Commission for Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris) samples were taken from 600 ml bottles. of Peñafiel mineral water obtained from grocery stores in Jalisco and the State of Mexico exceeded the Mexican standard 0.010 mg / L for arsenic. In the most recent tests in late April and May 2019 three different bottles showed 0.0132 0.0135 and 0.0172 respectively. In the United States the brand’s mineral water was removed from consumer shelves in 2019.

Possible solutions

According to experts interviewed up to this day the government’s only effort to reduce exposure to arsenic has been to install water treatment plants that remove this mineral. But even those efforts are insignificant given the magnitude of the problem. To begin with only 7% of the municipalities have a plant that treats the water they supply to homes. And only 1 in 10 existing water treatment plants removes arsenic.

There are two treatment plants in Hermosillo neither of which removes this mineral. Near Los Planes a water treatment plant was inaugurated in 2015 that would remove arsenic. The city council reported to the National Census of Municipal Governments that in 2018 it did not treat a single drop of water due to “equipment failures since its start-up.” The following year it didn’t work out either. “It works seasonally for example two weeks ago it worked but not this one” Claudia González said recently in November 2021.

In Torreón the president of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced in March 2021 the construction of a new water treatment plant for the La Laguna region. “The president is thinking about the water treatment plant because it is urgent that the population have clean water free of arsenic but what it represents is to free the groundwater from the aquifers so that the dairymen can use it up. The desert does not have the vocation of a dairy basin “said Pilar López.

Over the years Dr. García Salcedo has seen part of that desert populate with cases of “black foot”. “The question is why do I have to remove the arsenic from the water if I can have water without arsenic avoiding overexploitation?”

The solutions proposed by the experts require major surgery. They imply rethinking the entire water concession regime that currently exists in the country. The solution proposals are waiting in the different versions of the General Water Law which has been delayed for eight years in the Chamber of Deputies: putting meters that report the extraction of water from industries; charge for its exploitation in accordance with the profits of the concessionaires; reduce the concession to less than 30 years and prevent it from being automatically renewed; ensuring that only the water authorized in the concession is extracted and regulating and monitoring the construction and operation of wells are some of the points that the experts propose to regulate the water market in Mexico.

What most worries Fernanda Ibarra is the future of her daughters. When her mother told her in 2012 that she urinated arsenic she thought of her offspring. “She explained it to me as it is that she had arsenic and what could happen that it causes cancer and other diseases. What worried me the most at that time: ‘it was going to touch my children”.

That fear that crossed her mind when she was a teenager took shape. Her young daughters are exposed to the same danger as she and her mother just because they inhabit Los Planes. “My girl is already older and she drinks from that same water from the one that comes down from the wells. We try to drink from what they bring from the city but sometimes it runs out” lamented Fernanda.

Only 1 in 10 water treatment plants in Mexico removes arsenic or fluoride.

Claudia González in Baja California Sur and Pilar López in La Laguna face the problem as a community while governments of the three levels turn their backs on them. The delegation of Los Planes the municipality of La Paz has not informed the population about the danger “nor to deny that we are taking arsenic” said Claudia González. Neither does the state government. But the federal government also leaves them to their own devices.

In a press conference of the president the then head of Conagua Blanca Cisneros said on September 11 2020 that they protect the population by changing contaminated water sources for others that are not. “La Conagua has about five thousand four thousand water quality intakes which we have long before people drink the water. As soon as we realize this problem Semarnat Profepa and Conagua go together and immediately change the supply source ”said the official appointed ambassador to France in April 2021.

In response to a request for information Conagua reported that they replaced seven water supply sources in 2014 but it was due to the Grupo México spill of copper sulfate in Sonora. They did it twice more in 2016 in Guanajuato due to the presence of iron and manganese in wells. According to Conagua’s response they have not made a single water source change in response to the presence of arsenic or fluoride.

Near Los Planes a water treatment plant was inaugurated in 2015 that would remove arsenic. The city council reported to the National Census of Municipal Governments that in 2018 it did not make a single drop of water drinkable due to “equipment failures since its start-up.” The following year it didn’t work out either.

The legacy

Claudia González has spent very busy days between the mobilizations her work of informing the communities and caring for the family. “Not in my crazy dreams did I think that they would call me an activist which is what people ask me if I am. It was something that due to these circumstances was forming me and here we are in the fight. My intention is to instill in my daughters and my grandchildren that we must defend the land and water against everything ”says Claudia González.

And their fight has already taken effect. Her daughter Fernanda Ibarra says she is very proud of the defense of the territory that her mother undertook years ago. Then Claudia and her organization organized lotteries among the townspeople inviting a doctor here and there from time to time to inform them of the dangers of arsenic in water. Fernanda learned from her mother. Now she does everything possible to ensure that her daughters do not go through what she went through. The lesson is that a decent life must be taken care of before the gains of private interests he says. It is a lesson that he wants to leave for his daughters.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Space exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) Starlink satellite internet constellation which is currently facing a pre order backlog partly caused by a semiconductor shortage might see an improvement in the future if a report from a research firm Jefferies is accurate. In a report released yesterday Jefferies outlines that the shortage which has also affected other industries such as consumer electronics and automobiles is starting to ease but it remains cautious believing that the situation might not normalize under 2023.

Starlink Processor Supplier Sees Chip Delays Subside But Overall Semiconductor Shortage Expected To Last Until 2022

The shortage combined with an overwhelming demand for its service has seen Starlink struggle to meet customer pre orders for its equipment. These preorders require the company to ship a user terminal (dish) a WiFi router and other accessories to customers so that they can connect with the orbiting satellites and access the Internet.

It has seen Starlink push countless deliveries to next year after promising customers that it would start shipping their gear by the end of this year. In a new note research firm Jefferies believes that the semiconductor shortage is starting to ease out. The firm bases its conclusions on data from an American distributor and a British retailer. It outlines that microcontroller supplies have stabilized and pricing and lead times are in the ""stable-to-higher"" category.

Starlink's user terminal which allows users to connect to the network uses a central processing unit (CPU) designed by STMicroelectronics with British design house Arm Ltd's processor layout. It uses four of Arm's Cortex A53 CPU cores which are developed with power efficiency in mind.

Jefferies mentioned STM in its research note sourced by Seeking Alpha. In it the firm outlines that delays for products from STMicro and Texas Instruments have subsided but companies are facing great demand for power management circuits.

Seeking Alpha explains the (paywalled) comments as:

Shortages relating to STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) were viewed as ""pain points"" earlier this year but those delays have subsided though broad-based demand for power management integrated circuits continues. Additionally Analog Devices (ADI) and Infineon could start to see shortages while supplies from Xilinx (XLNX) ""remains in very short supply.""

The firm also comments on the overall semiconductor industry as it believes that high backlogs will last throughout 2022 which will also result in higher prices and backlogs for the chip firms.

Starlink's user terminal also uses memory modules from Kingston and both NAND and DRAM memory prices are expected to drop in the first quarter of next year according to research firm TrendForce.The lack of a teardown of the terminal prevents accurate insight into its component suppliers' supply constraints.

The shortage has also seen SpaceX introduce a new user terminal and router to customers highlighting that the upgraded equipment has shorter production times. While the pre order backlog stands at more than 750000 orders received according to the latest information Starlink plans to scale up operations in the future aggressively.

At this front it has already requested the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to deploy up to five million terminals in the U.S. alongside revealing plans to manufacture ""millions"" of terminals in a new factory in Texas. Starlink is also currently fighting to convince the FCC to open its plans to launch the internet satellites with SpaceX's Starship next generation launch vehicle platform which is currently awaiting its first orbital launch in Boca Chica Texas. Starship will enable Starlink to rapidly deploy a large number of satellites for what is planned to be a 42000 satellite constellation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmlsbS1jYW1lcmEtdHlwZXdyaXRlci1yZWNvcmQtc2FsZXMtc3VyZ2UtdmludGFnZS10ZWNoLWRpZ2l0YWwtbm9zdGFsZ2lhLTIwMjEtMTLSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZpbG0tY2FtZXJhLXR5cGV3cml0ZXItcmVjb3JkLXNhbGVzLXN1cmdlLXZpbnRhZ2UtdGVjaC1kaWdpdGFsLW5vc3RhbGdpYS0yMDIxLTEyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital nostalgia sees film camera typewriter vinyl sales surge,"Adam Berry/Getty Images

As people grow tired of screens vintage tech like typewriters and records are making a comeback.

Insider spoke to sellers of records typewriters vintage video games and film cameras.

They all said business is booming — here's why.

Gramercy Typewriters one of New York City's last remaining typewriter shops looks like a portal into another era.

""Our shelves are a bit barren right now"" Nick Campano a sales associate dressed in a plaid suit and blue velvet jacket said as he pointed to a dozen typewriters lining the narrow store's walls. ""We sold six machines yesterday.""

In the past five minutes three customers and one dog have walked through the shop's door. Business is booming Campano explained and sales have only increased during the pandemic — mostly thanks to young customers.

""I think it has to do with being fed up with looking at our computer screen"" he said. ""We look at it so much … that what's old has become new again.""

And it's not just typewriters. Vinyl records film cameras and retro video games have all seen a surge in popularity over the past two years sellers told Insider.

DKOldies a family-run vintage-gaming company based in Morgantown Pennsylvania has been ""considerably busier"" this year than ever before.

""It's been quite a scramble to get all these orders out"" Joey Walker-Denny who runs the DKOldies' social-media department said. Right now the most popular products include the Nintendo 64 the GameCube and Wii consoles he told Insider.

The same goes for vintage cameras according to Silvio Cohen VP of sales at the Adorama camera store in New York City.

""There is a much larger demand for analog cameras or film cameras"" he said. ""It takes you away from having to use a computer for everything in your life.""

The retro aesthetic has become so popular that mobile apps like Dispo which requires you to wait a day before viewing your photos are used for the sole reason of mimicking the experience of a disposable camera.

Why intentionally downgrade a $1000 iPhone to mimic a $13 camera? Or write on a device without spell-check or a delete key?

Some researchers would say the answer lies in the 20-year cycle of nostalgia: In the 2020s Y2K is all the rage. Others defend the ""Golden 40-Year Rule"" arguing ""the prime site of nostalgia is always whatever happened or is thought to have happened in the decade between 40 and 50 years past.""







The difference this time around is that technology is deeply embedded in our recent memories of the past. As Kyle Chayka explained in a New Yorker article exploring the recent rise of pixel art we're in the midst of the ""first wave of digital nostalgia.""

Add in a global pandemic constant Zoom meetings a new TikTok addiction and limited in-person interaction and you get ""online fatigue"" giving rise to a strong desire for simpler times — regardless of the decade.

In the case of vinyl sales the past two years have just accelerated a trend that was already there Sharone Bechor CEO of Rock and Soul record store told Insider.

""Vinyl has been steadily going up in the past five years"" she said. ""During the pandemic people were less on the go … they were at home and they were just enjoying their life.""

But as many tried to distance themselves from their screens technology's creators pitched the opposite — a virtual reality you never have to leave. This so-called ""metaverse"" recently featured in Facebook's name change to Meta was mentioned at least 449 times on earnings calls in Q3.

Even with Web 3.0 brewing on the horizon sellers say they're confident that the tech of our past is here to stay.

""I feel something different when I'm flipping through the pages of a photo album … it doesn't feel the same when you're just looking at it on your phone and swiping"" Bechor said. ""There's something special about holding something tangible that you wouldn't get from the metaverse.""",,,,,,,,,

The race to deploy 5G infrastructure has unlocked a new use for the rooftops of restaurants hotels residential buildings and even hospitals and churches. These rooftops are quickly becoming prime real estate targets for telecommunication leaders eager to establish 5G technology in highly populated areas.

In fact next-generation wireless deployments are positioned to be one of the largest allocators of lease revenue in the United States over the next five years creating a seismic opportunity for landlords and other business owners.

The Biden administration has made expanding the country’s 5G infrastructure a national priority. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks $65 billion in funding to expand broadband coverage to rural and underserved communities. Despite its speed and power relative to other wireless technologies 5G has a much shorter range only reaching up to about 1500 feet.

In addition to the major wireless communications providers new entrants in the 5G deployment race include traditional cable companies and Big Tech firms. Together these companies are forecasted to invest an additional $275 billion to deploy their 5G macro and small-cell sites. The only effective and efficient way to deploy the sheer quantity of deployment sites required is to leverage existing buildings. In other words the solution to the 5G race is to adopt a rooftop deployment strategy.

Historically the wireless communications market has been challenging to navigate for real estate and other business owners. Wireless carriers and tower companies have in the past entered into long-term agreements that often were less than advantageous to the property owner.

In many communities there’s strong opposition to building new towers and moreover the construction zoning and permitting process can be time-consuming. However 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. Now major institutional commercial real estate owners are better positioned than tower operators for carriers to achieve a faster more efficient solution for their wireless real estate requirements.

A rooftop deployment strategy presents a solution that is mutually beneficial to the 5G carrier and the property owner. Carriers achieve their objective of deploying their infrastructure as quickly as possible in heavily trafficked areas while property owners reap the financial benefits of leasing their rooftops and monetizing their existing buildings in new ways.

The impact on the net operating income for real estate owners and the revenue generated over the terms of a potentially 30-year lease can be substantial increasing their access to capital. In addition to collecting payments in return for leasing its rooftop to the carrier landlords are also able to provide better services to tenants with high-speed broadband connectivity.

What’s at stake in the 5G deployment race

The deployment of 5G infrastructure is critically important for the United States to keep pace and remain competitive internationally. Certainly 5G is about faster connectivity increased capacity and zero latency but it’s mostly about driving innovation that will enable a range of business services from autonomous vehicles and expansion of telehealth to efficiencies in manufacturing and agriculture and improved supply chain management.

With all of these benefits considered 5G is expected to contribute over $1.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP by 2025.

The Biden administration has also identified 5G technology and universal broadband as an economic equalizer for rural America. According to policy statements rural Americans are over 10 times more likely to lack access to reliable internet compared to urban residents.

In the recently signed infrastructure law the president and Congress prioritized investments in rural broadband infrastructure to bridge that digital divide expanding internet access to these underserved areas. Because of this emphasis landlords with properties in rural areas could stand to benefit more from the expansion of 5G infrastructure.

The path to establishing a strong 5G network across the United States will be a long one. While it need not be a deterrent property owners partnering with 5G providers and wireless carriers should also be informed and cognizant of the cybersecurity considerations of the technology as they house the infrastructure and offer the wireless network to their tenants.

In a recent Aon survey of more than 2300 risk managers and other executives cyber risk was listed as the No. 1 current and predicted future risk globally. Increased connectivity and 5G are the future which means the cybersecurity industry must continue to innovate and expand its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance defenses.

We’ve also seen the creation of organizations such as Building Cyber Security to help provide guidance and a framework to improve cybersecurity resiliency in the real estate sector.

For property owners to effectively monetize their rooftops and participate in the race to 5G government and private industry must continue to work collaboratively on an expeditious deployment of 5G infrastructure including timely review of 5G installation requests.

Additionally more work is necessary at the state and local levels to improve the zoning and permitting process for the deployment of 5G antennas. Numerous state legislatures are already considering legislation to better address and develop a 5G strategy for their constituencies which would also provide new opportunities for landlords.

There is more policy and technical work to be done to fuel the race to 5G but the revenue opportunity for property owners is immediate and tangible. For restaurateurs or hoteliers rebounding from the economic slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic monetizing their rooftops could be the difference between shuttering their storefronts and turning a profit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvZ2Fuc3RhbmQuY29tL01lYXRoL0FydGljbGUvSW5kZXgvMzIxNTY20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U20 A FC final: Tones round off a memorable year in style,"U20 A FC final: Tones round off a memorable year in style December 19 2021

Bhulf Ton rounded off a memorable year when they added the u 20 A Championship title to their Keegan cup triumph. Bhulf Tón had built up a match winning lead by the end of the third quarter at which time they led by 3 07 to 0 05 and seemed set for victory. Their opponents mounted a spirited fightback from there to the final whistle registering 6 points without reply but couldn’t manage the goal they needed to get within touching distance. Tones first half performance was built on a solid defence and they led by 1 04 to 0 02 at half time. Both defences were on top early on and in fact by the first water break a Tones point courtesy of Kyle Moran was the only score registered on the scoreboard. Joe Smith (2) and Evan Corrigan added points for Bhulf Ton after play resumed before Tones capitalised on a misdirected short kickout. Evan Corrigan and Laochra O Fionnagain combined to set up Tom Gavigan who palmed the ball to the net at close range to give Tones a 5-point advantage at half time.

Tones stretched their lead on the resumption with a point from Joe Smith. Tom Gavigan scored his second goal shortly afterwards when he rose highest to fist Laochra O Fionnagain’s ball kicked in from out near the sideline to the net. The yellow furze men rallied and notched 2 points to leave the score 2 05 to 0 04 after 39 minutes but were dealt a significant blow to see their intercounty player Cathal Hickey black carded. Tones rounded off a fantastic third quarter with 1 02 from the excellent Oisin Martin his goal a superb solo effort.

Tones had good performances from all six defenders and gave great protection to keeper Conor Mc Keever with Eoin Donegan imperious in the air. Peter Carroll and Sean Murray gave great forward impetus to the team while James Carroll and Sean Kendall broke up many Seneschaltown attacks. Adam O Neill’s fielding was superb. Oisin Martin pulled the strings at midfield and was prominent both in defence and attack ably assisted by Sean Penny. Kyle Moran Joe Smith Aaron Tolan Laochra O Fionnagáin and Evan Corrigan all had good moments in attack whilst captain Tom Gavigan’s knack for scoring goals was crucial bringing his tally for the three match campaign to 5.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Bosses are increasingly using an array of tech industry tools to keep constant tabs on their employees working from home despite statistics showing that those who work remotely are more productive than their counterparts toiling away in office buildings.

But one woman who worked for the tech industry’s biggest company is fighting back. Ashley Gjovik a former Apple project manager who was fired in September after speaking out about workplace safety concerns has asked labor regulators to rule that the company employs illegal surveillance tactics. In October Gjovik filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing Apple of a number of unfair labor practices including keeping tabs on employees in a manner that prevents them from exercising their right to discuss working conditions.

Gjovik also alleged that the company violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by retaliating against her for voicing concerns about workplace safety stemming from the fact that Apple’s office building in Sunnyvale California is situated on top of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-designated Superfund site an area contaminated by hazardous industrial waste that is supposed to have been cleaned up and contained if humans are in the vicinity. If Gjovik prevails the NLRB could issue a ruling curtailing employers’ abilities to surveil workers and chill their speech.

Gjovik has filed numerous other complaints with several environmental and workplace safety regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and has been meticulous in documenting her experience as demonstrated by her personal website.

This week the Department of Labor ruled that Gjovik’s complaints had merit and that the agency’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would be investigating her whistleblower retaliation complaints. Whistleblowing law expert Stephen Kohn told the Financial Times that it was unusual for OSHA to investigate such allegations because companies often “silence and intimidate” employees and because those filing charges must establish that their case is likely to succeed.

“Most of us know that there’s some level of pollution in our day-to-day lives but there’s still a lot of trust in the government and companies to do the right thing when it comes to poisoning people” she told Truthout.

In her NLRB complaint alleging illegal surveillance by Apple Gjovik cited the company’s handbook which reserves the right to search employees’ work equipment and their personal devices “to protect Apple confidential and sensitive information.” The company defines its proprietary information to include “compensation training recruiting and other human resource information.”

Under federal labor law all employees have the right to discuss their working conditions “for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” The NLRB has ruled that management cannot spy on employees exercising their rights.

The Apple handbook includes a footnote stating that the company is not attempting to restrict its employees’ “rights to speak freely about wages hours or working conditions as legally permitted.” But Apple policy also generally forbids employees from making any public disclosures without prior approval including statements to the press and it orders employees to refrain from discussing “compensation training recruiting and other human resource information” after leaving the company which it attempts to enforce through non-disclosure agreements. The handbook also bars employees from sharing information about their coworkers’ “compensation health information or performance and disciplinary matters” without any footnotes about “rights to speak freely about wages hours or working conditions” according to Gjovik’s complaint.

Charges that Gjovik filed with the NLRB also cite a memo circulated by Apple CEO Tim Cook after details of a meeting featuring discussion of pay equity was leaked to the press. Cook responded to the disclosure by vowing “to identify those who leaked” and by saying “people who leak confidential information do not belong here” contradicting any stated policy granting employees the right to discuss their working conditions.

Gjovik also told Truthout that when she informed someone on Apple’s employee resources team that she had the legal right to speak publicly about working conditions he replied “Most people don’t figure that out.”

In response to questions about Gjovik and Apple workplace activists Apple has typically declined to make specific comments. For example the company told Slate: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved we do not discuss specific employee matters.”

Apple has not responded to Truthout’s request for comment on Gjovik’s claim that a member of its employee resources team told her that the majority of Apple employees aren’t aware of their rights in the workplace.

Gjovik’s conflict with Apple management started in March when an administrative assistant emailed her team about the company’s Environmental Health and Safety division wanting to conduct a “vapor intrusion survey” in the Sunnyvale office. The phrase set off “alarm bells” for Gjovik who had spent the last six months battling her apartment’s property managers after becoming ill and learning that the residence was built on top of another EPA Superfund site.

“My body was just going crazy. It was such a nightmare. I was buying books on terminal illness” Gjovik said.

When she applied what she learned from her struggle at home things started going south. Gjovik responded to the administrative assistant’s email by asking her management team if Apple had conducted comprehensive air quality tests citing an Atlantic article from 2013 which documented how their Sunnyvale building was next to three separate triple fund sites. Apple started leasing the property in 2015 hadn’t conducted any tests since moving in and did not inform employees of the hazardous waste underneath them Gjovik alleged noting that she herself discovered the lack of testing in public records after learning how to do research through her apartment ordeal. She said that management claimed that they didn’t have to inform employees of the situation because there was no evidence of air quality issues. Gjovik replied that they lacked the evidence because they didn’t perform proper tests.

Meanwhile evidence of retaliation against Gjovik by management started to mount. HR opened a sexual harassment investigation into one of Gjovik’s superiors that she did not want initiated out of fear that hostility from above would worsen. She started getting bombarded with an unrealistic number of work assignments. One boss cited Gjovik’s “mental health issues” in urging her to drop her concerns about the Superfund site. Additionally she says superiors told her not to raise questions about workplace safety — always over the phone or in person. Gjovik attempted to document those statements by replying in emails with notes about the conversations asking if she missed anything.

By the middle of summer things began to escalate. On July 23 Gjovik made The New York Times quote of the day for questioning why Apple management wanted its employees to return to office work as the Delta variant of COVID-19 started to spread throughout the country. Around the same time she took to the company’s messaging platform Slack to ask her coworkers if they have had negative experiences dealing with HR receiving numerous responses in the affirmative. In early August after informing employee resources Gjovik asked colleagues working in the office to document cracks in the floor — a sign that vapor intrusion may be occurring. They took photographs and sent them to Gjovik and she planned to go into the office the next day to gather evidence herself. On the day of her planned trip to the office however she was informed that she was being put on paid administrative leave. On September 9 after Gjovik received a request from Apple management to cooperate with an investigation about “a sensitive Intellectual Property matter” she agreed to cooperate but never found out what it is they were trying to discover. Gjovik asked that the inquiry be conducted in writing over email. Subsequently she was fired.

The night before Gjovik was fired she received a direct message on Twitter from a random helpful follower urging her to take steps to protect her privacy in a general warning that invoked his own experience with private sector surveillance. Hours later she asked her Twitter followers if it would be “over-paranoid” to worry about the security of her messages on Apple’s iCloud. Soon after she began taking her personal information off of servers controlled by Apple and as she told the tech publication Protocol Gjovik began to unplug smart devices in her home. She told Truthout that she has no proof of the company using non-public information against her but noted that internet trolls defending Apple have used information that she has not shared about her health and compensation to insult her calling the matter a “nightmare sandwich.” Gjovik has also documented how supervisors at Apple were warning her to be wary of private-sector surveillance when she told them how she was locking horns with her property management company.

Still there is an end to the nightmare in sight and a silver lining. Gjovik is hoping that complaints she has filed with workplace regulators will prevent Apple and other massive companies from bullying and mistreating employees especially workers who aren’t as well-compensated as she was. Already it appears that the complaints she filed after being put on administrative leave have the potential to bear fruit. In addition to the Department of Labor advancing her case the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission told Gjovik in September that she has the right to sue Apple in state court for creating a hostile work environment. Experts familiar with the NLRA including former NLRB officials have said that Gjovik has a strong case against Apple — especially her complaint about CEO Cook threatening the employees who leaked details about the meeting concerning pay equity.

“What he’s saying here goes too far” NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman told Bloomberg about the Cook memo. “It’s restrictive of people’s ability to talk about employment policies.” Mark Gaston Pearce another former NLRB chair who like Liebman led the Board during the Obama administration tweeted that Gjovik’s case could be “a vehicle” to reverse pro-management rulings by the Board under the Trump administration. NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo who has the power to direct Board agents to advance cases that could set precedent has asked regional offices to pursue cases designed to expand the definition of “concerted activity” which was narrowed under Trump including those involving handbook policies like the ones flagged by Gjovik. Abruzzo also noted on November 4 the Board has ruled that concerted activity includes “protesting unsafe working conditions and asserting statutory rights like filing a claim with [OSHA].”

As far as her complaint to the SEC is concerned Gjovik said she wants to stop the company from misrepresenting how it treats its employees. The complaint centers around a shareholder Nia Impact Capital who alleged that Apple is exposing itself to employment litigation risk by enforcing a culture of secrecy beyond that which is necessary to protect its trade secrets. The company responded by claiming that “Apple does not limit employees’ and contractors’ ability to speak freely about harassment discrimination and other unlawful acts in the workplace.” Gjovik’s SEC complaint alleges that these are “false & misleading statements of material importance” by Apple citing an agency commissioner who warned in September 2020 against companies engaged in “woke-washing where companies attempt to portray themselves in a light they believe will be advantageous for them on issues like diversity.”

Not that any of this has brought Gjovik much pleasure. She told Gizmodo that working for Apple was a “dream” job and although she held a high-pressure position she was paid well and proud of her work. But since she was put in a situation where she feared for her health and safety and got significant push back from the company for raising concerns about it she wants to take the opportunity to stand up for herself and others.

“I was a very senior employee who gave them my blood sweat and tears. If they’re doing it to me what the fuck are they doing to retail?” she asked rhetorically. “I’m going to file as much shit as I can.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story said that in early August Gjovik went into the Sunnyvale office herself to take photos of cracks in the floor.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Amazon.cn entry for Xi’s “The Governance of China” had its ratings comments and reviews scrubbed and disabled roughly two years ago in response to an edict from Beijing the report said. Triggering the request were reviews rating the work at less than the maximum five stars according to one of the unidentified people familiar with the incident.

The move was part of a broader campaign to ensure that Amazon could carry on with business in the world’s most populous country where its Kindle and cloud computing operations had room to grow. By 2018 the company was receiving an “increasing number of requests from (Chinese) watchdogs to take down certain content mostly politically sensitive ones“ according to an internal briefing document cited by Reuters.

An Amazon spokesperson told Bloomberg News that it “complies with all applicable laws and regulations wherever we operate and China is no exception.”

The experience recounted in the report mirrors that of Apple Inc. which has grown increasingly compliant with Beijing in recent years. Apple complied with 97% of requests from the Chinese government for user device information in 2019 up significantly from 65% in 2014.

Reviews for Xi’s book of speeches and writings are blocked only on Amazon’s Chinese website. One Amazon.com entry has received 74% five-star reviews.

The filing was made after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) started reviewing allegations that Apple hurts competition by forcing app developers to use its proprietary system which can charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases.

Apple denied the allegations in its filing to the CCI and stressed that its market share in India is an ""insignificant"" 0-5% while Google commands 90-100% as its Android operating system powers most other smartphones.

""Apple is not dominant in the Indian market ... Without dominance there can be no abuse"" Apple said in the submission dated Nov. 16 which was signed by its Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer.

""It has already been established that Google is the dominant player in India"" it added.

Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Alphabet Inc's Google declined to comment when asked about Apple's assertions in the filing.

The complainant in the case a little-known non-profit group called ""Together We Fight Society"" said that Apple with iOS dominates the market for non-licensable mobile operating systems.

Apple countered that in its filing saying the entire smartphone market - which includes licensable systems like Android - is the market that should be taken into consideration.

Apple also described the Indian complaint as a ""proxy filing"" in its CCI submission saying that the complainant was ""likely acting in concert with parties with whom Apple has ongoing commercial and contractual disputes globally and/or that have complained to other regulators.""

The U.S. tech company did not give any evidence in its submission to support its claim. The non-profit told Reuters that Apple's remark was ""made to prejudice the mind"" of the CCI ""without any iota of proof.""

In the coming weeks the CCI will review Apple's response to the allegations and could order a wider investigation or dismiss the case altogether if it finds no merit in it. Details of CCI investigations are not publicly disclosed.

The CCI is separately conducting an investigation into Google's in-app payment system as part of a broader probe into the company after Indian startups last year voiced concern.

Apple's iOS powered about 2% of 520 million smartphones in India as of end-2020 with the rest using Android according to Counterpoint Research though it adds that Apple's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years.

GLOBAL ISSUE

Apple has been grappling with similar allegations in other parts of the world. In the United States it is locked in a legal battle with ""Fornite"" creator Epic Games over the issue and South Korea this year became the first country to ban dominant app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems.

In the European Union  regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's in-app fees for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.

Companies like Apple and Google say their fees cover the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.

In its CCI filing Apple argued that the in-app commissions it charges are ""not unfair or excessive"" and have decreased over time adding that it charges lower rates from small developers.

""Only a small number of large developers many of which are multi-billion-dollar conglomerates pay the headline rate of 30%"" Apple said.

""Competing platforms have charged similar or higher commissions as Apple. Particularly Google has charged a 30% commission on its app store"" it said.

Jemal spoke as two excavators – one with a long boom – and a Bobcat were moved onto the site over the weekend possibly in preparation for demolition.

City orders emergency demolition of Great Northern grain elevator damaged in windstorm The demolition order comes as Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 36G said it wanted to explore the feasibility of reusing the structure as a union hall credit union office and public museum.

""I looked at that building very closely and that building absolutely could be saved"" Jemal told The Buffalo News. ""It's a magnificent building. I have tackled a hundred times worse than that.

""If ADM wants to sell the building I will buy the building and preserve and stabilize that building. ADM has a ready willing and able buyer.""

Jemal's interest comes as the Campaign for Greater Buffalo History Architecture & Culture obtained a temporary restraining order from a State Supreme Court justice Sunday to halt demolition of the 1897 brick box-style grain elevator with steel bins believed to be the last of its kind standing in the United States.

ADM seeks to demolish damaged grain elevator despite preservationists' objections Archer Daniels Midland in a statement said the large hole in the flat brick northern wall exposing large steel bins posed a safety hazard including to workers in its flour mill next door.

The restraining order by Justice Dennis J. Ward bars demolition or alteration of the building until Wednesday when the parties are scheduled to appear again.

""It will take a powerful effort"" said Tim Tielman the Campaign for Greater Buffalo's executive director. ""Our adversary ADM has a lot of resources and they have the City of Buffalo arguing with them by their side.""

Jemal said he is having his own structural engineer look at the structure and will join the Campaign for Greater Buffalo in court in an effort to convince the judge that the Great Northern can be saved and reused.

Mayor Byron Brown's spokesman Mike DeGeorge said the administration had ""no comment"" regarding Sunday's developments.

A message seeking comment from ADM based in Chicago was not returned.

A statement earlier in the week from the company warned of ""significant safety concerns on-site and at adjacent properties and roadways"" after last weekend's massive wind storm knocked a hole in the elevator's north wall.

The Brown administration could have forced ADM to repair the grain elevator after the wall was extensively damaged by high winds Dec. 11. Instead James Comerford commissioner of Permit and Inspection Services ordered an emergency demolition based on public safety concerns raised by engineers and drone footage.

Brown then appealed to ADM to consider preserving all or part of the Great Northern despite the company's past requests to demolish the site as recently as last year.

Jemal said he was reluctant to come forward at first because he didn't want to ruffle any feathers but he is now because he feels deeply protective of Buffalo's history.

""These silos are Buffalo's monuments. Those are our monuments"" Jemal said.

""I'm sick and tired of people taking advantage of Buffalo and taking the magnificent architecture the city has and destroying it"" he added. ""Not on my .... watch.""

Jemal said he needs time to make a careful assessment of the unused Great Northern's condition and said cordoning off the site should be sufficient to protect the public.

""No one is in imminent danger over there"" Jemal said referring also to the flour mill next door. ""It's on an island. No one's in there and it's not falling down on the flour mill.

""Old buildings don't fall they stay. They're very strong. That building was built right.""

Great Northern grain elevator damaged by Buffalo windstorm The City of Buffalo landmark was built in 1897 and operated for nearly a century. Saturday's windstorm tore a hole in the northern wall but the grain elevator is not in danger of collapse.

Rep. Brian Higgins who has urged ADM to save the building using possible historic tax credits welcomed Jemal's offer.

""If Doug Jemal wants to buy and save the Great Northern that's a big compelling statement of viability"" Higgins said. ""His offer requires serious consideration and collective effort.""

Lorraine Pierro president of the Industrial Heritage Committee was encouraged by Jemal's expression of interest. The organization raised the funds to bring the National Park Service to Buffalo in 1991 to document all of the city's grain elevators.

""That's wonderful because we don't have another grain elevator of that type in Buffalo"" Pierro said. ""It was an important step in the development of grain elevators that originated here in Buffalo in 1842.""

Jemal is working on or has completed several large-scale projects in Buffalo including the redevelopment of the Statler Building the downtown Simon properties and modernizing the recently purchased Buffalo Hyatt Regency. He is also negotiating to develop the Richardson Olmsted Campus.

Jemal said some possibilities for reusing the Great Northern could be apartments – which he noted is being done at Silo City – manufacturing or possibly a tech hub.

""You can do anything with it"" Jemal said. ""You have to restore it respect it and bring it back to its adaptive reuse life. It will have historic significance and be so damn cool. Who wouldn't want to be there?""

Jemal said he's rebuilt numerous historic structures in Washington D.C. and elsewhere after being told they were unsafe and needed to come down.

""Guess what? I restored them and made a fortune"" he said.

The investment was co-led by ADM Ventures the investment arm of Chicago-based food multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland and an unnamed global tech investor Prof. Yaakov Nahmias founder and CEO of Future Meat told Bloomberg on Saturday.

US meat company Tyson Foods the second-largest processor and marketer of meat products and an existing investor in Future Meat also participated in the round.

Nahmias said the company will use the funds to build a production facility in the United States and hopes to hit US market shelves later in 2022 pending regulatory approval. This past summer Future Meat opened what it called the world’s first industrial cultured meat production facility in Rehovot its headquarters with the capacity to produce 500 kilograms (about half a ton) of cultured product per day.

The facility further supports Future Meat’s larger efforts “to create a more sustainable future” the company has said.

“We are incredibly excited by the massive support of our global network of strategic and financial investors” said Nahmias. “This financing consolidates Future Meat’s position as the leading player in the cultivated meat industry just three years after our launch. Our singular technology reduced production costs faster than anyone thought possible paving the way for a massive expansion of operations. Our team will break ground on the first-of-its-kind large-scale production facility in the United States in 2022.”

Future Meat’s technology is based on the work of Nahmias a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and is licensed through Yissum the technology transfer company of the university. The company grows animal cells in bioreactors and says its end product is indistinguishable from animal meat. The cells do not undergo genetic modifications and can multiply indefinitely. The process is more environmentally friendly than farming producing 80 percent fewer greenhouse emissions and using 99% less land and 96% less freshwater than traditional meat production according to the company.

“While Future Meat is leading the pack as the fastest-growing company in this space I truly see the entire cultivated meat industry as a massive agent of change creating a sustainable future for coming generations” added Nahmias.

Future Meat also announced Sunday that it was now producing cultivated chicken breast for just $7.70 per pound or $1.70 per 110-gram chicken breast down from under $18 per pound just six months ago.

Cultured meat companies have been drawing significant investments in recent years. Eat Just a San Francisco-based food company raised $267 million in September for its cultured meat division GOOD Meat. Memphis-based UPSIDE Foods (formerly Memphis Meats) has raised over $200 million for its cultivated meat poultry and seafood products and opened a production facility in Emeryville California last month.

In July Israeli cultivated meat startup Aleph Farms received a $105 million investment including by US actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio to bring lab-grown steaks to market.

The Israeli cultured meat sector also includes MeaTech 3D a maker of lab-grown meat products that started research into the production of cultivated pork meat and recently unveiled what it called the largest bio-printed cultivated steak to date at 3.67 ounces (104 grams) and SuperMeat which grows beef and poultry cells.

These food tech companies play a “substantial role” in the alternative proteins global market according to a report by The Good Food Institute Israel a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote research and innovation in the field.

The cultivated meat sector is poised to thrive in coming years when companies transition from the development stage to production the report said.

There are some 40 companies worldwide racing to be the first to market with cell-based meat products that taste and look like the real thing and can be affordably mass-produced to meet the massive demand for protein in a world whose population is increasing and becoming wealthier.",,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Jennifer Lopez a mis fin aux rumeurs selon lesquelles elle se serait offusquée des commentaires de Ben Affleck concernant son ex-femme Jennifer Garner dont il s'est séparé en 2015. «Cette histoire n'est tout simplement pas vraie. Ce n’est pas ce que je ressens. Je ne pourrais pas avoir plus de respect pour Ben en tant que père coparent et personne» a déclaré la chanteuse à «People » assurant les arrières de son partenaire.

Il y a quelques jours au micro de la radio d'Howard Stern l'acteur de 49 ans avait surpris en évoquant des sujets intimes comme son alcoolisme assurant qu'il aurait «probablement continué à boire» s'il était resté «piégé» dans un mariage qui ne le rendait pas heureux.

""Pour elle Noël c'est avant tout les enfants""

Quelques jours plus tard Ben Affleck avait tenu à clarifier ses propos  assurant que sa tournure avait été reprise hors contexte partout dans les médias. «Je ne voudrais jamais que mes enfants pensent que je dirai un jour du mal de leur mère. (...) J'ai dit quelque chose et on a donné l'impression que je disais l'exact opposé. J'avais parlé du fait que nous nous respections l'un l'autre que nous soucions l'un de l'autre de nos enfants qu'ils étaient notre priorité. Et ils ont dit que je blâmais mon ex-femme pour mon alcoolisme et que j'étais piégé ce qui m'a donné l'image d'un gars horrible stupide et insensible».

Au service de pédiatrie du CHU de Bangui la capitale une ONG a décidé de s’attaquer à l’une d’entre elles en assurant un suivi scolaire pour les enfants hospitalisés.

Avec notre correspondant à Bangui Carol Valade

Il pourrait à première vue s’agir d’une classe ordinaire. Mais nous sommes au service pédiatrie du CHU de Bangui où l’on soigne principalement le paludisme les diarrhées la malnutrition qui touche près d’un enfant centrafricain sur deux. Appollinaire Ngandaré directeur de l’école : « Ceux qui peuvent se déplacer bénéficient de ces enseignements-là dans les salles de classe. Mais ceux qui ne se déplacent pas restent sur leur lit de malade. Et les enseignants et animatrices vont auprès d’eux pour dispenser les cours ».

Fondée par des Centrafricains de la diaspora sur financement de l’Unicef l’ONG Centre d’action pour le développement du monde apporte depuis maintenant 6 ans l’« école à l’hôpital ».

« La présence de l’enseignant un soin psychologique »

En chirurgie malgré les cris déchirants des tout petits patients un enfant récite les couleurs : « Le bleu le vert le blanc le jaune… ». Appollinaire Ngandaré : « L’enfant qui est hospitalisé en face d’un personnel soignant peut-être qu’il a peur soit il peut être piqué ou on peut lui donner d’autres médicaments. Et la présence de l’enseignant c’est déjà un soin psychologique ».

Aymery-Brice Ngadzale coordonnateur du centre: « Avec les groupes armés les déplacements des gens la précarité des parents des enfants qui sont enrôlés dans des groupes armés. Il y a beaucoup de problèmes en Centrafrique qui font que les enfants décrochent. Nous avons choisi celle-ci dans un premier temps parce qu’il fallait commencer quelque part ».

L’ONG veut élargir ses activités vers l’intérieur du pays où les besoins sont immenses et soutenir les parents qui restent au chevet des enfants.

Jeudi les organisations patronales de l’hôtellerie-restauration ont proposé une nouvelle grille des salaires assurant au moins 5% de revalorisation sur le Smic. Une étape des négociations soumise encore à la signature des syndicats de salariés lundi et jusqu’au 17 janvier. Pour Thierry Grégoire président de la branche des saisonniers de l’UMIH principale organisation du secteur sur le reste de la grille cela se traduit par ""une augmentation moyenne de 16 %"". ""On a une responsabilité pour l'attractivité de nos métiers car nous avons perdu un certain nombre de salariés"" ajoute le représentant de l'Union des métiers et des industries de l'hôtellerie (UMIH) invité au micro d'Europe 1 ce dimanche.

""Le Covid a accéléré l'érosion""

Actuellement 30% de postes ne sont pas pourvus dans l'hôtellerie et la restauration. Et au total près de 237.000 salariés ont quitté la profession durant la pandémie de Covid-19. Mais le responsable de l'organisation patronale nuance: ""Le Covid n'a fait qu'accélérer l'érosion car on avait déjà depuis dix ans 100.000 emplois non pourvus."" La revalorisation salariale serait-elle alors LA solution pour endiguer la crise dans la secteur ? ""Il était important de revaloriser la grille des salaires des minima conventionnels. (...) Mais il y a aussi les conditions de travail. C'est sur ce deuxième volet que l'on s'engage à travailler dès l'année prochaine.""

Des annulations liées au durcissement des règles sanitaires

Avec notamment une amélioration du travail de nuit des coupures mais aussi du travail le week-end. Pendant les fêtes les restaurateurs ont dû tant bien que mal adapter leurs horaires et jours d'ouvertures par faute de main d'œuvre. ""C'est une réalité malheureusement. On a aussi des salariés qui n'ont pas compris ou qui comprennent mais qui ne veulent plus que l'on travaille quand nos clients sont sur des temps de repos."" Et le durcissement des mesures sanitaires n'est pas prêt de rassurer les restaurateurs et professionnel de l'hôtellerie déjà victimes de 5 à 10% d'annulation en raison de la fermeture de la frontière franco-britannique.

""Maintenir en vie nos entreprises""

""Les organisateurs de réception sont probablement ceux qui ont été le plus touchés durement. Le mois de décembre est un mois très important pour eux et ils ont entre 80 et 90% d'annulations de part les restrictions sanitaires. On est en train de pousser un maximum l'accompagnement notamment sur le Fonds de solidarité (...) pour maintenir en vie nos entreprises."" Pour cela Thierry Grégoire appel l'exécutif a écouter les revendications des restaurateurs et hôteliers avec par exemple un remboursement des prêts garantis par l'Etat ""pas avant 10 ans"". ""Il faut que l'exécutif comprenne qu'il peut y avoir une casse terrible au printemps"" conclut-il.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhdGVycmFuZWUuY29tLzE5NzIwMjEtdW4tdmVudC1kZS1qZXVuZXNzZS1zb3VmZmxlLXN1ci1sYS1wb2xpdGlxdWUtY2hpbGllbm5lLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gabriel Boric 35ans nouveau président chilien | Mediaterranée! L'actualité au quotidien,"Un vent de jeunesse souffle sur la politique chilienne. Gabriel Boric 35 ans homme politique de gauche et ancien leader d’un mouvement estudiantin un passé pas si lointain au final est devenu ce dimanche le plus jeune président du Chili après avoir remporté le second tour de l'élection présidentielle.



Après le dépouillement de 9995 % des bulletins de vote Gabriel Boric a remporté 5587 % des voix s'assurant ainsi la victoire sur son adversaire de droite Jose Antonio Kast qui a récolté 4413 % des voix Boric entrera officiellement en fonction le 11 mars prochain.

Depuis son qurtier général le président élu Boric a remercié le peuple chilien.

""Je veux commencer ce moment historique qui est formidablement excitant et que les yeux du Chili et du monde entier regardent en remerciant tous les Chiliens qui sont allés voter honorant leur engagement envers la démocratie"" a-t-il déclaré. ""Peu importe que vous l'ayez fait pour moi ou pour mon adversaire l'important est que vous l'ayez fait que vous ayez été présents que vous ayez montré votre engagement envers ce pays qui appartient à chacun d'entre vous.""



Pour sa part le président chilien sortant Sebastian Pinera a également félicité Boric déclarant : ""Les Chiliens ont donné un exemple de démocratie vous en avez fait partie je vous félicite.""

Il promet de défendre les droits sociaux tout en restant ""fiscalement responsable""

Avec deux programmes complètement opposés Boric et Kast ont émergé comme les deux principaux candidats après une élection générale qui s'est tenue le 21 novembre. Kast avait alors recueilli 28 % des voix. Boric est arrivé en deuxième position avec 25 %.

Jose Antonio Kast dont la récente montée en popularité a surpris les critiques a parfois été comparé à l'ancien président américain Donald Trump ou au président brésilien Jair Bolsonaro. Il est perçu comme un fervent défenseur du régime de l'ancien dictateur Augusto Pinochet et du marché libre. Le programme de l'ancien membre du Congrès âgé de 55 ans comprenait une réduction des impôts pour les entreprises la construction de barrières dans le nord du Chili pour empêcher les migrants d'entrer illégalement et l'abolition du droit à l'avortement.

Gabriel Boric quant à lui a un passé de leader de mouvement étudiant dans la capitale chilienne opposé au système éducatif privatisé du pays. Âgé de 35 ans l'âge minimum pour se présenter avait créé la surprise en juillet dernier en remportant la primaire de la gauche. Avec seulement deux mandats de députés il est devenu le chef de file de la coalition Apruebo Dignidad (""J'approuve la dignité""). Un mouvement né dans la continuité de la révolte sociale qui a secoué le pays fin 2019 et qui a poussé le désormais futur ancien président Sebastian Pinera à accepter un référendum pour une nouvelle Constitution héritée de la dictature d’Augusto Pinochet.



Gabriel Boric entend promouvoir une grande réforme fiscale pour faire participer les plus riches à son programme. Il entend également garantir un meilleur accès à la santé à l’éducation et à la création d’un nouveau système de retraite aujourd’hui entièrement privé.

Gabriel Boric a assuré qu'il défendrait ces nouveaux droits sociaux tout en restant ""fiscalement responsable"" répondant ainsi aux inquiétudes concernant l'augmentation des dépenses publiques.

Outre le développement d'un Etat-providence Gabriel Boric défend également des combats sociétaux en lien avec les luttes féministes très vives au Chili et le mariage des couples homosexuels qui sera autorisé dans le pays à partir du 10 mars 2022.

À noter que le Chili connait un ralentissement économique qui pourrait ralentir la mise en place des mesures socioéconomiques du nouveau président élu. De plus le Parlement qui n'est pas entièrement acquis à sa cause pourrait également constituer un frein aux réformes annoncées.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxlc3QtZWNsYWlyLmZyL2lkMzI0NTQwL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS0xMi0xOC9sYWRtci1kZS1tYXJpZ255LWxlLWNoYXRlbC10b3Vqb3Vycy1hdS1wbHVzLXByZXMtZGUtc2VzLWJlbmVmaWNpYWlyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'ADMR de Marigny-le-Châtel toujours au plus près de ses bénéficiaires,Durant la crise les salariés de l’ADMR n’ont pas failli à leur tâche en assurant les visites et les interventions auprès des bénéficiaires.

But because she was a stunt double galloping on horseback crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows hers was not a household name.

In her heyday however Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter’s stunt double on the hit television series “Wonder Woman” and mimed Ms. Carter’s leggy lope.

Burger chains chicken chains taco chains — all with their irresistible nobody-has-to-know drive-thru options.

And out of all those options the one we’re likely to be most frequently presented with is but of course McDonald’s.

Drive-thrus are a part of daily life and McDonald’s more than most — why avoid when you can make fast food work for you? Eric BVD – stock.adobe.com

And while the Golden Arches might seem like more of a hindrance than a help in the battle against excess pounds informed diners don’t have to be afraid to visit one of the world’s most ubiquitous restaurants — they just have to know how to order from the menu.

By using the same rules you’d use anywhere else — yes to lean proteins yes to veggies and don’t overeat — you’d be amazed how well you can do one expert explained.

Dietitian Kristen Carli owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness shared her go-to order with the fast food experts at Eat This Not That! — here are her picks for the best lunch order at McDonald’s for weight loss.

What to order at McDonald’s when you’re trying to lose weight

Keep it simple with a classic all-beef hamburger hold the high-calorie frills. McDonald's

“The best lunch order for weight loss is the McDonald’s Classic Burger with a side of apple slices and an unsweetened iced tea” Carli wrote.

“Opting for a basic burger such as a McDonald’s hamburger or cheeseburger provides protein and some carbohydrates without excess calories from cheese or mayo” she said.

“Choosing apple slices as a side adds fiber and natural sweetness without added sugars or fat. Selecting unsweetened tea keeps your drink calorie-free and helps you stay hydrated. This meal provides a great balance of protein carbohydrates and fiber which can help keep you satisfied while managing your calorie intake” the pro explained.

The meal tops off at just 250 calories believe it or not and packs a healthy 12 grams of protein — what Carli calls “your BFF for weight loss” and the “superhero of nutrients” for the way it fills you up helping you to avoid eating snacks between meals.

The apple slices instead of fries — and the unsweet tea instead of soda — makes this meal seem downright healthy.

Just make sure not to load the hamburger up with cheese and mayo and the like Carli warned — content yourself with onions pickle and ketchup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzExL3VjbGEtcHJvdGVzdHMtcG9saWNlLWluYWN0aW9uLWZpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Violence at UCLA protest raged for hours before police stepped in,"Faculty had raised alarms in the days before the attack on pro-Palestinian protesters. That night one witness called emergency services 11 times before police intervened.

Despite warnings of violence at UCLA police didn’t step in for over 3 hours

Late on April 30 Sean Tabibian called 911 to say police were needed urgently at the University of California at Los Angeles. “All hell had broken loose” Tabibian recalled in an interview. Masked agitators were attacking pro-Palestinian protesters on a campus quad video footage shows and a team of hired security guards had retreated.

The call at 11:09 p.m. was the first of 11 that Tabibian made to police that night as the violence escalated according to his cellphone’s call log. Other witnesses called 911 as well records show.

“They said they were responding” said Tabibian a local business executive and UCLA alumnus who was near campus around the time commotion erupted at the encampment and who said he was concerned that protesters had been discriminating against Jewish students. “They kept saying they’re responding they’re responding.”

While a small UCLA patrol could be seen in footage briefly early on law enforcement agencies did not move in to stop the violence until 3 hours and 34 minutes after Tabibian’s first 911 call a Washington Post examination has found — a delay that prolonged one of the most violent altercations since pro-Palestinian protesters began setting up encampments on college campuses across the country this spring.

The examination — based on evidence including more than 200 videos emergency radio transmissions text messages and interviews with more than a dozen witnesses — illuminates the stakes for university and local officials as they decide if and when to call police to deal with pro-Palestinian encampments. Elsewhere police have been accused of using heavy-handed tactics but at UCLA where university policy discourages calling police preemptively campus police as well as the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol are facing scrutiny for their hands-off approach that night.

It’s not clear why police waited so long to respond. But in the hours before they took action at least 16 people were visibly injured the majority of them pro-Palestinian including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.

The protesters occasionally fought back. People on both sides sprayed their opponents with chemical irritants at least 48 times — in some instances in the face at close range. Unconfirmed reports of a gunshot on campus and a man armed with a knife were relayed to officers over radio recordings show.

As the violence raged some police remained stationed at a hastily convened command post near the encampment while others assembled in formation closer to the violence but held back for an hour video shows. Authorities did not report making any arrests and a review by The Post of video footage found no indication attackers were detained.

Law enforcement’s tepid response on April 30 contrasts starkly with their aggressive maneuvers the following night when officers in riot gear some firing projectiles swiftly dismantled the UCLA camp and arrested 210 people for refusing to leave.

The Post’s examination also found that faculty had raised concerns for days about harassment of pro-Palestinian activists and physical violence directed at people in the protest encampment raising questions about whether the school should have had more police on hand to prevent an altercation.

Skip to end of carousel College protests over Gaza war Waves of antiwar protests are spreading across colleges campuses with growing police arrests as graduation season approaches. See the universities where protests are intensifying Are you a college student? Tell us about protests on your campus (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) End of carousel The college is typically policed by its own small force and university officials must ask outside departments for extra help when they determine it’s needed. UCLA follows a systemwide University of California policy “not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community” a spokeswoman said in a statement last month after protesters established their encampment. While LAPD would not answer questions about when they were summoned a senior UCLA official told a colleague that the college had asked LAPD for assistance by around 11:30 p.m. on the night of the attack according to text messages obtained by The Post. The California Highway Patrol has said UCLA requested its help an hour later at 12:30 a.m. UCLA police chief John Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that when he got to campus shortly before midnight he saw 19 officers from campus police the LAPD and three other local police departments but an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small to step in. It was not until about 1:30 a.m. that officers began staging with campus police in a parking lot near the encampment video shows. CHP confirmed the time UCLA requested its help but did not respond to further questions. In an unsigned email LAPD told The Post “The department is looking into its involvement on campus along with other law enforcement agencies and a detailed report is being completed.” Campus police referred questions to UCLA. A spokesperson for UCLA did not respond to requests for comment. UCLA and LAPD have said they are now jointly investigating perpetrators of the April 30 attack and that they have asked the FBI for help. Michael V. Drake the president of the University of California system has requested an external investigation of the university’s response that night. Mounting concerns On April 25 as protests emerged at universities nationwide over Israel’s war in Gaza students at UCLA’s Westwood campus began building a tent encampment on Dickson Plaza an open tree-lined quad in front of the college’s Royce Hall theater. Their demands to college leaders included calling for a cease-fire divesting from companies tied to Israel’s war effort and boycotting Israeli universities. Over the next several days videos show counterprotesters faced off with pro-Palestinian demonstrators. According to protesters they repeatedly tried to enter the encampment.

UCLA asked for assistance in policing the demonstrations from the wider University of California police system on April 25 and April 26 but then canceled those requests Wade Stern the president of the University of California’s police union told The Post. The cancellations first reported by the Los Angeles Times were frustrating Stern said. “Every cop wants to go and help” he said. “We all want to be there.”

Concerns about students’ safety mounted among some faculty ahead of a pro-Israeli counterprotest planned for April 28 and permitted by university officials. In a phone call on April 27 Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck assured Randall Kuhn a public health professor that counterprotesters did not want to “pick a fight” and that UCLA was stationing dozens of hired security guards around the encampment including 30 ready “to help address any provocations or potential attacks” according to an email Kuhn sent to colleagues summarizing Beck’s remarks. Beck referred questions to a UCLA spokesman.

On April 28 counterprotesters erected a massive TV screen to blast footage of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas at the protesters. UCLA’s police force was bolstered that day by additional officers from other University of California campuses. Still when an assault occurred they were outmanned and sought additional help from several local police departments according to a timeline compiled by police union officials.

By the next night tensions were rising again. Videos show a small group of agitators taunting people in the pro-Palestinian encampment. Police later separated fights between the two sides protesters said in interviews.

Hours later UCLA again asked for help from other UC police departments. But none was able to send reinforcements as they were monitoring protests on their own campuses according to the union timeline.

The attack

Agitators gathered outside the encampment the following day. Recordings posted on social media showed protesters refusing entry to a Jewish student who identified as a Zionist and a mother complaining to UCLA that Jewish students were being blocked from accessing a library.

At 2:35 p.m. Danielle Carr an assistant professor at UCLA’s Institute for Society and Genetics wrote an email seeking to sound an alarm about “truly unbelievable” aggression against protesters during the pro-Israeli counterprotest two days earlier. “I know that many faculty are wondering what the administration plans to do to protect our students” Carr wrote to an office responsible for handling complaints of sexual violence and harassment.

By the evening a large crowd had gathered outside the protest camp. One man was draped in an Israeli flag and others wore hoodies with slogans demanding the return of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. At 10:48 p.m. counterprotesters moved closer to the encampment’s southern barricades and blared “Harbu Darbu” — an Israeli wartime anthem calling for retribution for Oct. 7. Suddenly they rushed forward and started pulling metal fences away from security guards stationed at the perimeter of the encampment.

The guards were from Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) which contracts with UCLA and specializes in crowd control at sporting events and concerts and a subsidiary. While some CSC guards attempted to push back attackers others stood aside.

“There are too many!” one of the security guards said recordings show. Another shouted “CSC pack it up!” as fellow guards walked away. CSC did not respond to questions from The Post.

The agitators pushed past the fencing and started ripping down plywood barriers on the perimeter of the camp’s south and north sides. Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to hold their line.

Calls for help

When Tabibian the business executive placed his first 911 call at 11:09 p.m. he connected with a dispatcher and they spoke for 21 seconds. “I believe I told him that people were getting hurt — they needed to get over here and shut this down” Tabibian told The Post noting that it was difficult to differentiate between each of his 11 calls. Tabibian blamed pro-Palestinian protesters for provoking the chaos.

At 11:13 p.m. two UCLA patrol cars and an ambulance arrived near a UCLA campus police car that an observer said had been there all day. A third arrives shortly after. At least four officers stepped out of their cars and were soon surrounded by counterprotesters some shouting “Shut it down!” in an apparent reference to the encampment. One man was ushered to the ambulance and at 11:19 p.m. the three police cars and ambulance pulled away.

Reports of injuries rolled in. At 11:31 p.m. a fire department dispatcher asked an ambulance stationed nearby to respond to an injury at the college.

Kuhn the public health professor texted Beck the vice chancellor about his growing concern. Beck assured him that LAPD had been summoned.

Violence continues

Moments later a counterprotester lit a firework and lobbed it over the encampment perimeter. It exploded inside the encampment to terrified screams.

The lack of police intervention frustrated witnesses. Jeremy López who supported the protest called 911 at 12:28 a.m. to report that students were being beaten. “The operator said ‘Yes we know already’ and hung up” López later told The Post.

Carr the assistant professor who had warned of potential violence arrived at the plaza a few minutes later and encountered what looked to her like a war zone. Students were sprawled on the ground some bleeding from their faces. Others were reeling from eye pain caused by irritants.

The violence continued “for hours and hours with nobody stepping in” said Bharat Venkat an associate professor. “I thought a student would be killed.”

A mob surrounded two pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had stepped outside of the encampment. While one was hit with a wooden stick the crowd rained punches on the other. He was later recorded receiving treatment from volunteer medics his face covered in blood.

At 12:32 a.m. a man on LAPD radio said they “might want to launch a UCLA unit” according to a review of radio communications archived by the platform Broadcastify. Seconds later an officer said he was at UCLA’s Murphy Hall — close to the violence — along with four other units. But no LAPD personnel were seen taking action in available video footage of the area.

After 1 a.m. police reported over radio that an “MFF” — mobile field force — and a helicopter had been requested at the college and officers were told that the incident was “code three” meaning they should use lights and sirens.

But over the subsequent hour the address of the temporary command post was misstated over radio confusing some officers.

People calling police continued to receive dismissive responses. “Didn’t you already call?” an operator said when a woman called UCLA police at 1:33 a.m. video shows. “I already told you we’re handling the situation. You can’t continue calling unless you have an emergency.”

Police emerge

Throughout the evening police vehicles had gathered on the outskirts of campus but the first mass of police visible in footage reviewed by The Post was a line of about 30 CHP officers that began to form at 1:43 a.m. Another row of officers in black lined up behind them. They did not advance.

At 2:17 a.m. counterprotesters rushed the encampment barricade physically assaulting protesters including slamming a plank of wood on someone’s head and spraying an irritant. Officers stood about 200 feet away. None moved to stop the violence the video shows.

Nearly an hour after they assembled in line and nearly four hours after the attack began officers from CHP and LAPD began slowly moving in formation toward Dickson Plaza at 2:43 a.m.

By 3:10 a.m. police had separated the majority of attackers from the pro-Palestinian protesters. But law enforcement did not arrest or appear to question the attackers instead granting them an exit route away from the camp according to video.

“There have only been a couple times in my life where I’ve had trouble understanding what’s real and what’s maybe a nightmare and this was definitely one of them” Nicholas Shapiro an assistant professor and a former EMT who helped treat injured students later told The Post.

Shapiro arrived home with dark stains on his fingers and palms.

“Surreal” he texted a group of professor friends at 3:47 a.m. “to be ending the night cleaning a student’s blood off my hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1sYXRlLWZlZXMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi1jZnBiL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzExL2J1c2luZXNzL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWxhdGUtZmVlcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLWNmcGI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge blocks Biden administration rule capping credit card late fees at $8,"New York CNN —

A federal judge in Fort Worth Texas on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.

US District Judge Mark T. Pittman an appointee of former President Donald Trump granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.

These organizations led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule which was set to go into effect Tuesday would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32 the CFPB estimated.

A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.

“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”

The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.

“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week” said Chuck Bell advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”

The rule first proposed in February 2023 is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.

The new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt according to the CFPB.

The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers especially millennials and those with lower incomes have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.

The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.

According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3RvcC5jb20vcHJpbmNlLWdlb3JnZXMtY291bnR5LzIwMjQvMDUvMS1raWxsZWQtaW4tc2hvb3RpbmctYXQtbWdtLXJlc29ydC1hbmQtY2FzaW5vLWluLXByaW5jZS1nZW9yZ2VzLWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 killed in shooting at MGM Resort and Casino in Prince George’s Co.,"A man was killed in a shooting at MGM Resort and Casino in Oxon Hill in Prince George's County Maryland early Saturday morning.

Leading counter drone solution company Dedrone announced a Series C financing round led by Axon the global leader in connected public safety technologies.

The counter drone space has had a banner year: Dedrone says that they have sold more than 1000 sensors and have expanded their capabilities to be able to cover more than 200 different drone types.

“Drone detection and tracking is highly complex and we are seeing more and more instances of drones being used for nefarious purposes including the first known drone-based terrorist attack on U.S. soil last year” said Aaditya Devarakonda CEO of Dedrone. “This investment demonstrates clear validation of Dedrone’s technology and team. Axon is a tremendous strategic partner for delivering airspace security to the public safety sector.”

Dedrone’s solution is used by the governments of four G-7 nations nine U.S. federal agencies including the Department of Defense and internationally by more than 65 critical infrastructure sites 20 airports 50 correctional facilities and 10 Fortune 500 companies.

“The drone economy is flourishing and Dedrone is very much at the heart of it providing critical protection to organizations around the world and keeping communities safe” said Rick Smith founder and CEO of Axon. “Axon is proud to support Dedrone’s solution as it offers unmatched technology in airspace security.”

Counter drone solutions have steadily grown in importance and sophistication as the commercial drone industry expands. The December 2018 interference with air traffic at Gatwick airport which cost the U.K. government millions and stranded holiday travelers brought home the need for reliable solutions to detect identify and mitigate unauthorized drones.

Dedrone’s solution includes software comprehensive AI/ML-based sensor fusion and detection identification and tracking capabilities mitigation functionality and advanced data analytics.

Axon is a leader in public safety systems including smart weapons and body cameras. Axon “launched its end-to-end drone solution Axon Air in 2018 which delivers secure wireless live streaming integrated evidence management and program management to improve operational efficiency and outcomes for public safety agencies and the communities they serve” says the press release.

“At Axon we are dedicated to leveraging technology to improve safety. Our existing Axon Air program is a great example of putting the latest in drone technology to work for good in the hands of responsible agencies” said Aydin Ghajar General Manager of Axon Air. “We chose to invest in Dedrone because of our shared commitment to deliver reliable robust airspace security that ensures public safety.”

Under Nakhate’s watch Bank of America has helped Indian entities raise more than $60 billion over the past decade. And in the past one year or so she has made the bank the go-to banker for unicorns and for foreign investors looking to invest in the Indian market—she facilitated Facebook’s $5.7-billion investment in Reliance Jio last year.

The details of what happened are contained in a federal case where the government is seeking to seize a Bank of America check for $16893.86.

In an affidavit detailing the government’s reasons for seizing the money Derek MacDonald a special agent for the United States Secret Service said authorities believe the money was part of a COVID relief fraud scam.

On July 12 a woman and her daughter went to the Barnstable Police Department to report a scam. The mother explained her daughter is mentally disabled and discovered that PPP loan funds had been deposited into her Bank of America account.

The daughter however never applied for the loan.

The funds which equaled $16893.86 were placed in a check. The mother and daughter brought the check to the police station and handed it over to investigators.

MacDonald and Barnstable Police Detective Steven Barrette who is part of the USSS New England Cyber Fraud Task Force interviewed the mother and daughter in mid-July.

The daughter told investigators “that she was communicating with an individual she met online who she believed was the actor Vin Diesel” records said.

The scammer and the woman spoke via Google Hangouts and through email.

Eventually the scammer had the woman provide her banking information and a picture of her driver’s license. The woman believed she was helping a charity run by the famous actor.

The woman then noticed nearly $17000 appeared in her bank account one day. The woman told her mother that the deposit was odd and she never applied for a PPP loan the secret agent wrote.

At one point the woman also received a voicemail from a person pretending to be a manager asking for the money.

The investigators were allowed to review the online communications between the woman and the scammer and believed she was tricked during what is commonly known as a romance scam.

Federal investigators discovered the woman’s information was used to file for a PPP loan for a food service contractor business and the money was intended to be used for payroll costs. Investigators records show traced information back to Texas.

Authorities now want a judge to allow the federal government to take back the money. The affidavit does not describe any details about who they think committed the fraud as the investigation is ongoing.

Jo Ann Hardesty was sued by Bank of America last month for allegedly owing more than $16000 on two defaulted credit card accounts. She had previously faced a lawsuit from a second creditor over $4400 in unpaid debt in a case that has since been resolved The Oregonian reported.

'WOKE' RETAILERS WHO ASKED CONGRESS FOR HELP AMID SMASH-AND-GRABS SUPPORTED LEFT-WING POLICE REFORMS

""I understand my personal debt may cause concern since I am one of five commissioners voting on our city budget"" Hardesty told The Oregonian in a statement. ""I ask to be judged on my three years as an elected city commissioner.""

Hardesty who is running for a second term next year called herself a ""budget hawk"" when it comes to public matters but that she neglected her personal finances despite earning more than $125000 a year.

""I have been an excellent steward of public dollars and that is what Portlanders elected me to do"" she told The Oregonian.

""When I ran for City Council in 2018 like many working people I was reliant on a credit card and built up debt. I live alone without help and put all of myself into my work at the City"" Hardesty said in a statement to KGW. ""Sometimes that means I neglect to take care of personal matters. I tried to work out a payment plan before with this debt that didn’t work out and intend to pay this off.""

Hardesty reportedly raised more than $500000 for her city commission campaign.

Hardesty has been an early outspoken advocate of the defund the police movement since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis more than a year ago. Like many U.S. cities Portland has set a new record for homicides in 2021.

On Monday she filed a $5 million lawsuit against the Portland Police Association and its former president a Portland Police Bureau officer and the city of Portland for their alleged roles in the leak of information that falsely implicated her in a hit-and-run crash.

The Portland City Attorney’s Office signed a $50000 contract last week with Bullard Law a Portland-based firm to defend the city against Hardesty’s claims Willamette Week reported."

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

Viator drummed on Disincarnate's 1993 sole album Dreams Of The Carrion Kind (headed up by former Obituary Death and Testament guitarist James Murphy) and played keyboards on Acid Bath's 1996 record Paegan Terrorism Tactics.

News of Viator's death comes from a post by Murphy. We wish Viator's friends and family all the best at this time.

""RIP Disincarnate drummer Tommy Viator pictured here to the far left in 1993"" wrote Murphy. ""I have no idea what happened I just know that he is gone.

""Tommy was a key element to the band's sound with a drumming style all his own… he helped make the Dreams of the Carrion Kind album heavy as hell without a single blast beat at least not as that technique is known today. He was wearing my leather in this pic I don't really remember why.

""We just spoke back at the beginning of April and he seemed to be in good spirits and having some positive musical activities and plans with musicians local to him near his home in Louisiana. I'm glad we had that conversation and I'm very glad that I let him know that I appreciated him at the end of it. I would've said so much more if I had known but we never know."""

That sequence equalled Forest’s best since 2016 with Johnson completing a second-half comeback that had been started by captain Lewis Grabban who scored his 10th goal from the penalty spot after Keane Lewis-Potter had fired the Tigers in front.

The triumph moved Forest one point outside the play-off places.

Earlier Steve Cooper’s men brimming with confidence were on the front foot from the first whistle with Jordi Osei-Tutu particularly prominent during the opening exchanges.

A left-wing raid by the on-loan Arsenal wing-back led to the afternoon’s first chance but Grabban miscued his volley when given a free shot on Nathan Baxter’s goal at the far post.

Grabban went closer with his next opportunity guiding the deftest of flicks just wide of Baxter’s near post after James Garner swung a low free-kick into the six-yard box from the right flank.

The hosts continued to dominate as Johnson exchanged passes with Djed Spence but after he was given a shooting chance by the latter’s delightful back heel the 20-year-old Wales international dragged across the face of goal.

Just past the half-hour mark centre-back Joe Worrall then charged on to a square pass and fired a first-time effort just over.

Hull eventually mustered their first attempt of the contest in the 35th minute but Greg Docherty’s deflected edge-of-the-box strike was routinely gathered by Brice Samba.

Malik Wilks’ free-kick was more threatening as it brushed the side-netting and with Forest seemingly unsettled by an injury to Osei-Tutu that necessitated a tactical reshuffle the improving Tigers went in front two minutes before the break.

A diagonal ball from the right by Sean McLoughlin caught Spence napping for the home side and Lewis-Potter stole in to surge towards goal and beat Samba with a firm eight-yard shot.

Lewis-Potter might even have grabbed a second goal in first-half stoppage time when he rose unmarked to meet George Honeyman’s corner but headed just wide of the near post.

A shell-shocked Forest did rally a little before the interval with substitute Alex Mighten tiptoeing his way across the byline to send in a cross that Grabban diverted towards goal but the ex-Norwich striker could not extend Baxter unduly.

Cooper’s men were back in the ascendancy though after the restart with Baxter at full stretch to claw away Philip Zinckernagel’s looping header from Spence’s right-wing delivery.

In the 51st minute a positive burst into the box by Mighten was then halted by Honeyman’s lunge and referee John Busby pointed to the spot.

Grabban had to wait four minutes while Mighten received treatment for an injury that forced him off but showed immaculate mental strength to firmly find Baxter’s bottom-right corner from the spot.

At the other end Lewis-Potter’s low drive lacked the conviction to trouble Samba but Grabban turned provider as Forest surged into a 72nd-minute lead.

The 33-year-old forward charged down the right wing before sending in a deep cross that Johnson expertly collected before keeping his cool to steer an eight-yard effort into Baxter’s bottom-left corner.

Hull refused to surrender with Samba needing to palm away a Lewis-Potter cross that threatened to drop below his crossbar and with six minutes of stoppage time displayed away boss Grant McCann’s protests at supposed time-wasting by Forest earned him a yellow card.

McCann then looked on in frustration as Docherty lifted a good opportunity over and Callum Elder’s downward header was smothered by Samba meaning a spirited Hull’s own six-match unbeaten run came to an end.",,,,,,,,,

Warren Buffett once evaded an attempt to kidnap and hold him for ransom. The incident woke him up to the risks of being rich and famous spurred him to invest in heavy-duty security and surveillance equipment and may explain why he doesn't pinch pennies when it comes to his personal security.

Buffett's decades of shrewd stock purchases and savvy business deals were paying off handsomely by the mid-1980s author Alice Schroeder wrote in ""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life."" Forbes included the investor in its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans for the first time in 1985 and Buffett was one of only 14 billionaires in the rankings.

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO now firmly in the public eye soon became a target for criminals. Two men one armed with a chrome-plated replica of a .45 handgun turned up at Buffett's office building in Omaha Nebraska in 1987 Schroeder wrote.

The pair planned to abduct the investor and demand $100000 for his safe return — the equivalent of $245000 today.

Security guards and the police foiled the plot but the incident rattled Buffett and those around him. While the Berkshire chief rejected the idea of a personal bodyguard as a constraint on his privacy and freedom he did have a security camera and a 300-pound metal door installed to safeguard his office Schroeder said.

Buffett's memory of the gun-wielding kidnapper might explain why Berkshire has spent an average of $339000 a year on his personal and home security since 2008 according to company filings. The notoriously frugal investor has happily collected a $100000 annual salary for more than 40 years but he hasn't skimped on keeping himself safe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc21vaW5lc3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIxLzEyLzE4L2Nhc2V5cy1idXlzLTQwLXBpbG90LWxvY2F0aW9ucy1rZW50dWNreS1hbmQtdGVubmVzc2VlLzg5NTMwNzkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey's buys 40 Pilot locations in Kentucky and Tennessee,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.desmoinesregister.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/money/2021/12/18/caseys-buys-40-pilot-locations-kentucky-and-tennessee/8953079002/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002265373F1D0>, 'Connection to www.desmoinesregister.com timed out.

It shows that more than one-third of the return in the S&P 500 this year has come from just 5 stocks.

Some investors become concerned when they see statistics like this.

It’s all a house of cards.

What happens when these companies take a dive?

This isn’t healthy market behavior.

Stocks are detached from reality.

Sure if and when the biggest stocks fall the market will likely fall as well. That’s just how the stock market is constructed.

But it actually makes sense these companies would have such an outsized impact on returns since they have an outsized impact on fundamentals.

After hearing Michael and me on Animal Spirits discuss how the biggest companies are carrying the index this year Pranav Ghai from CalcBench sent me some research to show why it’s justified that the market is so top-heavy.

Here’s what he did:

Took the profits numbers from 2016-2021 by calendar year for every company in the S&P 500.

Sorted those companies from most to least profitable.

Took the top 25 companies in terms of net income and compared their profits to market cap weights in the index.

Compared the top 25 names each year to the remaining stocks in the S&P.

This is the result:

Each year since 2016 the 25 biggest companies have produced even more profits than their weighting in the S&P 500.

Not only are the 25 biggest companies becoming larger relative to the index but so are their fundamentals. In 2020 the top 25 names made up 37% of the index but 56% of the profits!

So far this year the 25 most profitable companies make up 42% of the S&P 500 and 46% of the net income.

You can shake your head at how big these companies are getting but they are big for a reason. The fundamentals more than back up their market caps.

For example through the end of the third quarter of 2021 Apple makes up a little more than 6% of the index but also brought in around 6% of the profits. Google made up 4.5% of the index and 4.3% of net income. Facebook (sorry I’m not calling it Meta) had a 2.4% weighting with 2.5% of profits.

The numbers don’t always match up so neatly1 but these companies sit on the throne for a reason. They have become such a large part of the overall market because their fundamentals have been so strong.

As certain segments of the market have been getting crushed of late it may feel like it’s only huge tech stocks that are doing well but that’s just not the case.

In fact 85% of S&P 500 companies have positive returns this year.

The S&P is now up 26% on the year. It certainly helps that Apple (+31%) Microsoft (+47%) and Google (+65%) are all having strong years.

But 48% of all stocks in the index are up by more than 26% this year. Nearly three-quarters of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 10% or more this year.

Interestingly enough the equal-weighted S&P 500 is also up 26% this year just like the market-cap weighted version.

The mid cap index is up 20% this year. The energy sector is up more than 50%. Financials have climbed 36%. Small cap value stocks are up 24%.

It’s not just big tech stocks soaring. It just feels like that because these stocks are now so important to the overall market.

And there is a reason they are so big and important.

They’ve earned their place at the top of the mountain.

But these aren’t the only stocks rising this year. It just feels that way.

Dick Schulze started hunting around for a business opportunity.

The billionaire founder of Best Buy who is now 80 years old homed in on the travel industry which he saw ""turned upside down"" and figured there must be some good deals to be had.

""Cruise ships are being dry-docked all over airplanes are being parked all over hotels are being either shut down or closed all over"" Schulze said on a recent sunny day in his office in Naples Fla. where he now lives. ""I said 'There's got to be some value.'""

He found what he was looking for on the hard-to-reach island of Anguilla in the Caribbean — a 180-room luxury resort that needed some sprucing up after being damaged by Hurricane Irma in 2017.

Last week the rebranded Aurora Anguilla Resort & Golf Club had its grand reopening after Schulze had a hydroponic farm a solar array and a desalination plant rebuilt. The golf course which is also being reconstructed and expanded will open in phases in the first half of next year.

Rooms start around $750 a night suites around $1000 villas around $3000 and private residences around $4600.

""I don't need the money"" Schulze said. ""It's the satisfaction you get from succeeding — taking something that's underperforming and turning it into something that performs.""

Schulze remains chairman emeritus and the largest individual shareholder in Richfield-based Best Buy which he started in 1966 and led until 2002. His nearly 10% stake is worth more than $2 billion.

Schulze admits he had never heard of Anguilla which is a British overseas territory and initially confused it with Antigua a bigger and better-known destination that's also in the Lesser Antilles.

American Airlines this month began twice-weekly flights to Anguilla from Miami. But with no other direct flights from the U.S. and with many visitors often taking a ferry across from St. Martin Schulze created a fleet of four 50-passenger planes to fly resort guests in from New York Miami and Ft. Myers Fla.

The flights are being operated through Best Jets International a St. Paul-based private air charter and aircraft management company that Schulze has owned for many years.

Schulze began dabbling in the hotel space a couple years ago when he bought the Westin Edina Galleria hotel after an old friend called him up and asked if he would be interested in it. Weeks later the pandemic hit and sent occupancy at the hotel from 80% to 6%.

But with his deep pockets the hotel came through the downturn and according to Schulze kept all of the staff on the payroll. He said that's what got the wheels turning in his head looking for other opportunities in the space.

In Anguilla the resort's staff has nearly doubled to 580 under Schulze he said. He's taken care to make sure that each part of the experience is top-notch down to the front-desk staff learning guests' names and groundskeepers greeting them.

""It's kind of my quest to see how different hospitality is from retail"" Schulze said. ""And I'm finding out that it's different. But it's still guest comes first. Just like it is in retail where the customer comes first.""

At age 26 Schulze opened a stereo shop in St. Paul called the Sound of Music which he financed with his personal savings and by taking out a second mortgage on his family's home. From that humble beginning he built Best Buy into one of the nation's largest sellers of consumer electronics.

As chairman emeritus he has no official duties but stays in fairly regular contact with company executives. He has nothing but praise for Best Buy CEO Corie Barry and the rest of the management team.

""I think she's doing a great job"" he said.

Schulze comes back to Minnesota several weeks out of the year. Many staff members of his foundation and family office work out of a building in Edina.

With a net worth of $4.5 billion according to Forbes Schulze has committed to giving a decent chunk of his wealth to charitable purposes. He has pledged to give $1 billion to his namesake foundation and is about halfway to reaching that mark.

Every year the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation gives tens of millions of dollars to groups in Minnesota and Florida in areas such as education health and medicine and social services.

When he visits Schulze also usually meets with students and administrators at the University of St. Thomas a school he initially enrolled in as a young man but ended up leaving to serve in the Air National Guard instead.

He donated $50 million to the school more than a decade ago to help set up the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship. That was important to him because he has often said that if he had gotten a college degree he might have avoided many of the mistakes he made in his career.

Entrepreneurship is now the university's eighth-largest major. One-fourth of the undergraduates at St. Thomas take at least one entrepreneurship course.

""He always says to students that entrepreneurship is for people who want to take their destinies in their own hands"" said Laura Dunham associate dean of the Schulze School. ""He's definitely somebody who has lived that.""

The resort in Anguilla was built two decades ago by Leandro Rizzuto founder of Conair Corp. and the Cuisinart brand. When he first visited Schulze was smitten by the location and the beauty of the place. But he found its food to be ""awful.""

Food is a crucial part of the experience for him so the resort has brought in a renowned chef and changed up the menus. The new restaurant at the golf course — a steakhouse — was named ""D Richards"" after Schulze.

Schulze is planning to get started on a waterpark next year which will include a lazy river and giant water slides. He also wants to add courts for sand volleyball pickleball tennis basketball and bocce ball.

His project list is much longer: a 500-seat stadium for live entertainment an archery range miniature golf course rock-climbing walls horse-riding and food trucks.

""Is it a little bit of Disney?"" Schulze asked unprompted. ""Yeah maybe a little bit of Disney. Only from the perspective of high-quality service and entertainment. If people just have fun when they get there that's what makes me feel good. That's what I'm trying to do.""

He hopes the resort will be so popular that it will need more rooms. With more than 300 acres there is plenty of space to expand.

Taking risks since he opened that stereo shop in St. Paul Schulze said he doesn't see the resort as one of his big bets.

""It's a slam dunk"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU1NTU5My9tYWNoLWUtZXYtYmVzdC1idXkv0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly9pbnNpZGVldnMuY29tL25ld3MvNTU1NTkzL21hY2gtZS1ldi1iZXN0LWJ1eS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Ford Mustang Mach-E Is KBB's 'EV Best Buy Of 2022',"The Ford Mustang Mach-E has been chosen as Kelly Blue Book's ""EV Best Buy Of 2022"". The automotive research company praised the Mach-E both for its day-to-day usability and performance. KBB even dubbed it the ""Sports Car Of SUVs"" thanks to its ability to combine practicality and driver enjoyment.

KBB outlined the Mach-E's easygoing suspension and lack of road noise as two key positives. They also praised its interior layout and legroom. Another positive was all the equipment that comes as standard. Even the entry-level $43895 Mach-E Select still gets synthetic leather dual-zone climate control and Ford Co-Pilot360 at no extra cost.

Other positives KBB mentioned were the Mach-E's high safety score and tech. Equally its range of up to 306 miles per charge (RWD with the Extended-Range Battery) is among the best in class. They also felt when you factor in the tax credit the Mach-E represents good value for money:

""$43895 may seem like a high board to dive from at first but the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E is well worth it. The Ford EV SUV is eligible for the maximum $7500 federal EV tax credit plus any other state and local incentives in your area.

NewsDesk @infectiousdiseasenews

On Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alerted clinical laboratory staff and health care providers that false reactivity or “false-positive” Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR; non-treponemal) test results when using the Bio-Rad Laboratories BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit can occur in some people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.

Based on information provided by the manufacturer Bio-Rad Laboratories RPR false reactivity was observed in some individuals for at least five months following a COVID-19 vaccination.

More research is underway to determine the extent of the issue. It is not known if other RPR tests may be affected similarly. Treponemal testing for syphilis such as Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) and treponemal immunoassays do not appear to be impacted by this issue.

Health care providers should make patients who received a reactive RPR result using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR test kit aware that they may need to be retested for syphilis with another test to confirm results.

COVID-19 vaccines do not cause syphilis. Health care providers should continue to strongly encourage patients to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and be aware of their patients’ vaccination status when interpreting reactive RPR test results.

The FDA recommends clinical laboratory staff and health care providers who use the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit should do the following:

Perform confirmatory testing for all reactive results. Use of only one type of serologic test (non-treponemal or treponemal) for people without an earlier syphilis diagnosis is insufficient for diagnosis.

In individuals with a negative treponemal test (e.g. TP-PA) but reactive RPR result on the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit repeat RPR testing is not necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated.

For people previously treated for syphilis in whom treponemal tests will remain persistently positive and who are being evaluated for possible new syphilis infection a reactive RPR should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s medical history (including COVID-19 vaccination status) risk factors and clinical presentation. In individuals previously treated for syphilis who received a COVID-19 vaccine and whose clinical presentation and epidemiologic considerations do not support syphilis re-infection confirm reactive RPR results performed on the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR platform using a different RPR test. Sequential serologic tests for a patient should be performed using the same testing method (VDRL or RPR) preferably by the same laboratory to minimize variability. However if the previously used RPR test was the BioPlex 2200 a RPR test from a different manufacturer should be used at this time.

Ensure your patients are aware of the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and are aware that the COVID-19 vaccines do not cause syphilis. Millions of people in the United States have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect your patients from COVID-19 and it may also protect the people around them. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety.

Encourage patients who are sexually active to get tested for sexually transmitted infections to protect their health.

Why Did My Doctor Order This Lab Test? What is an RPR?

Background

A person is considered positive for syphilis when the non-treponemal (RPR) and treponemal antibody tests (e.g. TP-PA or enzyme immunoassay) are both reactive. The Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit is a multiplex test used to detect (IgG/IgM) antibodies to Treponema pallidum (the bacteria that causes syphilis) and non-treponemal reagin antibodies in human serum or plasma.

The clinical community is aware that false-reactive RPR test results have been observed in people with systemic infections unrelated to syphilis such as tuberculosis rickettsial diseases and endocarditis. False reactive RPR testing has been previously observed following immunization (specifically following smallpox vaccine). False reactivity with RPR can also occur during pregnancy.

In the video Little Mili reached out to grab a toy an instinctive gesture for most 19-month-old infants but an impossible feat for someone afflicted with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); were it not for a drug developed by a company based in Cambridge Massachusetts.

On November 16 Du Jia a 32-year-old mother in the Guangdong provincial city of Maoming posted a video of her son nicknamed Little Mili on China’s Little Red Book social media platform.

But the cost for such improvement was gigantic.

SCMP Graphics

Nusinersen sold under the brand Sprinraza is the world’s first therapy approved for treating SMA a genetic disease afflicting an estimated 30000 people in China characterised by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brainstem that can result in severe progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.

The drug approved in more than 50 countries used to cost 700000 yuan (US$110000) for each dose when it was launched in China in 2019 for a treatment course that lasts a lifetime. Most SMA victims like Du a housewife cannot afford the drug.

“The drug [producer] the [charity group] China Primary Healthcare Foundation and the municipal government provided us with some support cutting the price to 700000 yuan for six jabs in the first year but it was still a heavy burden” she said. “We tried everything [taking] overdrafts from 11 credit cards and borrowing money from our parents to scrap together 700000 yuan. We used to worry about raising the next 700000 yuan because this is a lifelong mediation for Little Mili.”

Good news came on December 3 when China’s National Health Security Administration released its 2021 National Reimbursement Drugs List (NRDL) a compilation of medicines that are eligible for coverage by the nation’s health insurance schemes. Sprinraza was among 74 drugs that were added to this year’s list after Biogen agreed to slash prices by 95 per cent. Biogen was unavailable for comment.

The NRDL a compilation that has existed for two decades is part of the Chinese government’s plan to make health care affordable and accessible under the country’s socialist principles. Formally adopted in 2017 as an annual list it forms part of the “ common prosperity” aspiration pledged by President Xi Jinping.

What is the effect of having drugs included in China's NRDL? Product name Therapeutic Areas NRDL Inclusion Price Cut % Revenue Growth of NRDL Inclusion YOY % Perjeta Breast Cancer 73.6 318 Tagrisso Lung Cancer 71 187 Xalkori Lung Cancer 70.8 127.1 Alecensa Lung Cancer 69.5 88.2 Tasigna Blood Cancer 67.2 46.3 Elunate Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 67 88.2 Inlyta Kidney Cancer 66.4 121 Imbruvica Blood Cancer 65.1 142.5 Votrient Kidney Cancer 65 90.7 Herceptin Breast Cancer 64.8 48.2 Sutent Gastrointestinal Stomach Tumor 64.6 48.2 Tyvyt Hodgkin's Disease 64.1 125 Avastin Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 62.8 77 Lynparza Ovarian Cancer 61.9 149.4 Zukadia Lung Cancer 60.4 307 Erbitux Colorectal head and neck Cancer 59.9 128.3 Humira Rheumatoid Arthritis Psoriatic Arthritis etc 59.2 111.4 Remicade Rheumatoid Arthritis Psoriatic Arthritis etc 59.1 (-) 18.7 Xeljanz Rheumatoid Arthritis Psoriatic Arthritis etc 57.7 69.9 Foslodex Breast Cancer 56 116.5 Source: Simon-Kucher & partners

Drugs that make it to the list are eligible for between 70 per cent and up to 80 per cent of their prices paid for by insurance shifting the cost burden from the patients to the public sector. To get on the list though price cuts are often required at source.

“Many pharmaceutical companies [aspire] to have their medicines added to the drug list as it helps overcome the multiple access hurdles in one fell swoop improve patient affordability and enhance competitive positioning in many cases” said Bruce Liu partner at strategy consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners. “If you take revenue growth after NRDL as an indicator of success most worked out.”

The latest NRDL announced earlier this month for implementation on January 1 comprises 2860 drugs with 1486 Western drugs and 1374 traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

Out of the 74 additions this year seven drugs were added directly while the remaining 67 medicines for treating a range of maladies from infectious diseases to radiocontrast agents oncology and rare diseases made it via rounds of price negotiations. On average prices were reduced by 61.7 per cent before drugs could make it to the list.

Besides Biogen’s Sprinraza several drugs by Chinese pharmaceutical developers like Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine BeiGene and RemeGen made it to the 2021 list Credit Suisse said.

Most branded therapies see a sharp surge in sales volume and revenue after their inclusion in the coveted NRDL even if they must slash prices to get there according to analysts such as Liu of Simon-Kucher & Partners and Clarivate China.

The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche doubled the sales of its Herceptin breast-and-stomach cancer treatment and tripled the sales of its Avastin cancer drug in the two years after their NRDL inclusion in 2017 even after 60 per cent price cuts in each case Clarivate China said in its In-Depth report released in June.

The evidence shows that steep discounts are worth the while to get on China’s NRDL in a price-elastic market where the median disposable income was 13120 yuan in the urban areas – even with a 12 per cent increase from a year earlier – and less than half of that in the rural villages.

China’s pharmaceutical market has been constantly growing in recent years. It is estimated to reach US$161.8 billion by 2023 for a 30 per cent share of the global market compared with 11 per cent in 2018 according to Daxue Consulting’s January report.

But the world’s second-largest pharmaceutical market is highly fragmented with about 5000 manufacturers – mostly small and medium enterprises – competing in multiple niches across the spectrum of pharmacology. That has created the room for global pharmaceutical giants like Novartis Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca to grab significant shares of the market the report said.

To give domestic drug producers a leg up the National Health Services is prodding them to add their products to the NRDL.

“The NRDL has made it possible for novel therapies to gain wide reach across the country for diseases with large patient populations” said Christian Hogg Chief Executive Officer of HutchMed (China) Limited which develops targeted therapies and immunotherapies for treating cancer and immunological diseases.

“We see more domestic companies competing with multinational [producers] in innovative drug research and development and their footprint in the NRDL has increased with every update” said Hogg of HutchMed whose shares are traded in Hong Kong London and Nasdaq.

The company has two drugs on the list. The first added last year was Elunate used for treating metastatic colorectal cancer. It was China’s third-most diagnosed form of cancer last year with annual new cases estimated at between 450000 and 550000. The second drug to make it was Sulanda used for treating advanced non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours included in this year’s list.

HutchMed declined to say how much it had to cut prices to make it on the list. It and its partner AstraZeneca decided to hold out with Orpathys withholding the inclusion of the drug for treating non-small cell lung cancer on the NRDL. HutchMed did not elaborate on the exclusion.

Orpathys is not the only holdout. Fosun Kite Biotechnology and JW Therapeutics two producers of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapies refrained from joining the NRDL even after their medicines were approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration. Their products are for treating adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

“The price of this therapy in other countries is about 2.5 million yuan” said a spokesperson at Fosun-Kite Biotechnology the venture between Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical and California-based Kite Pharma. “Our product [priced at 1.2 million yuan] is a completely innovative product and its price is the lowest in the world.”

JW Therapeutics a venture between the US drug giant Bristol Myer Squibb’s Juno Therapeutics unit and China’s Wuxi App Tech is in no rush to join the NRDL after missing the inclusion deadline by two months.

“We are delighted if our product is to be reimbursed by the government; this is on our wish list” said James Li Chairman and CEO at JW Therapeutics.

The crux of the matter may be the gaps in expectations and forecasts between current prices and sales and future prospects. That puts the NRDL’s regulator and drug producers at odds in their negotiations for inclusion.

“Innovative drugs have bigger risks and cell therapy is a new concept that saves lives but is expensive to make” Li said. “Investors expect returns from their investments so we have to be profitable in certain years and we can’t cut prices at the current stage. There is a disconnect between the government’s targeted price and what we are able to offer.”

To be sure the NRDL is not the sole entry point into China’s market as private insurance and support from municipal governments are stepping up to provide access to drugs analysts said.

“NRDL is a voluntary process as companies may opt out if [they think] the business case does not make sense” said Liu of Simon-Kucher & Partners. “In most cases it does though.”

Fosun and JW Therapeutics said they have cooperated with private insurers that include their products into their schemes.

Local governments also provide patients with customised medical insurance schemes in conjunction with insurance companies. That supplements the reimbursements for medical expenses for illnesses analysts said.

In Suzhou in eastern China’s Jiangsu province the local medical insurance includes CAR-T therapy drug protection which is reimbursable up to 70 per cent according to Fosun. Local authorities can consider widening the pool of capital in the system for better access JW Therapeutics’ Li said.

For Du Jia in Maoming the financial burden on her son’s SMA jabs has mostly eased with the inclusion of Sprinraza on the list of insured drugs.

“The drug will now be sold at 33000 yuan per jab” she said. “With coverage by public insurance I expect to pay 30000 yuan to 40000 yuan a year for the three jabs that Little Mili needs in the second year of treatment. I really want to thank the government for putting the drug on the list.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

With this in mind we look at a suburban Cork estate built over fifty years ago as a model for housing that seems especially pertinent today.

A New Model

Dundanion Court in Blackrock Cork was completed in 1968 on an elevated site east of the old railway line near Dundanion House built for Sir Thomas Deane to his own design in 1832. This modernist scheme consists of two courtyards of thirty-six two-storey flat-roofed homes grouped in stepped rows of six and four and set in a cul-de-sac. At the time this compact plan had twice the density of its contemporaries with approximately twenty units per acre. The houses are brick infilled with glass and black-painted cedar sheeting. Plumbing rainwater drainpipes and wiring are located within the fabric of the houses to keep the facades free of clutter. Each house has dual access either from 'front' doors in the courtyards or via rear walled-in gardens.

Modernist Tour

The estate was devised by architect Neil Hegarty a mere two years after completing his architectural degree in 1962 having been begun in 1956 as a student of the first class of the School of Architecture in the Crawford School of Art. After graduation Hegarty spent six weeks travelling around the United States on a whistle-stop tour of Modernist architectural sites. Hegarty learned from several housing schemes he experienced first-hand such as Lafayette Park (1959) in Detroit by German American architect Mies van der Rohe with Ludwig Hilberseimer as landscaper or Chicago’s Hyde Park A&B (1962) by I.M. Pei with Harry Weese & Associates. Also influential were the designs of Eric Lyons of SPAN Developments Ltd in the UK. Hegarty and his young family lived in No.1 Dundanion Court for the first ten years of the scheme’s existence enjoying the architect’s perk of the largest rear garden.

Around the Hearth

The terraces consist of full-height aluminium-framed glazing framed by yellow brickwork; each unit on an 8-ft (2.4m) square module. Inside each house the exposed yellow brickwork continues with timber-clad ceilings and flush plywood doors with aluminium door handles and Carrara marble slabs inset into kitchen worktops. Hegarty wanted materials equal in quality to those he saw on his North American tour. The open-plan dual-aspect ground floor (living area dining area and galley kitchen) flows around a central brick hearth with fair face concrete bands along with a beautifully simple black limestone mantelpiece. Adjacent to the hearth is an open-riser teak staircase. Keeping the circulation space to a minimum created an extremely efficient internal layout. The expansive glazing at the front and rear elevations floods the ground floor with natural light during the day. A concrete floor slab allows for underfloor heating avoiding the need for separate radiators that might impede the flow of the space. Upstairs Hegarty cleverly laid out four timber-floored bedrooms with an en-suite off the master bedroom and a family bathroom that was originally carpeted.

Social Engineering

Hegarty narrowed the footpath through the grounds so that two people could not pass each other without exchanging greetings. Additionally he paired front doors under porches providing another opportunity for neighbourly conversation. The courtyards always had a sense of security due to the passive surveillance provided by the glazed facades and net curtains. Neil Hegarty’s son Tom who chose to bring up his own family in the estate describes this feeling as ‘entering everyone’s living room’. The communal gardens meant children were never without playmates and every resident was invited to courtyard birthday parties. From the kitchen parents can view their children at front and rear. Hegarty explained that the courtyards did not accommodate the mature trees but rather the trees dictated the plan of the scheme. Their foliage still softens the crisp edges of the terraces. This is architecture that builds community around shared green courtyards. Accordingly homeowners must leave their vehicles at the periphery.

Challenging the Rules

Dundanion was not just a new approach to communal housing design but also how to fund and maintain it. A solicitor with an interest in co-operative housing initiated the project and drew up the long lease (700 years at £400 per year) for this two-and-a-quarter acre private estate. Neil Hegarty's father set up Daniel Hegarty & Sons Ltd to build the site. The company would act as both developer and the ground landlords for maintenance of the estate. The lease would include stipulations such as the necessity to use net curtains (as were originally provided by the developer) to create the unity of the place.

Where’s Your Courtyard?

One test of a housing estate is how the residents inhabit the space and make it their own as individuals and as community members. Certainly with each house in private ownership the external appearance of Dundanion Court has changed over the past fifty years. The resident’s association wants the estate to evolve and supports these well-intentioned modifications while conserving the intentions inherent in its design. The influence of this design upon its inhabitants is best demonstrated perhaps by one resident’s young daughter who when visiting friends often exclaims to her hosts 'where’s your courtyard?’

In 1992 Cork City Council granted Dundanion Court Listed Building Status and the entire scheme is an Architectural Conservation Area in its 2015 City Development Plan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmV3c2ZvdXIuaWUvMjAyMS8xMi90aGUtdGhyZWUtZ29vZC1mcmlkYXlzLW1lbW9yaWVzLW9mLWFuLWlyaXNoLW9jdG9nZW5hcmlhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Three Good Fridays: Memories of an Irish Octogenarian « News Four,"Eoin Meegan



In this book Octogenarian Bill Morrison reminisces over his long and colourful life first growing up in Blackrock then as a citizen of the world and now as a resident of Ballsbridge (he claims the book came about in order to kill the boredom during Covid). Particularly striking are the memories of a happy childhood in Blackrock in an Ireland that has long since vanished. Such as visiting Findlaters store with its intriguing pneumatic pulley system where the money was whizzed up to the counting house upstairs and the change brought back by the same seemingly mysterious process much to the enjoyment and awe of the children at the time. Also the old Regent Cinema where admission set you back a staggering sixpence! as well as travelling on the old double-decker tram – long predating the sleek modern Luas. Memories too of swimming and diving both at which Bill excelled and long summer days spent at the Blackrock Baths. And let’s not forget such eccentricities as playing marbles and conkers (today’s kids would have to google that to see what it meant!) and road tennis with a rope substituted for the net! One particular chapter tells the story of Bill’s marriage to the beautiful singer Mona Baptiste from Trinidad now sadly deceased penned by his friend Bill Hern.

The Three Good Fridays is as much a social history of the times as a description of a personal childhood. The story of the early working life and subsequent business career reflects the changes the country went through during those same exciting times with Ireland’s international growth in diplomacy politics commerce and cultural influence both domestically and internationally. Throughout his very successful career with Bord Failte Bill travelled all over the world and rubbed shoulders with such luminaries as Tony Bennett Al Martino Stéphane Grapelli Bill Cosby Maeve Binchy Nuala O Faolain Jim Sheridan Niall Brophy Paul O’Connell Donal Walsh Olympians Eddie Heron and Paddy Kavanagh and the greatest of them all Muhammad Ali. But fame and success rested easy on Bill and the book is full of lovely stories and anecdotes (including the “who’s Mona” story). The title comes about from events that happened on three separate Good Fridays (all falling on April 10th) Bill’s birth in 1936 the signing of the Good Friday Agreement 1989 and his 84th birthday in 2020 which he spent (or as he says ‘endured’) cocooning in splendid isolation. A very enjoyable read.

The major difference between 3D printing and 4D printing is the use of materials to be printed and the printing facility. This emerging technology combines printing techniques with high-level material science software and engineering. 4D printing is about bringing this extra dimension to materials. It is more about transforming the already created 3D printed object over some time. They change their shape depending on our requirements. 4D technology uses commercial 3D printers such as Polyjet printers the input can be hydrogel or shape memory polymer. There are many advantages of 4D printing such as size-changing new materials added; the objects can shrink unfold and compress which are made with 4D printing. One potential application of 4D printing in the real world would be a self-repair piping system that can be of great use in all sectors. This technology can be used in biotechnology medicine and manufacturing too. The printing holds exciting potential for the way products are manufactured today.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcmtiZW8uaWUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2Fub3RoZXItcG9wdWxhci1jb3JrLWJhci1kZWNpZGVzLTIyNTA0Njc20gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29ya2Jlby5pZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYW5vdGhlci1wb3B1bGFyLWNvcmstYmFyLWRlY2lkZXMtMjI1MDQ2NzYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another popular Cork bar decides to close following latest Covid restrictions announcement,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Another well-known bar close to Cork city centre has decided it needs to close its doors following the latest announcement of Covid restrictions.

The Venue Bar in Blackrock has confirmed that it will ""reluctantly"" shut for the month of January due to the decreased number of hours they will be allowed to operate.

From Sunday midnight all restaurants and bars excluding takeaways or delivery services must close at 8 pm.

Following this announcement the popular venue situated between Pairc Ui Chaoimh and Pairc Ui Rinn took to Twitter to inform its loyal customers that they will remain open for them for Christmas but unfortunately they will need to close in January.

""We will stay open until 2nd January to look after our customers but will reluctantly close for the month of January. A dreadful blow to both business staff & customers"" said The Venue Bars.

This comes hot on the heels of the owner of Paddy the Farmers in Cork city recently informing its own customers of the ""sad news"" that they will ""not be able to open this weekend.""

""We put the safety of our staff and customers first and foremost so we made the choice to remain closed to protect everyone"" they posted on their Facebook page.

""From everyone in Paddys we urge everyone to look after themselves so we can all spend time with our families this Christmas stay safe"" they added.

With the Christmas season coming up soon people are joining together to contribute to the world around them in any way they can. Charity events often come up during this season of giving and often projects like Operation Christmas Child have become a holiday tradition for local churches.

On Saturday morning Nov. 6 Worsham Baptist Church hosted a packing party for Operation Christmas Child. Church members of all ages came out to participate and support the cause.

Lorraine Smith the central drop off coordinator for the Operation Christmas Child South Central Virginia Team said the group would like to bring on more volunteers in the future.

“We’d love to build up our team members” she said “because all we have now are prayer team members and central drop off which is myself and then the two other drop off team members the one in Keysville and one in Asheville.”

Operation Christmas Child is a specific project of Samaritan’s Purse dedicated to delivering shoeboxes containing gifts and necessities such as toys school supplies and hygiene products to children in need. Samaritan’s Purse is based in Boone North Carolina and works with over 100 countries to provide aid to people in need.

Smith further explained how the team’s area coordinator resigned several years ago so that position is not being filled at this time. Also Smith encourages the idea of expanding the team to get more people involved.

“We have plenty so we need to encourage others to give and to help them to know this is a tangible demonstration of God’s love when the children receive these gifts” she said.

Members of the team consist of people who work with churches citizens in the community and logistics. In addition there are those who work in media support for social media newspaper and radio as well as the prayer team and student relations with the colleges and other schools in the area.

Heritage Baptist Church is the central drop off location for Operation Christmas Child in Farmville. There are two other drop off locations in the area: Ash Camp Baptist Church in Keysville and Blackstone Presbyterian Church in Blackstone. Worsham and Heritage are two of around 35 churches in the area that participate in Operation Christmas Child.

The project itself has been in existence since 1993. Franklin Graham the president and CEO of Samaritan’s Purse helped start the Christmas operation by asking his friend the late Pastor Ross Rhoads for assistance in the request made for shoeboxes to be filled with gifts for children in Bosnia since the country was at war at the time.

Since the project began 188 million children across 170 countries have received shoebox gifts through the program.

On the global scale the goal for this year is to bring gifts to 9.7 million children. Last year’s goal was 9.1 million. For Worsham Baptist Church the goal was to fill up 200 shoeboxes and 100 back packs.

Smith mentioned how the senior members of her own church community at Heritage chose to give to this project online.

Due to the pandemic Operation Christmas Child promoted the idea of building a box online this year in addition to in-person work. People could go to the organization’s website to build a box and pick the different items to go in it for the price of $25 which included the $9 processing and shipping fee.

“It’s very extensive” Smith remarked “Lots and lots of volunteers are involved.”

Worsham has been collecting items for this all year long. Being involved with this project also reminds local church members the real reason for the season.

“I think it’s important. In scripture we are commanded to do (events like Operation Christmas Child) to go into all the world.” Smith said “That’s really what (the purpose is).”

The boxes don’t just bring gifts to children Smith explained.

“It’s not just the shoebox gift. It’s sharing the gospel with the children. They have an opportunity to hear the gospel of Jesus” she said.

Operation Christmas Child spreads the gospel of Christianity at the various distribution events held across the world where children receive messages about Jesus while getting their shoebox gifts.

It does a lot too to the people giving” Smith added. “It enlarges your heart when you give to others and share.”

Charity projects like this also build closer connections within smaller communities like the churches in Farmville.

“Your impact is so much greater when you’re joining with other churches and not just out there trying to do it yourself. You couldn’t do it alone. We need each other” Smith admitted.

The collection week for Operation Christmas Child always happens the week before Thanksgiving each year. The National Shoebox Collection Week occurred Nov. 15- 22 this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25ld3MubmV0L2xpdmluZy9mYW1pbHkvZXgtZXRpcXVldHRlLXBhcnRuZXJzLXNpY2stY2hpbGQtY29tZXMtYmVmb3JlLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZV84Nzc3YTA1ZS01NzhhLTExZWMtYjhhOS02N2IyYzI0YzI1MmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-etiquette: Partner's sick child comes before everything,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Okaz/Saudi Gazette



MAKKAH — The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced that there has been no service added on the Eatmarna application to book an appointment to kiss the Black Stone (Al-Hajar Al-Aswad).



The ministry clarified that the prospect of allowing the ritual of kissing the Black Stone is subject to the regulations of the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques. “There will also be no permission to enter inside the Holy Kaaba” the ministry sources said.



Earlier the ministry announced that there would be options on the Eatmarna and Tawakkalna applications to book appointment for kissing the Black Stone touching the Yemeni Corner (Al-Rukn Al-Yamaani) and performing prayer at Hijr Ismail a portion of which is considered as part of the Holy Kaaba.



The ministry had said the arrangement was made after adding a new icon titled “Tawaf” on the Eatmarna and Tawakkalna applications to facilitate booking appointment for the performance of tawaf for non-Umrah performers.



The ministry also made some procedures in this regard with putting forward a proposal to take advantage of the barriers available in the mataf (circumambulating area around the Holy Kaaba) to organize entry and exit so as to enable pilgrims and other worshipers to kiss the Black Stone. According to the ministry sources the proposal had been referred to the competent authorities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYW1tb25uZXdzLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlLzU1MjY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can't go to Mecca?

Can't go to Mecca? Saudi Arabia brings hajj to the metaverse with 'VR Black Stone' experience

Ammon News - The Hajar Aswad or Black Stone is laid into one corner of the Kaaba located in Mecca's Great Mosque the holiest site in Islam.



Saudi Arabia has brought Islam's holiest site into the metaverse age with a new initiative on Monday that allows Muslims to virtually view a religiously revered rock in Mecca from their homes.



The Hajr Aswad or Black Stone is laid into one corner of the Kaaba located in Mecca's Great Mosque the holiest site in Islam.



The ""Virtual Black Stone Initiative"" allows Muslims to ""experience the Hajr Aswad virtually prior to the pilgrimage to Makkah [Mecca]"" according to the official Haramain Facebook account.



The Haramain - translating as ""the two sanctuaries"" - refers to Mecca and Medina and specifically the two holy mosques there.



The general president of the mosques Abdul-Rahman Al-Sudais whose department is separate from but collaborates with the Haramain organisation inaugurated the programme on Monday according to his office's website.



The initiative is a project of the Exhibitions and Museums Affairs Agency working with Umm Al-Qura University.



While inaugurating the programme Al-Sudais said it was crucial to have a simulation that engages not only sight and hearing but also touch and smell.



The general president said the Mecca and Medina mosques contain much historic and Islamic heritage adding that this should be digitised for everyone.



Several other university and government officials were present at the opening event. These include Turki bin Suleiman Al-Amro who is head of the institute at Umm Al-Qura University that was involved in creating the Virtual Black Stone project.



It was not immediately clear how and when the public will have access to virtual reality technology.

Date: December 18 2021

By Justin Hayward Simple Flying

Supersonic travel has been on hold since the retirement of Concorde in 2003. The European-built Concorde and the Russian Tupolev Tu-144 have been the only commercial supersonic aircraft to date. With US companies leading the way for the next supersonic revival you may wonder where they were the first time around. There was a plan for a US-built supersonic jet – the Boeing 2707 – but it was canceled before any were built.

The first supersonic race

Operating flagship routes with British Airways and Air France from 1976 until 2003 Concorde is undoubtedly the most well-known supersonic commercial aircraft. It was not the only attempt at supersonic flight at that time though.

Supersonic travel first took place in October 1947 with Chuck Yeager flying the US Air Force Bell X-1 at Mach 1.06. This started the race to develop supersonic aircraft – both for military and commercial use. The United States Soviet Union and Europe all began projects during the 1950s and 1960s to develop supersonic commercial aircraft. Two of these resulted in aircraft that flew for many years though with more limited commercial success than initially hoped for.

Concorde took its first flight in 1969 and entered service in 1976 jointly with British Airways and Air France. Although it only ever flew with these two airlines this was not the original intention. Before launch Concorde had around 100 options from 18 airlines. These were all canceled (mostly by 1975).

The Soviet Union launched the Tupolev Tu-144 two months before Concorde. It offered an impressive specification – a slightly higher speed (Mach 2.15 compared to 2.04) higher capacity (140 compared to 100) and a slightly longer range. It was very costly and inefficient to operate though mainly as it relied on afterburners for the whole flight. It only ever operated with Aeroflot and only on one route between Moscow and Almaty. It left passenger service in 1978 but still flew until 1999.

The Boeing 2707

The US also had ambitions for supersonic aircraft. There was a proposal from Lockheed (amongst others) for the L-2000 jet with a delta wing design. This lost out to Boeing’s proposal for the Super Sonic Transport (SST) aircraft or Boeing 2707.

It was planned as a much larger aircraft than Concorde with a capacity of 292 in two classes. It also pushed the range further and took speed up to approximately Mach 3.

It was popular too with 122 orders from 26 airlines. This included plenty of orders from the leading US airlines – Pan American ordered 15 aircraft TWA ordered 12 United Airlines six Northwest six American Airlines six Continental Airlines three and Delta Air Lines three. Several of these airlines also had orders for Concorde. Had it worked out Boeing’s aircraft would have been much more prevalent in the US though.

Canceling the 2707 project

As we know the Boeing 2707 was never to take to the skies despite its higher order volume. In May 1971 the US House of Representatives voted to stop funding the project. Boeing had not even completed the prototypes it was working on. Concorde of course went on to be built so why was Boeing’s project canceled? Several factors came together to influence the decision.

A significant factor was the ongoing economic crisis and the rising price of oil at the time. The SST (like Concorde and the Tu-144) was fuel-hungry and there were strong fears about the viability of this. Alongside this there had also been environmental opposition. The noise pollution and sonic boom also remained a problem. This was never solved and hampered Concorde’s success in the US too. It remains a challenge today with new supersonic developments.

Commercial factors played into it as well. Boeing was also developing the 747 at the time and this offered a different market proposition of higher capacity and lower fares. Challenges in the design of the 2707 such as the need for lighter materials did not affect the 747.

Influence on Concorde

Many of these factors also influenced Concorde’s limited success. In the years after the Boeing 2707 was canceled all options for Concorde apart from those of British Airways and Air France were canceled. Lack of confidence following Boeing’s cancellation certainly influenced this. As did the crash of a Tupolev Tu-144 aircraft while demonstrating at the Paris Air Show in 1973. Airline attention shifted to the high capacity and low fare model with aircraft like the 747 becoming a huge success.

Concorde was a flagship offering for the two airlines it flew with – something the US airlines never had. It never returned its massive investment cost so perhaps the US government was right to drop the 2707. Concorde did make a profit for the operating airlines however. In a good year British Airways made £30-50m ($37-61m) profit from Concorde; Air France slightly less.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLXNlbGxzLWl0cy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcnBsYW5lcy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtZm9yLTEwMG0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing sells its Commercial Airplanes headquarters for $100M | HeraldNet.com,"The sale completes a series of large real estate divestments by Boeing this year.

SEATTLE — Boeing has finalized the sale of its Commercial Airplanes headquarters campus at Longacres which was put on the market in April.

The buyer is Unico Properties a subsidiary of a Seattle-based private equity real estate investment firm. The company did not disclose the purchase price but a person with knowledge of the sale gave it as $100 million.

In a news release Unico said it bought the site for its location near commuter rail the Southcenter mall and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as a “transit-oriented investment.”

The sale completes a series of large real estate divestments by Boeing this year driven by its need to drastically slash costs during the pandemic-driven aviation downturn.

The site included not only the headquarters building but another building that once housed Boeing’s state-of-the-art training facilities and full-flight simulators. Pilots and airline mechanics used to come there from around the globe before Boeing moved the simulators to Miami and dispersed the training to other facilities.

Boeing bought the site 31 years ago displacing the former Longacres horse-racing track.

The lavish flight training center opened first and cost $65 million to build according to former Boeing Vice President Peter Morton who finalized the details.

Morton installed a $17000 piano and commissioned music by Seattle-based pianist and composer Walt Wagner to be played at the opening ceremony in 1995.

Earlier this year Boeing had already sold off:

* Seven office park buildings in Bellevue’s Eastgate area for $139 million.

* A large warehouse adjacent to Paine Field airport in Everett for $35 million.

* 310 acres of unused land next to its Frederickson manufacturing facility for $200 million.

* And just last week two office buildings in Renton for $12 million.

For the Bellevue offices Boeing agreed to a lease to continue occupying that office park for two years.

The only Boeing property left on the market is a tiny quarter-acre parcel on Beacon Hill the site of a former radio tower.

Ned Carner Unico chief investment officer in a statement touted the 150-acre Longacre campus’s “enviable connectivity and a park-like setting” which includes two large ponds an apple orchard and a 1-mile walking trail.

It encompasses 962800 commercial square feet between two large office buildings as well as a day care facility and about 2150 parking stalls. It’s located 3 miles from the Tukwila Transit Center with next-stop access to downtown Seattle.

Unico plans capital investments to refresh and modernize the properties the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjkzOTE0My9jYXJkaW5hbHMtdGFrZS1vZmYtZm9yLWRldHJvaXQtaW4tbmV3bHktYm91Z2h0LWJvZWluZy03NzctdGVhbS1wbGFuZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cardinals take off for Detroit in newly bought Boeing 777 team plane,"The Arizona Cardinals will be in a new whip when they take off for Detroit to play the Lions on Sunday.

The team announced on Friday that the organization has purchased a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft.

Arizona will transport players coaches support staff and equipment on the 288-passenger plane.

Of those seats 166 are oversized for extra comfort and features 28 first-class pods with lie-down seats and 48 business class seats.

The Cardinals join the New England Patriots as the only NFL franchises to buy a plane for team travel.

“It is a major undertaking every time we travel for a game” Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said in a press release.

“This aircraft will not only provide major convenience but also maximum comfort for our players when getting them to and from road games. Every NFL team is looking for advantages wherever possible and we think this will certainly provide one.”

The Boeing 777 is powered by Rolls Royce Trent engines and has a normal cruise speed of 645 mph according to the release.

It also has a maximum altitude of 43100 feet can travel 8625 miles without refueling and has a maximum takeoff weight of 656000 pounds.

The Cardinals have to travel 22186 miles in the air over the course of the 2021 season. Only five NFL teams are required to go further this season.

Over the last five years Arizona has traveled the seventh-most in the league with 109277 air miles.

Dreamliner 787 plane with AirEuropa livery moves past the company's final assembly facility in North Charleston South Carolina U.S. on Tuesday Dec. 6 2016.

Italian prosecutors on Saturday ordered the seizure of components intended for the production of Boeing 787 aircrafts that they said failed to meet the technical specifications sought by the customer.

The titanium and aluminum parts were seized by finance police at a plant of Italian aerospace and defense group Leonardo in Grottaglie in southern Italy.

The components were produced by two small firms Processi Speciali and Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS) which were previously sub-suppliers to Leonardo. Both these sub-suppliers are under investigation said the prosecutors from the southeastern city of Brindisi who ordered the seizure.

The administrator for Processi Speciali declined to comment. The court-appointed administrator for MPS was not immediately available for comment.

Eight unnamed individuals are also under investigation for fraud and for actions threatening the safety of air transport.

The prosecutors said in a statement their investigations suggested the parts ""were produced using titanium and aluminum of different quality and origin from those prescribed by the customer and in breach of the relevant technical specifications"".

The prosecutors said the parts were intended ""for the production of sections 44 and 46 of the Boeing 787 fuselages"".

Leonardo which filed a lawsuit on Dec. 7 is the injured party in the criminal and administrative investigations the statement said.

Leonardo declined to comment.

A spokesperson for Boeing in Italy declined to comment.

In October Boeing said that some 787 Dreamliner parts supplied by MPS were improperly manufactured over the past three years.

At that time the U.S. aircraft manufacturer said the quality issue did not affect the immediate safety of flights adding it had notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Undelivered planes will be reworked and planes already carrying passengers will go through a review process with Boeing and receive FAA confirmation Boeing said.

In November three sources told Reuters that prosecutors in southern Italy had opened an investigation into the supply of parts to Boeing by MPS."

Initial plans suggest that sixty percent of the space will be for laboratory use and forty percent for offices. The final composition of the floor area can be determined by the future tenants. At full build out as many as 2055 employees could be working from the campus.

While 927 vehicles is a lot for a transit-adjacent project such as this there could have been more. Because the project is located within the Millbrae Station Area Specific Plan (MSASP) the developer is able to add fewer than the minimum required parking. Otherwise the city code would require a minimum of 1244 parking stalls to be included.

WRNS Studio is the design architect BKF Engineers is the civil engineer and Bionic is the landscape architect.

At ground level stone walls establish the foundation enhancing the visual scale of the office buildings. Meanwhile the upper levels will be set back from the street to break up the massing create visual interest and produce open-air balconies for the office employees.

A linked paseo will run through the site offering a requiem of landscaped open space with public seating and gathering space. A plaza at the corner of Millbrae Avenue and Rollins Road will link the paseo to the open space establishing the welcoming connection to the mixed-use Gateway at Millbrae Station project rising across the street.

Each office building will rise six floors with generous ceiling heights pushing the rooftop to be 100 feet above grade. Each design will be of a similar style with curtain wall skin and terra cotta though distinguished by color palettes and materials used particularly the earthen-toned facade of Building Two.

The new life sciences campus will replace six existing low-slung commercial buildings and surface parking built between 1955 and 1963. The 4.7-acre property is situated between Highway 101 and El Camino Real and is across from the Millbrae station service by BART and Caltrain.

That transit station is also in a state of evolution as construction is wrapping up on The Millbrae Station Development. Led by Republic Urban Properties the over $400 million project is creating 320 market-rate homes 80 low-income homes a 164-room hotel 150000 square feet of office space and 45000 square feet of retail all beside the regional hub.

Alexandria is responsible for approximately nine million square feet across the Bay Area focusing on biotech and providing office space. As one of the nation’s largest biotech developers the company is responsible for nearly 50 million square feet. Facebook is the third-largest among its tenants nationally Moderna is the seventh-largest Uber is the ninth-largest and Roche is the tenth largest.

Alexandria is also partnered with Boston Properties to develop 1.7 million square feet in South San Francisco along Gateway Boulevard. An SFYIMBY site visit recently showed construction is underway for the 148-foot tall R&D building at 751 Gateway Boulevard.

Construction is expected to take 42 months from groundbreaking to completion. If approval can be achieved quickly the development could open as early as 2026.

Science denialism comes in many forms: climate change deniers people who are anti-vaxxers who believe COVID is a hoax that evolution isn't real and who think the Earth is flat.

With the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change creating huge challenges for humanity denying science has never been so dangerous.

So what can you do if that science denier is someone you care about — or maybe even someone in your family?

McIntyre a research fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University decided to explore this topic in a new book titled How to Talk to a Science Denier: Conversations with Flat Earthers Climate Deniers and Others Who Defy Reason.

(MIT Press/Boston University)

McIntyre spoke to Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald about how science deniers construct and defend their beliefs with evidence-based insights into how to change their minds.

Here is part of their conversation.

You write in your book that there's a common script behind all science denial reasoning and that if we know the script we can change it. So what is the script?

This script was discovered by Mark and Chris Hoofnagle and it was developed further by John Cook and Stephen Lewandowsky who are cognitive scientists and it goes like this: there are five tropes of science denial reasoning.

Every science denier cherry picks data believes in conspiracy theories engages in illogical reasoning relies on fake experts and denigrates real experts and here's my favourite: that science has to be perfect in order to be credible.

Now if you understand that script you're way ahead of the game.

There was a study in Nature Human Behavior in June of 2019 which vindicated that model. It's called technique rebuttal and I was very gratified to see that that was really the first empirical evidence to show that it could be effective in convincing science deniers to give up their beliefs.

When you say technique rebuttal what do you mean by that?

Technique rebuttal is simply to understand those five tropes and to learn how to use that to push back. So for instance somebody who claims that science has to be perfect to be credible.

Often I would say to the flat Earthers something like ""OK so you claim that you're being more scientific than the scientist?""

""Yes.""

""And your beliefs are based on evidence?""

""Yes.""

""So what evidence would it take to convince you that you were wrong?""

A man explains flat Earth theory to a fellow demonstrator at an anti-mask protest that took place in July 2020 in London England. (Hollie Adams/Getty Images)

They weren't prepared to talk about that. And my experience is that if you listen to somebody and you make it clear that you're respecting them as a person — even if you're not respecting their belief but you asked them why they believe it — they'll eventually say something that you can use.

They'll say something illogical. They'll say something that relies on a fake expert. And that can give you an opening to at least plant that seed of doubt to say ""Well wait a minute. Are all the pictures from NASA faked?""

There's sort of a general theme in the book that science deniers have a fundamental misunderstanding of how science works that the deniers may already have their conclusion before they begin and look for evidence to fit that which is backwards to the way science works.

The thing I respect the most about scientists is that they test their biases against the evidence. And by the way they can answer that question that I posed to the flat Earthers. If you ask a scientist what evidence could change your mind about hypothesis X they can tell you.

What makes a denier is not somebody who rejects the scientific consensus. It's somebody who rejects the scientific consensus and doesn't have good evidence for their beliefs and won't say what evidence would convince them to give up their beliefs.

People with anti-science beliefs are often radicalized by false content they read online. (William West/AFP via Getty Images)

That's when they're in this kind of hermetically-sealed box where the evidence can't get to them. And that's just the exact opposite of what I call the scientific attitude.

You also mentioned in the book a technique called content rebuttal. How does that work?

Well content rebuttal is another method that Betsch and Schmid talked about in their article. That's a little tougher to do because you have to actually be an expert.

If you're a climatologist and you're having a discussion with a climate denier and they're bringing up the false claim that the global temperature hasn't gone up in the last 17 years — or whatever it is they're claiming right now — you know the studies and you know the data and you can push back with content.

Former Trump-appointed NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine famously changed his mind about human fossil fuel emissions being the main driver of climate change within weeks of beginning his new job at the space agency. (Red Huber/Getty Images)

Now in that study they looked at both content rebuttal and technique rebuttal side by side and found that they were both equally effective and that there was no additive effect which is spectacular news for the allies of science because it means that even though I'm not a scientist I can go out there and be just as effective as a scientist is using content rebuttal by me using technique rebuttal.

This was the case when he talked about why he forced his way into a trade. Brown was on Jason Whitlock’s podcast “Fearless” and laid out his concerns with the Steelers and their inability to build a Super Bowl-winning squad.

“I wanted to get out of Pittsburgh because I was realizing we not going to win the Super Bowl” Brown said. “We’re not going to do anything great. How we going to do anything great? You put in your top receiver against a kid he’s a rookie. You think a rookie receiver gonna be able to take two double teams and the best guy every week? He’s not even prepared. We play football to be champions and to change the life of your family. I wanted to be a champion so I’m not trying to leave the team because of the money.”

Say what you will but Brown isn’t wrong. Head coach Mike Tomlin and the front office never got the most out of the roster and while we loved the numbers Brown put up with Ben Roethlisberger at quarterback but this group while Brown was on the team grossly underachieved.

“I would have hit him in the numbers probably” Peyton quips.

“Who cares” Caesar exclaims. “We’re all Caesars! Even Cooper he’s my favorite” Caesar says while gesturing to Peyton and Eli’s brother.

This is the second commercial the Manning family has filmed for Caesars Entertainment and it likely won’t be the last.

Denise Truscello

A true architect of Las Vegas entertainment Franco Dragone is ready to return to the Strip to surprise and delight audiences with a new brand of performance and production. This time he’s teaming up with famed illusionist and longtime Vegas headliner Criss Angel to take their collective creativity in a new direction.

Dragone may be best known for his work with Cirque du Soleil creating and directing landmark Las Vegas productions “Mystère” at Treasure Island and “O” at Bellagio — the first two Cirque shows to return to the stage this year during the pandemic. He’s also behind Celine Dion’s original residency show at Caesars Palace “A New Day” and the shuttered aquatic spectacular “Le Rêve” that ran at Wynn Las Vegas for 15 years.

“Franco is probably one of the most prolific directors in entertainment history and he certainly changed the trajectory and history of Las Vegas” Angel says. “Now we are equal partners on a course to create some more.”

Angel and Dragone first connected during the launch of “Le Rêve” and spent time together developing a show for Steve Wynn that was never realized. They reconnected last year when Angel interviewed Dragone for a web series on creativity that raised funds for out-of-work artists and performing arts workers.

“We have followed each other for a long time and we met again thanks to this initiative” Dragone says. “And Criss and I wanted to do something more together as partners and we decided to try this experience.

“I think for both of us it’s a risky time during this pandemic we are going through which is not finished so maybe we are a little bit crazy. But we’ve jumped into this project completely and it has deepened our friendship.”

The show is “Amystika” described as a prequel to Angel’s “Mindfreak” magic-based production at the Criss Angel Theater at the Planet Hollywood resort and it will run in the same room.

“It’s very interactive a visual feast but there is a story there” Angel says. “This is the first time I’m aware of in Las Vegas history where you have two shows you have to see to get the complete experience and understand the entire concept.”

Originally set to launch preview shows on December 27 “Amystika” has pushed back its opening date to March 11. The delay is expected to give the production team the time it needs to finalize the dramatic special effects stunts and technical requirements of the show. As Angel said in a statement last week “We are literally inventing the technology and special effects that are used throughout this show and that level of creativity can’t be rushed.”

The objective for the two partners behind the project has always been to push the boundaries of what is possible in live theater and present something Las Vegas audiences haven’t seen before.

“To create something new nowadays is extremely different than 15 years ago” says Dragone. “The audience can go on YouTube and see a lot of things so when they actually come to you you have to offer something that makes a difference.

“I have the impression that from time to time Las Vegas goes through transitional periods where it moves from one genre to another. It seems for a few years now everyone is using the words ‘immersive’ and ‘interactive’ and when something is trendy that means that it’s already old. Something follows an innovation and then everybody wants to compete and do the same thing. So yes we are trying to do something new but we do this with much humility and ambition and we put all of our talent experience and energy into the project.”

Both entertainment icons say they’ve truly enjoyed collaborating on “Amystika” and learned quite a bit from each other.

“Sometimes when you work with somebody you don’t know what you’re going to get” Angel says. “It has turned into something absolutely beautiful and I’ve grown so much personally and professionally. He’s such a genius at what he does and he looks at the process in a very different light that I’ve seen anybody do.”

Dragone says they are both “fully into the creation” of the show and his international theatrical background is a nice complement to Angel’s background in magic. “And he never stops. He has the energy to work day and night so it has been a very demanding experience” Dragone says. “But it’s something that we love. I have found that passion I remember in him 20 years ago when we were collaborating with Steve Wynn.”

Now that so much time has gone by since that first connection this creative duo can accomplish thing onstage today that they could only imagine back then. “Amystika” will have a blizzard that engulfs the audience Angel says and fire and wind storms unlike anything that has been presented in a Las Vegas show. The cast of the show has grown much larger than originally planned.

“There was such a wealth of talent we couldn’t say no” Angel says. “But it’s worth it because we want to do something no one is doing opening a brand-new spectacle at this time when most everybody is scared … about possibly closing down again [due to the pandemic]. No one knows what’s going to happen but we are feeling bullish and we’re setting the bar pretty high.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtY29sdW1ucy9rYXRzL3ZlZ2FzLWxvdW5nZS1sZWdlbmQtYm9iLWFuZGVyc29uLXRha2VzLW9uLWNhcm5lZ2llLWhhbGwtMjQ5OTE4NC_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWNvbHVtbnMva2F0cy92ZWdhcy1sb3VuZ2UtbGVnZW5kLWJvYi1hbmRlcnNvbi10YWtlcy1vbi1jYXJuZWdpZS1oYWxsLTI0OTkxODQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vegas lounge legend Bob Anderson takes on Carnegie Hall,"Bob Anderson has achieved the improbable bringing his Sinatra revue to New York City.

NEW YORK — The man in the tux rekindles a time so long ago. “When I was 17 it was a very good year” he sings evoking images of small-town girls and soft summer nights.

But there’s no hiding from the lights not tonight. We know where Bob Anderson is taking us to the autumn of his years. The Las Vegas lounge legend is now center stage at Carnegie Hall this Saturday night filling the hall with the voice of Frank Sinatra.

The classic Sinatra timbre rides a wave of music by a 32-piece orchestra. Anderson has been remade to look just like Sinatra the artwork from makeup designer Ron Wild. The singer wears a $3500 tux he bought just for this show. His mannerisms the cock of head and casual flip of the backhand are all there.

At times you feel Old Blue Eyes himself has inhabited Anderson’s physical being. In an age where a hologram could be created to play this show Anderson is starring in a kind of movie come to life. The singer is leading us to a Sinatra show at Circus Maximus at Caesars Palace or before then the Copa Room at the Sands.

Are we watching the autumn turn to winter tonight? It feels the culmination of Anderson’s rich career as an all-time impressionist or “interpreter” as the description has evolved.

But it’s not the end not for Bob Anderson who starred at the Top of the Dunes for a decade ending in 1985 and was a fixture on the Strip and national-TV talk shows for a generation. He and is team are convinced it is the start. Sinatra’s 106th birthday would be Dec. 12 just a night after this show but they are treating this tribute as a new adventure.

Luck Be a Lady

For Anderson’s Sinatra show Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage is without question the platform for something bigger. His production team rented the space spending at least $150000 for to pay for the venue for this one show.

In effect Anderson has turned the historic hall into a regal auditioning platform. Between a half-dozen and 10 owners and representatives of Broadway theaters arrived to check out this show formally titled “One More For The Road.”

“I want to people to know what’s happening over here” Anderson said in his hotel suite overlooking Manhattan the morning of the show. “They may think that Carnegie Hall took Bob Anderson rather than our people paying for the thing for Bob Anderson to be on that show. That is the case.”

The show was performed for members of the Nederlander Organization which controls nine theatres; and Jujamcyn Theaters which own five Broadway venues. The Shubert Organization which owns 17 theaters is reviewing film from the footage that was taped by the Carnegie crew.

And hey Anderson might turn the whole saga into a reality show. The scramble for the show to adhere to the state and venue’s pandemic policies itself would be worth an episode.

Anderson said the Carnegie Hall production was able to recoup its investment. Official numbers are 2238 tickets sold about 150 more comped — the vast majority to first responders invited to the show — in a hall seating 2804. It is easily the largest theater crowd in New York on the night of the performance.

It’s also the largest audience assembled at Carnegie Hall during COVID a stat that should stand for the foreseeable future as New York’s mass-gathering policies change by the day because of the Omircon variant surge.

Anderson’s entourage is led by primary backers and co-producers Keith Maas and Carolyn Klucha of Twin Palms Entertainment. The relationship is familial as Klucha is also Anderson’s niece.

Maas and Klucha began following Anderson in 2018 and jumped onboard as producers in September. Twin Palms teamed for the Carnegie Hall show with Bob Anderson Productions. That company received a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) which funded the Carnegie Hall show.

In addition to the production lineup headed up by Anderson along Dianne Russomanno works as business manager Stephen Eich is back as director and Patricia Dockswell as production manager. This is a tight dedicated group.

The Sinatra show has been Anderson’s passion and even artistic obsession for upwards of a decade. He can perform many impressions of course from Tony Bennett Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr. Tom Jones Johnny Mathis Bobby Darin and Nat King Cole. But it was his Sinatra interpretation that led to his run with “Frank. The Man. The Music” at Palazzo Theater. That show performed for a year on the Strip closing in November 2015 just before what would have been Sinatra’s 100th birthday.

That decision stung Anderson. He wanted to be onstage as Sinatra for No. 100. As it was he refused to allow his show to perish. He built a team to present a concert video at Avalon Hollywood theater in Los Angeles in 2017 with Todd Fisher’s production company at the helm. That footage was also sent to Broadway operators.

In December Anderson forged a partnership with Tony Award-winning theater exec Eva Price and her partner Carl Flanigan and their Maximum Entertainment Company. Price’s credits include by “On Your Feet” the Gloria and Emilio Estefan story; “Dear Evan Hansen” and the revival of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma.” She’s worked with more than 15 Broadway musicals plays and concerts and is a member of The Broadway League’s Board of Governors.

As a result Anderson’s Sinatra revival was in line for a theater with talks ongoing until COVID wiped out all Broadway shows. Carnegie Hall was Anderson’s next destination to relaunch his Sinatra musical for interested theater operators and keep this dream alive. As Anderson said “We wanted to be able to market this show as being Sinatra from Carnegie Hall. That would be a powerful selling point.”

In that regard the win was in the moment Anderson stepped onstage.

“To me having not sung as Sinatra in so long I felt good” Anderson said. “But more important I felt the audience loved it. I really felt the energy on that stage.”

Come Fly With Me

Anderson took a quartet of classic Vegas musicians to make up the core of his orchestra otherwise filled with many of New York’s finest players.

Joey Singer who spent more than a quarter century touring with Debbie Reynolds is pianist and music director. Bob Sachs whose Vegas performances date to Sam Butera and Keely Smith and who backed Wayne Newton is on bass. Bob Chmel (Frank Sinatra Jr. Pia Zadora Jerry Lewis Bob Hope and Doc Severinsen) plays drums. And a member of Sinatra royalty Danny Falcone whose father Vince was Sinatra’s bandleader for 10 years at the end of his career is on trumpet and also contracted the entire orchestra.

All are made their debut at Carnegie Hall. It’s an interesting place to knock off the rust.

“You know the history when you walk in you know that Tchaikovsky opened the room and Vladmir Horowitz played here. Everyone in the world has played here” Singer said at the show’s after-party. “There is no other place for Carnegie Hall. So yeah it’s a real thrill it’s hard to put into words what an awesome feeling it is to be here.”

Sachs said the gravity of the show did not escape him.

“It is pretty amazing that the first show we do after being off for two years is at Carnegie Hall” Sachs said. “Sometimes you wish you had an opportunity to do the show elsewhere in preparation yeah. But you know you just have to step up to the plate and do your thing. Overall I thought it was a great experience.”

Chmel said “The closest I ever came to Carnegie Hall was a town hall show here with Frank Jr. while ago so this was a first for me. I’m 78 now so it took a long time but here I be! Thank you Jesus right?”

Falcone often referred to Sinatra as “Grandpa” when he was a kid.

“I’m sitting there looking out at the audience and it’s just mind-blowing” said Falcone who has backed Celine Dion Lady Gaga on the Strip and is a member of Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns. “It was just too much. I thought the band sounded phenomenal.”

My Way

Anderson has had to make some difficult decisions about where to spend his partners’ capital. The orchestra is not positioned on risers. They sit flat onstage. Risers are expensive Anderson says $45000 to bring in and another $45000 to haul away. An advanced onstage monitor setup to help the band hear what they are playing more clearly has also been scrapped.

Of course there is no video or production effects in the show. If you are looking for LED and smoke machines ad Carnegie Hall you’re in the wrong place.

It’s entirely music and singing Anderson at the mic and Singer at the rudder.

Anderson glides into the performance seeming to feel his way around the stage. He’s working out the kinks right in front of us. He’s thinner than we remember having lost weight after his own battle with COVID several months ago (which took him out of a weekend of shows at South Point Showroom in August).

But Anderson is forever a natural showman having performed for five hours unscheduled recently at the Italian American Club’s dining-room lounge. This about a week before what was likely the most important gig of is career.

Anderson is funny that way taking a lounge gig as seriously as Carnegie Hall. Finally playing a full show as Sinatra he catches his groove about a third of the way through flying through “Get Me to the Church On Time” “Lady Is a Tramp” “My Kind of Town” “New York New York” building to the closing coupling of “That’s Life” and “My Way.”

Anderson introduces Deana Martin Dean Martin’s headlining daughter and her husband John Griffeth; and baseball legend Joe Torre from the audience. Anderson earns all of his four standing ovations from that Carnegie crowd.

And for what is next Anderson relates talks at several venues among them Mohegan Sun in Connecticut and also Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City He’s booked at Key Largo Anglers Club in Florida in March and is looking at adjacent Coral Reef Reef (a favorite of Jimmy Buffet). His current Broadway general management firm KGM is setting up meetings with Broadway reps in January.

But as always the clock is ticking and the calendar’s dates flipping for the headliner in the autumn of his years. Frank Sinatra’s contemporaries are no longer with us his original fans dwindling. Few musicians ever actually performed with him in his Las Vegas heyday. And the pandemic is not cooperating. The show is beholden to forces the showman can’t control.

But the music he says will survive for all seasons.

“I’m showing you the way he was and if you like Frank Sinatra you will know most of the songs” Anderson says. “But there will be some younger fans who will not know him they are not gonna know these songs. OK maybe they’ll learn something because this is what Frank Sinatra was all about.”

View the current offers here.

Hawaii is the destination many Americans envision when they think of vacation. It's a beautiful segment of Polynesia that those of us in the continental U.S. have the privilege of visiting without even needing a passport. Yes it's touristy — that's because it's spectacular.

Depending on when you travel airfare to Hawaii can be prohibitively expensive. But if you know the best ways to get to Hawaii using points and miles you'll be impervious to price gouging.

Let's look at one exceptional sweet spot between the West Coast and Hawaii using Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles. They're extremely easy to earn as they partner with the following transferable points programs:

By using this tactic you can stretch the rewards you earn from the best travel credit cards into multiple trips to the tiny archipelago for the price of a single trip booked through competing loyalty programs.

Why it's special

Singapore Airlines doesn't sound like it would be as relevant to the free-travel strategy of U.S. travelers as the likes of American Airlines or United.

However you can book many of the same exact award seats with Singapore Airlines miles as you can with AA or United miles. The award price can even be significantly cheaper.

For example a flight from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD) to Honolulu (HNL) on United Airlines usually costs 45000 miles round-trip in coach (though it may occasionally be cheaper). But the same exact United Airlines seat booked through Singapore Airlines will only cost 35000 miles (PDF link).

There's an even sweeter deal buried in the Singapore Airlines loyalty program for travel to Hawaii — but you must fly Alaska Airlines to get this special price.

Here (PDF link) is Singapore Airlines' award chart for Alaska Airlines flights. As you can see flights from Zone 1 (California Oregon Washington) to Zone 5 (Alaska Hawaii) cost only 12000 miles one-way in coach. That is fantastic especially considering these flights can cost hundreds of dollars.

It's worth noting that these aren't the absolute lowest prices to Hawaii. You can book flights on United Airlines via Turkish Airlines for as little as 7500 Turkish miles each way in coach. But award space isn't nearly as accessible — and Turkish Airlines miles aren't as easy to earn as Singapore Airlines miles.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

New York CNN Business —

Nearly a year ago a bunch of day traders from the fringes of the internet figured out how to beat Wall Street at its own game. Or so they thought.

Around mid-January shares of GameStop (GME) — a brick-and-mortar retailer that most analysts expected to go the way of Blockbuster — began surging fueled by a pile-on of day traders from the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit. They were doubling tripling their positions by the day chanting “diamond hands” and “to the moon” rally cries to hold onto their shares rather than cash out. The term “meme stock” sauntered into the mainstream.

Better still these amateur traders who winkingly referred to themselves as “Apes” were sticking it to the fat cats on Wall Street who’d heavily shorted GameStop. The more people tried to dismiss the Reddit crowd — Citron Research called them “the suckers at this poker game” — the more they drove up the stock squeezing the short sellers.

In the end the GameStop rally sent the stock up 1600% before coming back down to Earth. Citron meanwhile shut down its short-selling business after the episode. Melvin Capital one of Wall Street’s elite hedge funds was so financially gutted it had to be bailed out by two other firms. The Apes rejoiced. Who’s the sucker now?

It looked in the moment like David had taken down Goliath. But the giant was merely caught off guard.

The GameStop saga brief though it was marked a turning point for Wall Street. Did the Apes overthrow the establishment? No far from it. But the spectacle of the uprising was every bit as important as the result. Once GameStop caught the public’s imagination Wall Street could no longer afford to dismiss social media or the investors who congregate on it.

“Most people saw it as this revolution” says Spencer Jakab a Wall Street Journal columnist and author of a forthcoming book about the GameStop rally. “And a lot of young people are still convinced that they’re fighting some kind of virtuous fight against evil hedge funds… but basically the story is the same: If you think you’ve figured something out to beat Wall Street you probably haven’t.”

The Reddit army’s moment fizzled in early February when GameStop cratered to around $45. Those who joined late buying the stock at its peak of around $480 were left with huge losses. These days GME trades around $145 — up nearly 700% for the year but far from January’s highs.

Jaime Rogozinski the founder of WallStreetBets acknowledges that what happened with GameStop wasn’t a revolution per se but that doesn’t mean the community or the ethos that guided it — sniffing out market inefficiencies and exploiting them for profit — is dead.

“They’re little accounts but they’ve now figured out how to push a stock price even with their insignificant size” Rogozinski told CNN Business. “They’re not going to stop looking for these things.”

The original WallStreetBets page has more than doubled in size since the GME rally going from about 5 million at the end of January to over 11 million now – an explosion of popularity that’s put off some early adherents who broke off to form new more specialized investing groups on Reddit and elsewhere.

So who won David or Goliath? Maybe both.

The force of the January squeeze was powerful enough to make even the stodgiest of Wall Street elite sit up and take notice. US regulators are paying close attention too.

“You’ll be hard-pressed to find a company that has over 100% short float now right?” Rogozinski says. In other words no Wall Street firm with any sense wants to end up like Melvin a titan that was squeezed so hard by the GameStop surge it lost 53% of its fund in under a month. If you massively short a stock and run up your exposure you’re putting a target on your back.

WallStreetBets with all its crude jargon and machismo became a check on institutional investors who had perhaps gotten too cozy. Not wanting to be wrong twice firms have hired social media managers and subscribed to services that monitor social chatter. JPMorgan for one is currently testing a new tool aimed at protecting clients from losses tied to meme stocks Bloomberg reported earlier this month.

“If you don’t have a clear view of what retail is up to it feels like you’re driving partially blind” Chris Berthe JPMorgan’s global co-head of cash equities trading told Bloomberg.

For better or worse Jakab says all of this has made Wall Street even better at making money.

“I think what’s changed is that Wall Street is totally aware of what’s going on” says Jakab. “And they are not going to get caught out in the same way again. They monitor social media they’re going to be more judicious about getting exposed.”

For all the so-called Apes accomplished Jakab argues in the end it was the little guy that got hosed in the GameStop saga. His book “The Revolution That Wasn’t: GameStop Reddit and the Fleecing of Small Investors” Jakab makes the case that despite all the talk of sticking it to the Man the rally only tipped the odds further in Wall Street’s favor.

“Wall Street likes this” he told CNN Business. “Wall Street likes millions of young people who hate Wall Street putting their money on Wall Street — they don’t care if they’re hated.”

Perhaps the more significant legacy of WallStreetBets and the GME saga is cultural. Spend half a minute on the site and you quickly understand this isn’t a convention of Boomers in suits but rather a bunch of young Millennials and Gen Zers (still mostly male) talking about complicated options trades via memes and emoji.

“The best analogy that I can come up with is you’ve had these seasoned professional poker players playing this game for decades and now they’ve all had to scoot over to make room for this new player that doesn’t use the same rules” Rogozinski says. “You have somewhat of a reckless individual that has a different concept of risk and a different objective. And so these players now have to adjust their strategy.”

Listen

Rome — This week the group of seven cardinals who advise Pope Francis on Curia reform and Church affairs met in Rome.

Cardinal Oswald Gracias of Bombay (Mumbai) India has been a member of the council of cardinals (C7) since it was created by Francis at the beginning of his pontificate. The prelate spoke with Crux about the new Constitution for the Roman Curia – the Church’s central government – currently being reviewed by Pope Francis; the challenges Christians face in India with a new anti-conversion bill being debated; and the Latin American Ecclesial Assembly held in late November in which he participated as one of the “foreign” guests.

Crux: What brought you to Rome this time?

Gracias: I came for a meeting of the C7 with the Holy Father that is of the Council of Cardinals. We had meetings from Monday to Wednesday. In the past 18 months we had meetings over video conference with the Holy Father but this time he invited us to come physically. Of course with coronavirus you never know but we were able to keep 100 percent attendance.

And how was it to meet in person for the first time in 18 months?

I was personally very happy to see the pope. He seemed very healthy perhaps even in better health than the last time I had seen him. He’s had some time to rest it seems because he did not seem tired at all. He was very energetic engaged and interested in what we were suggesting.

And today it’s his birthday so as I was headed to the airport I wished him a happy birthday. I have to insist on this he was very good. And the meeting went well because having lost the past 18 20 months there was much that need to be discussed and it was good to reconnect in person because obviously it’s not the same to speak through a computer screen.

You have been working for the past several years on the new constitution for the Roman Curia. How is that coming and will we be seeing it soon?

I hope we will. We made our recommendations to the Holy Father when we presented it to him. But evidently he wants to make it his own and he is personally studying it going through it carefully. He did tell us that he liked it so there’s no real indication that he will be making any major changes to what we presented. And of course he was present during our discussions so he knows the background of every line that we put in there. But it is very clear that for him this is a very important document so he wants to study. But we have finished our job with it so we are not even revising it.

We’ve seen through the reporting of Crux contributor Nirmala Carvalho that there seems to be an uptick of anti-Christian persecution in India these days with a priest narrowly escaping an attack with a machete Hindu nationalists attacking a Catholic School and a new anti-conversion bill. Are you concerned about it?

I have to begin by saying that I have been out of India for several days already as I was in Rome for a week and before that in Mexico for four days. Therefore I really don’t have a direct knowledge of what is going on on the ground even though I have been obviously on the phone with the bishops. There seems to me that there are mainly concerns in Karnataka where the archbishop is concerned that the anti-conversion bill is primarily targeted against minorities. I will know more once I get home but the bishop has told me that there are problems and we will have to see what can be done.

Before coming to Rome you were in Mexico taking part in the Ecclesial Assembly organized by the bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean. What are your impressions of that meeting?

It was very impressive. It was different to what we are used to so I was happily surprised and learned a lot. I was very hesitant to go in the beginning but they insisted and now I am very glad that they did. It was perhaps a new way to hold an assembly and it was important to be there so that we can now reflect what can be learned from their system and imitate what they did.

It was a hybrid meeting with some 100 people present and some 900 online. It was an experiment and though it didn’t work a 100 percent it is a new way to exercise synodality and as such we have to learn from it.

They had planned it before the Synod on Synodality was announced but I think it was God preparing the road. South Americans are by far the leading Church I believe on what is synodality and lay participation in the life of the Church. I’m hoping to keep in touch with them so that we can discuss and explore different possibilities for the Universal Church.

And are you hoping to perhaps do something similar in India which as a country has a larger population than Latin America as a continent?

Certainly but realistically we might not be ready for that yet. But you know we can learn and gradually come to that. We do have some experience on this but also some limits. However it would be very good to see something like that both in India and also in the Asian conference of bishops. We will be meeting early in the new year and I will share what happened in Mexico what we learned there and discuss what we can imitate and of course what we can improved from what they did because as I said it was an experiment!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpZ2gtcmFua2luZy1hZnJpY2FuLWNhcmRpbmFsLWFsbGVnZWRseS0wMzA4NTUwMzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High-ranking African cardinal is allegedly 'fed up' offers resignation letter to the Vatican,"Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana key advisor to the Pope and the only African to head a Vatican department has abruptly offered his letter of resignation

Peter Turkson the Ghanian cardinal to the Catholic Church and the only African to head a Vatican department has abruptly offered his letter of resignation on Saturday.

Turkson has become one of the key advisors to Pope Francis on issues like climate control and social justice and some experts say he could have been a leading candidate to become the next pope which would make him the first Black pope in 1500 years.

The pope has yet to announce his acceptance of the resignation.

VATICAN CITY VATICAN – APRIL 09: Archbishop of Cape Coast Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson attends Palm Sunday Mass celebrated by Pope Francis at St. Peter’s Square on April 9 2017 in Vatican City Vatican. At the end of the mass Pope Francis condemned the terror attack on a Coptic church dedicated to St. George ‘ Mar Girgis ‘ in the city of Tanta north of Cairo which killed at least 21 people and injured nearly 60 others.

According to inside sources Turkson is reportedly “fed up” with internal disputes in the Catholic Church.

The 73-year-old heads the Dicastery for Integral Human Development which was founded in 2016 to deal with issues like peace justice and migration.

Earlier this year the Pope requested that Turkson’s department undergo an external review headed by the Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago.

If accepted Turkson’s departure would leave the Vatican with no African head of a major department.

The other African department head Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea retired in February after being appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1979.

This year has been particularly rocky for the Vatican.

Following a continuation of the clergy child sexual abuse scandal a new 2021 report alleged that more than 200000 minors were abused by the Catholic Church in France over the past seven decades. Several members of the church faced abuse charges and were forced to vacate their positions.

In June 2021 German Cardinal Reinhard Marx sent a letter of resignation as a symbol of the church’s “systemic failure” on child abuse and said that he wanted to “share the responsibility” of the mishandling of cases.

Pope Francis denied Marx’s request commanding him to continue as archbishop.

“It is urgent to air out this reality of the abuses and how the Church acted and let the Spirit lead us to the desert of desolation to the cross and to the resurrection” said the Pope in a statement responding to the heightened calls for the church to address the longstanding issues of sexual assault.

“Silences omissions and giving too much weight to the prestige of the institution only leads to personal and historical failure and makes us live with the weight of having skeletons in the closet” he added.

VATICAN CITY VATICAN – MARCH 12: Ghanian Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson attends the Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice Mass at St Peter’s Basilica before they enter the conclave to decide who the next pope will beon March 12 2013 in Vatican City Vatican. Cardinals are set to enter the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI after he became the first pope in 600 years to resign from the role. The conclave is scheduled to start on March 12 inside the Sistine Chapel and will be attended by 115 cardinals as they vote to select the 266th Pope of the Catholic Church.

According to Church rules Turkson would still be eligible to be a part of the group of cardinals that gets to elect the next pope after Francis dies or retires.

Despite not giving an official reason for his resignation Vatican sources say that Turkson will give more information after the Pope makes his decision.

After an unsurprising loss to AA program Jamestown on Friday night 73-49 the Trojans were served a disappointing 68-49 loss by Cardinal O’Hara on Saturday night.

“I feel good about the tournament we’re gonna learn a lot from it” Southwestern head coach Aaron Emley said about the Trojans performance in the tournament. “Yesterday is one thing you’re going against a good AA in Jamestown but tonight there was no excuses for it. We need to get better.”

The Trojans (2-3) played a strong first half as they held a narrow 31-27 lead at halftime. It wasn’t long into the fourth quarter before the lead was gone and soon after that the game as Southwestern came out flat and Cardinal O’Hara’s shooting began to heat up. Cardinal O’Hara outscored Southwestern 22-8 in the third quarter capitalizing on four shots from downtown.

Southwestern’s offense went through Aidan Kennedy and Matthew Pannes as the duo were the only Trojans to make multiple baskets. In the first half Kennedy and Pannes were involved with every scoring play. The first five points went through Kennedy as he first got an assist after faking a shot from the corner then dribbling down the baseline and dishing off a pass to Jason Ni for a corner three then after that Kennedy stole the ball on the inbound and made a quick dish to Pannes who kissed it off the glass for two. Both Kennedy and Pannes drained a 3-pointer then Kennedy cashed in on his own steal for a breakaway layup as the quarter ended tied at 13-13.

“I thought we got out better in the open court in the first half” stated Emley. “Second half we just weren’t getting those looks. They picked up their intensity on defense so I’ll credit them for that but we weren’t getting good ball movement and not a lot of scoring from outside Pannes and Kennedy.”

In both the second and third quarter all of the Trojans points were scored by Pannes and Kennedy which was helpful in the second but detrimental in the third quarter. Cardinal O’Hara made adjustments at halftime that slowed down the Southwestern offense and turned the game in Cardinal O’Hara’s favor. To start the third quarter Cardinal O’Hara began using a man-press defense that the Trojans struggled to adjust to.

“Third quarter we didn’t handle it well” Emley said about Cardinal O’Hara’s press. “That was the big turnaround. I think we had six turnovers in the first half and six in the third quarter.”

While the Southwestern offense cooled off the Cardinal O’Hara offense improved as the game went on with its shooters remaining consistent throughout the contest. Cardinal O’Hara was led by Jacob Kanowski who scored 19 points with two 3-pointers — enough to earn his place on the All-Tournament Team. Including Kanowski four of Cardinal O’Hara’s players scored double-digits Chris Wright with 13 Isaiah Serrano with 11 and Simmarion Threct with 10.

In the fourth quarter the game slipped further away from the Trojans as Kennedy finished with 25 points and Pannes finished with 18 and they fell to Cardinal O’Hara 68-49.

This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

(AP) — A federal judge’s decision to reject a multibillion-dollar opioid settlement involving OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is being hailed as a step toward justice by advocates who have long called for greater accountability for the family that owns the company.

But not everyone involved in the arduous settlement process is celebrating including some advocates who have lost loved ones to the nation’s ongoing — and growing — addiction crisis. The ruling Thursday from New York-based U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon is a blow to those who sought to use billions of dollars from Purdue and from the Sackler family members involved with the company to fight the epidemic.

“It could be dragged out for months if not years” said Cheryl Juaire of Massachusetts who has lost two grown sons to opioid overdoses.

Juaire founded an organization for grieving parents and was a voice for victims on a committee during the Purdue bankruptcy proceedings that led to the settlement vacated this week.

“Every day 265 people are dying. The attorneys are getting richer because they’ve still got a job to do and lives are being lost” she said. “When is somebody going to say ‘This is all about the lives?’”

Avi Israel also lost a son to opioid addiction but sees this week’s ruling differently. Like Juaire he has dedicated his life to fighting addiction starting Save the Michaels of the World a group that has helped get 1200 people in western New York into addiction treatment this year.

He said Thursday’s decision was the right one.

“You could give me all the money in the world; that’s not going to bring my son back” said Israel who also sits on a state board that helps distribute money New York brings in from opioid litigation.

Allowing lawsuits to move forward against Sackler family members could have a more long-lasting effect by deterring corporate executives from pushing medications they know could cause harm.

“I want them to know what it feels like for millions of us in this holiday season when you sit at the table and you stare at an empty chair and you know that all of that could have been avoided” he said.

The contrasting views of justice in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy reflect a complicated case at the center of multiple lawsuits seeking to hold players in the drug industry accountable for the nationwide epidemic of addiction and overdoses. Combined prescription and illicit versions of the drugs have been linked to more than 500000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades and it’s gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic. Federal officials say there were 100000 overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended in April the majority of them from opioids.

The Purdue case is the highest-profile but it’s not the largest opioid settlement in the works. The drug distribution companies AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health and McKesson plus drugmaker Johnson & Johnson have agreed to a settlement worth $26 billion over time. The deal relies on having a critical mass of local governments surrender their right to sue and sign on.

Facing thousands of lawsuits from state and local governments unions hospitals and others Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as part of an effort to settle the cases. After negotiations and mediation it reached a deal supported by the overwhelming majority of state and local governments as well as individuals with claims who voted on it.

The plan calls for Sackler family members to give up ownership of Purdue. The transformed company would continue to make OxyContin but with profits going to fight the opioid crisis. It also would try to develop low- or no-cost drugs to reverse overdoses and treat addictions. Sackler family members would contribute $4.5 billion over time in cash and charitable assets.

Most of the money would flow to government entities which would be obligated to use it to fight the crisis and not just to fill their budgets.

“The most important thing to me is that in the plan every single penny has to be used for the epidemic” Juaire said.

Because of the advocacy of Juaire and other representatives of victims a portion of the settlement — $750 million — would go to individual victims and their families. Payments were expected to range from $3500 to $48000. That set the Purdue deal apart from other large opioid settlements where money for individual victims is not included.

But the deal came with one catch that angered many advocates state attorneys general and others: The Sacklers would be protected from all current and future civil lawsuits over the toll of opioids.

Under a 2020 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice the company pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a deal that would waive most of their $8.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures as long as it entered a settlement that would use money to fight the opioid crisis. Members of the Sackler family agreed separately to pay $225 million to settle federal civil claims. There are no indications that criminal charges could emerge against family members though some activists are pressing officials to file them.

Eight states and the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee a part of the Department of Justice objected to the bankruptcy settlement and appealed after a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge accepted the deal in September.

Their arguments swayed Judge McMahon. In her ruling she said bankruptcy law does not give judges the power to accept deals that protect people who are not themselves filing for bankruptcy protection if some parties in the case don’t agree.

The decision “puts a fine point on the idea that there cannot be two systems of justice in this country” one for the wealthy and one for everyone else” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in an interview Friday.

Purdue said it would appeal but that it also would keep trying to find a settlement all parties would accept.

McMahon anticipated an appeal in her ruling: “This opinion will not be the last word on the subject nor should it be.” She said the issue of third-party releases has hovered over bankruptcy law for decades with federal circuit courts disagreeing about whether they can be granted.

The appeal will go to the New York-based U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. It’s expected that whichever side loses will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.

Congress also has considered legislation that would prohibit the kind of protections granted to Sackler family members but the bill has stalled.

Representatives of the Sackler family have said in court depositions and congressional hearings that they have not done anything improper and are not responsible for the opioid epidemic. They have not commented on Thursday’s ruling.

The Department of Justice under different leadership than it was 13 months ago when Purdue pleaded guilty praised McMahon’s decision.

“The bankruptcy court did not have the authority to deprive victims of the opioid crisis of their right to sue the Sackler family” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",,,

This has some owners considering their options and one of them is Nick Hodges who is a member of the Bronco 6th Gen Facebook group.

Curious to see how much his Bronco was worth Hodges reportedly took it to CarMax for an appraisal. They allegedly came back with an offer of $61000 which is far more than the original sticker price of $44140. Since Hodges reportedly paid $46000 for his Bronco he’d be looking at a healthy profit of $15000.

That’s enough to make most people consider selling and he posted his dilemma on Facebook. Many people said he should take the company up on the offer while others suggested he sell it himself and make more money.

Of course things aren’t quite that simple as Hodges’ previous posts suggest he’s a huge Bronco fan and has already started making minor modifications to his SUV. That being said $15000 is still $15000 and he could always sell his Bronco order a new one and drive something else in the meantime.

The latter involves jumping through a few hoops and waiting for a new Bronco to arrive but it might be worth it. That’s especially true if he has another vehicle and wouldn’t have to rush to buy something else to drive in the meantime.

With all that being said what would you do in if you were in his shoes?",,,,,,,,,,,,

None of these companies are being transparent with members of the public who are largely reliant on whisle-blower crew members and concerned cruise guests to tell them the truth about the virus.

NCL’s Norwegian Breakaway

Two weeks ago NCL’s Norwegian Breakaway experienced a COVID-19 breakout which initially affected “nine crew members and eight passengers.” The public learned of the outbreak via tweets by the Louisiana Department of Health which unlike the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed precise information regarding exactly how many coronavirus cases there were on this cruise ship and the number of guests and crew infected before the ship even returned to port in New Orleans. This state health department even informed the public that one crew member was infected with the Omicron varient.

Meanwhile several publications reported that guests on the NCL ship had no idea that a single passenger or crew members on the ship had tested positive including the Omicron varient. NCL falsely claimed that the outbreak intially involved only a “handful” of cases when the actual count is now at least twenty infected guests and crew members.

Hmm @CruiseNorwegian first said Norwegian Breakaway had only ""handful"" of #COVID19 cases (handful = just ""5"" fingers?) but total is now at least 17 (& counting stay tuned) including at least 1 #Omicron variant (isolated on #cruise ship with over 5000 passengers & crew?) Ha! https://t.co/bbneJpfuJJ — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) December 7 2021

The information was obviously taken seriously enough by a large number of passengers who were scheduled to board the NCL cruise ship that they decided not to board the ship. One guest estimated that as any as four hundred guests decided at the last moment not to cruise whereas a crew member estimated that one hundred and fifty guests changed their minds. Whatever the actual number the prompt accurate and precise reporting by the Loiuisiana Department of Health illustrates the importance of transparency of health departments regarding matters of public health. The transparency of the Louisiana health department is to be sharply contrasted with state health departments like that in Florida which has been effectively muzzled by Republican DeSantis for selfish political purposes.

We subsequently reported that an additional three crew members (a recreational staff member a stateroom attendant and a musician) on the Norwegian Breakaway tested positive for COVID-19 during the initial couple of days of the next cruise based on information from a trustworthy NCL crew member.

Royal Caribbean’s Jewel of the Seas

The Jewel of the Seas which has a history of guest and crew member COVID-19 infections since last July again experienced a group of passengers testing positive for the virus. Unfortunately the CDC’s COVID-19 color code reporting system erroneously showed a “green” designation (no cases) whch we pointed out on Thusday in our article titled Additional COVID-19 Cases Aboard Royal Caribbean’s Jewel of the Seas. By Friday the CDC had changed its designation for the cruise ship to “yellow”indicating that the “reported cases of COVID-19 have met the threshold for CDC investigation.”

The utility of the CDC’s color code system is rather limited as it does not indicate whether there are two or twenty or two hundred positive cases (if it accurately indicated the presence of COVID-19 cases on the ship at all).

We have subsequently received additional information from a trustworth shipboard employee on this Royal Caribbean cruise ship indicating that:

“Another 4 PCR Covid positive guests detected today making a total of 8 positive onboard. All these guests are moved to the “red zone” till tomorrow morning when they will be disembarked in Miami. Contact-tracing guests are isolated in their staterooms till the end of the voyage as well.”

The crew member additionally commented:

“The Hotel Director F&B director and restaurant operation manager are isolated for 10 days (contact tracing identified them in close contact with some top tier guests who are Covid positive).

We are short of staff onboard in certain departments mainly in front of the house it was a challenge this week to handle 1600 guests and tomorrow we are expecting more then 2000 guests here.

The ship is definitely overcrowded as one of the main things to prevent outbreaks is the social distancing and we have way too many people spending their time in lounges especially restaurants and queing waiting to be seated to My-Time dining area (main dining room area with flexible timing for dinner).

It’s certainly not a good idea to cruise nowadays on the ship which is almost fully booked.

Also we stay today together with Symphony of the Seas in Coco Cay. As per our colleagues from Symphony there are around 30 positive Covid guests onboard!”

Royal Caribbean’s Symphony of the Seas

Yesterday a passenger on the Royal Caribbean Symphony of the Seas stated via Twitter that there are as many as 36 COVID-19 cases amongst the guests based on information received from a crew member. This guest’s family member was infected and he was complaining that she was largely unattended by the medical staff while attepting to find infomation about the testing procedure for him and his family.

Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Panorama

Meanwhile guests aboard the Carnival Panorama stated yesterday via Twitter that Mexico will not permit passengers from the cruise ship to disembark the cruise ship in Cabo because there reportedly are COVID-19 cases involving guests onboard. As usual Carnival Cruise Line refuses to disclose the number of positive virus cases whether crew members are also infected and whether there are any Omicron variant cases involved.

There are forty cruise ships leaving from U.S. ports with COVID-19 aboard including nineteen cruise ships operated and owned by Royal Caribbean.

With the Omicron varient spreading throughout the U.S. there is every certainty that this highly contagious COVID-19 varient will cause havoc on cruise ships leaving ports in Florida and other U.S. states. Omicron found its way onto NCL and Royal Caribbean cruise ships over two weeks ago. It is probably on Carnival Cruise Line ships as well although Carnival is the last cruise line which would voluntarily release such information.

A shout out to the brave crew members and the conscientous guests who have provided the above information. Thanks to them we now know what is actually happening at sea on these largely lawless cruise ships.

This change comes as two other major cruise lines have also tightened measures to make sure guests and crew remain safe.

The cruise line has informed booked guests of updated protocols that are in effect on sailings from December 18 2021 through January 31 2022. All guests aged two and above will now be requested to wear a mask indoors and outdoors with exceptions. The cruise line is also no longer allowing any smoking in the casino.

In a letter to guests Carnival says “Our Have Fun. Be Safe. protocols and procedures have proven very effective during our restart and have been developed in consultation with our medical experts and they are designed to be adaptable as our current public health situation evolves.”

Another significant change is that Carnival now strongly suggests that guests have a booster vaccination before their cruise. Boosters have become an essential defense against the new Omicron variant as detailed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The cruise line continued “In preparation for your voyage we want to update you on the COVID-19 protocols we are implementing fleet-wide for sailings through January 31 2022 as we respond to the Omicron variant.”

What Are the Updated Protocls?

Wearing masks during a cruise has become the obvious change especially now that Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line have tightened their mask policies. There are also changes for the casino along with booster shots recommendations. Cruise Hive readers can check the full Have Fun. Be Safe. protocols here.

Sailings through January 31 2022

Updated Protocols

Carnival Cruise Line requests that guests aged two and above wear masks at all times indoors except when eating or drinking or when in their staterooms. It’s recommended that guests use higher-grade masks when indoors for added protection. Masks must also be worn outdoors if in a large gathering and when social distancing cannot be maintained.

With the CDC encouraging all persons over 16 years old to have the booster vaccination Carnival Cruise Line recommends guests have their booster at least seven days before sailing.

Even though the CDC is poised to be ending its Conditional Sailing Order in January 2022 cruise lines are still working with the organization to make sure guests and crew remain protected and that expert advice is followed.

Casino Protocols

When it comes to the casino smoking will no longer be allowed at any time. That’s the only change in addition to the previous rules that have already been in place for several months.

Sailings from February 1 through March 30 2022

Carnival Protocols

The updated protocols are only temporary and from February 1 through March 30 2022 the masks indoors and outdoors will only be strongly encouraged rather than a requirement. The cruise line also says “Guests aged two and older will still have to be required to wear masks in elevators and in designated indoor entertainment venues all retail shops in the casino and at any indoor activity with children under 12 years.”

Masks Now Required Indoors

In a letter sent to cruisers Friday evening Carnival Cruise Line outlined several changes being made to their health and safety protocols.

The communication made sure to remind recipients that the procedures being used “have proven very effective during our restart.” It also pointed out that as was said from the beginning the protocols were designed to be adaptable so that they could change “as the public health situation evolves.”

With that in mind Carnival Cruise Line says that from now until at least January 31 2022 their masking policy will become more stringent. “All guests ages two and above are requested to wear masks at all times when indoors except when eating or drinking or when in their own staterooms” the letter reads.

It adds that masks should be worn “when outdoors if in large gatherings and physical distance cannot be maintained.”

Finally the letter points out that health authorities are advising that “higher grade masks” be used indoors.

Booster Shots Recommended Not Required

The letter also addresses the question of booster shots thusly: “The [Centers for Disease Control] has strongly recommended that all persons over 16 years obtain a… booster vaccination when eligible. We strongly encourage all guests who are eligible to get their booster vaccination at least seven days before boarding.”

The wording of this particular paragraph led to some confusion as would-be passengers flooded brand ambassador John Heald with complaints about their inability to obtain a booster shot in a timely manner. This led to him posting a video to his Facebook page in which he offered clarification.

“I wanted you to hear it from me and I apologize sincerely if it was no clear enough” Heald said. “You do not need to have a booster. Yes we recommend you have one. I’ve had mine lots of you have had yours. But if you have not had your booster you can still come on your cruise.”

How Other Lines Are Handling Masks

Carnival Cruise Line’s mask policy is largely in line with newly-released mask guidance from both Royal Caribbean and Norwegian cruise lines.

Like Carnival those lines released updated guidance in recent days in conjunction with growing concerns over the current health crisis.

While Carnival Cruise Line has said their policy will remain in place through January 31 2022 Royal Caribbean’s is currently in effect through January 5 2022 while Norwegian Cruise Line says their current policy is only effective through December 19 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXJpbGxvLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvMTgvYW1hcmlsbG8ta29yZGVzdGFuaS1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2hvZS1jYXJuaXZhbC1mb3N0ZXItY2hpbGRyZW4vODk1Mjk3MDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amarillo Kordestani Christmas Shoe Carnival foster children,"For the fourth consecutive year local plastic surgeon Dr. Rouzbeh Kordestani held his annual “Christmas after Christmas” event to help foster families get their children new shoes on a cold Saturday morning at Shoe Carnival in Amarillo.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions last Christmas the event had to be done with families driving up to and receiving shoes in their vehicle but this year all families gathered at Shoe Carnival and were able to have the store to themselves as they picked out shoes.

Kordestani who said he had a history of doing medical missions in places such as Africa said he became aware that there were many in need of help locally and throughout the country. Since then he has been involved with the Greater Amarillo Foster Parent Association to help provide needed support to the families it serves. He said he has been involved with the organization with various events and contributions over the past 12 years.

""It became obvious that while we were focusing on many other places we were completely neglecting people in our own backyard. When brought up about these needs locally we revamped our focus"" he said.

About five years ago Kordestani became aware of the significant needs of children in the area for specific clothing items. When asked why he chose shoes Kordestani said he really did not know that this was such a great need until the Foster Parent Association told him about the need.

“I didn’t even think about it until the association told us about the enormous impact of kids being able to get new shoes for the return to school after Christmas. We gave shoes to every kid in the family that came to the event"" he said.

About 30 families with a total of 87 children were given shoes Saturday at this year's event. Children were allowed to choose whatever shoe they liked up to a limit of $55 which covered most of the shoes at Shoe Carnival. Smiling children and parents went from row to row to find the perfect shoe for them.

One of the many families that could get shoes for their family today was the Brannon Family. Getting shoes for both of his children Chris Brannon was pleased that this event was made available to his two sons Parker and Oryan.

“I am very excited; I love getting shoes"" Parker Brannon said. “My other shoes were getting pretty old.”

Parker Brannon said that his favorite color shoes were black and blue.

“It is exciting to get new shoes"" Oryan Brannon said.

Val McClane felt that the event was a godsend for the family.

“I am so grateful for the doctor to do this” McClane said. “This is great that they do this for the community each year. This is definitely a need in my household.”

Mark Kile a partner in the event spoke about how honored he was to be a part of the event.

“I was an underprivileged kid growing up one of six kids"" Mark Kile said. “I can relate to these kids and their needs for shoes. This is a very positive thing to be able to be a part of for the community.”

Other partners in the event were Kordestani’s staff members and Gold’s Gym and Shoe Carnival.

Adam Shepard manager for Shoe Carnival spoke of the very fortunate partnership he felt it was to be involved with.

“Seeing the kids' eyes light up as they pick out their shoes is a present in itself for me"" Shepard said. “It was so great to be able to help make many of these kids' Christmas better.”

Amy and Jon Moffett brought their newly adopted daughter Carolynn and other members of their family to get shoes. Jon Moffett had just gotten over being hospitalized recently with COVID-19 and appreciated the gesture of Dr. Kordestani.

“This is really helped us to be able to get other items for Christmas with this event providing new shoes to our children"" Jon Moffett said. “With my health issues it was quite a blessing.”

If people want to help in future charity events with Dr. Kordestani they can contact him at 806-322-5438. He said that his organization has very few layers and any help is appreciated.

“Hopefully people realize that we need to start taking care of our own in need and I look forward to any people that want to help to reach out to me” Kordestani said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NydWlzZS9jYXJuaXZhbC1jb3JwLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtb3BlbmluZy1vZi1kdWJhaS1jcnVpc2UtdGVybWluYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Corp.

The building in Palm Beach Gardens has now added the prestigious WELL Platinum certification from the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) to the LEED Platinum designation it achieved in 2019 for energy and environmental design.

Carrier’s Center for Intelligent Buildings is now just one of just six commercial buildings in the USA with both WELL and LEED Platinum designations.

Carrier moved into the 224000ft2 facility in 2018. It was specifically designed to provide a healthy safe sustainable and intelligent indoor environment for employees and visitors while simultaneously showcasing the company’s products and integrated systems.

“Given that we spend 90% of our time indoors occupying buildings that balance function with occupant health are of vital importance” said Carrier chairman and CEO David Gitlin. “By achieving WELL Platinum certification in our own global headquarters we are demonstrating the benefits of Carrier’s Healthy Buildings offerings and showcasing how our cutting-edge digital technologies optimise indoor environments and maximise employee well-being and productivity.”

The International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) is a public benefit corporation whose mission is to improve human health and wellbeing through the built environment. It administers the WELL Building Standard – a performance-based system for measuring certifying and monitoring features of the built environment that impact human health and wellbeing through air water nourishment light fitness comfort and mind.

The WELL Platinum certification recognises that Carrier’s global headquarters has incorporated sustainable and health-centric components that are unmatched in the commercial landscape. The building leverages advanced solutions through Carrier’s Healthy Buildings Program featuring products that optimise indoor environments to improve occupant experience operational efficiency and inspire confidence in everything from physical safety and security to improved health productivity and cognitive performance. The facility was specifically designed to COGfx air quality standards – indoor air quality specifications found by Harvard University researchers to improve employee productivity reduce sick days and promote better cognitive function.

Independent testing and observation are said to have shown that the building achieved a score well above the Platinum threshold across categories ranging from air water and material quality.

WELL representatives evaluated the building in 10 areas of health and wellness including air and water quality noise light and temperature levels and other environmental parameters applicable to WELL requirements. The facility is the 109th building globally and the 24th building in the country to achieve WELL Certification at the Platinum level. Previously the Center was recognised as the first commercial building in the state to earn LEED Platinum certification in 2019.

A number of Carrier Healthy Buildings solutions are deployed in the facility. These include Carrier’s Abound cloud-native platform which is used to monitor real time indoor air quality and thermal comfort against the WELL Building Standard and Automated Logic’s WebCTRL web-based platform that tracks air quality and thermal performance to keep occupants comfortable while managing energy consumption.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTEyLzEyNDE3NjYuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese aircraft carrier battle group enters Pacific for 'routine drills',"The picture shows the aircraft carrier Liaoning (Hull 16) and other vessels and fighter jets in the maritime parade conducted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy in the South China Sea on the morning of April 12 2018.Photo:China Military



The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy recently sent an aircraft carrier battle group through the Miyako Strait into the Pacific Ocean with analysts saying on Saturday that the voyage is likely a routine exercise that could feature drills near the island of Taiwan and in the South China Sea.The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force on Wednesday spotted a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of four warships namely the aircraft carrier Liaoning the Type 055 large destroyer Nanchang the Type 054A frigate Rizhao and the Type 901 comprehensive supply ship Hulunhu which then passed through waters between Okinawa Island and Miyako Island and sailed south toward the Pacific Ocean on Thursday Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in a press release on late Friday.In the process the PLA carrier battle group conducted vessel-based helicopter takeoff and landing exercises in the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean and held vessel-based fighter jet takeoff and landing exercises in the Pacific Ocean according to the press release.Japanese warships and warplanes including the Izumo helicopter destroyer which wrapped up modifications and became a de facto aircraft carrier this year attempted to monitor the movement of the Chinese vessels the press release said.On Tuesday the Type 052D destroyer Xiamen also took a similar route and entered the Pacific Ocean a separate press release by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said on Thursday. This vessel is likely also a part of the Liaoning carrier battle group observers said.The reported Liaoning carrier battle group's voyage is likely a routine exercise a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Saturday.This is not the first time the Liaoning has transited the Miyako Strait this year as it had taken this route twice in a round trip in April.At the time Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng a PLA Navy spokesperson announced that the Liaoning carrier group conducted exercises near the island of Taiwan as part of an annually scheduled regular training with the target being examining the result of exercises and enhancing its capability to safeguard national sovereignty safety and development interests.Similar exercises will be conducted on a regular basis in the future Gao said.Previous records indicate that the Liaoning could also train in the South China Sea . For example the Liaoning conducted a cross-regional maneuver crossing the Miyako Strait and the Bashi Channel into the South China Sea for exercises in April 2020. Gao said at the time that the PLA Navy would continue to regularly organize similar training and exercises.Friday was the second anniversary for the commissioning of China's second aircraft carrier the South China Sea-based Shandong.Military enthusiasts are looking forward to seeing the Liaoning and the Shandong form a dual carrier group for the first time. Even if they don't this time the day will eventually come the anonymous expert said.The expert also pointed out that the Nanchang the PLA Navy's first Type 055 large destroyer and a powerful escort of the aircraft carrier has participated in many key missions this year indicating that the vessel is now reliable and combat-ready.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5hdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vbm9rLWFpci1zaWducy1sb25nLXRlcm0tZGVhbHMtd2l0aC1zYWJyZS1yYWRpeHgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nok Air signs long-term deals with Sabre Radixx,"Thai airline Nok Air announced strategic new long-term agreements with both Sabre and its subsidiary company Radixx to support the evolution of the carrier’s new business strategy.

This tiny cheerful bird is one of the most well-known birds in North America. Its black cap of feathers and its chick a dee dee dee call gave rise to its onomatopoeic name.

Chickadees eat mostly insects in the summer. In the winter insects (and their eggs and pupae) still make up about half of a chickadee’s diet. This is bad news for chickadees because according to many studies insect populations are declining globally. Insecticides urbanization and light pollution can all harm insect populations. Some studies indicate that insect populations have declined by 45 percent in the past 40 years. In 2020 one large meta-analysis published in the journal Science examined 166 studies that spanned nine to 80 years; the meta-analysis concluded that terrestrial insects are declining at a rate of 1 percent per year or 9 percent per decade.

What does this insect decline bode for chickadees? It’s difficult to know for sure but according to the entomologist Doug Tallamy it takes between 6000 and 9000 caterpillars to rear one family of baby chickadees for these babies do not eat seeds; they can eat only insects. Chickadee parents both are kept very busy feeding the hungry chicks. They carry a caterpillar (or two or three) to the nest about once every three minutes 14 hours or more per day for 16 to 18 days. That’s more than 300 caterpillars per day. If insect populations continue to decline it is easy to understand why bird populations which depend on insects will also decline.

One of the reasons for the decline in insect populations is the planting of nonnative species.“One of the big problems for insects is that we are landscaping” Tallamy says “with plants from someplace else – typically China. Those plants are not able to support our North American insects.” Of course chickadees prefer areas with trees that support the greatest numbers of caterpillars he notes.

Those are oak native cherries and plums willows poplars birches and crabapples and apples. These trees also produce seeds and berries that support adult birds especially in the winter. You can find the native plants that host the most caterpillars here. In our area 473 types of butterflies and moths use the oak (Quercus Fagales) as a host plant for caterpillars; not every person is able to plant an oak tree in their yard but there are many other native plants that support insects and native birds. Because birds need so many caterpillars to survive it is easier to plant a tree that supports these caterpillars than to try to feed these birds with bird feeders. Bird feeders can help an adult survive the winter but they cannot provide the food that baby birds need.

One other simple thing we can do to help butterfly and moth survival is to leave leaves on the ground during the winter because many butterflies and moths pupate on the undersides of leaves or shelter under leaf cover.

There are about 2249 species of caterpillars in Massachusetts which live mostly on native plants. According to Tallemy’s studies when the native plant biomass in an ecosystem falls below 70 percent the bird population declines.

Still another threat to the black-capped chickadee is climate change. Some of the expected effects of climate change include warmer average temperatures longer warm seasons shorter cold seasons greater rainfall bigger storms and more acidic oceans. According to Mass Audubon the black-capped chickadee is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In the eastern part of Massachusetts chickadees populations are projected to decline by more than 30 percent by 2050.

Chickadees can be quite beneficial to humans by helping keep unwelcome insect pests at bay as noted by Edward Howe Fornbush an ornithologist who lived from 1858 to 1929:

In 1894 my small orchard became very seriously infested with canker-worms tent-caterpillars codling-moths and gipsy moths. No attempt was made to protect the trees from their enemies until the fall when by feeding numbers of birds were attracted to the orchard. Immense numbers of the eggs of the fall canker-worm moth and the tent-caterpillar moth were already deposited upon the trees and toward spring large numbers of spring canker-worm moths began to ascend the trees and lay their eggs. So many Chickadees and nuthatches were attracted to the orchard during the winter that they destroyed nearly all the insects and their eggs and the next season which proved to be one of great insect multiplication my orchard was the only one in the neighborhood which produced a good crop of fruit while most of those in town produced little or no fruit … My assistant … estimated that one Chickadee could destroy 138750 eggs of the canker-worm moth in the twenty-five days during which the female moths lay their eggs.

Chickadees in the city

Chickadees courting behavior occurs in March through May when males pursue females. Then a bonded pair works together to carve out a nesting site in dead branches or stumps (or nest boxes when available). It can take the pair a week or more to excavate an appropriate nesting site. Once the cavity is prepared the female gathers fluffy vegetation fur feathers and moss to line the nest. This process takes a few days. The finished nest is about 3 inches wide and an inch deep. The female lays six to eight eggs on average and incubates them for about 12 days. As you can imagine each chickadee egg is tiny – only about a half-inch long. The male feeds the female during this period when she cannot leave the nest. You can watch this nesting process here.

When the chicks are born both parents are kept very busy from sunup to sundown feeding the hungry youngsters. In his “Useful Birds and Their Protection” Forbush tells of a time he watched a tiny chickadee tackle a large caterpillar:

I once saw a Chickadee attempting to hold a monster caterpillar which proved too strong for it. The great worm writhed out of the confining grasp and fell to the ground but the little bird followed caught it whipped it over a twig and swinging underneath caught each end of the caterpillar with a foot and so held it fast over the twig by superior weight and proceeded while hanging back downward to dissect its prey.

After about 18 days the youngsters leave the nest. At this time they look much like the adults. By the end of the summer you cannot tell the youngsters and the adults apart. In late summer the youngsters move away from the parents but still flock with them; by fall they wander off. Winter flocks of chickadees are not family groups. Flocks of chickadees have a hierarchy with one chickadee pair No. 1 another No. 2 and so on. Some birds called floaters are not paired. If a highly ranked bird dies the highest-ranked floater takes its place. Floaters do not ever pair up with other floaters. They move from flock to flock trying to improve their social standing.

Chickadees are a popular bird and they have been popular for a very long time. They are charming to watch at bird feeders and they eradicate insect pests even in winter. In about 1925 Forbush wrote about these remarkable birds:

[Chickadees] will come to your very yard to glean a meal as well as roam the woodlands in their untiring quest of insects and insect eggs. . . . Throughout the year Chickadee wages warfare on infinite hosts of insect pests and in effectively reducing their numbers renders invaluable services to agriculture and forestry. This versatile bird has learned to procure its sustenance from trunk and bough from tree-top and ground and every crack and cranny in which insects hibernate or lay their eggs. No bug is too small to escape its penetrating eyes and no caterpillar too large for Chickadee to tackle.

These little birds are such a delight to behold that we owe it to them (and to ourselves) to do whatever we can to ensure that they do not disappear from our region.

Be one of the first to put the new Cat® C32B 2025 mhp marine engine in your boat and you'll earn the right to boast a little (or a lot).

After all choosing the new C32B means you've hooked the latest engine on the market all new from the block up and perfectly designed for sport fishing. Here are four ways it'll make you the envy of everyone else on the water.

1. You'll leave the others in your wake

More horsepower equals more speed and this 2025 mhp marine engine gets you to (and from) your favorite fishing spot faster. Plus with an ""E"" tier rating the Cat C32B gives you the power to run at wide-open throttle — the full 2025 mhp — as much as 8% of the time. That's at least 3% longer than the closest competitor.

And you don't have to worry about added weight slowing you down either. The new C32B delivers a 5% power increase over the previous model with just a 2% weight increase. It's more muscle in the same package making it a great choice for repowers as well as new builds.

2. You'll enjoy the luxury of a quiet conversation

We wouldn't blame you for wanting to shout the advantages of this new 2025 mhp marine engine from the bridge — but the good news is you won't have to. The C32B is so much quieter than its predecessor that you can hold a conversation on deck at normal volume even when your boat is running at full throttle.

How much quieter exactly? 25% under low-speed conditions. That's thanks to the C32B's advanced unit injection fuel system. Like common rail fuel systems used on other high-horsepower engines it fires multiple injections of fuel per power stroke — reducing noise.

This fuel system brings other benefits too like redundancy. A failed high-pressure fuel pump renders a common rail system inoperable. With unit injection however you can still bring your boat home if an injector fails. This tried-and-true technology — part of our C32 engine platform since 2006 — is also simple to service.

3. You can rest easy while the rest worry

Ask other fishing boat owners and they'll tell you: The Cat marine engine warranty can't be matched. The new C32B comes with unlimited-hour protection for the first two years and you can add Extended Service Coverage (ESC) for the next three. When the first five years are up just have your Cat dealer inspect the engine then add another five years of ESC. That's a total of 10 years of coverage — and peace of mind every time you go out on the water.

Want even more reassurance? Consider this: The American-made C32B is the next generation of the proven reliable C32 platform — a more powerful version of a product you already know and love. We've put the C32B through more than 30000 hours of testing to ensure its reliability.

And of course this new 2025 mhp marine engine is backed by the support of the Cat dealer network around the globe. You're never far from the parts service and support you need no matter where you are on the water.

4. You'll fish while they futz with filters and fluids

If you're not thinking about filters and fluids when you make your engine decision maybe you should. As engines get more powerful system cleanliness gets more important. The C32B's Ultra High Efficiency Plus Filters — white to match your engine — keep out more contamination so engine components last longer.

And if you keep using the right Cat filters and fluids and work with your local Cat dealer to take regular S.O.SSM fluid samples there's a good chance you can extend your oil change interval on the C32B out to 500 hours. That's less time spent on maintenance and more time spent fishing.

Don't let the bragging rights go to someone else. Get ahold of your Cat dealer today to get your order in for the new 2025 mhp Cat C32B marine engine. And be sure to ask what else is coming soon to our sport fishing engine lineup — you won't want to miss it.

Six reasons to repower with the C32B

More power and more speed delivered in the same size package and based on a proven design — that's what you get with the new Cat® C32B. All new from the block up built on the reliable C32 platform and tested for more than 30000 hours this American-made 2025 mhp marine engine isn't just perfect for new sport fishing boats. It's the ideal repower solution whether you're running an existing C32 at 1825 mhp or 1925 mhp or another engine brand entirely. Here's why:

1. Run longer at higher horsepower

If you want to get to and from your favorite fishing spot faster repowering with the Cat C32B is a smart move. With an ""E"" tier rating it gives you the power to run at wide-open throttle — the full 2025 mhp — as much as 8% of the time. That's at least 3% longer than the closest competitor.

2. Drop it in and go

Upgrading from an 1825 mhp or 1925 mhp C32 to the 2025 mhp C32B is simple. The new model is a drop-in replacement fitting into the same space in your engine room. And don't worry about added weight slowing you down. The new C32B delivers a 5% power increase over the previous model with just a 2% weight increase. It's more muscle without more bulk making it a great choice for repowers.

3. Enjoy the quiet

A day fishing shouldn't feel like a night at a rock concert. With the new C32B you can hold a conversation on deck at normal volume even when you're running at full throttle. Our new 2025 mhp engine is 25% quieter under low-speed conditions thanks to its advanced unit injection fuel system. Similar to common rail fuel systems this system fires multiple injections of fuel per power stroke to reduce noise. This tried-and-true technology is incredibly reliable and easy to service too.

4. Restart your warranty coverage

If your older engine is out or running out of warranty coverage a C32B repower gives you the peace of mind you deserve for up to 10 more years. Like all Cat marine engines our new 2025 mhp model comes with industry's best coverage: unlimited-hour protection for the first two years with the option to add Platinum Extended Service Coverage (ESC) for the next three. When the first five years are up have your Cat dealer inspect the engine and add another five years of ESC.

5. Add other upgrades

The time your boat's off the water for a C32B repower is the perfect time to make other updates. Consider upgrading to the newest Cat color displays as well as to Cat controls — your dealer can order the engine and controls together and send the package to the shipyard to make the process faster and more convenient. You also can bundle extended protection for your engine and controls with Platinum Plus ESC.

6. Spend more time fishing

After your C32B repower make sure you keep using the proper Cat filters (white to match your engine) and fluids and work with your dealer to take regular S.O.SSM fluid samples. Why? Doing so likely will let you extend your oil change interval out to 500 hours. That means less time spent on maintenance and more time spent on the water.

Now's the time to schedule your C32B repower so get ahold of your Cat dealer today to place your order for this new 2025 mhp marine engine. Make sure to ask what else is coming soon to our sport fishing engine lineup — you won't want to miss it.

Why Jarrett Bay's Co-Founder is excited about the C32B

Randy Ramsey co-founded Jarrett Bay Boatworks one of the world's premier builders of custom sportfishing boats in 1986. When customers approach him about building a new boat one of the first questions they always ask is ""What engine should I buy and why?""

Cat® marine fuel filters stop sooting aboard rascal

Captain Nick Millsap has been around sport fishing boats many of them with Cat® power most of his life. He grew up fishing in Orange Beach Alabama started working on charters as a teenager then spent a decade as a mate on private boats. In 2015 the owner of the Rascal a 60 Hatteras GT asked Millsap to come aboard as captain. Two years later the owner upgraded to a 63 Hatteras GT with Cat C32 engines — and Millsap immediately spotted a problem.

""As soon as we took delivery of the boat I started noticing that the transom was really sooty"" he says. ""You could see it sooting when we cranked the engines up.""

Millsap called Jamie MacDonald the marine account manager at Cat dealer Gregory Poole to investigate.

""A dirty transom usually means something isn't running right with the engine"" MacDonald says. ""When you see a sooty transom that means unburned fuel which means you're wasting fuel out the tailpipe.""

MacDonald sent a service technician onto the Rascal to adjust the fuel injectors hoping that would solve the issue. Millsap ran the boat to Marathon Florida then to the Bahamas — still sooty. He replaced the fuel filters — still sooty.

Right place right time right filters

As luck would have it Caterpillar's filtration expert Tim Styfhoorn introduced himself to MacDonald at a Cat event around the same time. When he heard about the sooting problem aboard the Rascal Styfhoorn had a hunch the new fully synthetic fuel filters just introduced for Cat machines might be the solution — so he pushed the internal Caterpillar development team to fasttrack the marine version.

""The next thing I know we're at the Fort Lauderdale boat show and there's a guy from Cat standing on the back of our boat with a case of fuel filters saying 'Try these'"" Millsap says. ""We put them on and it cleared up the problem immediately. It also fixed a little priming issue we were having too.""

That case contained Ultra High Efficiency Plus (UHE+) Secondary Fuel Filters which Caterpillar designed specifically to provide higher levels of filtration efficiency and capacity inside today's high-performance engines. They come standard on the new C32B 2025 mhp engine launched in August 2020 and are available as an upgrade on previous C32 engine models.

""As we keep pushing to get more horsepower out of the same size engine packages tolerances keep getting tighter"" Styfhoorn says. ""That means systems need to maintain even higher cleanliness levels than before. UHE+ filters are more efficient at removing smaller particles of contamination which means components last longer.""

For Millsap the UHE+ filters deliver more than just a clean transom. They also give him more confidence that the Rascal's C32 engines will perform as expected no matter where the boat travels.

""Fuel in the islands isn't always the cleanest fuel. It gets shipped to a terminal loaded on a barge and you're taking on 1800 gallons that may have come from the bottom of the barrel"" he says. ""These fuel filters help keep us going.""

Longer intervals = more time on the water

There's another benefit to using the Cat UHE+ filters as well — one Millsap is looking forward to taking advantage of when the newest Rascal a 65 Hatteras GT also powered by Cat C32 engines is delivered in the fall of 2020.

Because he's diligent about always using Cat filters and fluids and works with Gregory Poole to take and analyze fluid samples through the S.O.SSM Services program Millsap should be able to extend his oil change intervals from 250 hours to 400 or even 500 hours on the new Rascal.

That will save time money and hassle — no more rushing to squeeze in an oil change before a big fishing tournament. And a trip to and from the Bahamas for example will no longer require an oil change along the way.

""We won't have to carry the supplies with us. We won't have to figure out where to dispose of the used oil. We won't have to shut the boat down"" Millsap says. ""We'll be able to go longer — and that means more time fishing.""

Fishing with confidence

More time fishing is what Millsap has come to expect from Cat marine power over the years.

""Cat engines and Cat support are incredible"" he says. ""In the five years I've been captain we've never had to shut the boat down or cancel a trip due a Cat engine problem. That's averaging about 1000 hours a year.""

That means he doesn't have to turn to Jamie MacDonald at Gregory Poole for support very often — but when he does Millsap knows he'll get an answer fast.

""Anytime I need Jamie first time the phone rings he picks it up and puts me in the right direction quickly"" Millsap says. ""I don't see why we'd ever go with anybody else.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBqc3Rhci5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxzMDExNzI3OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael T. Millett Obituary,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

Michael T. Millett 88 of Peoria Illinois passed away on Friday December 17 2021 at Lutheran Hillside Village. He was born to John C. Millett and Corinne L. (Zimmerman) Millett on December 9 1933 in Wilmette Illinois. He was proceeded in death by his parents and older brothers John Jr. and Donald Millett. He is survived by his wife Pamela (Schwarz) Millett.

Mike attended Bradley University earning a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering. He went on to work for Caterpillar where he retired as a Staff Engineer after 53 years with the company.

Mike loved crossword puzzles nature and animals giving generously locally and to many wildlife causes. He also had many pets often strays and said “A home without an animal is not a real home.” He also was a generous supporter of many local charity organizations.

He spent his summers playing golf on local courses trips with friends and in Oregon with his brothers. He felt golf was the greatest game ever invented and was an avid follower of the sport. He was a member of Mt. Hawley Country Club and the Country Club of Peoria.

Mike also loved to travel especially abroad which really kicked into high gear when he married Pam. They toured the world by air and sea trying never to miss an oversea excursion hosted by WTVP. They also enjoyed many oversea cruising adventures with groups as well as alone. Travel was his passion with Pam.

He was a generous friend and was known never to have spoken ill of anyone. Since childhood Mike was always admonished for being late to school meetings and get-together’s with friends. Yet he joked that after he died he would be referred to as the ‘late’ Mike Millett.’ He will be forever missed.

Per his wishes cremation rites have been accorded. A celebration of his life will be from 4 – 6 PM on Tuesday December 21 2021 at Mt. Hawley Country Club. Private burial of ashes will be at a later date.

You can check out at any time. More info

Retail giant Marks and Spencer has launched legal action against its budget chain rivals Aldi after it accused the supermarket of copying its Light Up Gin.

In court papers filed by M&S earlier this month the company claims Aldi's gold flake blackberry and clementine gin liqueurs are ""strikingly similar"" to their own product and claim that they “constitute designs which do not produce on the informed user a different overall impression to the [M&S] designs”.

As part of the claim M&S highlight several features that it says are protected which include the bottle shape itself an integrated light feature gold leaf flakes and a winter forest graphic.

Both gins come in a uniquely shaped bell bottle and feature a light in the base that highlights edible golden flakes that can be seen floating inside.

However Aldi’s gin is a mere fraction of the price of its rival with bottles selling for £6 cheaper at £13.99 when compared to M&S’s £20.

In the paperwork filed by M&S as part of an intellectual property claim the company states that customers have been misled into believing the two gins were of the same quality a move which it says allows Aldi to ""ride on the coat-tails” of its well established success.

The company is seeking an injunction to stop Aldi from continuing to manufacture the product and to prevent any further infringement of its protected designs.

M&S also wants Aldi to destroy or surrender any existing product that may breach the injunction and is also keen to explore the potential for damages.

This isn’t the first time the two retail chains have clashed over intellectual property however.

Earlier this year M&S sued Aldi over its creation of Cuthbert a caterpillar cake that the company claimed bore too striking a semblance to their own iconic Colin the Caterpillar cake range.

In a now infamous series of tweets Aldi launched the viral #FreeCuthbert campaign on twitter with many cake lovers divided as to which side to take: Team Cuthbert or Team Colin.

A similar string of cheeky tweets was also spotted today in response to the latest lawsuit with Aldi posting on Twitter: ""Our lawyers gonna be so rich they be shopping in @marksandspencer soon #FreeCuthbert #Round2”.

And the tweets unsurprisingly left shoppers in stitches.

@shauna_everitt wrote: ""I’m dead (laughing face emoji). Aldi’s tweets tonight have been bloody hilarious.""

@lettietomblog wrote: ""Aldi Twitter team deserves a raise. Hilarious.""

@CNathanson tweeted: ""Whoever does #aldi PR does a great job v funny. Their dupes are amusing but are they really a threat to the real deal #colin?""

In response to the latest legal action the BBC reports an M&S spokesperson said: ""M&S has a proud history as a leading British innovator and for over 136 years customers have turned to M&S for unique original quality products - conceived created and developed by us working with our trusted suppliers and produced to the highest standards.”

""So like many other UK businesses large and small we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time passion creativity energy and attention to detail that goes into designing developing and bringing a product to market and building its brand over many years.

""We will always seek to protect our reputation for freshness quality innovation and value - and protect our customers from obvious copies.”

What follows is a less polished piece than I’d typically write. I just wanted to share some of my observations as well as a “cliffs notes” summary of the document which includes some related information and definitions. Understand that nothing I write here is authorized or based upon any special knowledge so be warned that my analysis might be completely off base. Additionally re-reading this I realize that I wrote this as if the document was composed by Archbishop Roche himself. He did sign the introductory letter but he is not listed as the author of the dubia or responses and it might have been written by other members of his staff.

Easter Eggs in the Document

This document is unconventional in several ways not the least of which is the presence of several “Easter eggs” that will likely go unnoticed by most readers but may jump out at those who have been following Vatican politics closely.

The first little Easter egg is the fact that this document is in the form of a “responsum” to dubia. You might recall that the internal resistance to Pope Francis escalated dramatically in late 2016 with the publication of five dubia submitted by four retired cardinals—loaded questions intended to entrap the pope in an admission that his exhortation Amoris Laetitia contains heresy. Frustrated that Pope Francis ignored their inquisition these cardinals took to the mass media in an attempt to pressure him to answer the dubia but he never responded.

I don’t think it’s unreasonable to suggest that the publication of the dubia set off a chain of events that eventually led to the promulgation of Traditionis Custodes and this Responsum five years later. These dubia appear to have been composed by the CDW and the document functions as a sort of “Frequently Asked Questions” page ostensibly based upon the most-repeated questions they have received from bishops attempting to implement Francis’s motu proprio.

The second Easter egg is the language used to indicate the pope’s approval of this Responsum. The English translation of the document says (bold emphasis added):

The Supreme Pontiff Francis in the course of an Audience granted to the Prefect of this Congregation on 18 November 2021 was informed of and gave his consent to the publication of these RESPONSA AD DUBIA with attached EXPLANATORY NOTES.

Note the words: “informed of and gave his consent to the publication.” They struck me as quite similar to those used earlier this year in the document opposing blessings for same-sex couples which said:

The Sovereign Pontiff Francis at the Audience granted to the undersigned Secretary of this Congregation was informed and gave his assent to the publication of the above-mentioned Responsum ad dubium with the annexed Explanatory Note.

In Italian however both documents use the same words “è stato informato e ha dato il suo assenso alla pubblicazione.” Earlier in the year it was argued that this wording was designed to distance Francis somewhat from the document. If that’s the purpose in this case it’s hard to say. A quick search for the phrase on the Vatican website reveals that these are the only two documents in which that precise phrasing has ever been used. At the very least it’s an interesting coincidence.

The third Easter egg is the reference to “instituted ministers” in question 9. Before Vatican II the Church had “minor orders” (porter lector exorcist acolyte) which made men progressing towards priesthood “minor clergy.” In the 1970s Saint Paul VI abolished the minor orders and the “major order” of subdeacon but retained the offices of lector and acolyte designating them as “lay ministries.” In the last year Pope Francis has opened these ministries to women and has established the new lay ministry of Catechist. The abolition of the minor orders and the establishment of canonically-recognized lay ministries remains a sore spot with traditionalists so its usage here is interesting to say the least.

Easter egg number four is that all the quotations from Traditionis Custodes are in Latin. You may recall that in Cardinal Raymond Burke’s lengthy critique of the document he wrote in his very first point “In a preliminary way it must be asked why the Latin or official text of the Motu Proprio has not yet been published. As far as I know the Holy See promulgated the text in Italian and English versions and afterwards in German and Spanish translations.” I suppose this document clears that up.

Opening Letter of the document

In case the reasons for Traditionis Custodes were unclear Archbishop Roche reminds us of the aim of Pope Francis’s decision: ecclesial communion. He writes “As pastors we must not lend ourselves to sterile polemics capable only of creating division in which the ritual itself is often exploited by ideological viewpoints.” Continuous liturgical formation for both priests and laity is needed to achieve this aim.

He urges us to listen to Pope Francis who “wants to point us to the only direction in which we are joyfully called to turn our commitment as pastors.” And that direction is the implementation of the Second Vatican Council. He reminds us of the Council fathers’ desire for reform saying “One fact is undeniable: The Council Fathers perceived the urgent need for a reform so that the truth of the faith as celebrated might appear ever more in all its beauty and the People of God might grow in full active conscious participation in the liturgical celebration (cf. Sacrosanctum Concilium n. 14) which is the present moment in the history of salvation the memorial of the Lord’s Passover our one and only hope.”

Summary and analysis

What follows are my own thoughts on each of the dubia and each of the responses. There are some direct quotations but anything that’s not in quotes is my personal thoughts summary or paraphrase. I added some facts definitions and references that might help you to understand the original document but please do not consider this an authoritative analysis.

1) Can a bishop offer a dispensation from Traditionis Custodes to allow the celebration of the 1962 Missal in a Parish Church? (Art. 3 § 2 of Traditionis Custodes states that bishops of dioceses with groups that celebrate the old rite are to designate the locations where these groups may gather for the Tridentine Mass but “not however in the parochial churches and without the erection of new personal parishes.”)

Archbishop Roche answers yes provided that it is understood that Traditionis Custodes affirms that the use of the previous rite is a concession specifically for these groups that have already been celebrating in the older form and that it is “not part of the ordinary life of the parish community.”

Additionally these exceptions are to be made by the CDW when requested by the bishop and “only if it is established that it is impossible to use another church oratory or chapel. The assessment of this impossibility must be made with the utmost care.” He goes on to explain that these Masses should not be listed on the parish Mass schedule and should not conflict with parish activities. Furthermore as soon as another venue becomes available the permission will be withdrawn.

While this might be seen as an attempt to marginalize those who are attached to the previous rite that is not the intention of this decision. Rather the purpose is to remind them that this is a concession not an opportunity to promote the celebration of the 1962 Missal.

2) Does Traditionis Custodes allow for the celebration of the sacraments with the Rituale Romanum and the Pontificale Romanum?

This dubium refers to liturgical rites that aren’t found in the 1962 Roman Missal or the Liturgy of the Hours. The Rituale Romanum and the Pontificale Romanum are liturgical books that include the pre-Vatican II sacramental rites other than the Mass. Very broadly speaking the Rituale Romanum contains the rites used by priests and the Pontificale Romanum contains those used by bishops.

The Rituale Romanum therefore includes the sacramental rites for baptism matrimony penance and extreme unction.[1] The Pontificale Romanum includes the rites in which the bishop is the ordinary minister: Holy Orders and Confirmation.[2]

The dubium asks whether the bishop may grant permission to use these books. The CDW completely denies permission to use the Pontificale Romanum and the use of the Rituale Romanum is denied except in the case of “canonically erected parishes” that celebrate Mass using the 1962 Missal according to the provisions of Traditionis Custodes.

The implication here is that in communities where a traditionalist parish has been erected—prior to the July 16 2021 release of Traditionis Custodes of course—with the purpose of celebrating according to the pre-Vatican II liturgical books the bishop may allow the priests to use the older rites for baptism confession matrimony and the anointing of the sick. In any newly-designated non-parish venues permission may not be granted. Further the use of the Pontificale is never permitted which means that going forward all Catholic deacons priests and bishops of the Latin Rite will be ordained according to the Vatican II liturgy. Additionally in ordinary cases the implication seems to be that the Sacrament of Confirmation will be celebrated according to the reformed rite as well. This apparently even applies in the aforementioned canonically-erected parishes.

Archbishop Roche then offers an “Explanatory Note” with a reminder that the goal of Pope Francis is to re-establish a single unified expression of liturgy according to the reforms of Vatican II. Traditionis Custodes was promulgated as a step towards that goal. It also states that both books have been abrogated.

He points out why this is especially important regarding the Sacrament of Confirmation. He writes “It should be remembered that the formula for the Sacrament of Confirmation was changed for the entire Latin Church by Saint Paul VI with the Apostolic Constitution Divinæ consortium naturæ (15 August 1971).”

3) May a priest continue to celebrate Mass according to the Tridentine Rite if he does not recognize the validity and legitimacy of concelebration? Particularly may he continue if he refuses to concelebrate at the Chrism Mass in his diocese?

Archbishop Roche answers no.

We might recall that priests of the FSSP were dismissed earlier this year from the diocese of Dijon France due to their refusal to concelebrate the Chrism Mass with their bishop during Holy Week. Concelebration is when more than one priest celebrates Mass together with all the concelebrants participating in the Eucharistic Prayer. Many Catholics today might not realize this because it has become so common for large Masses especially at papal Masses or large diocesan events but until the Second Vatican Council this ancient practice had largely disappeared from the liturgical life of the Church. Except for ordination Masses where the newly ordained priest or newly consecrated bishop would concelebrate every Mass had only one celebrant. Certainly other priests participated especially in high Masses but the roles they played (deacon subdeacon distributing communion etc.) did not include the consecration of the Eucharist.

The practice of concelebration is frowned upon by many traditionalists including Fr. John Zuhlsdorf who compared concelebration to abortion saying it should be “safe legal and rare.” (Ironically many progressives also oppose concelebration albeit for different reasons.)

The concern expressed in Archbishop Roche’s response is that priests who refuse to concelebrate even once a year may have an ideological aversion to the Vatican II liturgy which is a hindrance to Church unity and doctrinal coherence. Archbishop Roche reminds the bishops that they are to take care to accompany the priest toward an appreciation of the value of concelebration when he is having difficulty.

Nevertheless the archbishop sees this as a significant red flag. He explains “The explicit refusal to take part in concelebration particularly at the Chrism Mass seems to express a lack of acceptance of the liturgical reform and a lack of ecclesial communion with the Bishop both of which are necessary requirements in order to benefit from the concession to celebrate with the Missale Romanum of 1962.”

4) In Masses according to the 1962 Missal is it possible to use the full text of the bible for the scripture readings indicated in the Missal?

Archbishop Roche answers yes.

This is actually a fairly important question because the readings in the Tridentine rite do not align with the expanded Vatican II Lectionary. In the United States for example there is no approved English Lectionary for the 1962 Missal. Traditionis Custodes stipulates that going forward when Mass is said according to the older form “the readings are proclaimed in the vernacular language using translations of the Sacred Scripture approved for liturgical use by the respective Episcopal Conferences” (Art. 3 § 3).

In the Tridentine Rite it is the custom for the priest to proclaim the readings in Latin and then at the beginning of the homily to re-read them in the vernacular. The translation in 1962 Latin-English Missals in the US is the Douay-Rheims whereas the currently approved translation of the bible for use in the liturgy is the New American Bible. Since the chapters and verses of the readings don’t align between the two missals it seems there were two options: create a new Lectionary or read straight from the Bible. The Congregation has deemed that the latter is more appropriate.

Interestingly the USCCB is currently working on a revised New Testament for its official biblical translation the New American Bible Revised Edition. The Old Testament was completed in 2011 and the New Testament is expected to be completed in 2025. Only after that is complete will the Lectionary be updated probably several years after that. This potentially means that those attending Mass according to the 1962 Missal will spend years listening to readings from more recent translations than those who attend the Vatican II liturgy!

This is an imperfect solution however because there are some significant differences between the Lectionary and the text of the bible. The Lectionary adds introductory phrases (such as “Jesus said to his disciples” or “Brothers and sisters”) that do not always appear in the actual bible. Another difference is that in a few cases the Holy See has required specific wording to be used in the liturgy that might not match the translation found in a copy of the bible. For example when you hear the Gospel reading that includes the Lord’s Prayer at Mass (Mt 6:9-13) you will hear the words of the traditional prayer to which we are accustomed. In the actual bible however you will find a newer translation.

5) Does the diocesan Bishop need authorization from the Vatican to allow priests ordained after the publication of Traditionis Custodes (July 16 2021) to celebrate according to the 1962 Missal?

Archbishop Roche answers in the affirmative.

This is a clarification of the original English text which said that the bishop “shall consult the Apostolic See” before granting permission but was not clear about whether explicit approval from Rome is required. This response makes clear that permission from the Vatican must be given in every case.

The response goes on to explain that it is “absolutely essential that Priests ordained after the publication of the Motu Proprio share this desire of the Holy Father” to recognize that the reformed liturgy is “the unique expression of the lex orandi of the Roman Rite.”

The response reinforces that this is to be part of their training stating “All seminary formators seeking to walk with solicitude in the direction indicated by Pope Francis are encouraged to accompany future Deacons and Priests to an understanding and experience of the richness of the liturgical reform called for by the Second Vatican Council.”

6) Can the permission to celebrate using the Missale Romanum of 1962 be granted ad tempus (on a temporary basis)?

Archbishop Roche responds that this is “not only possible but also recommended.” He explains that this allows the bishop to assess whether “everything is in harmony with the direction established by the Motu Proprio. The outcome of this assessment can provide grounds for prolonging or suspending the permission.”

7) Does the permission granted by a diocesan Bishop to celebrate using the 1962 Missal only apply to the territory of his diocese?

Affirmative.

8) If the authorized Priest is absent or unable to attend must the person replacing him also have formal authorization?

Archbishop Roche answers in the affirmative. This means that anyone celebrating Mass according to the older form must have permission without exception.

9) Do Deacons and instituted ministers participating in celebrations using the older Missal need permission from the diocesan bishop?

Affirmative.

10) “Can a Priest who is authorized to celebrate with the Missale Romanum of 1962 and who also celebrates on weekdays with the Missale Romanum of the reform of the Second Vatican Council binate using the Missale Romanum of 1962?”

Archbishop Roche responds in the negative.

“Binate” means to celebrate two Masses on the same day. According to Catholic teaching and theology ideally a priest will celebrate only one Mass per day on weekdays. (Although in practice many priests regularly binate—or trinate—for “just cause” or “pastoral necessity.”) Archbishop Roche goes on to explain that the right of the faithful to the celebration of the Eucharist is not denied (and therefore there is no “just cause”) because the faithful always have the option to participate according to the Vatican II rite.

11) Can a Priest who is authorized to celebrate using the 1962 Missal celebrate on the same day with the same Missal for another group of faithful who have received authorization?

No.

According to Archbishop Roche once again “It is not possible to grant bination on the grounds that there is no ‘just cause’ or ‘pastoral necessity’ as required by canon 905 §2: the right of the faithful to the celebration of the Eucharist is in no way denied since they are offered the possibility of participating in the Eucharist in its current ritual form.”

Conclusion

Pope Francis means business. In the months immediately following the promulgation of Traditionis Custodes I wondered whether the document would lead to any significant changes. Many bishops especially in the US were carrying on as usual and essentially ignoring the document. Some even invoked canon 87 §1 in order to dispense their dioceses from having to implement it.

The question now is whether they’ll listen. It is becoming increasingly clear that beyond the ongoing open attacks against the papacy by radical traditionalists the cold war between the US bishops and Pope Francis is beginning to heat up. Is this the start of a reckoning?

The legacy of Pope Francis and the Second Vatican Council are very much on the line and the future of the Church especially in the United States is at stake.

Notes:

[1] “Extreme unction” was the common English name for the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick before Vatican II.

[2] There are situations where a priest rather than a bishop does normally celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation such as when receiving an adult into the Church or in the danger of death and when delegated by the bishop for just cause. That said in the Latin Church the ordinary minister of the Sacrament of Confirmation is the bishop. The only minister of Holy Orders is a bishop.

You can’t possibly predict the future but you can plan for what is probable and make arrangements accordingly.

It’s no secret that recent supply chain trends have been less than predictable. A series of social and economic macro-shocks have radically affected the way consumers shop and interact with brands. And as the consumer experience has shifted supply chains have had to shift with it. The organizations having the most success are the ones that are adjusting their supply chains in advance of coming trends. They are planning ahead — not because they know exactly what is going to happen but because they know something will happen.

Here’s how technology is best used to prepare the supply chain to meet current trends and changing consumer demands.

Urbanization and speed

The combination of urbanization and speed to consumer is driving a significant shift in how supply chain networks are designed. The days are gone when the solution for all e-commerce challenges was building a single enormous fulfillment center in the middle of a cornfield. Now to meet the delivery speed needs of consumers organizations are looking to smaller fulfillment facilities located in or near the metropolitan market region they are serving. As the populations of these regions continue to grow the return on investment to justify standing up smaller fulfillment facilities within the regions grows as well. Placing these smaller urban fulfillment centers nearer to where consumers live allows organizations to get product into consumer hands within hours which is the new “free 2-day” standard delivery expectation.

From a technology perspective urban fulfillment centers require high storage density with high throughput. Automation providers have available and are currently deploying goods-to-person micro-fulfillment solutions in urban fulfillment centers. There are several variations on the theme (some are more space-efficient some provide higher throughput) but all facilitate a nimble and quick supply chain.

There are “close-to-consumer” fulfillment strategies across several industries. The primary ones leading the way are general merchandise and apparel. But there’s also durable manufacturing organizations placing small assembly operations and spare parts fulfillment near metro markets to meet the speed demands of consumers.

Sustainable packaging

The world continues to increasingly embrace the critical role of sustainability in the manufacture distribution and consumption of products. Consumers are looking for brands that are elevating environmental friendliness. As companies focus attention on carbon neutrality environmental efforts gain more weight and sustainable packaging becomes a priority. Best practices on packaging are both an effort to mitigate the negative impact of non-recoverable (single-use) materials and a way to fulfill customer expectations for positive management of environmental resources.

The biggest challenges are to avoid single-use packaging and to minimize non-used space. Trends for sustainable packaging include returnable/reusable containers bioplastics and edible films. In many cases it’s no longer practical or prudent to default to super-rigid rectangular packaging. And this new age of consumer packaging is creating a growing variety of more unique handling characteristics that material handling automation must be able to accommodate.

Companies are having to adapt their operations to address the challenges brought on by new packaging standardization new handling methods and changes in flow of inventory. Automation solutions featuring trays and totes to move goods through a facility are well suited for handling the variations and offer an excellent example for how technology can provide the necessary flexibility for supply chains to adapt quickly to change.

Individualization and consumer choice

The growing trend toward very specific consumer preferences (from extreme price consciousness to very specific dietary practices such as veganism) has given rise to products and solutions tailored to those preferences. To meet these unique needs manufacturers and retailers have been expanding their offerings with more choices. To survive this SKU proliferation there has been a shift to reduce lots sizes toward a sort of “lot-size-of-one” mentality (a unique choice for every individual).

Supply chains are now having to grapple with how best to cope with this shift. Typically the number of choices a company offers its customers will have an inverse relationship with the throughput of its supply chain. Early in the pandemic there was a retraction of product offerings as organizations placed a greater importance on supply chain throughput and volume. As a consumer you may have noticed fewer choices at your local retailer. That’s because those organizations focused their efforts and resources on only the highest-demanded products. Now after the initial disruption of the pandemic the number of offerings is increasing again and will continue to do so to meet consumer demands toward individualization.

An aging society’s impact on supply chains

Global population numbers continue to expand as expected lifespan metrics improve. Healthcare technology advancements across the world are driving the average age of the global population to rise. And with an aging population comes an aging workforce. Since the year 2000 the average age of the workforce has increased by approximately 5 years. As a result two key trends are affecting global supply chains:

· The need for more ergonomically friendly solutions to accommodate the aging workforce.

· The need for a combination of people and robotics in the workforce.

Creating a working environment that is more ergonomically friendly goes hand in hand with a flexible automation environment where people can focus on truly value-added tasks and robotics can handle repetitive labor-intensive tasks. A supply chain environment that is welcoming for a wide range of physical abilities will be critical for organizations to meet their operation goals particularly given the recent global labor challenges.

What’s going to happen next?

That’s the thing — nobody knows exactly what’s going to happen next in supply chains. But with a healthy understanding of current trends companies can plan ahead and look to automation technology to provide the flexibility to navigate through the disruptions ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Dutch Shell Plc is aiming to produce liquefied natural gas with a bio-component for use in heavy vehicles within about two years. Trucks using the fuel can travel for 1500 kilometers without refilling according to Shell which will make the new product at Rheinland the biggest oil-processing complex in Germany.

Shell’s move is among initiatives aimed at cutting carbon emissions at the Rheinland site which includes the Godorf plant where the “carbon-neutral” LNG will be made. Its sister facility Wesseling was the first European refinery to start production of green hydrogen last year albeit on a small scale. Shell plans to stop processing crude at Wesseling by 2025.

“LNG has one of the most energy-intensive processes across the oil and gas sector” said Seyhan Turan director of Altass Consulting whose clients include the European Commission and the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy. “Biomethane LNG is perfect for heavy-duty vehicles and maritime transport.”

Biomethane can be made from food waste or other organic matter. Shell said it will use manure that would otherwise release methane if left to rot in the farmyard.

Shell’s idea is to mix it with fuel made from natural gas resulting in a carbon-neutral product. The company is now looking at either buying or building biomethane plants it said. Chevron Corp. announced plans to build similar plants with a partner earlier this year.

The process of making biomethane will also usually yield carbon which could be sold to industrial clients according to Turan. Shell didn’t reply to an email asking whether that’s the case.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

By Ali Kucukgocmen

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has opened the ancient Chora church one of Istanbul's most celebrated Byzantine buildings to Muslim worshippers after it was used as a museum for more than 70 years making it the second such major conversion under President Tayyip Erdogan.

Erdogan a champion of pious Muslims in Turkey and head of a party with Islamist roots turned Istanbul's world-renowned Hagia Sophia from a museum into a mosque in 2020 in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.

That move was criticised by church leaders and some Western countries who said reconverting Hagia Sophia risked deepening religious rifts. Erdogan said this was interference in sovereign rights and that he was determined to protect Muslims' rights.

The original Chora or Kariye church dates back to the 4th Century and was turned into a mosque by the Ottomans. It became a museum in 1945 and Erdogan signed an order in 2020 converting it back into a mosque. It reopened on Monday after restoration.

The outer halls were preserved as a museum with visitors able to view the prized mosaics that dot the ceiling unhindered. Curtains concealed the mosaics in the building's prayer section in line with Muslim traditions.

People were seen lifting the coverings to look at the mosaics of Jesus and of Mary with the infant Jesus.

Ferdy Simon a British tourist said he would have preferred the building to remain as a museum so that people could see the mosaics and frescoes there. ""It seems to be a political gambit"" he said speaking outside the Chora.

""It's a bit of a shame when you see devout women who have come here to pray and they are told they can't go into the main narthex area"" he added referring to the fact that the main prayer section is reserved for males as in all mosques.

'POLITICAL GAIN'

Ugur Gokgoz a Turkish man who came to pray said it was Turkish people's right to use the Chora as a mosque adding that the artefacts inside the museum were preserved.

""There was a small section reserved for prayer. At the end they didn't tear everything down and turned it into a mosque"" he said.

A church was first built at the site in the 4th century but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake.

The Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora built near the ancient city walls of Constantinople contains 14th century mosaics and frescoes showing scenes from biblical stories.

They were plastered over after the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 but brought to light when - like Hagia Sophia - it was converted to a museum by Turkey's secular republic in 1945.

Burcin Altinsay Ozguner Turkey head of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the Chora artefacts are unique and the best way to make them available for researchers is to maintain the building as a museum.

""Of course there are political gains behind it"" she said adding there was no obvious need for a mosque in the case of both Hagia Sophia and Chora with mosques right next to them.

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

The parishioners are all here. The clergy are too. Well sort of — if you count avatars powered by artificial intelligence.

Today's service features a sermon prayers and songs brought to you almost entirely by ChatGPT.

While AI-led services haven't become mainstream scientists and theologians are exploring how new technology can coexist with some of the world's oldest teachings.

In places like Temple B'Nai Or in Morristown New Jersey the congregation made up of scientists young and old sets out to answer a question: What is a human? And does allowing technology into a fundamentally human experience like faith alter it somehow?

""We started looking at the future that is now and had questions of AI and you know even uploading our mind to the cloud things like that"" Rabbi Michael Satz told Scripps News.

Satz says it isn't the first time the nearly 4000-year-old religion has had to grapple with change.

""My ancestors wrote the Torah in the scroll — 2000 years ago the new technology was to have a book. And so the ancient rabbis had to ask the question can we liturgically use a book when we read the Torah? And they decided no you need to read out of the scroll because that's connecting us to our ancestors"" he said.

Today they're faced with similar questions.

""How do we look at AI as a tool that can help us be who we are rather than help us divide ourselves from others?"" Satz asked.

But can AI answer the tougher questions of spirituality like ""What's the one true religion?""; ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""; ""What happens after you die?""

""I can see people turning to AI as a start as a research tool for those questions and see what have the great Jewish teachers said about this question in the past?"" said Satz.

Congress A congressman wanted to understand AI. So he went back to college AP via Scripps News

Kutter Callaway an associate professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary and an adviser with AI and Faith agrees the human touch is necessary.

""Depending upon what data sets it's using we get an intense amount of bias within AI right now"" Callaway told Scripps News. ""And it reflects shock and awe the same bias that we have as humans. And so having someone that is actually a kind of wise guide or mentor to help you discern how to even interpret understand the results that AI is giving you is really important.""

But Callaway says there's good that can come from AI like translating the Bible into various languages.

""That is a very difficult task when it requires on-the-ground humans who know a language really well. But when assisted through AI all of a sudden you have a tool that actually can speed up that process quite a lot"" he said.

Rabbi Geoff Mitelman who helped found the studies at Temple B'Nai Or through his organization Sinai and Synapses agrees saying AI can be an aid in study.

""The best sermons that I ever find ... that I ever hear are when a rabbi sees a word in one text that is used in some other text and links the two of them"" Mitelman said. ""AI can very very quickly say 'Yes here's all the places where this text is used' and then the rabbi can then say 'Oh that's interesting I hadn't seen that connection before but I wouldn't have known this might connect here.'""

However there are concerns across religions about the interpretation of such texts bias and misinformation.

""The spread of misinformation and how easy it is to create and then spread misinformation whether that's using something like Dall-E or ChatGPT or videos and also algorithms that will spread misinformation — because at least for hundreds of thousands of years it was better for humans to trust than to not trust right?"" said Mitelman.

That cautious view of AI and religion seems to translate across practices a poll from the Christian research group Barna shows.

Over half of Christians 52% said they'd be disappointed if they found out AI was used in their church.

In 2020 leaders from the Roman Catholic Church IBM and Microsoft signed the Rome Call for AI Ethics a joint agreement that would eventually include leaders from Judaism Christianity and Islam to make sure future usage of AI is transparent inclusive responsible and impartial.

But no matter how far the technology goes all three agree the embrace of AI and religious life won't happen overnight.

""Our tradition tells us when two people are studying Torah together the divine presence is with them. And I think you know using AI being with AI can be isolating because you're not with other real flesh-and-blood people"" said Satz.

It's just like when places of worship turned to Zoom: Four years later people are slowly coming back to in-person services. The clergy we spoke to said there's a reason for that.

""If you think about so many of the great conversations that you've had or meetings that you've had how many of them were just sort of serendipitous conversations that you had in the parking lot or at services or you know so much of the joy of life are the unexpected meetings"" said Mitelman.

""Often Christian worship is supposed to be cumbersome. It's supposed to be inconvenient. It requires you to bring your body into a space with other bodies and celebrate the broken and bruised body of the God that we worship"" Callaway said.

Which leads back to that church service in Germany and the idea of bots someday replacing faith leaders.

""I think probably yes it is coming and faster than we think"" said Callaway. ""To me depending upon an algorithm essentially to deliver to us what I think is a moment where humans commune with other humans and with God — if you remove the humans from that equation then it's very quickly you're removing God from the equation too.""

Mitelman agrees.

""I think I would be a fool to say that's never going to happen. I think that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility but I don't think it's going to be hugely accepted"" he said. ""People need humanity here whether that's Christianity Islam Hinduism. So much of religion is not just faith but it is a physical manifestation. So is that kneeling is that kissing the Torah scroll is that standing or sitting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former church in South Lorain deemed a nuisance city orders emergency demolition,"A former church located at 1715 E. 31st St. in South Lorain was demolished May 10 because city officials learned vagrants had been inside the structure and partying and maybe even a squatter or two spending time in it.

Dave Faciana chief building official for the city of Lorain’s Building Housing and Planning Department said the Lorain Police Department alerted him May 9 that there were youngsters going inside of the former church.

Faciana said he and one of his building inspectors visited the church later that day and noticed that the roof had collapsed and that someone could fall through it especially on the second floor where the joists are weak.

“At that point I determined that it was an unsafe structure” he said. “We’re doing an emergency demolition.”

American Demolition razed the building.

Faciana said the city doesn’t do emergency demolitions often but this structure fell into that category.

“If there’s an issue and we find out that it’s an unsafe structure and vagrants or squatters in it at that point we determine if it’s unsafe and the hazards of if so that no one gets hurt.”

There was no evidence that people were living in the building but they should not have been in there Faciana said.

“They were in there doing God knows what” he said.

Faciana said the building has been vacant at least five years.

The owners are aware of the city razing the building he said.

The Morning Journal contacted the Lorain County Auditor’s on May 10 to get the names of the owners and contact them for comment.

“We are having issues with our website currently at that’s why you can’t get any owner/address information” according to a statement from the Auditor’s Office. “We don’t have any record of a 1715 E. 31st.”

However for where that address would fall there is an owner the statement said.

Since The Journal cannot confirm the name of the owner it is omitting the name.

However once the building is demolished the owners will receive and invoice from the city for the cost of the flattening the structure.

“If they don’t pay that cost the cost will be assessed to their taxes” Faciana said.

It will cost about $50000 to tear down the building he said.

“This is just another example of a dilapidated building that’s been sitting in Lorain for a long time and these are the things the city needs to do to make it a better community safe for the residents and get rid of these blighted dilapidated buildings” Faciana said."

Dr Aisah Dahlan menyebutkan dalam video di kanal YouTube Muslim Harus Tahu yang diunggah pada 12 Juli 2020 lalu.

Menurutnya pria mau berhubungan intim dulu baru dia akan memberikan cinta.

Dengan kesadaran tinggi lebih terasa kebahagiannya itu.

""Apa yang diinginkan pria saat bercinta pembebasan ketegangan yang menumpuk karena pekerjaan dan dia ingin lepaskan dengan pencapaian orgasme"" sebut dr Aisah Dahlan.

dr Aisah Dahlan mengatakan kalau sudah lepas tegangnya baru laki-laki memberikan cinta sama istrinya.

""Tetapi kalau tidak paham liat wajah kita lurus nggak denger penat jadi marahkan kita"" katanya.

""Apa yang diinginkan wanita dalam bercinta wanita harus membangun ketegangan dalam waktu panjang dengan berbagai persyaratan yaitu perhatian dari pasangan yang bicara"" jelasnya.

Networking job types

Network engineer: one of the most versatile and highly sought after networking professionals. Network engineers focus on designing optimizing and developing networking infrastructure but they also frequently assist with ongoing network management.

Network technician: primarily handles tactical upgrades bug fixes and troubleshooting for network hardware and software.

Network administrator: think of this role as the network’s operations manager. Network administrators handle most maintenance monitoring and general management features of a network after it’s set up. They are also frequently in charge of designating responsibilities to other networking roles.

Network support specialist: frequently more user experience (UX) focused. If a network or its components are experiencing outages or other problems this individual acts as the communication liaison between the users and solutions they need.

Network security engineer: focuses on developing technical physical and regulatory safeguards to secure different components of a network. They may work closely with a network administrator especially when focusing on network monitoring needs.

The injury occurred with less than two minutes remaining in the first quarter as the Texans returned a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. The Jaguars are currently trailing the Texans 14-3 in a battle between two 2-11 teams.

Jenkins was seen riving in pain on the ground for several minutes while being attended to by trainers. He would later be carted off the field with something around his injured ankle. He would be immediately ruled out for the remainder of the contest.

Jenkins a fifth-year veteran was signed during the offseason as one of the team’s top free-agent signees. He has started all 13 games for the team this year. He accounted for 73 combined tackles (56 solos) one tackle for loss and a QB hit. He added three pass breakups. Jenkins played for the Los Angeles Chargers over the past four years of the season.

For Jacksonville they’ll be losing one of their key players and captains one of seven named by former Jaguars HC Urban Meyer at the start of the season. Now they’ll turn to second-year safety Daniel Thomas likely for the remainder of the season if Jenkins’ season is indeed over.

The Jaguars have another option at safety too a second-round pick in safety Andre Cisco. Cisco could see more snaps as the season goes on as a result of Jenkins’ injury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5dGltZXMubGsvMjExMjE5L2J1c2luZXNzLXRpbWVzL25jaW5nYS1lbXBvd2Vycy10ZWxlY29tLWZpamktNDY1NTg3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NCINGA empowers Telecom Fiji | Print Edition - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,"NCINGA empowers Telecom Fiji View(s):

Reuters-Yonhap



By Park Jae-hyuk



Multiple global investment banks have promoted many of their Korean senior executives recently in light of the contribution of lucrative deals on the Korean market to their earnings this year according to industry officials Sunday.



The latest example of this was Credit Suisse (CS) which announced Wednesday that it had appointed both Shim Jong-min and Kim Sei-won as new managing directors ― a rank below partners.



Shim who was born in 1981 became the youngest managing director working at the Seoul offices of global investment banks. After working for Macquarie and Nomura he joined CS in 2014 and handled the sale of Asiana Airlines last year and the initial public offering (IPO) of KakaoBank this year. He also advised on Korean Air's sales of its in-flight meal and duty-free businesses Olive Young's pre-IPO IMM Private Equity's sale of Taihan Cable & Solution and SK E&S' issuance of redeemable convertible preferred shares.



Kim who worked for UBS and served as the chief financial officer of a local fashion firm Nanda advised on SK's investments in Vingroup and Masan Group as well as on Doosan's sales of its subsidiaries and Carlyle's investment in KB Financial Group. He also participated in Krafton's IPO allowing his company to make a handsome profit from the deal.

Goldman Sachs promoted Lee Seok-yong and Park Ji-eun to managing directors last month.



Since former Goldman Sachs Korea co-head Choi Dong-suk was appointed a managing director in 2010 this is the first time for Korean executives of the U.S. firm's Seoul office to be promoted to managing directors. Although Goldman Sachs appoints its new managing directors biennially the position is only allowed to 6 percent of its entire employees worldwide.



Lee who worked for Boston Consulting Group is known for his expertise in the tech media and telecommunication businesses ― he advised on Kakao Pay's IPO Coupang's listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the sale of Woowa Brothers.



Park who majored in economics and mathematics at Columbia University and earned a Master's in financial mathematics from New York University has specialized in derivatives markets.

Forty-six of the 114 electors in the finance functional constituency are banks from Europe North America and other parts of Asia a review by HKFP of information from the Registration and Electoral Office has found. The constituency will elect one member of the new “patriots only” 90-seat Legislative Council.

Of the list of foreign-owned banking companies that are electors eight are headquartered in the US including banking giants JPMorgan Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Other banks with a vote include Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Switzerland’s UBS. A total of 20 countries and Taiwan are represented on the list of banks that are registered electors.

The Bank of Taiwan is also among the electors at a time of unprecedented cross-strait tensions.

The Legislative Council polls will be the first since Beijing’s sweeping electoral revamp which has sharply reduced democratic representation. All candidates were screened through a multi-step process led by government officials to ensure that they are “patriots.”

Foreign governments hold partial ownership of a number of the financial institutions registered to vote. NatWest is more than 50 per cent owned by the British state. Commerzbank’s biggest shareholder is the German government which owns 15 per cent.

‘China’s internal affair’

Despite the fact that foreign banks have long held votes in Legislative Council elections Beijing leaders and Chinese state media in the run-up to the latest polls have repeatedly warned unspecified “western forces” to stay out of the process.

“Hong Kong’s election is China’s internal affair” Pan Yundong the deputy commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said on Wednesday. “We will not allow any foreign forces to make irresponsible remarks with their ulterior motives.”

State-run newspaper People’s Daily lambasted Lo Kin-hei chair of the Democratic Party calling him a “chess pawn of foreign forces” in a Thursday editorial for allegedly blocking party candidates from running in the elections.

The Democratic Party did not put forward any candidates after saying that no members had applied to run. Other traditional opposition parties also did not field candidates.

Most pro-democracy figures are behind bars in self-exile abroad have quit politics or are barred from running.

Beijing-led electoral overhaul

Beijing’s overhaul increased the number of seats in the Legislative Council from 70 to 90 but only 20 seats – belonging to the geographical constituencies – will be directly elected by the public compared to 35 previously.

The Election Committee which consists of pro-Beijing loyalists will vote for 40 members. The remaining 30 seats will be polled in close-circle elections by registered voters in special interest groups known as functional constituencies such as the finance tourism and education constituencies.

Two candidates are contesting the finance constituency this year including the incumbent Ronick Chan a Bank of China adviser. He is running against Owens Chan a non-executive director at an Australia-based health and nutrition company.",,,,,,,,,

The remaining 70% of the electricity needs of 435 lakh units for TTD and its allied temples around Tirumala Hills is being supplied by Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited.The TTD spends around Rs 40 crore towards electricity bill every year. It now wants to reduce the energy expenditure by Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore by implementing energy conservation and efficiency measures. The TTD is examining the recommendations of the ‘investment grade energy audit’ that suggested replacing of its old pump sets with energy efficiency pump sets.The TTD has decided to replace 5000 ordinary fans with super-efficient BLDC (brushless direct current) fans in the first phase with about Rs 1.35 crore. It is estimated to save 0.88 million units per annum with Rs 62 lakh monetary savings and payback period of 26 months.The TTD is planning to go for 2.2 MW rooftop solar systems in all colleges and schools in Tirupati and TTD buildings in Tirumala with the support of the state-level agencies like New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP). As part of energy efficiency and environmental protection measures TTD is also promoting electric mobility in Tirumala and Tirupati.During a webinar with the energy secretary and APSECM officials on Friday on the eve of national energy conservation week-2021 TTD executive officer K Jawahar Reddy said the TTD has taken every measure to ensure best services to all its devotees.“Eco-friendly energy efficient practices would showcase TTD as a world class energy efficient temple across the globe” said Jawahar Reddy.Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said energy efficiency is equally important for a sustainable future.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2NvYWwtc3R1ZGRlZC13aXRoLXJvY2tzLWFuZC1tdWQtaXMtaW5kaWFzLW5ldy1lbmVyZ3ktaGVhZGFjaGUvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgzNTM1ODIuY21z0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvcG93ZXIvY29hbC1zdHVkZGVkLXdpdGgtcm9ja3MtYW5kLW11ZC1pcy1pbmRpYXMtbmV3LWVuZXJneS1oZWFkYWNoZS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgzNTM1ODIuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coal studded with rocks and mud is India’s new energy headache,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Ruias-led Essar Exploration & Production Ltd ( EEPL ) and partner Italy’s Eni plan to start production from their offshore block in Vietnam in 2024-25 a top Essar executive said.Discovered in 2019 Block 114 is the largest hydrocarbon find in South East Asia in two decades and is estimated to hold about 2 billion barrels of oil and gas resource according to Essar. Eni is the operator with 50% participating interest in the block. EEPL holds the balance stake.The partners have already drilled three wells in the block and plan to drill one more appraisal well in 2022. A field development plan will be prepared latest by mid-2023 based on the data from the appraisal wells Pankaj Kalra CEO EEPL Mauritius  told ET. Once the field development plan is approved the big task of drilling development wells and setting up processing platforms will begin.“We will go for early monetization by putting up modular facilities. The production should start by 2024-25” said Kalra. Early monetization means explorers can start commercial production from discoveries made early in the contract period without waiting for the approval of the development plan for the entire field.Essar didn’t share production or investment estimates as these are yet to be approved by the Vietnamese regulator. Block 114 which is in the shallow waters of the Song Hong basin in Vietnam has already received an investment of more than $300 million as per Essar.“We are confident that this block will provide strong impetus for Vietnam to become self-sufficient in its energy requirements in the future’’ Prashant Ruia director Essar Capital said in a statement. Essar Capital is the investment arm of the Essar group.Prashant Ruia and Essar group founder Ravi Ruia recently met with Vuong Dinh Hue chairman of the national assembly of Vietnam and Le Manh Hung the deputy prime minister of the country to discuss the investments of Essar group and potential collaboration and business opportunities in Vietnam as per the company statement.

It symbolized how the city was big and important enough to attract one bringing with it jobs and a boost to the economy. And the plant’s huge display windows let families enjoy watching the workers bottle soft drinks.

Now Broward County is well underway with restoring this old landmark — at 644 S. Andrews Ave. situated just south of a Publix supermarket — to its former splendor in the city’s downtown. At least from the outside it will start to resemble what it looked like more than 80 years ago with dozens of replica windows and the same color scheme of paint.

“A lot of people are excited to finally see it coming back to life” said architect Merrill Romanik. “The branding of Coca-Cola is embedded in our culture. When they introduced this bottling plant to downtown Fort Lauderdale it had a strong impact to the community.”

Rick Ferrer the county’s Historic Preservation Officer said the plant’s construction “was considered a big deal for the city because it signified economic recovery during the Depression; only large cities got Coca-Cola plants.”

When the Chamber of Commerce publicly boasted about Fort Lauderdale’s top job-makers in July of 1940 the company was on the list with a whopping $20000 in payroll a year.

Coca-Cola stayed in the headlines for just about any update: In 1941 the Fort Lauderdale News detailed how the wife of a top bottling executive came by train from Chicago with two babies a nurse and 17 pieces of luggage to stay in their winter home in Idlewyld for the season.

The company bottled soda for decades in its two-story building with a third-story belfry that some experts said had no bell. In 1976 Coca-Cola relocated to Pembroke Park and in 1978 the nearly 2-acre site sold to a cable company. The interior was gutted and the new owners renovated the exterior by removing the huge display windows.

The county which owns the former plant building began a $3.1 million construction project in October and it is expected to be wrapped up sometime next summer.

The inside is a shell; Broward County officials said it has not yet been decided what will be inside although office space is most likely expected.

Romanik said the reconstruction includes a new roof with barrel tile intended to replicate the original. So are three large picture windows.

“That’s where kids used to be able to look through the windows (to see workers) pour syrup in the bottles and make Coke” she said. “Those large picture windows are coming back. We are working with a window company and we are bringing them back.”

There are also 36 steel wrought iron windows that are being restored she said.

The building will again become off-white with golden yellow as the accent.

This building wasn’t the city’s first bottling plant.

The first one opened in 1914 in a one-story building at Southwest First Avenue and Southwest Sixth Street its exact address unknown according to county staff. Among its earliest clientele were the Seminole Indians.

“Purchasing and consumption would have shifted to construction workers and realty brokers during the 1920s when real estate transactions development and construction increased exponentially” Ferrer said.

But the plant built new and relocated because business was booming.

A local headline blasted it would “move to larger quarters to meet demand” after sales were up purportedly ninefold. The plant was working “night and day” and Sundays to make 900 cases a day but the demand for Coca-Cola was far greater. The new plant along Andrews Avenue was projected to make 1000 cases every 8-hour shift according to the newspaper.

There were already bottling plants in Homestead Palm Beach and Miami and the 1939 grand opening was held “with much fanfare and a street festival” according to Ferrer.

Ariadna Musarra the county’s director of the Construction Management Division said architects are relying on blueprints from the bottling plants of its sister facility in Ocala which is on the National Register of Historic Places and now privately owned.

But not everything will be restored.

The bottling company’s name for example will not be branded back on the building because it’s trademarked and owned by Coca-Cola. A corporate spokesperson could not be reached for comment.

Historical experts say it’s a relief to know some preservation is underway.

“Returning things to how it looked historically it gives the city more character” said Ellery Andrews History Fort Lauderdale deputy director. “It brings awareness to what we used to be like how we’ve grown. ... There’s so much history.”

Phil Mooney was the historian and archivist for the Coca-Cola Company for 36 years. He’s now retired and still living in Georgia. He said the “strength of the company” is that the bottling plants were run by local people “who knew the community” and joined the Rotary Clubs and the Chambers by design.

He said there were about 1200 bottling plants nationwide in the late 1920s and 1930s and the picture windows were a staple throughout: “You wanted the community to see what was going on to see the manufacturing process get a sense of quality and purity. There was no hiding the process they wanted you to see it.”

He said there were generally three designs for bottling plants a small medium and large version and often made with brick “so when you went from town to town you said ‘Oh it’s a Coca-Cola plant!’”

“It’s fantastic” Mooney said of the restoration efforts. “It takes us back to a simpler time of life reflective of a point of time in the community. It’s a good snapshot of history.”

Mantle Ridge run by Paul Hilal “couldn’t have a better partner” than the one it struck with Richard Dreiling a former Dollar General Corp. (DG) CEO Mushkin said on the Activist Investing Today podcast.

On the podcast Mushkin said he suspects Mantle Ridge will have some success with its efforts especially as Dollar Tree has significantly underperformed its chief rival Dollar General; the S&P 500 index; and other retailers.

Mantle Ridge wants to revamp Dollar Tree’s pricing strategy. After conducting surveys Mushkin suggested that the discount retailer’s recent rollout of a price increase from $1 to $1.25 for many items could be comparable to Coca-Cola Co. (KO)’s problematic 1985 release of “New Coke.”

“Dollar Tree’s brand is so tied to ‘everything is a dollar’ so you have to be careful about doing [multi-price] without destroying your brand” he said.

Mushkin also discussed Engaged Capital LLC-targeted Hain Celestial Inc.’s (HAIN) M&A strategy noting that it was unlikely that the organic foods maker will be sold to a large packaged foods company any time soon. “From our understanding if there was an offer that was reasonable they would definitely have considered it” Mushkin said.

Mushkin who was an analyst most recently at Wolfe Research launched R5 Capital last year to provide research and strategic consulting advice to consumer-focused companies including retailers.

Bottlers Nepal produces and sells Coca Cola in Nepal. Issuing a public notice on Friday the DRI has asked the executives concerned to be present at the department within a week. “In case of their failure to present at the DRI within the date stipulated in the notice no complaint petition shall be entertained and action shall be taken in accordance with the Revenue Leakage (Investigation and Control) Act 1995” reads the DRI notice.

The revenue investigation body has issued a caution notice against 15 executives of Bottlers Nepal. These include chairperson of the company Shukla Wassan an Indian citizen from Gurgaon India.

Likewise Managing Director Puneet Chandrapal Varshney and directors Melvin Tan Chun Pin Gaurav Khosla Sundeep Bajoria Debabrata Mukherjee Sumanta Datta Jawahar Solai Kuppuswamy and Sanket Ray are among the Indian nationals against whom the DRI has stepped up its actions. Managing Director Salman Latif Rawn from Pakistan Finance Manager Sumit Goyal from Malaysia and Director Mohamed Amin Ghoneim from Singapore are also among those DRI plans to file cases on revenue leakage.

The DRI has also sought to take action against foreign citizens Denise Marie-Louise Lauwens Keith Ian Stacey and Choliya De Silva whose countries of origin have not been disclosed.

On suspicion of evading tax the DRI has been investigating the multinational company since last year. Bottlers Nepal has been accused of evading capital gain tax while transferring the promoters’ shares of foreign stakeholder six years ago.

According to the DRI officials Coca Cola Southwest Asia Holdings Limited one of the main investors of Bottlers Nepal had sold a large amount of its stakes in the Nepal-based company to Bottling Investments Group. But the company has failed to notify officially the government authority concerned in Nepal in an apparent bid to evade tax.

Bottlers Nepal has an issued capital of Rs 430 million and a paid-up capital of Rs 194.80 million. Three-fourth of the company’s capital is held by the foreign companies while the rest of the shares are in the name of domestic investors that includes 22 percent from the Khetan Group."

Here’s a full list of all the draftees.

First Round

1. San Diego Wave FC

Naomi Girma D Stanford University

With the No. 1 overall pick of the draft San Diego selected defender Naomi Girma out of Stanford University. A two-time Pac-12 Defender of the Year Girma won the NCAA Championship with Stanford in 2019. Starting in 67 out of 68 career games Girma is a solid defender who brings leadership experience having captained Stanford for the past three seasons and served as captain of the U20 national team.

2. Racing Louisville FC

Jaelin Howell M Florida State University

After being passed on by San Diego Jaelin Howell will take her talents to Louisville as the No. 2 overall pick of the college draft. The midfielder had a decorated career at Florida State twice winning a national championship and earning First Team All-American honors as a senior. The 2020 MAC Hermann Trophy winner Howell scored 14 goals in her college career while also recording 14 assists through 90 games.

3. North Carolina Courage

Emily Gray M Virginia Tech

As a midfielder Gray will be able to fill some holes for the Courage after they traded away Sam Mewis to Kansas City. While the team added Brianna Pinto in a trade with Gotham FC the addition of Gray will add more depth to the Courage’s midfield. Gray was excellent in her senior season scoring 12 goals and adding eight assists for the Hokies – nearly half of the team’s total.

4. Racing Louisville FC

Savannah DeMelo CM USC

DeMelo is a versatile midfielder primarily being used as an attacking midfielder at USC but also holding the abilities to play out on the left or in a deeper role. This past fall also saw her play in a multitude of ways including as a striker. Through 20 games played this season she scored four goals as well as seven assists. She’ll bolster a midfielder group that is now being led by Jessica McDonald after a trade with the North Carolina Courage.

5. Orlando Pride

Mia Fishel F UCLA

After departing with much of their roster during the offseason – including the departure of Alex Morgan to San Diego – the addition of Fishel is significant and could wind up being an absolute steal. In 59 games she scored 32 goals and added 14 assists moving into the Bruins’ top 10 all-time goal scorers in just three seasons. Not to mention Fishel will be reuniting with her collegiate head coach in Amanda Cromwell who was recently named head coach of the Orlando Pride.

6. North Carolina Courage

Diana Ordoñez F University of Virginia

A semifinalist for the 2021 MAC Hermann Trophy Ordoñez’s 45 career goals is tied for third most all-time at Virginia. She led the ACC in goals during the 2021 season and is a three-time All-ACC selection including a First Team selection in 2021. The Courage traded away Jessica McDonald to Racing Louisville FC for this pick and Ordoñez should provide some depth to a line that is led by USWNT forward Lynn Williams.

7. Kansas City Current

Elyse Bennett F Washington State University

Bennett will be joining a forward group led by Jéssica Silva and Kristen Hamilton giving her time to develop as a forward to the pro level. A high-powered scorer Bennett spent five seasons at Washington State playing in 93 games and scoring 26 goals while adding 12 assists. She had a career-high 10 goals in her senior season through 21 games and finished her season being named a Second Team All-American by the United Soccer Coaches organization.

8. OL Reign

Zsanett Kajan F St. John’s University

A forward out of Hungary Kajan is an offensive powerhouse having scored 16 goals in 18 games during the 2021 season. Throughout her five year career the forward scored 45 goals in 87 career appearances and was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year twice. She also has national team experience earning her first cap for the Hungarian National Team at 16 years old. While the Reign have a lot of depth at forward with Megan Rapinoe Bethany Balcer and Tziarra King Kajan will be able to develop her game with some of the NWSL’s best.

9. San Diego Wave FC

Marleen Schimmer M/F Grand Canyon University

After transferring to Grand Canyon Schimmer started in 15 games during the 2021 season scoring 13 goals and notching 14 assists. She also has international experience having played on the U17 German National Team at the 2017 U17 UEFA Championship. She’ll get to develop under one of the world’s best in San Diego with Alex Morgan and could compete for minutes in the 2022 season.

10. Orlando Pride

Caitlin Cosme D Duke University

Cosme anchored one of the top defenses of the country at center back leading the Blue Devils in minutes played with 1829 and scoring three goals. With the departure of Ali Krieger Cosme could fight for minutes while also learning from Pride defender Amy Turner.

11. Orlando Pride

Julie Doyle F Santa Clara University

A member of the 2020 National Champion Santa Clara Broncos Doyle sat out the fall season after using up her eligibility. Excellent in 1-on-1 situations Doyle can play either on the wing or underneath a lone striker. With the Pride looking to bolster their roster she could step in immediately and compete for minutes.

12. North Carolina Courage

Kaitlin Fregulia D Long Beach State University

The Courage continue to bolster their defense which is led by Abby Erceg and Carson Pickett. As a redshirt senior during the 2021 season Fregulia started in 18 games while amassing a total of 1608 minutes. She led a defense that recorded five shutouts while also tallying one goal and one assist. While she may have an uphill battle when it comes to competing for playing time Fregulia will be able to learn from some of the league’s best and could develop into a solid starter in North Carolina.

Zappe completed 33-of-47 attempts for 422 yards and six touchdowns to lead the Hilltoppers to a 59-38 victory over Appalachian State in a shootout at FAU Stadium on the campus of Florida Atlantic University.

The fifth-year senior who took advantage of an extra season of eligibility broke the NCAA's single-season touchdown and passing records in the final game of his collegiate career.

""Our main goal was to come into this game … was to get this championship and we were able to do that and also break those records so it makes it that much better"" Zappe said.

Zappe's 10-yard touchdown pass -- his fourth of the half -- to Jerreth Sterns in the final minute of the second quarter was his 60th of the season tying the NCAA single-season touchdown record set by former LSU quarterback Joe Burrow.

He broke the record on Western Kentucky's second possession of the second half with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Mitchell Tinsley.

Three plays before tying the touchdown record Zappe also broke the NCAA single-season passing record with a 43-yard pass to Sterns. He finished the game with 5967 passing yards and 62 passing touchdowns on the season.

""To have the game that we played and to be able to break those records with Bailey on our team we couldn't write a better story"" Western Kentucky head coach Tyson Helton said.

The teams essentially traded scores throughout the first half as Western Kentucky led 31-24 but the Hilltoppers pulled away in the second.

Appalachian State (10-4) got the ball first after the break but running back Camerun Peoples fumbled and Western Kentucky defensive end Jaques Evans recovered. Western Kentucky running back Noah Whittington ran 86 yards into the end zone on the very next play putting the Hilltoppers ahead 38-24.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Appalachian State wide receiver Jalen Virgil runs for a touchdown during the first quarter of the Boca Raton Bowl against Western Kentucky Saturday Dec. 18 2021 in Boca Raton Fla.

Western Kentucky (9-5) outscored the Mountaineers 21-7 in the third quarter. The lone score for Appalachian State during that span came on a 62-yard pass from quarterback Chase Brice to Malik Williams with 3:25 remaining.

Brice completed 15-of-23 attempts for 317 yards and four scores but he also had one interception.

""They made more plays than we did"" Appalachian State head coach Shawn Clark said after the game.

Zappe transferred to Western Kentucky from Houston Baptist where he threw for more than 8000 yards and 73 touchdowns in three seasons as a starter.

South Florida was well-represented in the Boca Raton Bowl. The teams have a combined 32 players on their rosters from Florida -- 20 for Appalachian State and 12 for Western Kentucky. That includes 17 players who hail from Palm Beach Broward or Miami-Dade counties.

The Mountaineers ended their season with a loss for the first time since moving up to the Football Bowl Subdivision level in 2014.

Beyond the unexpected outages and occasional bouts of slow speeds companies like Comcast also stack inexplicable additional charges on customers’ bills. Among the worst of these charges are the dreaded data caps or “data usage plans” as Comcast calls them.

Many internet providers either charge customers extra who use too much data in a billing cycle or ask them to pay even more for unlimited data. For over a year Comcast has planned to expand data caps to even more US states. But for the third time this year it has delayed those plans.

Comcast data caps delayed once again

Earlier this week Light Reading reported that Comcast has given up on rolling out data caps in the Northeast in 2022. Initially the company had planned to implement the caps in March of 2021. There was backlash and so the company announced it would delay the implementation to July. Then before the end of February Comcast scrapped plans to bring data caps to Northeast states in 2021 at all. The rollout would commence at some point in 2022 but Comcast didn’t offer a specific date.

It turns out that the date would not have mattered anyway as 2022 is now apparently off the table as well. “We don’t have plans to implement our data usage plan in our Northeast markets in 2022 at this time” a Comcast official told Light Reading.

Is Comcast giving up on its plans?

The publication contacted Comcast regarding the delay following a recent report from WHAV in which Massachusetts State Representative Andy X. Vargas claimed that Comcast had completely abandoned its plans to bring data caps to the Northeast. In other words no data caps in 2023 or beyond.

“The latest we have is that they have no intention of reintroducing the data caps at all which is a huge win” Vargas told WHAV earlier this week. That isn’t quite what Comcast told Light Reading.

Thrilled about this outcome– data caps were set to be reintroduced in 2022 but Comcast now has no plans to reintroduce them. Thanks to all who wrote and advocated with us! Ensuring fair competition and consumer choice is next. #datacaps #digitalequityhttps://t.co/NgklQX9Z0J — Andy X. Vargas (@RepAndyVargas) December 15 2021

As WHAV notes Rep. Vargas Rep. Dave Rogers and more Massachusetts legislators sent a letter to Comcast last New Year’s urging the provider to “reconsider any future attempts at imposing a data cap or any perversion of the principles of net neutrality in Massachusetts.”

Here’s how the Comcast internet data usage works according to the company’s website:

The 1.2 Terabyte Internet Data Usage plan includes 1.2 terabytes (TB) of Internet data each month as part of your monthly Xfinity Internet Service. In markets where the plan is in place customers not on an Unlimited Data plan who use more than 1.2 TB in a month will automatically incur an additional charge of $10 plus tax for each block of 50 GB. Maximum monthly overage charges will not exceed $100 no matter how much data a customer uses each month.

Comcast notes that customers who go over the limit will receive a one-time credit waiving overage charges. This will only work once and is applied automatically.

Comcast National Grid hike rates by double-digit percentages

In the spirit of the season — as defined by Scrooge — Comcast and National Grid have sent greetings to their customers in the form of announcements of incredible rate increases. If you haven't received yours be prepared!

Comcast is upping rates on all sorts of things. As an example a TV box that has been in our home for years will go from a monthly cost of $2.50 to $8.10! The Regional Sports Fee will rise from $10.75 to $14.10. That is a service I never even use but I am apparently required to have it in my home maybe in case of unexpected sports fans visiting?

I suppose that I should be grateful that the price of the modem rental was not raised from the already outrageous $14 a month. Or did I miss seeing that increase?

But Comcast has been outdone by National Grid! Since my last bill for $40.49 my charges have gone up to — wait for it — $196.48. Yes that's almost $156. For one month. The first day of winter has yet to come. And I keep my home fairly cool — 66 to 68 degrees downstairs usually and even cooler upstairs.

I have spoken with some others also retirees who have had shocking bills. One pensioner's bill went up at least $200. We used to hear stories about retirees on fixed incomes having to choose between food and medicine. Now some may have to add phone and gas bills to the ""which-bill-should-I-pay"" lottery.

COVID vaccines go way beyond personal rights

As I looked at the cartoon of Santa telling a health-care provider that he couldn’t make people care (Dec. 10) it was probably the saddest commentary I’ve read since this pandemic began.

As a retired nurse I react with anger at people who use the most frivolous of excuses not to be vaccinated. I am constantly amazed at those who believe the nonsensical information floating around without checking with science or medicine. This is way beyond personal rights. Vaccination is important for the whole community’s rights. Continuing to be selfish and self-absorbed will not help this pandemic go away.

A wealth tax should be tied to asset value not income

During this Christmas season of high inflation paired with gift-product scarcity and struggle for those with limited resources — many who haven't significantly benefited from the generous recent family-oriented federal programs — it's apropos for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to (again) bring up the overriding issue of fair taxation.

However most parties offering constructive input into this discussion tend to discuss wealth taxes in terms of income adjustments rather than asset assessments the latter being a far better barometer of measuring ""rich."" If income becomes the object of our balancing efforts we can expect the richest among us to launch a phalanx of high-priced CPAs to vastly reduce countable income to absurd levels to continue tax avoidance under new fairer-taxation parameters.

With personal/corporate asset determination as a guide — after sorting out asset redistribution (for example 2-year-olds ""earning"" vast sums or other entities where funds are parked to avoid taxes) and a retro effective date for determining assets rather than future which would give CPAs opportunities to ""work their wonders"" — wealth taxation might help to balance the economic scales long-term that Biden's Build Back Better bill only currently addresses. Those taxes would help fund those programs Sen. Joe Manchin claims aren't paid for.

Let's not forget the wealthy often have far greater control over their own rate of ""earning"" — via alliances with boards of directors taking compensation in stocks rather than money etc. — and have enriched themselves far beyond most of us at the lower end of the income scale i.e. the taxpayers who have provided them with the infrastructure means to make obscene profits. After all what can we appropriately call folks like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk the filthy rich among us who should shed a few billion to help the downtrodden 99% and still be filthy rich?

Thanks Sen. Warren.

Randy Johnson East Falmouth",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYW5uYXJib3JvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vY2F0aGVyaW5lLWJhZGdsZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catherine Badgley,"Catherine Badgley became director of the U-M Residential College in the summer of 2019 just in time for the pandemic. When Michigan’s “pause to save lives” sent students home before Thanksgiving a college based on living and learning in a shared space suddenly went virtual.

“What I have learned is that humans are very adaptable” says Badgley a paleoecologist who’s done fieldwork around the world. “While this is not the kind of challenge any of us would have wished for I don’t know a single person who hasn’t done something innovative and creative” in response.

“Faculty went to great lengths to create extra office hours remotely” she says and she herself was pleasantly surprised to discover that “one-on-one meetings on Zoom were fairly satisfying.”

“Hybrid” classes with some in the classroom and others remote were less so. “We decided that meeting on Zoom was preferable because at least everyone could see each other’s faces that way and we didn’t have to be wearing masks and we could–remarkably–have a conversation.”

In the fall of 2020 she took her first-year seminar on environmental science to the Arboretum and told the students “to pick a single tree … and learn about its natural history.” They returned to visit their trees repeatedly over the semester noting the changes they saw in “tree journals.”

“What was surprising to me was how much they had made a strong connection to that tree especially during a very chaotic semester” Badgley says. Several told her that when their parents came to visit they took them to see their tree.

“Having a relationship with something that had been there longer than they were alive … and might outlast them seemed to be something that they found extremely grounding.”

—

Badgley’s mother an art historian and her father a geologist met at McGill University. The family–Badgley has two younger sisters and a brother–moved often for her father’s career. When she was in elementary school they lived on the outskirts of Golden Colorado.

“It was a stunning setting” she recalls. “I remember day after day for years being fascinated by how the rocks looked near and far how the weather moved across the Rocky Mountains and out onto the plains and the sense of wholeness between the living creatures around me and the landscape they were growing in.

“That motivated me from a very early age to be not only curious about but wanting to help protect biodiversity and natural ecosystems from excessive exploitation … And it still motivates me today in the classes that I teach.”

Another formative experience came during a visit to her mother’s relatives in Belgium. “One of my most cherished memories when I was nine or ten was being the person who got up early to walk from this family apartment we were staying in in Brussels a couple of blocks to a bakery and buying rolls that had just come out of the oven … and bringing them back and eating them while they were still warm.

“The smell of that bakery and the experience of bringing those fresh rolls back every day motivated me to become a baker.”

While studying at Harvard’s Radcliffe College “between my freshman and sophomore years I started a pushcart bakery with a friend. We made bread six days a week in a church basement kitchen … and then sold our goods on the street in Cambridge.”

She still bakes bread almost every week but her career path led to academia. After graduating magna cum laude in geology from Harvard she added a master’s in forest science and a PhD in biology from Yale.

She came to Ann Arbor in 1982 with the Michigan Society of Fellows. She stayed on as a research scientist in the Museum of Paleontology where she did field work and met her husband museum curator and ecology and evolutionary biology prof Gerald Smith.

Libby Douvan then head of the Michigan Society of Fellows also directed the Residential College. “She asked me if I’d be interested in offering a class” Badgley says. She liked what she saw and has taught there on and off ever since.

“In a way it represents an ideal for me of what academia should be all about” Badgley says of the RC “which is that students are held to high standards of accomplishment and at the same time they have a lot of choice in determining the course of their own education.”

She’s published more than fifty academic papers many exploring how global change affects biological diversity. She also authored a children’s book–about bats.

“I wrote Pippa’s First Summer to try to change the negative attitude that so many people have towards bats before that attitude gets set” she says. “I hope to show [children] that bats have interesting lives are complex animals with unusual abilities and that we should value rather than fear their presence in our habitats.”

Badgley also has a consultant’s credit on The Magic School Bus Explores Human Evolution which takes the series’ school-teacher hero Ms. Frizzle and her students back in time. Badgley enjoyed interacting with author Joanna Cole and illustrator Bruce Degen through their editor but to her regret never met Cole in person (Cole died in 2020).

—

Badgley and Smith live on a 100-acre farm outside Chelsea in a timber-frame home overlooking fields and wetlands.

“It’s not quite wilderness here” she says “but there’s a lot of natural ecosystem around us and that has become a really important part of my life because it takes me right back to my childhood.”

Another continuity is a deep relationship with dogs. “I really consider some of them my greatest teachers” she says. “They perceive the world differently than we do. And they have different senses so they’re gathering different kinds of information. Also that they have this tremendous patience and forbearance …

“For me one of the real joys in life is learning not only from wonderful human friends and companions but I feel I’m learning from other species too.”

She laughs and adds “Including trees.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvb2JzZXJ2aW5nLWNlbnRlci1jaXR5LWJ1aWxkaW5ncy11bmRlci1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tZnJvbS10aGUtbGl2ZS1jYXNpbm8tYW5kLWhvdGVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Observing Center City Buildings Under Construction from The Live! Casino and Hotel,"The Philadelphia skyline has been significantly expanding for the past several years making a drastic change to the look of the city. The construction boom started when the Comcast Technology Center was under construction in 2015 and since that time a great number of projects have been completed and are underway. Today we take a look at the new image of the skyline from the Live! Casino and Hotel highlighting the projects that are currently under construction.

The tallest development under construction The Laurel Rittenhouse has reached the top of the parapet at 593 feet. The core which extends to 599 feet had topped in October. The recently completed W/Element Hotel can be seen with the W and the white strips lit up with work still being done on the lighting as some sections are still not lit. Nearby on Broad Street Arthaus is close to wrapping construction with the temporary construction elevator having just been taken off the tower.

Just in front of the recently renovation Jefferson Center the Jefferson Specialty Care Pavilion will soon top out as the structure currently stands nearly 300 feet tall approaching its planned 400-foot height. Also seen from the same view is the steel structure of 2222 Market Street which stands topped out and flooded with bright construction lighting. Behind 2222 Market the south tower of Riverwalk can be seen where the last few floors are being clad.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

As more consumers turned to cooking and mixing cocktails at home during the pandemic they’ve become more interested in acquiring different brandies and Cognacs.

That’s helped the brandy and Cognac category overall increase 6.7% in 2020 to reach 15.7 million 9-liter cases according to the Beverage Information Group’s 2021 Liquor Handbook. Much of that growth was driven by the leading brands of Cognac such as Courvoisier which rose 33%; Remy Martin up 18%; and D’Usse which increased more than 42%. The top Cognac brand Hennessy exceeded 4.4 million cases in 2020.

Popular sellers on-premise include the trendy Cognac brands such as Remy 1738 Hennessy and Courvoisier says Christopher Devern lead bartender at Red Owl Tavern and Stratus rooftop lounge at The Kimpton Hotel Monaco in Philadelphia. “I’ve tasted some great whiskeys from brands such as Sagamore and Jefferson’s who are using Cognac casks as a finish. This lends some unique and delicious qualities that I think Cognac lovers could appreciate.”

The Laundry Room a 27-seat speakeasy located inside Commonwealth in Downtown Las Vegas typically stocks its bar with Cognacs such as Philbert and Comandon says lead barman Anthony Partridge. “Lately the newer trend I’ve noticed is single estate versus blending.”

Tequila and mezcal may be the “hot” spirit right now says Miklos Katona beverage director for Brezza and Bar Zazu at Resorts World Las Vegas “but we always encourage our guests to complete their dining experience with some brown spirits such as Cognac or oaked-aged grappa.”

Brandy Beyond France

It depends on availability but the Resorts World Las Vegas bars typically stock Courvoisier Napoleon Hardy Legend 1863 Arak Razzouk Cardenal Mendoza Fundador Solera Rsv and Metaxa 7 Star as well as three different Remy Martin Cognac expressions. Remy Martin Courvoisier and Hardy are popular Cognac brands in the Vegas market says Katona “however an older Bas Armagnac like Veuve Goudoulin from the Ô80s could be even more memorable for our guests.”

Other countries such as Spain Greece and Lebanon have been making brandies for centuries Katona notes. These styles are becoming popular on the Las Vegas market as well.

The Laundry Room usually carries one brand of Cognac and one apple brandy says Partridge. “At times we will carry Trakal the Patagonian spirit distilled from apples and pears.”

Singani 63 has been a hit since joining the market in 2014 says Devern. “This floral-noted brandy from Bolivia is a key ingredient in tons of fun refreshing summer/spring cocktails” he adds.

American-style Brandy

While Cognac has generated the biggest buzz and revenue there has been increased interest in domestic craft brandy. Settlers have made brandy since they arrived in America; apple brandy was popular since apple orchards were abundant. Scobeyville NJ-based Laird & Co. has specialized in apple brandies for nearly 300 years.

The U.S. brandy industry had thrived until Prohibition but it never gained its traction after the ban on alcohol ended in 1933. The launch of Germain-Robin in 1982 by Cognac distiller Hubert Germain-Robin and professor Ansley J. Coale Jr. helped recast American brandy as a craft and premium spirit. E. & J. Gallo Winery which produces the leading E&J brandy brand acquired Germain-Robin in 2017.

Distillers have grown more creative about varietals and barrel finishes used for brandy since they’re not bound to the same rules and traditions as European producers. Germain-Robin for instance in September announced the release of a Single Barrel Pinot Noir brandy aged 19 years.

E. & J. Gallo Winery in 2017 unveiled a high-end brandy called Argonaut while Bertoux brandy made with California wine grapes launched in fall 2018. Louisville KY-based Copper & Kings brandy aged in Kentucky bourbon and American white oak barrels was founded in 2014 by husband-and-wife team Joe and Lesley Heron and acquired by Constellation Brands in 2020.

Fruit-forward Favorites

Fruit brandies tend to make an appearance in fall and winter cocktails. Venteux a French brasserie and Champagne bar that opened in Chicago this past summer has a Daiquiri-inspired fall cocktail called Bobbin’ For Apples ($16) made with Bacardi 8 rum Copper & Kings apple brandy Liquid Alchemist spiced apple syrup orange and lime juice.

Rose Mary restaurant also in Chicago has two specialty autumn drinks with brandy: Sweater Weather with Tom’s Foolery Bonded Applejack Stirrings ginger liqueur The Bitter Truth chocolate bitters red plum and lemon and the Port of Zadar with Rittenhouse rye Maraska Slivovitz (a plum brandy from Croatia) Luxardo Maraschino liqueur Peychaud’s bitters coffee Demerara and toasted fennel. Both cocktails are priced at $15.

Bartenders continue to “express and evolve” classic cocktail options such as the Sazerac Devern says. He also makes quite a few Sidecars another vintage Cognac drink with lemon and triple sec in the summer. “It’s also a popular sold-by-the bottle option at Stratus for people celebrating all kinds of occasions.”

“Bartenders continue to “express and evolve” classic cocktail options such as the Sazerac says Christopher Devern lead bartender at Red Owl Tavern and Stratus rooftop lounge at The Kimpton Hotel Monaco in Philadelphia

A fall favorite cocktail at the Red Owl Tavern is called Apple’s Peaches Pumpkin Pie ($15) with rye whiskey Calvados (French apple brandy) house-made pumpkin oat cream apple cider and apricot liqueur. “The fruity spiced and rich notes from the brandy really helped make this cocktail have all the more depth and flavor” Devern says.

The Laundry Room offers several cocktails crafted with brandy or Cognac. The Jacqueline Rose — a combination of apple brandy rose syrup lemon and anisette — has notes of floral fuji apple citrus and an anisette finish Partridge says. “Our Japanese Cocktail is a mixture of Cognac orgeat syrup and angostura and has hints of stone fruit and classic Angostura spice tones.”

The bar’s signature Vieux Carre combines rye Cognac Italian vermouth Benedictine Angostura and Peychaud’s bitters “which features notes of subtle baking spices honey deep cherry tones and a light anise finish” Partridge says. Cocktails at The Laundry Room are currently priced at $17.

Guests at Resorts World Las Vegas enjoy and rediscover some of the classic brandy-based cocktails Katona says “but most of the time it’s a sipping drink enjoyed neat.” The company’s newest concept Bar Zazu features a Remy Martin Sidecar.

When working with brandy and Cognac Brezza bartenders tend to let the base spirit shine a little bit more he notes. This gives them almost endless possibility “since Cognac will stand up to orange citrus and sour flavors as well as cocoa and port and anything in between.”

Devern agrees. “When used in the right hands and with the right recipe Cognac and brandy can be curated into many palatable cocktails.” And after the Covid lockdowns “guests are ready for fun unique and creative libations more than ever.”",,,,,,,,,

""We were like 'Everybody left' "" he said. ""Lot's of folks just up and left.""

In that moment the notion that decades later Corning with partners like businessman Joel Long would end up shaping much of the retail character of Billings helping to bring national chains like Walmart and Kohl's and the new Scheels superstore to town seemed as far distant as the moon.

Because in 1985 everything was going wrong.

""I think that was the darkest hour"" Corning said.

Corning is a Billings native and had returned to town in 1979 after a short stint back East. In Billings and the surrounding region the energy boom was in full effect and Corning had seen it as his opportunity to build up his property development business.

And for six years it worked.

His new company started constructing apartments and office buildings which would fill up almost as fast as he'd get them built. Executives managers and workers from national oil companies and oil patches from across the country were migrating to Billings at a surprising clip.

""It was definitely a boom time"" Corning said.

But as 1985 drew to a close the energy boom in Eastern Montana and surrounding states evaporated like a mirage. Corning and his company were left with nearly-empty apartment complexes and office buildings. They were in debt to their lenders with no one around to rent their property.

Along with the oilfield workers and oil company managers who fled town developers in Billings were leaving too. Many had gone under or had cut their losses and went to look for new opportunities elsewhere.

Corning decided to stay. He and his company had good relationships with their lenders and those lenders were willing to give Corning room to maneuver. It's easier for them just to have the developer handle the problems he said.

Land developer Joel Long calls it the art of the possible. He has partnered with Corning on projects since the early 1990s and described Corning as a person who continually finds ways to make possible those relationships deals and partnerships with lenders national retailers and local renters that to others seem impossible.

And so for the rest of 1980s that's what Corning did. He and his development company worked to stay afloat and keep their properties as profitable as they could.

""We just worked through it"" he said.

During those years it became increasingly clear that building apartments and office space was not the business Corning wanted. For him it was too volatile to offer any kind of long-term security. Retail development on the other hand seemed like the comfortable fit.

In the late 1980s Becky Reno who would go on to successfully launch the City Brew coffee shop franchise met with Corning to pitch her idea of opening a chain of video rental stores called Video Library. It became Corning's first retail development project.

(Reno would later sell the profitable Video Library to national rental chain Movie Gallery in 2003 at the height of the video rental boom. By the end of the decade Movie Gallery would go out of business and in-person video rental stores would be mostly wiped out by Netflix.)

By the early 1990s Corning was looking for his next project. Strip malls had become popular and big box stores were taking off.

Gravel pit to shopping center

The northwest corner of South 24th Street West and King Avenue West — which is now home to many of Billings' busiest box stores and is the busiest intersection in the city — was an old gravel pit owned by Joel Long.

Long's father had bought the property back in the 1950s. It was a business called Billings Black Top and it mined the gravel for asphalt construction. By the early '90s the pit was mostly spent and Joel Long had purchased it renaming the company JTL Group. Along with the company he purchased all the land around it from his father — 250 acres on either side of King.

""It's amazing how far out of town we were for many many years"" he said.

Realtors often called Long expressing interest in buying parts or pieces of the property but Long said he wasn't interested in splitting it up. And then Corning asked if Long wanted to partner in developing the whole thing.

Toys R Us and Walmart were both looking to expand in Montana and wanted stores in Billings. Long's property seemed to be the perfect spot.

Toys R Us went in first Long remembered followed by Walmart and then Lowe's. Across the street Best Buy went up followed by Home Depot.

""That started that whole development"" Long said.

Corning and Long then spent the next 10 years building out the rest of the retail space on either side of King which was filled in by retailers like Ross and Old Navy. Big national chains like to own their buildings but midsize retailers usually lease Corning said attracted to the space by the big retailers that act as anchors.

They create their own gravity he said.

A decade-long project can be risky and it has to involve the right mix of patience and foresight Long said. Because it means that the capital used to finance the project stays tied up for 10 years.

For Corning these projects are successful because of their long-term nature; it makes it easier to weather the ups and downs in the retail market. Retailers have a vested interest in staying in their building and Corning's company as landlord has an interest in keeping them there.

With that understanding Corning said the two sides can often come together and work out a lease agreement that keeps both sides profitable for years.

""You can't be rigid"" Long said.

Corning's ability to develop those relationships and shape large successful retail hot spots across Billings made him a known entity with national retailers.

Shiloh rises

So when Kohl's decided in 2007 it wanted to expand into Billings the national department store chain called Corning. And Corning knew just where to build.

The southeast corner of Shiloh Road and King Avenue West was another gravel pit owned by Joel Long and Corning believed it made the perfect location for his next retail development project which would eventually become Shiloh Crossing.

When Corning called up his old friend and asked if he wanted to partner up again Long had no trouble saying yes.

""You always have a choice"" Long said speaking of partnerships. Corning's work ethic and philosophy about development are a good match for Long two qualities he respects and shares.

""The mutual respect of each other's ability helped a lot"" Long added with a laugh.

Kohl's liked the location at King and Shiloh but it didn't want to be a ""lone ranger"" out there Corning said. In 2007 south Shiloh Road had almost no retail development.

Working with Long Corning decided to build 20000 square-feet of retail space with the Kohl's project ensuring there would be more than a dozen other retail shops and businesses along that corner. He also convinced Carmike to build a new movie theater there.

They named the development Shiloh Crossing and it would cost Long some sleepless nights — work began just as the Great Recession hit in 2008. It was the only time Long wondered if they'd gotten in over their heads.

Corning wasn't as concerned. The recession hadn't hit Billings as hard as it did in other areas of the country and interest rates were incredibly low at the time he said. But it was still a multi-year project which required patience and hustle to get the right businesses there.

""Then Steve Scheel called me"" Corning said.

The sporting goods retailer was transitioning to mega stores and he wanted to build his next one in Billings. But they had to wait for Shiloh Crossing to develop further and for their lease at Rimrock Mall to expire.

The Scheels mega store would not only draw in foot traffic from all over Billings but bring in shoppers from as far away as North Dakota and Wyoming. That kind of traffic is what smaller retail shops crave but often can't pull in on their own Long said.

So bringing in Scheels to anchor the south end of Shiloh Crossing had enormous potential for everyone involved he said.

The land on which Scheels would be built needed geotechnical work in order for construction to happen and so to close the deal Long sold the land to Scheels for $1.

""They have done extremely well with that store"" Corning said.

What's ahead

Looking forward Corning predicts retail development will move more and more toward mixed-use development like businesses that include an experiential component.

The West End is also home to the Shiloh Commons project on the northeast corner of Central Avenue and Shiloh Road which has residential space above the stores and restaurants.

Corning also sees more mixed-use with a medical component. And he sees more growth on Billings' West End.

""There's always been this steady westward drumbeat that will continue"" he said.

Looking back at Shiloh Crossing now after a decade and at his first projects at 24th and King Corning sees a lot of hard work and satisfying success.

""Luck is always a component"" he said. ""There's so much you can't control.""

But within a developer's control is the people with whom that developer chooses to work. Difficult projects test those partnerships and reveal who to trust and who to rely on when it's time to move to the next job.

Finally Corning said there will always be problems.

""Your success is managing through problems"" he said.

Weather had cancelled the Thursday qualifiers so the full field of 25 men ran with best of two runs counting. Gerard was the very last rider to drop —Corning the second-to-last had just dropped prior and disrupted the podium bumping Canada’s Mark McMorris out of first with a score of 91.50. Then it was Gerard’s turn. You guys this series of events was a lot!

Gerard put down an incredible run earning a score of 93.25 to overtake Corning. He went clean through the upper rail section then frontside 1080 nosegrab improving over the 720 on his first run and adding in the nosegrab for style then into a backside 1260 melon and finishing with the biggest trick of the day—a switch backside 1620 Weddle. The crowd which included a large gathering of his family and friends absolutely erupted.

“Standing at the top for run two after seeing all the guys destroy it today I was just thinking that I’m so proud of our U.S. team and all of my friends from everywhere and how good we’ve been riding” Gerard shared with the Dew Tour. “Obviously I wanted to land a run and get on the podium but more than anything I was just feeling so happy with how everyone rode. It was incredible.”

Corning earned his second-place finish cleanly handling the rail section and then stepping up in the jumps with a Cab 1260 nosegrab into a frontside flatspin 1440 melon to backside triple cork 1440 melon.

U.S. Team Slopestyle Coach Dave Reynolds shared his excitement at the results: “This was an amazing finish to the contest the event kept getting postponed and every postponement meant a new start order. Chris Corning and Red the last two to drop couldn’t have been a more storybook situation. They came in so clutch not a surprise but so impressive. Really excited for them both.”

McMorris held it down in third with a score of 90 while Sean Fitzsimons put down a memorable run linking up back-to-back triple cork 1440s which earned him a fourth-place finish. Brock Crouch took sixth and Like Winklemann finished in 11th.

Women’s Slopestyle

The women’s slopestyle saw challenging snow conditions for some of the competitors with speed becoming less of an issue among the field of 15 as they advanced through the three-run finals.

New Zealand’s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took the top score of the day with a 97.75 followed by Finland’s Enni Rukajarvi with a 90.75 and Japan’s Kokomo Murase in third with an 87.75.

Eighteen-year-old Courtney Rummel posted the top U.S. score of the day earning fourth place with an 83.50. This was a career-best finish for the U.S. Team rookie rider.

“I’m super stoked I’ve never done two sevens in a run so I’m so happy I pulled it together. It’s insane to me” shared Rummel just after landing her run. She also shared her excitement about competing alongside teammates Julia Marino and Jamie Anderson “It makes me want to step up because they step up. They’re the biggest inspirations ever. It’s so sick riding with them—I love it.”

Two-time Olympic Gold medalist Jamie Anderson finished in seventh and Julia Marino in 10th—both uncharacteristically unable to put down their runs in finals.

The Olympic qualifiers continue after the holidays at the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix at Mammoth Mountain California January 3–8 2022.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch is reporting that Virginia’s capital city will get a new tallest building when CoStar Group a commercial real estate analytics and research firm expands its James River campus with a 26-story skyscraper.

The tower will rise on vacant land adjacent to a nine-story building the Washington-based company acquired last year and will be part of a $460 million expansion of its corporate campus in Downtown Richmond on nearly 4 acres of vacant land purchased by CoStar in August 2020 for $20 million.

CoStar also plans to build a six-story building where its employees can use a fitness and wellness center gather in conference facilities and an auditorium and visit stores and restaurants.

Construction on the project which includes 750000 square feet of office and retail space and is expected to add 2000 to 3000 new jobs to the more than 1000 CoStar has there now is set to begin in 2023 and be ready for use in 2024.

The new tower will rise 510 feet into the air blasting past the James Monroe state office tower which is 29 stories and 449 feet tall. Dominion Energy has a new building nearby that is 20 stories and 417 feet tall.

Office space in both buildings will be used by the sales marketing software development customer service and support teams.

CoStar CEO Andrew Florance who was a lab partner with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when both attended Princeton University announced the plans on Friday jokingly calling the new development “Little HQ2” a nod to Bezos’ East Coast headquarters in Northern Virginia know as “HQ2.”

Features of the new tower which is being designed by architect William Chilton of Pickard Chilton include solar panel siding that will provide a “significant amount of energy” used by the LEED-certified building according to the Times-Dispatch.

This ready-to-eat meal just takes a few minutes to microwave. And thanks to big box stores like Costco you can make sure to have enough soup to get you through any tough or busy times. While these meals are definitely convenient many of them can't qualify as healthy.

""Soups are a convenient way to take in a dense amount of nutrition with very little preparation even more so for canned soups"" says Trista Best RD at Balance One Supplements. ""Unfortunately canned soups are not always as healthy as they market themselves to be. Chicken noodle and vegetable soups are commonly used to help alleviate many illness symptoms but they can be quite high in sodium. Just one serving provides the consumer with over 400 milligrams of sodium which is nearly one-quarter of sodium recommendation for the day at 2300 milligrams.""

""What makes canned soup unhealthy generally is the high sodium content"" says Lisa Young PhD RDN author of Finally Full Finally Slim and a member of our medical expert board. ""It is very important to check the label for sodium.""

Keeping an eye out for sodium plays an integral role in choosing the right soup especially when you want to stock up at Costco. Following the advice of these experts we assembled the master list of soups to watch out for when you hit Costco ranked from bad to worst sodium count per serving.

Campbell's Simply Chicken Noodle Soup

110 calories 2 g fat (0.5 g saturated fat) 680 mg sodium 13 g carbs 1 g fiber 1 g sugar) 9 g protein

When you want some comfort food that can warm you up nothing hits the spot like chicken noodle soup. But this feel-good staple can easily be overdone when it comes to sodium. A single cup serving of this soup contains 30% of your daily sodium and if you decide to down a whole can expect to consume 1460 milligrams of sodium in one go.

Cambell's Cream of Mushroom Soup

100 calories 7 g fat (1 g saturated fat) 860 mg sodium 8 g carbs 0 g fiber <1 g sugar) 2 g protein

""Another thing that you want to look for with canned soups is to avoid soups made with cream"" says Young. ""It will add unnecessary calories and saturated fat.""

Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup comes loaded with 860 milligrams of sodium per cup while its cream content makes it a bit more unwholesome than its chicken noodle soup cousin.

For a healthier take on this classic try out the recipe for Creamy Whole30 Mushroom Soup.

Ivar's Cheddar Garden Medley Soup

210 calories 15 g fat (8 g saturated fat) 900 mg sodium 14 g carbs 0 g fiber 5 g sugar) 5 g protein

Ivar's take on a Cheddar Garden Medley Soup raises the stakes in added cream and salt bumping the saturated fat and sodium content up to eye-popping levels. This particular soup has 39% of your daily sodium per serving but also clocks in with 40% of your saturated fat content for the day.

Nongshim Udon Noodle Soup Bowl





210 calories 0.5 g fat (0 g saturated fat) 910 mg sodium 46 g carbs 2 g fiber 1 g sugar) 5 g protein

Instant noodle soup bowls offer some great conveniences and taste great when you don't have time to cook but also pack in the most salt. This Nongshim Udon Noodle Soup Bowl crams in as much salt as possible and each serving comes with almost half a day's worth of sodium.

Ivar's Loaded Baked Potato Soup

320 calories 19 g fat (11 g saturated fat) 950 mg sodium 24 g carbs 1 g fiber 3 g sugar) 10 g protein

Ivar's Loaded Baked Potato Soup clocks in at 900 mg of sodium equalling that of the brand's take on Cheddar Garden Medley. While these items stack up equally when it comes to salt this particular soup steps up its saturated fat game. Each serving comes loaded with 10 grams of this unwanted fat making it an even worse choice when you visit Costco.

When a craving strikes opt to whip up this soup at home with a recipe for Healthy Hearty Baked Potato Soup. With this homemade offering you can watch your salt intake and enjoy all the flavors this soup has to offer.

Nongshim Shin Noodle Soup Bowl





370 calories 13 g fat (6 g saturated fat) 2070 mg sodium 55 g carbs 3 g fiber 2 g sugar) 8 g protein

Nongshim Shin Noodle Soup Bowl takes the cake as the unhealthiest most salt-laden Costco soup offering around. One serving of this instant soup contains 89% of your daily sodium making it a no-go for anyone who needs to stay healthy.

Do you want to be alerted about new deals as they’re published? Click here to subscribe to Frequent Miler's Instant Posts by email.

Sam’s Club started selling discounted gift cards for Southwest and Hawaiian Airlines gift cards this past week with the discount available on Hawaiian Airlines gift cards being even better than that offered by Costco.

The Deal

Key Terms

Southwest – limit 3 per membership.

Hawaiian – limit 4 per membership.

Quick Thoughts

Costco has been offering a 10% discount on $500 Southwest gift cards for quite some time but it’s great to see the same offer available at Sam’s Club seeing as there’ll be a lot of people with a Sam’s Club membership who don’t have a Costco membership.

Costco also started offering a 10% discount on Hawaiian Airlines gift cards recently but Sam’s Club’s offer is even better seeing as it’s a 12% discount reducing the $500 face value cards to $440.

There are a couple of potential added benefits of the Sam’s Club offers compared to Costco. Gift card purchases from Sam’s Club sometimes track through shopping portals so you might be able to earn some additional cashback that way.

A second potential benefit is if you have a Cash App debit card. There’s a (possibly targeted) Boost for Sam’s Club which gives a 5% instant discount on SamsClub.com purchases. That can be used every rolling 24 hours and has a limit of $20 off which means the offer is good on up to $400 of spend.

That means a $500 Southwest gift card with the Cash App Boost applied will only cost $429.99 (a 14% discount) while a $500 Hawaiian Airlines gift card would cost $420 (a 16% discount).

Note that by solely redeeming gift cards for a flight booking you’d be forgoing travel protections so that’s something to weigh up when deciding whether to buy these.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8va2l0Y2hlbi5uaW5lLmNvbS5hdS9sYXRlc3QvY29zdGNvLWNocmlzdG1hcy1sdW5jaC1vbi1hLWJ1ZGdldC8zYjE3YzAwNi1lY2M2LTQxNjktOTFmMS03NGI5ZDU3MDZjOTXSAURodHRwczovL2FtcC5uaW5lLmNvbS5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzNiMTdjMDA2LWVjYzYtNDE2OS05MWYxLTc0YjlkNTcwNmM5NQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Christmas lunch: How to do festive food on a budget,"If you've ever been in charge of Christmas lunch you'd know it can be an expensive affair.

There has been good news for the family amid the sadness however as a heart-melting message from Frederik Crown Prince of Denmark proved on Sunday.

A post on the family's official Instagram page revealed that they have welcomed ""two new residents"" – a gorgeous pair of puppies – and they couldn't be cuter!

The little canines could be seen among the Christmas decorations in a series of sweet photos and the message alongside the pictures was adorable too.

It read: ""Here on the fourth Sunday in Advent we would like to introduce two new residents at home. A little over six weeks ago Grace became the mother of two of the cutest puppies… to the great joy of us all. - The Crown Prince's family.""

Frederik is heir to the Danish throne and shares four children with his wife Mary: Prince Christian of Denmark 16 Princess Isabella 14 and ten-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.

The couple met in Australia where Mary who was born in Hobart in Tasmania is from and tied the knot back in 2004. Mary is now isolating at her home Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen.

The Danish royal family recently welcomed two adorable puppies

In a statement the palace added that Crown Princess Mary will remain in isolation in accordance with the guidelines.

It is not yet clear how her illness will affect the family's plans to spend Christmas at Marselisborg Castle in Aarhus with Queen Margrethe 81.

However in brighter news no other members of the princess' family have tested positive for the virus according to the palace. Prince Christian previously tested positive for COVID-19 in December 2020 after an outbreak at his school.

It probably will include a four-lane boulevard-style road with speed limits of 45 mph or less. A new bridge across the Great Miami River will replace the existing 100-year-old Black Street Bridge that is nearing the end of its usefulness to carry cars and trucks although engineers have not yet limited weights of vehicles that cross it.

The proposed new roadway almost 3 miles long if completely built also will cross over the CSX railroad tracks to become only Hamilton’s third place where vehicles driving east-west do not have to stop for trains on the CSX lines. The other places are the congested High Street through downtown and the $32 million South Hamilton Crossing which opened three years ago last week and carries Grand Boulevard over them linking Ohio 4 with the area near Miami University’s Hamilton Campus and the city’s West Side.

The highway could have significant impacts to alleviate traffic congestion particularly along the city’s main east-west highway of High and Main streets where traffic is heavy while commuters use it and at other times. Many residents and city officials fear that with the April 2022 opening of Spooky Nook Sports Champion Mill which will attract 10000 or more athletes and their families to the city on many weekends traffic will worsen.

Some residents of Hamilton’s Fordson Heights area and of Fairfield Twp. are concerned about what the highway could do to areas where they live. Some noted it would have significant impact on the Bonham Farm and on residents of Fairfield Township. Planners in November were urged to keep those people in mind.

The proposed new highway while easing traffic along High and Main Streets also could create heavier traffic in other parts of the city including on the West Side. Northwest Washington Boulevard likely would become a busier thoroughfare than it is now as drivers from places like Oxford may pass around the northern parts of Hamilton into Fairfield Twp. back into Hamilton crossing the Great Miami River and the railroad tracks.

Explore South Hamilton Crossing suddenly better links southern Hamilton

Major benefits seen in project

Dan Corey director of the Butler County Transportation Improvement District sees the project as completing work that the major construction of Ohio 129 began during the 1990s — better linking Hamilton especially its West Side to Interstate 75.

With that project Ohio connected the interstate highway to the footstep of Hamilton” Corey said.

North Hamilton Crossing will finish the Ohio 129 investment “by bringing 129 over the railroad track over the river to connect the West Side back to an interchange at I-75” Corey said putting Hamilton “into the 21st century ... for its economic activity.”

Two things that were “blessings” to Hamilton’s growth during the 19th and 20th centuries — the river and the railroads — are “now a hindrance of getting connectivity from the West Side of Hamilton to the interchange” with I-75 which is the city’s current most prominent transportation gift he said.

About four dozen participants in a November “stakeholders” meeting were shown maps of several possible routes which were marked Alternatives A through G. There actually are about a dozen possibilities though when some of those paths are combined with others.

While most Hamilton residents and commuters are most concerned about traffic congestion from commuters and Spooky Nook Corey and Rich Engle Hamilton’s director of engineering point to two other significant aspects of the project:

The aging Black Street Bridge which might be converted to a pedestrian/bicycling pathway after it no longer carries vehicles is about 20 years from requiring replacement unless there would be major structural work on it Engle said consultants have estimated.

Another overpass above CSX tracks would help vehicles avoid dangerous railroad crossings Corey said.

Some are concerned

One person who’s concerned is Keith Reiring a resident of the Fordson Heights area which is separated from the rest of Hamilton’s North End neighborhood by Greenwood Cemetery. He’s concerned a route may disrupt the family friendly quiet residential area where he lives.

“The growth and development of Hamilton has been exciting to watch over the years” said Reiring who had expressed concerns about the project’s routes and was included as a stakeholder to report back to his neighbors. “I reside in a wonderful neighborhood inside a great city.”

“I hope that all aspects are taken into account with the decisions and placements of any new roadways. My neighborhood is a great place to live and raise my family. I hope it will still remain that way.”

In addition to Alternatives A through G that are being considered Reiring said he accepted planners’ suggestion and provided an alternative-route idea of his own which he calls Alt Route 1. It would wend along the Hydraulic Canal of the Great Miami River and would end at Ohio 4 near North Eastview Parkway. It would affect fewer homes and the Bonham Farm he said.

Also some of the homes that would be in its path are in a floodplain so are in danger of flooding he said.

While transportation officials have drawn lines on the maps to show possible routes Keith Smith environmental coordinator for Ohio Department of Transportation District 8 notes those lines aren’t exact - only rough guesses perhaps 100- to 500-feet wide of where a roadway actually might go.

“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to people in the public they see a line on the map and are sure that’s a road” Smith said. “They want to know why did we hit their grandmother’s house or something. It’s just a representation of a study area.”

And yet officials note it’s important to listen to people’s concerns.

“Each and every one of those alternatives impacts the community in a different manner” Engle said. “And so we have to be very very cautious and careful to make sure that we do the best planning we can and to minimize impacts as much as possible.”

What’s next?

SUPPLIED

SIM Senacheert a high-profile financial veteran who currently helms local lender Prasac Microfinance Institution Plc has decided to step down after nearly two decades in top posts.

His resignation comes shortly after South Korea’s KB Kookmin Bank New York-listed KB Financial Group Inc’s (KB) commercial banking unit completed an acquisition in October giving the bank a 100 per cent stake in the microfinance institution (MFI).

Employed at Prasac for just over a quarter century and serving as its president and CEO for 18 years Senacheert grew the lender from scratch as a small institution with just a handful of branches into one of the country’s leading MFIs.

The institution now has hundreds of locations and a wide spectrum of new digital methods and processes have been adapted and integrated into the core of its business.

In a recent financial report Prasac said that between 2004 – when it obtained an MFI licence – and September 2021 total assets expanded 453-fold from $9 million to $4 billion and total equity grew 1204-fold from $526000 to $634 million.

During the same period its loan portfolio ballooned about 453-fold from $7.7 million to $3.5 billion deposit balance skyrocketed from $196000 to $2.4 billion and number of staff grew nearly 25-fold from 372 to 9203.

Although there was little doubt in its abilities to raise funds Prasac on May 5 last year listed a corporate bond on the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) allocating 1272000 shares in the public offering with a total issue amount of 127.2 billion riel ($31 million).

But the CEO will most likely not resign alone – a total of seven executive committee members and senior management officers are also set to leave the company in January and February.

Senacheert sat down with The Post’s May Kunmakara to discuss his departure and his next journey.

What specifically made you decide to leave?

I’ve held the position as CEO for 18 years and have been working with Prasac for more than 25 years hence it is the time for me to leave in order to pave the path for KB to fully participate in the MFI’s management.

On the other hand I also expect that the management change will enable Prasac to move on to the next level.

To what do you attribute your success?

The success was contributed by many factors such as peace and political stability macroeconomic stability and economic growth enabling regulations support from trusted and loyal clients and all other stakeholders.

These include the government National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) lenders depositors local authorities among others but especially thehardworking management and staff.

What motivated Prasac’s decision to list on the CSX last year?

We decided to issue a corporate bond to among other things participate in the development of the capital market help to promote the utilisation of the KHR diversify funding sources and help the liquidity position improve our governance and disclosures and promote Prasac to the public.

How did Prasac manage such remarkable performance during Covid and how did it work with its most vulnerable customers to accommodate them during the economic crisis?

During these difficult times what we’ve been striving to do is to stay with our clients listen to them and help them.

On a per-case basis we restructured loans for the clients who experienced financial difficulties provided additional credit to those who needed the funds to keep their businesses running or to reopen.

What are your plans after leaving Prasac?

At the moment I am free and there is no plan yet. But I hope that I will be able to continue working in the sector so that I can utilise my experience and knowledge.

Of which one's leadership decisions do their team-mates probably say ""Oh no not again""? • Getty Images

Despite the chaos caused by the Australia captain's Covid close-contact disqualification from playing in the Adelaide Test  good captaincy will eventually be defined as ""the job Pat Cummins does"".

Imran Khan a fine leader of the Pakistan side before he became prime minister says in his book ""A good cricket captain must understand bowling."" Who better than Cummins - a top-class paceman - to understand bowling?

He is also by far the most inspirational player in the Australia side and even when he was replaced as captain this week the team still played hard with thoughts of his reputation in mind.

Cummins acquired the appropriate nickname Postman Pat before he was appointed captain. He is accorded this handle because he regularly delivers often providing Australia with a wicket when it's needed.

There is a lot to like about Cummins' appointment and he certainly delivered in his first captaincy Test with a five-wicket innings haul at the Gabba

Will Cummins have days where it doesn't all go exactly to plan? Too right - that is the life of a captain and of any leader anywhere in the world. However Cummins will improve as a captain because that is what good leaders do: they learn from their mistakes and try to avoid making them in the future.

The one question Cummins can't answer is how many Tests he'll miss through injury or Covid regulations. His second-Test hiccup is one he will prefer to have avoided but having to miss games is something you have to deal with.

Root is not an inspirational captain and this is indicated by the number of times his team work their way into a decent position but can't finish the job

Cummins will become a really strong leader and elicit excellent assistance because he's well respected. Eventually he will be ranked as a good leader for all occasions. A lot of that will be based on his calmness and common-sense thinking.

What is the opposite definition of excellent leadership? There's a good chance it can be summed up by Joe Root 's captaincy.

Root is an excellent batter but a poor captain. It would not be unfair to describe him as an ordinary and unlucky captain. Rarely do you find a long-term captain who is lacking in imagination but is also lucky. A fortunate captain is usually lucky because the players believe he is some kind of miracle-worker and things tend to work out because of the team's belief.

It showed again at Adelaide Oval that misfortune follows Root's team around. The England bowlers beat the bat regularly but had little to show for their honest toil. However the England selectors' tolerance of mediocrity was also on view when Jos Buttler who is far from their best keeper was again chosen and made yet more inexcusable blunders.

No amount of blustering bluff at press conferences can cover up for the selection mistakes that have been made by England.

It's not that Root's team dislike him - on the contrary - it's just that he has taken so many poor decisions they must be thinking ""Oh no not again.""

He is not an inspirational captain and this is indicated by the number of times his team work their way into a decent position but can't finish the job. This happened again when where after conceding 425 in Brisbane England repeated their mistakes in Adelaide to leak 473 for the loss of nine. Another sign of Root's inadequacy was the number of times he put an English fielder in a catching position following an uppish shot going to that area. A good captain - as Richie Benaud regularly said - is two overs ahead of the game otherwise he's behind in the match. A responsible leader has a team of competitors who want to play for their skipper.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NieXRlc2FwcC5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtc2V0LXRvLXBsYXktYm94aW5nLWRheS10ZXN0L3N0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pat Cummins likely to play Boxing Day Test: Details here,"Next Article

Pat Cummins was ruled out of the 2nd Test at the Adelaide Oval

Pat Cummins likely to play Boxing Day Test: Details here

By Parth Dhall 09:50 pm Dec 18 202109:50 pm

What's the story Australian pace spearhead Pat Cummins is set to play the Boxing Day Test against England starting December 26. Cummins who took over as Australia's Test captain from Tim Paine was ruled out of the second Test. He was deemed a close contact of a COVID-19 positive case. Cricket Australia informed that South Australian Health has allowed Cummins to return home and train.

Context

Why does it matter?

Cummins was ruled out of the ongoing 2nd Test after coming in close contact with a COVID-19 positive case in Adelaide. He was at an Adelaide restaurant with his brother ahead of the Test. Although Cummins returned a negative PCR test he was required to isolate. However he has returned to his home in Sydney and is available for the Melbourne Test.

Statement

Cummins is allowed to train

""Cummins who has tested negative can mix with family but only in small groups while being urged to avoid any highly populated location particularly indoors. But being able to train and do fitness work is a bonus for the fast bowler who would have been contained to a hotel room for seven days had he remained in Adelaide"" stated a report in cricket.com.au.

Approval

SA Health authorities allowed Cummins to return home

South Australia health authorities had allowed Cummins to return home after placing him in a seven-day quarantine. ""Pat Cummins has been granted approval by SA Health to return home to NSW. Under the plan approved by SA Health he will self-drive from isolation and then with the appropriate PPE and hygiene controls take a single charter flight"" Cricket Australia had said on Friday.

Captaincy

Will Cummins return as captain?

Cummins recently took over as Australia's Test captain from Tim Paine who is on an indefinite break. The latter had left captaincy after his sexting scandal came to light. Under Cummins Australia thrashed England in Brisbane. Steven Smith replaced Cummins as captain for the Adelaide Test. The former is leading Australia for the first time since the ball-tampering fiasco in Cape Town (2018).

Do you know?

Cummins attained these feats at the Gabba

At the Gabba Cummins became the first Australian captain to take a five-wicket haul in the Ashes since Richie Benaud in 1962 (6/115 in Brisbane). Cummins is also the first captain to take a five-for in an Ashes Test since Bob Willis in 1982.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L25ld3MvYXNoZXMtMjAyMS0yMi1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1jb25maXJtZWQtZm9yLWJveGluZy1kYXktdGVzdC1hZnRlci1taXNzaW5nLWRheS1uaWdodC1nYW1lLWluLWFkZWxhaWRlLTQ1NjgwMDYuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L2FtcC9uZXdzL2FzaGVzLTIwMjEtMjItcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtY29uZmlybWVkLWZvci1ib3hpbmctZGF5LXRlc3QtYWZ0ZXItbWlzc2luZy1kYXktbmlnaHQtZ2FtZS1pbi1hZGVsYWlkZS00NTY4MDA2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashes 2021-22: Pat Cummins Confirmed for Boxing Day Test After Missing Day-Night Game in Adelaide,"Australian Test skipper Pat Cummins was on Saturday confirmed for the Boxing Day Test beginning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on December 26 after he was ruled out of the Adelaide Test due to being deemed a close contact of a COVID-19 positive person.

Cummins had dined with fellow New South Wales and Adelaide Strikers fast bowler Harry Conway at Little Hunter Steakhouse on the eve of the ongoing Test following which he was replaced by Michael Neser in the Playing XI.

On Saturday it was confirmed that Cummins will not have to continue his COVID-related isolation in Sydney and will resume training for the third Test.

Earlier after being ruled out of the Adelaide Test Cummins had flown to Sydney on a chartered flight. He was granted permission by South Australia health authorities to return home to NSW.

Australia captain Cummins was force to sit out the match at Adelaide Oval after the paceman was deemed to be a close contact with a positive coronavirus case at a restaurant.

Fellow fast bowler Starc and spinner Lyon dined at the same establishment but were considered to be casual contacts with the person who had the virus.

Starc took 4-37 and Lyon claimed 3-58 as England meekly collapsed from 150-2 to 236 on day three in reply to 473-9 declared. Australia then closed in complete command on 45-1 in their second innings - leading by 282 runs.

Left-arm quick Starc revealed it could have been a very different story if Cummins had replied to his text message.

He said: ""It was just fortunate we were sitting outside. It was almost a bit of a p***-take because Pat didn't reply to my message so thought we'd sit away from him and sit outside so it's been a lucky one.""

Starc says he did not lose any sleep fretting over whether dining out could have cost him another chance to exploit England's vulnerable batting line-up in a match Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of due to a side strain.

""Spinner [Lyon] didn't sleep. I slept quite fine there wasn't much I could do about it after"" he said.

It was revealed on Saturday that both sides will face stricter protocols for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests due to a rise in COVID-19 cases.

Players can only follow Starc and Lyon's lead and dine outside while they must also socially distance with members of the public.

Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley told SEN radio: ""We need to make sure there's social distancing so we ask everyone to be respectful in the public.

""That's the real shame because what we have seen is players wanting to interact with fans. That's been a feature of the Big Bash. But we've now got very clear protocols.

""As it comes to those on the field of play we need to make sure that people are operating in a really biosecure way."""

The seventh annual Brainstorm Health conference will gather in person May 10-11 2022.



Brainstorm Health brings together forward-thinking and insightful leaders in health care technology and business to leverage the rapid growth across these sectors and explore ways to drive meaningful change worldwide. As the fields of science and medicine continue to innovate it’s clear health and health care are global in nature — and interconnected. The program will look at how new technologies worldwide collaboration evolving therapeutics and big data drive better health outcomes and business value.

We’ll hear from experts about investing in health care; look at the urgency of a global business strategy to remain resilient; and talk about what lies ahead in the battle with COVID-19. As we talk to business leaders about best practices for navigating the ever-changing pandemic landscape we’ll continue the conversations on crucial issues such as upstream preventive interventions the global mental health crisis and the need to eradicate racial inequities so health care is accessible for all. As always we have a few surprises in store and plenty of opportunities to engage with other leaders. Please join us for these vital discussions.

Confirmed participants include CEOs Dr. Albert Bourla of Pfizer Dean Bitan of Imagene AI Patrick Collison of Stripe David Cordani of Cigna Eric Lefkofsky of Tempus Labs and Dr. Alex Oshmyansky of Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company as well as Apple Vice President of Health Dr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai Lux Capital Partner Deena Shakir and Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health Dean Michelle Williams.

FORTUNE is following guidance issued by local authorities and the CDC and is taking several additional steps to prioritize participants’ health and safety. For Brainstorm Health all attendees must be “Up to Date” with COVID-19 vaccinations. The CDC defines “Up to Date” as having received all recommended doses in the primary series COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose when eligible.* In addition participants must have a negative result from a PCR test taken up to 48 hours prior to arrival at event registration. All participants will show proof of “Up to Date” vaccination status and the negative PCR test before receiving event credentials. Mask protocols will be shared prior to the event and will be based on local guidelines.

Rhode Island-based CVS is shifting its focus to primary care minute clinics and prescription delivery. It's reimagining its remaining stores as ""community health destinations"" where one could go for minor medical treatment or to stock up on health and wellness products while getting drugs delivered to their door especially for chronic conditions like diabetes hypertension or congestive heart failure.

CVS won't say whether any drugstores in Northwest Indiana will be shuttered but it plans to close nearly one tenth of its locations nationwide over the next three years as it reimagines its business model for a digital age.

“Now is the time to undertake our next major evolution and capitalize on our role as the leading health solutions company in America” CVS Health President and CEO Karen Lynch said. “By leaning into our high-growth foundational businesses and expanding our reach in areas like health services and primary care we have an opportunity to shift care to be more centered around the consumer while capturing a meaningfully greater portion of health care spending.”

Evolving pharmacy business models will mean many customers opting to get their prescriptions delivered by Walgreens Amazon and one of the growing number of online pharmacists that deliver drugs right to the mailbox. But brick-and-mortar pharmacies also double as hubs of convenient neighborhood shopping sometimes in underprivileged neighborhoods where it's miles to the nearest grocery store. So more people in Northwest Indiana could end up lacking a late-night place down the street where they can quickly pop in to grab Band Aids shampoo or other essentials in just a few minutes without having to navigate a much larger grocery store where the lines can be much longer.

CVS closed 12 pharmacies across Northwest Indiana after it acquired the homegrown Fagen Pharmacy chain in 2017. Walgreen's has been closing pharmacies for years in the Region including in Calumet City Hobart and Gary where it shut down all four of its locations. A few of the vacant pharmacies have since been taken over by dollar stores that don't fill prescriptions.

Both major national chains have reduced the number of 24/7 locations they open to the point where the Walgreens at Cline Avenue and 45th Street in Griffith appears to be the only one left.

""It's tough because Fagen's closed too"" said Jessica Renslow a community activist in Miller where a Dollar General took over the vacated Walgreen's. ""Edgewater and Methodist Hospital both opened pharmacies I believe to help.""

It's been a burden for some particularly lower-income residents who rely on public transportation to get around.

""The closest pharmacy is the Walgreens in Lake Station"" Renslow said. ""Health equity is a really tough issue right now.""

The problem is exacerbated because big national chains have put many smaller independent community pharmacies out of business over the years Indiana University Northwest Associate Professor of Economics Micah Pollak said.

""In the last few decades we’ve seen significant consolidation among retail pharmacies. Today many cities and towns are served by only one or two national chains with few or no local pharmacies"" he said. ""With both CVS and Walgreens now closing many retail locations this creates pharmacy deserts particularly in regions that were already under-served. Unfortunately this forces residents to travel further for their medications or even worse may mean some no longer have access at all to fill their prescriptions.""

Pharmacy deserts in already struggling neighborhoods could create more public health problems Pollak said.

""We will hopefully see new pharmacies open to serve these areas but that may not happen for years and until it does this will likely worsen health disparities"" he said.

Walgreen's and CVS are not immune from e-commerce said David Lasser with Merrillville-based Commercial In-Sites. Good RX Express Scripts and Medco have been operating online pharmacies that mail prescriptions directly to patients' homes and now retail giant Amazon is getting into the pharmacy space.

""Amongst all the other changes in e-commerce and shopper preferences that the pharmaceutical chains like CVS and Walgreens are contending with now they have Amazon to add to the list of outright competitors"" Lasser said.

Pharmacy chains have adapted to the increased competition by diversifying and trying to position themselves more as convenient providers of health care services Lasser said. People will increasingly be able to visit a pharmacy to see a doctor or get a flu sprain or minor illness checked out.

""The trend towards not only closing some excess stores has another aspect underway that of expanding in-store clinics"" he said. ""For example presently within a local Walgreen’s store at Schererville at Indianapolis Boulevard and Main Street a full clinic with a staffed physician is under construction.""

Stores such as Target Walmart and local pharmacies likely will see an increase in prescriptions and traffic to the stores said Brett McDermott senior vice president and co-founder of Crown Point-based Latitude Commercial.

It's not clear how long the vacant real estate would stay on the market. Most of it is in highly visible prime locations along heavily trafficked roads.

""As far as the real estate side CVS is similar to Walgreens in the fact they like to be located at hard corners which are ideal for retailers. Once they announce store closings we will potentially see the stores go 'dark' for a little while"" McDermott said. ""If CVS doesn’t own the particular location they typically will still be bound to a long-term lease depending on how long they’ve been located there. CVS works with developers where they build the store sign a long-term lease on it and then sell to an investor. Due to this many of the locations will probably still have some length on the term. The investor isn’t going to let CVS off the hook so CVS will more than likely look to sublease their store. We’ve seen many closed Walgreens do this and have worked with tenants such as dollar stores medical use or for instance Jump Zone who took over a former Walgreens in Hobart. This allows for CVS to recoup some of their lease payments but they still stay on the hook as a guarantor.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbXlyZ3YuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8xOS9jYW5vLWhlYWx0aC1jb21lcy10by1icm93bnN2aWxsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cano Health comes to Brownsville,"A fast-growing national company specializing in primary care for seniors now has a location in Brownsville.

Cano Health LLC founded in 2009 and headquartered in Miami Fla. has opened a location at 1454 Central Blvd. in the space formerly occupied by CVS pharmacy. It’s one of 11 locations to open in the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio since 2020 according to the company’s chief financial officer Brian Koppy who said the focus is on meeting unmet needs in under-served communities by providing primary healthcare “all wrapped around access wellness and quality.”

The company started with a single location in Florida and today has 130 sites and physicians in six states and affiliate physicians in New York New Jersey and Puerto Rico he said noting that Medicare recipients are Cano Health’s primary market. Koppy said the company partners with insurance companies to help grow in under-served markets and that Humana is a major partner in Texas.

Cano Health’s primary care centers like those recently launched in the Valley are centered around primary-care physicians and practice what the company calls “high-touch population health management” he said.

“That includes prescription home delivery various wellness programs transition of care” Koppy said. “We have high-risk and complex-care management tele-health —all those services that you can wrap around primary care. We have a healthy heart program by Dr. Juan (Rivera). All programs that are aligned to meet the primary care needs of our members.”

Many of the patients enrolling with Cano Health in under-served communities haven’t seen a doctor for years and the company’s health-management approach strives for a high degree of patient engagement Koppy said. It’s not merely about making the services available but encouraging members to take advantage of them he said.

Koppy said that on average the company’s members/patients come in eight times a year to see a doctor but there are many more opportunities for engagement throughout the year.

“Through all the various social fitness and wellness activities our members will come in another 12 times a year to these medical centers” he said. “So that’s more than 20 visits a year nearly twice a month for our members to come into our medical centers. So they really become health community centers where it’s not just about coming in when you’re feeling sick or you have bad knee or a bad back.”

The centers also serve as a place where seniors looking for ways to stay active can come in for physiotherapy play backgammon do arts and crafts chair yoga and so on Koppy said. Cano Health provides transportation to and from its centers for members he said.

“We find our drivers are a great brand ambassador for us” Koppy said. “They really develop strong relationships with many of our members.”

For patients with incurable diseases it’s about managing care so those patients can live healthier and happier lives with less pain he said.

Cano Health centers in the Valley accept Medicare Advantage plans from payers such as Aetna Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas Centene Cigna and Prominence Health Plan with Humana coming soon. No patient is ever turned away for care though the Valley centers are not currently accepting Medicaid plans according to the company.

Inc. magazine in 2020 named Cano Health the fastest growing primary-care provider in the United States for the second consecutive year. Koppy said the company intends to keep growing its footprint in the Valley and elsewhere which means expect to see more Cano Health primary care centers.

“We believe that in order for us to be effective in the markets that we’re in we want to build scale and density” he said. “That gives us more access points for our members but it also leverages our overall economies of scale as we move into a market.

“We continue to believe the Rio Grande Valley is an excellent market for us to continue to grow in and for the rest of Texas as well we like the markets we’re in. We’re going to continue to expand (in those markets) as well as find new markets throughout Texas. We’re right now looking for new locations for expansion.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLXNraWxscy10cmFpbmluZy1wcm9ncmFtcy1jYW4tbGVhZC10by1qb2JzLXdpdGgtaGlnaGVyLXBheS_SAWVodHRwczovL3doeXkub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1za2lsbHMtdHJhaW5pbmctcHJvZ3JhbXMtY2FuLWxlYWQtdG8tam9icy13aXRoLWhpZ2hlci1wYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia skills training programs can lead to jobs with higher pay,"This story originally appeared in The Philadelphia Tribune.

Philadelphia’s business community is joining with community groups and universities to offer skilled training programs to fill much-needed positions that start off as entry level but typically lead to higher paying jobs and careers.

Since the pandemic many city companies are trying to expand but are struggling to find employees. At the same time many city residents lack the necessary skills to fill the openings. These training programs provide a needed service to job seekers and the business community.

In August 2020 the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corp. (PIDC) launched its Navy Yard Skills Initiative.

The program was made possible with a $1.5 million grant from JP Morgan Chase to the University City District to support the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative in collaboration with Temple University and PIDC to build a network of employer-driven workforce programs in West North and South Philadelphia.

Since 2018 Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center’s Smart Energy Technical Training program has offered customized job training and job-placement services for those who are interested in the energy industries such as solar and electric-car charging technology. These two sectors are growing rapidly in job and career opportunities as clean energy and electric vehicles become more popular. The OIC is one of the region’s oldest and largest providers of tuition-free job-training and career-development services.

Both programs are seeking applicants now for programs starting in January.

Temple University through its Lenfest Center for Community Workforce Partners formed in 2018 also offers job and career training programs.

Delena Smith skilled-trades program manager of OIC’s Smart Energy Technical Training program said it is designed to get graduates entry-level positions in the solar electric-car charging and other energy-related businesses.

“It was started because of the need for skills training in trades jobs” Smith said. “We know that solar is the future so it just made sense.”

According to Smith about 70 people have completed the eight-week program which is sponsored in part by PECO and is tuition free. To enroll you must be 18-years-old have a high school diploma or GED be able to lift 50 pounds go up an extension ladder and pass a reading and math test.

After finishing the program participants are given an OIC certificate of completion and an Occupational Safety and Health Administration certification. This means the holder has completed a 10-hour safety and health information course for entry workers in the construction and general industry.

Graduates of the program have been hired by companies such as PECO Solar State and Volta Charging. Based in San Francisco Volta Charging is one of the top builders of electric-vehicle charging stations in the U.S.

“We’ve been able to place 83%” Smith said. “The pay starts at $15 an hour but goes up with experience. (Participants) are very excited about it. Many of our participants have no trades experience.”

As part of the program Smith also teaches a class on “life skills” such as conflict resolution professionalism time management and dealing with difficult people in the work place. Employers had specifically asked for these skills Smith said."

Gene Lee 60 said Friday he will remain as board chairman after he steps down after seven years as CEO. He will be replaced by Rick Cardenas a longtime Darden employee.

Lee is credited with successfully guiding Darden through the pandemic. In addition to Olive Garden and LongHorn company also owns Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen Yard House The Capital Grille Seasons 52 Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s. It has more than 1850 locations making it the nation’s largest full-service restaurant chain with annual sales in excess of $7 billion.

Restaurant analyst John Gordon told the Orlando Sentinel that Lee has been “extremely strong steady hand that steadied the company.” He called Darden’s handling of the pandemic a “virtuoso performance.” The company established a paid sick-leave policy for its employees and provided emergency pay to employees who were furloughed when dining rooms closed.

“There was never any doubt about the survival of Darden” Gordon said.

Cardenas 53 started with the company as an hourly employee in 1984 and worked his way through the ranks. He became the chief financial officer in 2016 and became president and chief operating officer 11 months ago.

He said he does not expect to make any major changes in how the company operates.

“I really think the strategy that we have is the right strategy” Cardenas told analysts and shareholders in a conference call Friday. “I don’t see a big change in our strategic priorities partly because I was a big part of writing them.”

Lee did say the company will increase its minimum hourly wage from $10 to $12 including tips starting next month and that most employees will make more. He said the average restaurant worker will make $20 per hour.

The $12 figure “is what I would call entry-level wage and more in rural America” Lee said. “In the major cities you’re not hiring anybody for $12 an hour today. This is an increase and a guarantee to our workforce that will probably have more impact on Cheddar’s than any of our other brands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTE5Mjcvc3lzY28tZWxlY3RzLXRocmVlLW5ldy1kaXJlY3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sysco Elects Three New Directors,"HOUSTON Dec. 17 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sysco Corporation (NYSE: SYY) the leading global foodservice distribution company announced today that three new directors Ali Dibadj Jill M.

Actions speak louder than words. Over the last two decades companies worldwide have set goals and made pledges to reduce their environmental impact and become more sustainable. The majority of these changes were brought forth due to shifts in public policy and consumer opinion as concerns about global warming and pollution increase. Most companies set their own goals while maintaining legal requirements. Regardless the facts remain the same — countless companies have fallen behind on their promises.

Keep reading to discover 10 companies failing to keep their promises and five that are going green.

Those Who Miss the Mark

These 10 companies are failing to keep their promises on sustainability and ethics.

1. Amazon

This global giant says it’s committed to and invested in sustainability. It has set goals to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Some initiatives support a more sustainable future for the company but many of their fundamental values promote unsustainable practices.

At its core the company encourages consumerism and advocates faster shipping for customers. Suggestions for greener shipping options have been passed-over for fear of alienating customers but reports show a new plan — electric delivery trucks. If Amazon implements its new fleet of delivery vehicles it could transform its reputation for being an unsustainable company.

2. Netflix

The Netflix business model is unsustainable. Their tendency to start big-budget projects and then end them after a single season is a waste of materials and resources. Additionally their business model encourages people to use the internet contributing to collective digital traffic and subsequent energy usage. Fossil fuels provide electricity globally which means the more internet usage the higher the daily emissions.

3. Exxon Mobil

This company consistently ranks highly for global emissions. Despite their promises to position themselves for a lower-carbon future their business model currently relies solely on fossil fuels. Exxon believes its products are essential to modern life and through producing those products they are committed to protecting the environment.

4. Samsung

Receiving a “D” in Greenpeace’s 2017 Guide to Greener Electronics Report Samsung has fallen behind competitors regarding sustainability and transparency. While the company continues to publish greenhouse gas emissions and its energy footprint it fails to publish a list of its suppliers. Without the list of suppliers it’s challenging to discern the company’s real level of sustainability.

5. Walmart

Walmart began its quest for sustainability in the mid-2000s but it still has a long way to go. While it’s set lofty goals like zero emissions by 2040 average consumers see unnecessary consumption — like single-use plastic bags — used in daily operations and transactions.

6. 3M

3M has been busy with lofty goals and products spanning 11 different industries. While they’ve reached or maintained many of their growth promises they’ve fallen short with others. Specifically they are behind on their goal to improve energy efficiency by 30% by 2025. Instead they’ve only indexed a 3.2% change.

7. Darden Restaurants

Comprised of Olive Garden Longhorn Bahama Breeze and more Darden restaurants include many fan-favorite chains. Their website describes a commitment to sustainability but they haven’t updated their report since 2014. The 2015 sustainability goal update reports that they’ve reached their goals but there is no further information supplied outside of this report.

8. Starbucks

Starbucks shocked the world by announcing they were going strawless in the name of sustainability. However the amount of plastic waste from their straw usage is nothing compared to their disposable plastic cups. While they also offer paper cups a thin layer of liquid-resistant material coats the cups and makes them non-recyclable. As a leader in the food and beverage industry this company could be doing more to reduce its footprint.

9. H&M

This Swedish fast-fashion giant is known for making promises but frequently misses the targets. With efforts to be more sustainable they began clothing recycling programs. However many people pointed out that it would be greener if their clothes would last for years rather than quickly falling apart.

Besides this the clothing company is known for underpaying its overseas workers. Despite promises David Savman H&M’s global head of production says none of the workers are being paid living wages due to disagreements on what qualifies as a fair figure.

10. Victoria’s Secret

With a lack of transparency this company has failed to prove it has eliminated toxic waste from the supply chain by 2020. Additionally it sources cotton from the Better Cotton Initiative but the company does not list the exact amount or extent to which this cotton makes up their clothing.

Those Who Pioneer Change

These five companies are demonstrating their commitment to going green.

1. Disney

Disney seems to constantly expand their business and influence over the world but they have sustainable practices to support that growth. For example in 2019 the company purchased a 270-acre solar facility outside of Orlando. With this facility and other initiatives they are able to reduce their net emissions by 47% and it is expected that this number will grow as their initiatives increase.

2. Kemin

Kemin understands the importance of sustainability through three healthy tiers — people planet and business. The company continues to seek ways to manage resources responsibly and minimize their environmental footprint. To date Kemin is the only SCS-certified Sustainably Grown rosemary and spearmint supplier.

3. Burt’s Bees

Burt’s Bees has not sent waste to the landfill since 2011. It also prioritizes responsible sourcing and carbon neutrality. While the goal was to be carbon neutral by 2020 the company reached it four years sooner and has maintained that status to date.

4. Target

Target has continued to reach its goals and set new goals year after year. One especially noteworthy promise is their commitment to invest up to $5 million in green chemistry innovation by 2022. In 2017 they’d only invested $802440 but by 2018 the number had tripled and continues to grow.

5. Ørsted

By divesting from fossil fuels and investing in wind farms instead Ørsted was able to reduce their carbon emissions by 86%. Ultimately their eco-friendly practices led them to rank as the most sustainable corporation in the world according to the Corporate Knights 2020 Global 100 index.

Remember to Research

In a survey conducted by Bain of 300 respondents only 2% of companies expected to achieve or exceed their sustainability goals they’d originally set. As you can see from the list above many companies make promises but fail to keep them. Always conduct research before investing in a company that markets itself as sustainable or eco-friendly.

The Adel Partners Chamber of Commerce joined Iowa Spring Manufacturing for a groundbreaking ceremony on Nov. 11. The current facility is located at 2112 Greene St. in Adel and the new facility will be located just down the road on the east side of Vision Parkway.

Iowa Spring Manufacturing President and CEO Tim Bianco said the new facility will be 55000 square feet with 50000 of that being used for the warehouse and 5000 for office space. Bianco added that the company is investing $7.4 million into the facility and between $3-5 million in equipment.

“We have experienced growth rapid growth in the last 24 months. But sustained growth over the last 10 years and we’ve set ourselves apart from our competition to the extent where we’re sought after in our industry” Bianco said. “As we continue to grow we’re out of space here.”

Iowa Spring Manufacturing produces large mechanical springs for products from other companies including Overhead Door Corporation John Deere and more. Some of those products include springs for overhead garage doors cultivators railcars and more.

“The demand for our product has increased exponentially over the last couple years and COVID has really shined a light on that” Bianco said. “We have space constraints here and so the plan is to break out business segments from this facility and move them into the new facility so we can expand both of those segments.”

He added that the company plans to continue making overhead garage door springs in the current facility and then mechanical springs for railcars material handling and other applications will be made in the new facility.

Once the new facility is completed Bianco said the plan is to continue growing with new equipment in both buildings. Twenty current Iowa Spring employees will move to the new facility and Bianco said they plan to hire another 20 employees once the new facility is up and running.

The new facility is expected to be completed in mid-summer of 2022 with full occupation by the fall.

Bianco said the company has looked at expanding in other states before deciding on an expansion in Adel.

“We’re grounded in Adel our roots are here. We’ve been here since 1979 and are just honored by what the community has done for us” he said.

When his father was looking at purchasing Iowa Spring Manufacturing’s current building in Adel he couldn’t afford it. Bianco said a group of business people formed the Adel Development Corporation and co-signed a loan for his father to purchase the building.

“So to recognize that to remember that and know where you come from and then to honor that by continuing to grow here” Bianco said of the company’s decision to expand in Adel.

He added that the company has a sister facility in North Carolina. While Iowa Spring Manufacturing is focusing on getting the new facility up and running in Adel the company is already looking ahead.

“We fully intend on doing another facility somewhere in North America in the next three to five years” Bianco said."

The Team USA-inspired A330-900 celebrates Delta’s new eight-year partnership with Team USA which runs through the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

“Delta and Team USA share a deep belief that connecting the world makes us all better” said Tim Mapes Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Delta. “This one-of-a-kind livery celebrates our partnership which has been built on shared values and the inspiring athletes of Team USA whose indomitable spirit lies at the heart of both our ‘Keep Climbing’ message and the Olympic and Paralympic Movement.”

The custom livery was designed by Shane Edwards Delta’s Product and Experiential Design Manager in collaboration with the airline’s in-house creative team Window Seat. Unique Team USA design elements that are incorporated throughout the livery were developed by Carey McKay Delta Art Director and Graphic Designer and will also be featured in various Delta visuals materials and platforms both in flight and on the ground.

Global carrier is now the official airline of Team USA on road to Beijing 2022 Paris 2024 Milano Cortina 2026 and LA28.

“The team opted for a clean classic design to promote the partnership between Team USA and Delta” Edwards said. “The Team USA logo is prominently featured along with a blue gradient that represents the sky and ‘rise to the top’ with a grounding red element representing the resilience needed to get there.”

The custom paint design which started flying Dec. 18 will be assigned primarily trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes. Serving Delta’s commitment and path to a more sustainable future the A330-900 is a key part of Delta’s widebody fleet renewal plan and is 21% more fuel-efficient per ASM than the 767s it replaces in the fleet. The plane encompasses Delta’s enduring support for Team USA and its pursuit of excellence.

To further its commitment to Team USA Delta has also proudly partnered with six inspiring athletes on their journey to the Beijing Winter Games. Delta and Team USA have a shared drive to be the best and the airline will support these athletes both on and off the field of play celebrating their stories of resilience and perseverance as they pursue their Olympic and Paralympic dreams.

Six U.S. Olympians Paralympians and Hopefuls—Maame Biney Amber Glenn Breezy Johnson Dan Cnossen Jen Lee and Oksana Masters—join Delta as athlete ambassadors on their journey to compete on the world’s biggest sporting stage.

Delta revealed the new livery at an event Friday hosted by Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir near its global headquarters in Atlanta. Nearly 600 employees were in attendance as Delta CEO Ed Bastian unveiled the aircraft livery alongside LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games Chairperson Casey Wasserman. Olympic Legends Apolo Ohno (Speed Skating) and Vonetta Flowers (Bobsled) were also on hand for the first look alongside Cnossen Glenn and U.S. Paralympian Mallory Weggemann.

“I’m very proud to partner with Delta on the road to the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games” Cnossen said. “Its support is invaluable especially as I approach my third Paralympic Games and it is very exciting to see how they will celebrate Team USA through the new livery design. Delta is all about helping people’s dreams take flight whether you’re an Olympic or Paralympic athlete or an everyday traveler. This plane is one of many ways Delta will bring the Olympic and Paralympic spirit to life in the air and on the ground—and as an athlete I’m honored to be a part of this journey.”

As Team USA’s official airline Delta will manage travel for U.S. Olympians and Paralympians to Beijing 2022 Paris 2024 Milano Cortina 2026 and LA28 where it also is an inaugural founding partner. The first Beijing-bound flight will depart in January from Los Angeles International Airport and operate as a charter in order to meet Chinese government entry requirements. Delta’s charter flights are the only way Team USA athletes and staff will travel to Beijing 2022 from the U.S.

“Even through a global pandemic Team USA athletes have endured and thrived in pursuit of the Olympic and Paralympic dream” said Bill Wernecke Managing Director – Charter Operations. “We are proud to carry this extraordinary team into competition and we look forward to being the first to welcome them home.”

The partnership with Team USA furthers the global airline’s longstanding support for sport—and its proud history supporting Team USA at the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Delta served as a past sponsor of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in its hometown in the Atlanta 1996 and Salt Lake City 2002.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4eXVhdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi91cy1jYXJyaWVycy1vdXRsaW5lLTIwMjItY3JvYXRpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US carriers outline 2022 Croatia operations,"

The United States’ “Big 3” carriers - American Airlines Delta and United - have outlined their plans for the upcoming 2022 summer season and the future development of their operations to Dubrovnik. American which launched seasonal flights from Philadelphia to the Croatian coastal city in 2019 was set to return in 2020 with additional flights and capacity. However the coronavirus pandemic has seen the airline indefinitely delay the route. Brian Znotins American Airlines’ Vice President for Network and Schedule Planning said the company will “take a holistic evaluation” of its Dubrovnik route in the coming years to determine whether to potentially restore flights depending on how demand and competition has changed in the market by that time. “There's nothing to say that we won't necessarily restart flights again” Mr Znotins said adding that Philadelphia is “the natural draw” for utilising new aircraft as they come in to ramp up service to Europe.





Delta introduced seasonal flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Dubrovnik during the summer of 2022 but at this point does not plan to restore flights next year. As Europe has reopened for American travellers Delta is looking to increase operations to traditional markets frequented by US tourists and destinations that can attract even more high-yielding passengers. Croatia was one of the few countries within the European Union to permit entry to US citizens and residents both this year and last year with Delta noting it was one of the major factors for the introduction of its flights to Dubrovnik.





United Airlines has confirmed the resumption of flights between New York’s Newark Airport and the Croatian coastal city next summer following a successful debut this year. The carrier will restore operations on May 27 2022 with four weekly rotations departing Newark each Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday. Furthermore the US carrier has extended its flight program to Dubrovnik with services to be run until the end of the 2022 summer season on October 26 of next year. All flights will be maintained by the Boeing 767-300 aircraft. United’s Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella has said the Dubrovnik service was launched in response to Croatia maintaining open borders for American citizens and residents throughout the coronavirus pandemic and has performed strongly as a result. “We feel really bullish about Europe for next summer. We had a look of that this summer. We started in a few new markets. In fact we loaded those for sale very late. And those new markets are actually some of our top performing city fares because Croatia and Greece in particular made it clear to the world that they were open for business. And in fact our customers responded to it immediately and our new flights did incredibly well” Mr Nocella said.

A Talking Glass Media production.

Dexcom the global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes has announced the opening of its second Mesa facility where distribution operations will take place for Dexcom’s innovative continuous glucose monitoring systems. Dexcom leadership joined Mesa Mayor John Giles to formally dedicate the 500000-square-foot Dexcom Mesa Regional Distribution Center (RDC) with a ribbon cutting ceremony in front of employees local community members and diabetes care

advocates.

“Mesa is proud to be the home of two Dexcom facilities” said Mesa Mayor John Giles. “Since their arrival in 2017 Dexcom has increased job opportunities in both healthcare and manufacturing and has proven to be a tremendous community partner. I’m proud of their success and pleased to celebrate the opening of the Regional Distribution Center.”

This new state-of-the-art facility will help advance Dexcom’s mission to empower people to take control of their diabetes by distributing the world’s leading real-time CGM system. Dexcom CGM technology uses a small wearable sensor and transmitter to measure and send real-time glucose values wirelessly to a smartphone or a receiver* without the need for painful fingerpricks.† In 2018 Dexcom began manufacturing CGM technology in Mesa with just 300 manufacturing employees and one 10000-squarefoot manufacturing space. By the end of 2022 Dexcom’s total Mesa operations will span two facilities four manufacturing areas that are almost entirely automatic include 1700 employees and combined equate to a footprint the size of nearly 15 American football fields.

“We are overjoyed to celebrate the opening of our new Regional Distribution Center which will help Dexcom scale distribution of its life-changing CGM technology including the future next-gen Dexcom G7” said Kevin Sayer chairman president and CEO of Dexcom. “We’re proud to be part of the Mesa community and look forward to helping this city grow by providing meaningful careers in healthcare – with significant hiring goals at both our Dobson manufacturing facility and here at the Regional Distribution

Center – while making a profound impact on the lives of people with diabetes.”

Dexcom is seeking applicants for Material Handlers openings for all shifts. Pay starts at $16.51 an hour and forklift and pallet jack experience is required. Along with competitive pay Dexcom benefits include medical dental vision 120 hours of paid time off per year 40 hours of sick time per year 401k match education reimbursement and a great inclusive company culture.

Prior to fully opening Dexcom’s RDC gained recognition earlier this year as the nation’s first and only fully air conditioned indoor COVID-19 drive-thru vaccination site. This allowed for more than 100000 vaccine doses to be administered to the community without facing the Arizona heat.

For: Kim Szeto 17 HKFYG Lee Shau Kee College

“Work hard! It’s for your own good! Only if you get into university can you find a good job and earn big bucks.”

We all grow up listening to our parents’ advice working towards this goal. However billionaire businessmen without a university degree such as the late Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates make headlines around the world for their wonderful achievements.

So you begin to wonder whether you need to attend university to achieve financial success. For me the trio are an exception yet they still prove that universities open more doors and ensure a better future for young adults.

Why so many students are holding off on university

Such opportunities usually lead to a wider range of career choices and a higher chance to earn more money.

On the flip side there’s a limited number of jobs available for those without a university degree. Numbers don’t lie. According to the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities in Washington the annual median salary of high school graduates is only US$33000 while bachelor’s degree holders earn up to US$44000. The earnings difference grows to more than US$1.3 million over their lifetime.

In this knowledge-based world that we live in when labour-intensive jobs are mostly taken up by machines a university education has become indispensable for all of us.

At university we can also network with high-achievers or those with similar interests. For example Harvard provided Zuckerberg with a chance to meet Eduardo Saverin one of the co-founders of Facebook.

In other words university may not offer people instant wealth but it paves the way to long-term financial success.

The argument that university is not necessary for financial success is only an illusion. Jobs Zuckerberg and Gates were all admitted to top-notch universities in the US when they were young. Arguably that made a big difference in their lives. After all as the old saying goes “you reap what you sow”.

Books you should read before heading to uni in the US

Against: Annabel Cheung 12 St. Paul’s Co-educational College

University may lead to better job opportunities but is it really necessary for financial success? My answer is “no” because financial success is not only about being employed and getting a high salary but also about earning enough money to support your family without falling into debt.

Although gaining a university degree means that you have had a good education there are secondary school graduates who started off in lower-paid jobs and went to become top executives at multinational companies thanks to their experience and hard work.

What’s more there are lots of amazing careers that don’t actually require a university degree such as chefs musicians key opinion leaders or “influencers” fashion designers and artists. You can make a fortune from these careers depending on your ability.

There’s also the fact that many students accumulate large amounts of debt to pay for university. Photo: Shutterstock

Also universities – which emphasise theoretical knowledge – are not the only source of higher education available; there are post-secondary institutes that focus more on practical knowledge and hands-on experience.

These institutes can help you pursue a career that you are truly interested in.

There are some negative aspects of university graduates getting high-paying jobs. For example they would not want to make an investment since they are already well-off.

On the other hand school leavers might take such a risk and if it comes off they may set up a company and hire university graduates to work for them!

So finding a good job after university studies may actually be a hindrance to becoming a successful entrepreneur.

Statistics show that nearly 30 per cent of today’s billionaires don’t have a bachelor’s degree. This shows that going to university is not a requirement for being wealthy.

It is still possible for people with a lower education to have successful lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LEACHVILLE Ark — One week after a deadly tornado tore through parts of Arkansas the community of Leachville is still working to pick up the pieces.

""Our little town is just gone but it can be rebuilt but the life we lost in Dollar General can not"" said Sue Scott who knew June Pennington who died last Friday.

Officials say Pennington was trapped working at the Leachville Dollar General when the storm hit.

Neighbors of the tight knit community now grieve the loss.

""My heart just breaks for her family because she was a part of our daily life because that's the only store we had in this town"" said Scott.

Another employee was with Pennington when the storm hit.

The teen wouldn't talk to THV11 on camera but says she shielded him with her body while the two huddled inside a bathroom in the back of the store.

Debris from the store is still spread out on the ground behind a fence now.

""Just look around you know. We're still picking up. Rebuilding. But Ms. Pennington's never coming back"" said Scott.

The journey to recovery is continuing long after the storm has passed. Many neighbors finding other housing options.

""We've been in a hotel all week long. At the Holiday Inn in Jonesboro"" said Melroy Johnson.

He's traveling back and forth to his family's damaged home to pick up their belongings.

""Just been working you know. Just trying to salvage what I can. Store stuff in my storage. Talk to the insurance companies.""

Even through the debris the family is focusing on appreciating what they still have — each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlYWwuY29tL3BvZGNhc3RzL2FjdGl2aXN0LWludmVzdGluZy10b2RheS1yNXMtbXVzaGtpbi10YWxrcy1kb2xsYXItdHJlZS1oYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Activist Investing Today: R5’s Mushkin Talks Dollar Tree Hain,"Dollar Tree Inc.’s (DLTR) board “doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on” as it faces a total board takeover effort launched by Mantle Ridge LP according to Scott Mushkin founder of consumer-focused research firm R5 Capital LLC.

Mantle Ridge run by Paul Hilal “couldn’t have a better partner” than the one it struck with Richard Dreiling a former Dollar General Corp. (DG) CEO Mushkin said on the Activist Investing Today podcast.

On the podcast Mushkin said he suspects Mantle Ridge will have some success with its efforts especially as Dollar Tree has significantly underperformed its chief rival Dollar General; the S&P 500 index; and other retailers.

Mantle Ridge wants to revamp Dollar Tree’s pricing strategy. After conducting surveys Mushkin suggested that the discount retailer’s recent rollout of a price increase from $1 to $1.25 for many items could be comparable to Coca-Cola Co. (KO)’s problematic 1985 release of “New Coke.”

“Dollar Tree’s brand is so tied to ‘everything is a dollar’ so you have to be careful about doing [multi-price] without destroying your brand” he said.

Mushkin also discussed Engaged Capital LLC-targeted Hain Celestial Inc.’s (HAIN) M&A strategy noting that it was unlikely that the organic foods maker will be sold to a large packaged foods company any time soon. “From our understanding if there was an offer that was reasonable they would definitely have considered it” Mushkin said.

Mushkin who was an analyst most recently at Wolfe Research launched R5 Capital last year to provide research and strategic consulting advice to consumer-focused companies including retailers.

Bond has been set for a homeless man who is accused of robbing a Naperville Dollar Tree store at knifepoint Thursday.

Melvin Lewis 44 has been charged with armed robbery.

Just before 9 a.m. Thursday Naperville officers responded to the Dollar Tree store located at 1550 N. Route 59 for a report of an armed robbery.

According to authorities a man wearing a surgical mask who was later identified as Lewis approached the register with several items. His purchase was declined and at that point he allegedly displayed a silver knife and demanded money from the cash register.

The cashier then gave Lewis about $60 from the register.

Lewis then allegedly fled the scene.

At that time the cashier called 911.

While investigating the robbery authorities identified Lewis as the suspect. He was taken into custody Friday at a nearby hotel where he was living.

""Crimes like this are senseless and put our community at risk"" Naperville Chief of Police Jason Arres said. ""We will continue to vigorously investigate crimes such as this and hold those responsible accountable.""

A judge set bond at $1.5 million for Lewis.

It has been 15 years since South Carolina last opened a state park.

The 190 acres at Misty Lake off Ascauga Lake Road in Aiken County had been used as a recreational retreat for Dominion employees and their guests and boasts a 6200-square-foot clubhouse. The site is one of three properties that are expected to come into the state park service over the next year the others being Pine Island Club on Lake Murray near Columbia and the Ramsey Grove plantation in Georgetown County.

Plans for an additional land offer from Dominion the 94-acre Bundrick Island also on Lake Murray have not yet been finalized.

Paul McCormack director of the South Carolina Park Service called the land transfers a “hopeful case” and said the final approval process would take place next week with the formal deed transfer from Dominion occurring sometime next year.

The property at Misty Lake valued at $2.48 million would require little work following the transfer before it would be ready for public use. McCormack said that Dominion had maintained the property including its infrastructure despite not having used the clubhouse since the pandemic began.

There are no hiking trails at the site currently but the land is associated with another site that McCormack said was suitable for a longer-term campground.

The state had most recently opened a new park in 2006 when the 7000-acre H. Cooper Black recreation area in northeastern South Carolina was transferred to the park service from the state Forestry Commission.

Separate from the deal with Dominion McCormack said the park service is also working with the state Department of Natural Resources to turn a site at Charleston’s Fort Johnson into a park.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY29ycGdvdi5sYXcuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC8yMDIxLWNwYS16aWNrbGluLWluZGV4LW9mLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1wb2xpdGljYWwtZGlzY2xvc3VyZS1hbmQtYWNjb3VudGFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability,"In a two-year period marked by political polarization civil unrest and the January 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol more U.S. companies have adapted by expanding board oversight of potentially controversial political spending. This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch is reporting that Virginia’s capital city will get a new tallest building when CoStar Group a commercial real estate analytics and research firm expands its James River campus with a 26-story skyscraper.

The tower will rise on vacant land adjacent to a nine-story building the Washington-based company acquired last year and will be part of a $460 million expansion of its corporate campus in Downtown Richmond on nearly 4 acres of vacant land purchased by CoStar in August 2020 for $20 million.

CoStar also plans to build a six-story building where its employees can use a fitness and wellness center gather in conference facilities and an auditorium and visit stores and restaurants.

Construction on the project which includes 750000 square feet of office and retail space and is expected to add 2000 to 3000 new jobs to the more than 1000 CoStar has there now is set to begin in 2023 and be ready for use in 2024.

The new tower will rise 510 feet into the air blasting past the James Monroe state office tower which is 29 stories and 449 feet tall. Dominion Energy has a new building nearby that is 20 stories and 417 feet tall.

Office space in both buildings will be used by the sales marketing software development customer service and support teams.

CoStar CEO Andrew Florance who was a lab partner with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when both attended Princeton University announced the plans on Friday jokingly calling the new development “Little HQ2” a nod to Bezos’ East Coast headquarters in Northern Virginia know as “HQ2.”

Features of the new tower which is being designed by architect William Chilton of Pickard Chilton include solar panel siding that will provide a “significant amount of energy” used by the LEED-certified building according to the Times-Dispatch.

Creative couple Caroline Tompkins and Kevin Cudahy have rented their fair share of narrow small prewar New York City apartments. So when the pandemic hit the two decided to take advantage of the buyer’s market moving from their railroad unit in Greenpoint Brooklyn and purchasing a 1000-square-foot condo in Ridgewood Queens. But even with pluses like a balcony big enough to dine out on and an indoor garage that has already proven to be a lifesaver (if you’ve ever tried parking in this neighborhood you know what they’re talking about) there were a few minuses.

For starters a boxy low-ceiling setup glossy (in a bad way) builder-grade floors and absolutely zero architectural charm were the exact opposite of their style. “We joked that it looked like the apartments divorced dads move into on TV complete with plastic vertical slat blinds original to the building’s 1980s construction” shares Tompkins. To create a far-from-bland haven they called on Cudahy’s friend since high school Michael Yarinksy one half of the duo at Office of Tangible Space for help.

“Michael was the first person I thought of to ask for guidance” recalls Cudahy. “It’s invaluable to work with someone you can trust especially when you aren’t quite sure what it is that you want.”

Layout Comes First

The one thing the couple did know was that they wanted their space to feel like an oasis. Not so much from the city notes Tompkins (they take pleasure in the crowded streets) but from the once-strict distinction between their work and social lives. Unfortunately the strange original layout wasn’t doing them any favors. To separate the extra-large entryway from the living room Yarinsky proposed a wall divider. But since he’s used to million-dollar budgets he had to get creative on this scrappier project. “We had to do the most with very little” he explains. “The screen wall system isn’t even millwork it’s just fabricated plywood. But it holds the space really well and allows the light through.”

Find Your Anchor Points

Yarinsky also kept on budget by deviating from his studio’s typical use of bold paint or punchy wallpaper and coating a few strategically chosen walls in Venetian plaster instead. “If you did plaster everywhere it would have a lot less of an effect” he says. Concrete-like in appearance it added a much needed rich textural element to the bedroom and living room giving the space an earthier vibe and creating moments of contrast. “The material itself doesn’t actually cost that much; it’s the labor” he points out. “You can go jump on YouTube and learn how to do it yourself.” His top tip: Experiment with small patches before tackling an entire wall; it’s easy to mess up.

Balance Soft and Hard Lines

At first the furniture was too Miami Vice—a lot of chrome and glass—notes Tompkins so the group worked to add in more playful pieces. In the living room an Akari floor lamp is nestled next to a vintage Pierre Paulin lounge chair. In the bedroom acrylic nightstands host abstract-like table lamps by Virginia Sin. And Tangible Space’s signature curvy floating shelves can be spotted throughout juxtaposed by the linear framed photographs and paintings. “We do a lot of things with curvature and custom millwork and we can definitely go crazy-town for the right client on things like blob architecture but we find that it feels better if you do it in balance” explains Yarinsky.

Nothing Has to Be Permanent

Although the apartment is already outfitted with great finds purchased prior to moving day—Gae Aulenti chairs a Herman Miller Chiclet love seat and a George Nelson pendant lamp to name a few—Tompkins advises to “think of your apartment as an evolving space. Furniture can come and go. Always reevaluate.” The couple have now taken up the search for a new dining table and Joe Colombo chair (Simone Rocha if you’re reading this please get in touch). “Kevin loves online estate sales and auctions” notes Tompkins. “He drove two hours upstate to buy a basket painted like a watermelon. It takes time and patience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtMTAzMjQxNDcvUHJpbmNlLUNoYXJsZXMtZ29kZGF1Z2h0ZXItSW5kaWEtSGlja3MtcmV2ZWFscy1kcmFtYXRpYy1ob3NwaXRhbC1kYXNoLWRhdWdodGVyLURvbWluby5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDMyNDE0Ny9hbXAvUHJpbmNlLUNoYXJsZXMtZ29kZGF1Z2h0ZXItSW5kaWEtSGlja3MtcmV2ZWFscy1kcmFtYXRpYy1ob3NwaXRhbC1kYXNoLWRhdWdodGVyLURvbWluby5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince Charles' goddaughter India Hicks reveals dramatic hospital dash with daughter Domino,"Prince Charles' goddaughter has revealed the dramatic hospital dash leading up to her daughter's birth.

India Hicks who was a bridesmaid at the Prince's wedding to Diana and is 678th in line to the throne took to Instagram on Friday to celebrate her youngest child Domino's birthday and recalled how her husband David Flint was pulled over by police during their frantic drive to hospital.

India (seen pregnant in 2007) remembered how husband David was driving so fast the police pulled him over when she was in labour with her only daughter

Explaining that she had taken Domino on a girls' grip to The Rosewood hotel on the island to celebrate she shared a sweet snap as she beamed alongside her daughter.

India wrote: '14 years ago very early on the morning of December 17th David was stopped for speeding. Two hefty looking cops asked him to step out of the car. He must have really been going quite fast.

'""You are not going to believe this” David said to the police “but my girlfriend is having a baby.” They bent down to look inside the car and sure enough there I was fighting a contraction as Domino was well on her way.'

Referring to her four sons she continued: 'Now I’m pretty sure I was destined to be a boys' Mum. I could not imagine life with out 4 boys. I would miss all the loo seats up the lost socks the unimaginable idiotic things they do. I would even miss the day to day liability of living in ‘CAMP KILL YOURSELF' so when I finally gave birth to a daughter I could not quite believe it.'

She concluded: 'This birthday to celebrate 14 years of her we went on a girls trip.'

Posting a picture of a stunning home in her neighbourhood India wrote: 'This is the island today. In blazing full bloom. Except not quite. With the closure of the country comes the loss of tourism the lifeblood of the Bahamas economy. - Whilst many of the hotels have begun fundraising for their staff there is concern in the community for the more vulnerable members who might get lost in the shadows of this economic crisis..'

She writes: 'My mother taught me many things but cooking no not a hint of it. In my early twenties when I was modeling I lived off cereal and Licorice Allsorts. In my late twenties I ate a lot of toast and Marmite. In my early thirties I learnt to make scrambled eggs for the babies I kept having.

'Then Claire arrived and for the past fifteen years has swept into our kitchen fed the kids packed the picnics roasted the chickens and tossed the salads. She has prepared lunch for eight and dinner for 168. Fondly known as our Top Banana she has kept us all from being really hungry. Until now. She was off the island when the lock down came.

'So we have done a little adapting these past few weeks. There are 5 new chefs in our kitchen and they’ve made me bloody proud.'

Sharing a picture of a deserted local beach with her sons playing on it she wrote: 'It’s been strange to not hear the church bells ring or the sound of golf carts pootling around the island or the noise of a distant airplane arriving or leaving – All of those things have been restricted. - Much like the rest of the world everything here is changing daily. Today we were allowed back on the beach- mind you only for the recognized one hour of exercise and only with your immediate family. - But even though I am really truly blessed to live amongst swaying palm trees and beside turquoise waters I am struggling to sleep at night. What kind of world will our children now be growing up in? Let’s hope in amongst all this the earth is healing'

Proving her eye for style runs in the family she shared a pictujre of her daughter Domino painting her bedroom door writing: 'Actively encouraging her to paint all over the doors and walls. #lockdown'.

India also shared a picture of her stunning tabe display at Easter writing: 'They were meant to be rabbit ears- apparently I was the only one who could see that. The little chicks were more obvious but we didn’t have olives so I used blueberries - hey it’s strange times all round.'

Elsewhere India is seen using a basket of laundry to do a workout outside her stunning villa writing: 'Today is World Health Day- when health care workers around the world are celebrated. Never have they been more appreciated than right now. It’s also a day we should think about our own health.

'Don’t let bloody Corona stop you even on a month-long lock down. Looking for a 100 lbs bench press solution? Swipe right'.

And sharing a video of her family playing Monopoly in their garden she said: 'This afternoon we listened to The Queen’s Speech - and then took some time to sit together quietly as a family - be sure and swipe to see how that goes...'.

Meanwhile India also shared the struggles of homeschooling when her son Amory returned to college.

She wrote: 'Today Amory goes back to college. Which means walking across his bedroom at home to a desk in the corner. -

'He has dyslexia and ADHD. It’s severe enough that he attended a specialist school for kids with learning differences. A brilliant school which taught him valuable coping mechanisms and gave him confidence and optimism. He was finally able to swim out of the shallow end of his childhood.

'And with a great deal of commitment humor hard work and originality he went onto college. Here he felt the full richness and excitement of face-to-face teaching in a classroom filled with his peers. -

'But now his confidence is wobbling once again. He is asking how his subjects can be brought to life in this new digital remote environment and how will he cope with his diverse learning profile. -

I understand. I do. We are all asking questions. And we don’t have many answers. But how do we stop this virus also attacking the confidence of our kids? - -

'These photographs are of David’s study. A man who can shepherd words beautifully on a page and lose himself in a mountain of books'.

Posting a picture of her enviable palm-fringed garden overlooking the beach India wrote: 'Today even this little island went under a 24hr-curfew. We can see the beach we just can’t go to the beach. Bond is very confused as every day we run together on that beach now we will just stare at it together. . But the view is good the sun shines and a breeze blows. We are so lucky. Until someone gets seriously sick and then it gets tricky. This country is not set up to deal with a pandemic. Which is why with only 4 confirmed cases of Corona they have imposed such aggressive action. And rightly so I applaud the government. .'

Reflecting on the island's serenity with stunning pictures of the scenery another snap of the beach reads: 'All of the Bahamas is under a 24-hour lock down. Four days of the week we are not allowed to leave our homes three days of the week we can leave but only to grocery shop or take a little exercise and only when wearing a face mask. The grocery shopping days went a little funky last week with a sudden stop and then an equally sudden start but only shopping at certain times by certain letters of the alphabet.

'These draconian measures are correctly in place. This nation of friendly people needs to be protected. COVID-19 likes nothing more than underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes and doesn’t give a shit about the possible lack of health insurance or medical access. -

'And so this beach that would normally be sizzling with Easter weekenders stretches out stripped and bare.'

In a 2016 interview with Business Insider India cited her grandmother - the last Vicereine of India Edwina Mountbatten- as her professional inspiration.

Despite being extremely wealthy India has been labelled 'unusual' as one of the few British heiresses to earn their own income.

In 2015 she launched India Hicks Style an e-commerce business which sells jewellery accessories make-up and homeware with products ranging between £15 to £400 - but announced over the summer that it would be closing down.

India daughter of the late interior designer David Hicks and Lady Pamela Hicks daughter of the 1st Earl Mountbatten frequently shares pictures of her porch and pool as well as the exotic harvested fruits from her grounds.

Her sitting room contains a copy of Walter de la Mare's Desert Islands illustrated by the artist Rex Whistler who painted panels for the boudoir of her grandmother Edwina Mountbatten in London along with a shark's jaw from her travels in Kenya.

The former Ralph Lauren model who is the second cousin to the Prince Of Wales also shares her house with two dogs two cats and a tortoise along with three-legged dachshund Banger who was run over by a drunk tourist and had to have one of his back paws amputated.

Flower arranging is one of those things that looks deceptively simple—but in reality it takes a lot of practice. Sure if you’re picking up some simple blooms from Whole Foods and enjoying them on your kitchen table it would be hard to make them look bad but when a photo shoot is involved it’s a whole other game. This may sound dramatic but if your flowers are in the wrong vase it can throw off an entire image.

Which is why I only trust Iittala’s Aalto vase designed by Alvar Aalto in 1937. It has been a true lifesaver on set—so much that it has a permanent position in my stylist’s kit. Almost any type of flower can manage to look good in one so regardless of the morning’s flower market finds it always comes in handy.

Domino’s chief content officer Kate Berry—who was once a full-time florist and turned me on to this vase in the first place—agrees. It’s been her go-to for more than 25 years and her enviable collection is proof. “The undulating curves makes it great for beginners as they create small structures from which you can build up” she explains. Because of the Aalto’s wide mouth Berry suggests positioning the stems diagonally rather than straight up and letting the wavy pockets help guide you allowing each bloom to rest perfectly in its spot.

I scored mine on eBay but they’re also available at the MoMA Design Store (priced from $130). While there are loads of cute budget-friendly vases out there I would truly rather have one Aalto than 10 ho-hum ones. But if you’re not one to splurge on a vessel for yourself it’s the perfect gift. Florals aside it even looks excellent empty making it more than just a vase but also a bookshelf object. I keep matchboxes in mine—that is when I’m not bringing it to a shoot."

“The ESGR Pro Patria Award was created to publicly recognize U.S. employers providing extraordinary patriotic support and cooperation to their employees who have answered their nation’s call to serve” said Gary Aten ESGR state committee chair. “Supportive employers are critical to maintaining the strength and readiness of the nation’s Guard and Reserve units.”

Dow joins thousands of American employers who have reviewed and amended their current human resources policies to ensure compliance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Many employers provide support far beyond what USERRA requires including pay differential to offset the loss of wages and extension of health care benefits to complement coverage provided by the military when their employees are mobilized.

In addition to adopting policies and benefits to support veterans reservists and members of the National Guard Dow also established a Veterans Employee Resource Group in 2015. Data has shown that when veterans join the private-sector workforce the broad range of experiences they bring with them is directly in line with the qualities and skillsets Dow is looking for in an employee. Dow’s Veterans Employee Resource Group is focused on providing veterans the resources they need to thrive in their roles at Dow. These resources include a Military Degree Equivalency program a mentor matching program for new military hires and the establishment of two sub-resource groups designed to provide support for active reservists and members of the National Guard and spousal support.

“We are truly humbled and honored to be recognized with the prestigious Pro Patria Award by ESGR” said Scott Whelchel Dow’s Chief Security Officer Global ES&S Director and Managing Sponsor of Dow’s Veterans Employee Resource Group. “Dow believes there is a strong business case for hiring veterans and recognizes the invaluable contributions they bring to the workplace. We demonstrated this belief in November 2020 by launching our Military Degree Equivalency program which is leveling the playing field for veterans with relevant military experience of E6 rank or greater (OR6 for Canada) as equivalent to a Bachelor’s degree for U.S. and Canada job postings.”

ESGR is a Department of Defense program that develops and promotes supportive work environments for service members in the National Guard and Reserve through outreach recognition and educational opportunities that increase awareness of applicable laws. ESGR also provides assistance in resolving conflicts between Service members and their employers.

New York CNN Business —

Nearly a year ago a bunch of day traders from the fringes of the internet figured out how to beat Wall Street at its own game. Or so they thought.

Around mid-January shares of GameStop (GME) — a brick-and-mortar retailer that most analysts expected to go the way of Blockbuster — began surging fueled by a pile-on of day traders from the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit. They were doubling tripling their positions by the day chanting “diamond hands” and “to the moon” rally cries to hold onto their shares rather than cash out. The term “meme stock” sauntered into the mainstream.

Better still these amateur traders who winkingly referred to themselves as “Apes” were sticking it to the fat cats on Wall Street who’d heavily shorted GameStop. The more people tried to dismiss the Reddit crowd — Citron Research called them “the suckers at this poker game” — the more they drove up the stock squeezing the short sellers.

In the end the GameStop rally sent the stock up 1600% before coming back down to Earth. Citron meanwhile shut down its short-selling business after the episode. Melvin Capital one of Wall Street’s elite hedge funds was so financially gutted it had to be bailed out by two other firms. The Apes rejoiced. Who’s the sucker now?

It looked in the moment like David had taken down Goliath. But the giant was merely caught off guard.

The GameStop saga brief though it was marked a turning point for Wall Street. Did the Apes overthrow the establishment? No far from it. But the spectacle of the uprising was every bit as important as the result. Once GameStop caught the public’s imagination Wall Street could no longer afford to dismiss social media or the investors who congregate on it.

“Most people saw it as this revolution” says Spencer Jakab a Wall Street Journal columnist and author of a forthcoming book about the GameStop rally. “And a lot of young people are still convinced that they’re fighting some kind of virtuous fight against evil hedge funds… but basically the story is the same: If you think you’ve figured something out to beat Wall Street you probably haven’t.”

The Reddit army’s moment fizzled in early February when GameStop cratered to around $45. Those who joined late buying the stock at its peak of around $480 were left with huge losses. These days GME trades around $145 — up nearly 700% for the year but far from January’s highs.

Jaime Rogozinski the founder of WallStreetBets acknowledges that what happened with GameStop wasn’t a revolution per se but that doesn’t mean the community or the ethos that guided it — sniffing out market inefficiencies and exploiting them for profit — is dead.

“They’re little accounts but they’ve now figured out how to push a stock price even with their insignificant size” Rogozinski told CNN Business. “They’re not going to stop looking for these things.”

The original WallStreetBets page has more than doubled in size since the GME rally going from about 5 million at the end of January to over 11 million now – an explosion of popularity that’s put off some early adherents who broke off to form new more specialized investing groups on Reddit and elsewhere.

So who won David or Goliath? Maybe both.

The force of the January squeeze was powerful enough to make even the stodgiest of Wall Street elite sit up and take notice. US regulators are paying close attention too.

“You’ll be hard-pressed to find a company that has over 100% short float now right?” Rogozinski says. In other words no Wall Street firm with any sense wants to end up like Melvin a titan that was squeezed so hard by the GameStop surge it lost 53% of its fund in under a month. If you massively short a stock and run up your exposure you’re putting a target on your back.

WallStreetBets with all its crude jargon and machismo became a check on institutional investors who had perhaps gotten too cozy. Not wanting to be wrong twice firms have hired social media managers and subscribed to services that monitor social chatter. JPMorgan for one is currently testing a new tool aimed at protecting clients from losses tied to meme stocks Bloomberg reported earlier this month.

“If you don’t have a clear view of what retail is up to it feels like you’re driving partially blind” Chris Berthe JPMorgan’s global co-head of cash equities trading told Bloomberg.

For better or worse Jakab says all of this has made Wall Street even better at making money.

“I think what’s changed is that Wall Street is totally aware of what’s going on” says Jakab. “And they are not going to get caught out in the same way again. They monitor social media they’re going to be more judicious about getting exposed.”

For all the so-called Apes accomplished Jakab argues in the end it was the little guy that got hosed in the GameStop saga. His book “The Revolution That Wasn’t: GameStop Reddit and the Fleecing of Small Investors” Jakab makes the case that despite all the talk of sticking it to the Man the rally only tipped the odds further in Wall Street’s favor.

“Wall Street likes this” he told CNN Business. “Wall Street likes millions of young people who hate Wall Street putting their money on Wall Street — they don’t care if they’re hated.”

Perhaps the more significant legacy of WallStreetBets and the GME saga is cultural. Spend half a minute on the site and you quickly understand this isn’t a convention of Boomers in suits but rather a bunch of young Millennials and Gen Zers (still mostly male) talking about complicated options trades via memes and emoji.

“The best analogy that I can come up with is you’ve had these seasoned professional poker players playing this game for decades and now they’ve all had to scoot over to make room for this new player that doesn’t use the same rules” Rogozinski says. “You have somewhat of a reckless individual that has a different concept of risk and a different objective. And so these players now have to adjust their strategy.”

Natick firefighters made a ""heroic"" rescue of one victim Deputy Fire Chief Daniel Dow said. Two people were taken by ambulances to nearby hospitals.

The fire resulted in extensive damage to the first floor with moderate smoke and heat damage throughout the rest of the building said Dow.

Twelve units within the building are no longer habitable he added although two of them were vacant.

Just before 4 a.m. firefighters received a call for fire and smoke alarms. When they arrived there was heavy fire pouring out from the first-floor apartment. When firefighters began to extinguish the fire they were notified that there were possibly two people in need of rescue.

“One was outside on the ground and the other was inside the apartment and Natick Fire was able to rescue the victim through the first-floor window” said Dow. Flames ripped through the room when firefighters broke through the window went in picked the victim up and pulled her out he said.

The person outside suffered from smoke inhalation after first running into the apartment to rescue the other person but returned outside when they were unable to breathe said Dow.

The person rescued from inside the apartment a woman was taken by ambulance to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston while the other person was taken to MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham according to Dow.

Both suffered from smoke inhalation he said but he did not know the extent of their injuries.

Everyone else occuplying the apartment building was able to get out he said. Firefighters didn't find anyone else during a search of the building.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the Massachusetts Fire District 14 Regional Fire Investigation Team and the state Fire Marshal’s Office.

“It was really outstanding work by the Natick Fire Department” said Dow. “The victim in the first apartment was alive when they were transported due to their heroic rescue effort.”

Dow an American company based in Michigan has a target to work with partners to collect and recycle 1 million tonnes of plastic globally by 2030. In April it teamed up with Chinese milk brand Shiny Meadow to collect and repurpose more than 6000 used plastic milk bottles.

From repurposing used milk bottles to recycling water barrels and making biodegradable bags multinational chemical firms are trying to make plastic packaging more sustainable in China amid growing pressure from regulators and customers.

Since 2017 Dow has entered into similar partnerships in countries such as Indonesia Thailand Vietnam and the US. It said the process can prolong the lifespan of roads as well as cut energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

“The intent is to give a second life to the [waste] plastic and prevent it from getting into the environment” said Bambang Candra the Asia-Pacific commercial vice-president of Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics. “With our materials science technology we are able to turn hard-to-recycle plastic into useful materials.”

Although each of the polymer-modified asphalt road projects can only repurpose 10 to 20 tonnes of waste plastic it can help inspire other companies to take on similar projects he said.

New York-based Closed Loop Ocean a United Nations-backed initiative to raise US$150 million to combat plastic marine pollution in Asia estimated in 2018 that half of the roughly 8 million tonnes of plastic that leak into oceans each year come from Indonesia the Philippines Vietnam Thailand and China.

China the biggest producer of plastic waste on the planet kicked off a five-year plan in January to phase out single-use and non-biodegradable plastic bags and other plastic packaging.

In October Dow started providing material to flexible packaging producer Kaida Group for making fully recyclable packaging to contain laundry pods for Chinese laundry brand Liby. Dow is aiming for all of its packaging products to be reusable or recyclable by 2035.

The packaging is recyclable because it contains only polyethylene and can retain the toughness and aesthetic appeal of less environmentally friendly packaging made with multiple materials Candra said.

Building a “circular” economy by recycling plastic waste is a key strategy for many countries aiming to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels – the mainstay of chemical production – and curtail environmental degradation and carbon emissions.

Under pressure from regulators and investors to reduce their carbon footprint chemical producers are increasingly making recyclable products and adding renewable materials into their processes.

In October Dow struck an agreement to source pyrolysis oil – made from broken down mixed plastic waste – from Holland-based Fuenix Ecogy Group for producing plastic products such as food packaging.

Dow has committed to incorporating at least 100000 tonnes of recycled plastics in its products sold in the European Union by 2025.

Globally only a fifth of the roughly 250 million tonnes of plastic waste generated each year is recycled according to German chemicals firm BASF.

The company last year invested €16 million (US$18 million) in Germany’s Pyrum Innovations which has the technology to break down waste tyres into pyrolysis oil. BASF will buy most of the oil produced by Pyrum for making new chemical products.

BASF last year licensed technology to Shanghai-based Red Avenue New Materials Group to make biomass-based compostable bags and packaging films in a 60000-tonne-a-year plant in Shanghai.

The company aims to double its sales generated via circular economy solutions to €17 billion by 2030 from last year. It had €59 billion of global sales in 2020.

Covestro another German chemicals firm last year partnered with Hangzhou-based drinks firm Nongfu Spring and recycling firm Ausell to annually collect and break down 1 million old large polycarbonate water barrels and turn them into plastics for applications in electronic home appliances and car parts.

It has also developed a process and built a pilot plant in Germany to chemically recycle polyurethane foam in used mattresses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvbmdtb250bGVhZGVyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3BlZ2d5LWwtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItNDg3ODk2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peggy L.

That means many parents in the Pensacola area have to make plans for who will watch their children or where to send them while they are out of school.

One popular option for many families is a winter camp.

""The camps provide a safe affordable space for youth to be able to bond and make friends as well as develop social schools in a well supervised environment"" said Deja Dowdell marketing coordinator for Pensacola Parks and Recreation.

Check out five winter camp options in Pensacola listed below:

E.S. Cobb Resource Center at 601 E. Mallory St.

Fricker Resource Center at 900 North F St.

Woodland Heights Resource Center at 111 Berkley Drive

Children who attend the camps will participate in fun holiday-themed activities Dowdell said. They will have a chance to do holiday-themed crafts as well as sports activities.

Last year attendees at one of the camps made made a ""human-size gingerbread house"" out of recycled materials such as egg cartons and cardboard boxes as a way to learn about sustainability and environmental stewardship according to Dowell.

Christmas/Winter Break Camp

YMCA of Northwest Florida counselors at the Vickrey Resource Center plan on keeping wintertime campers busy during their break away from school.

Although the winter break camp at the Betty J. Pullum Family YMCA in Navarre will not be open this year the winter camp at Pensacola's Vickrey Resource Center will be running at full force.

Campers will be able to enjoy a variety of indoor and outdoor Christmas-themed games. They will even get to experience a little virtual reality using the YMCA's BEAM Pro system.

""What it is is a laser-protected virtual reality game that projects on the floor and the kids get in and play it"" said Angela Stephens youth and family service director for the YMCA of Northwest Florida.

Campers will also have access to the site's computer lab if they get out of breath from all the physical activities

Pensacola Mess Hall's Winter Break Camp

The winter camp at the Pensacola Mess Hall is all about science.

""We call it a science sampler"" said Megan Pratt the Mess Hall's executive director. ""Each day there will be a different type of science to explore.""

One day activities might focus on the science of building and construction and the next morning they may be all about chemistry biology or zoology.

The daily schedules and activities may change based on campers' interest but holiday-themed science activities are likely in the cards.

The camp offers both half-day sessions from 9 a.m. to noon and full-day sessions from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The proposal if approved by the Florida Public Service Commission would lead to Duke customers starting to pay more on their monthly bills in March and continuing through February 2023.

For example a residential customer who uses 1000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month is currently slated to pay $141.49 a month in 2022. If the proposal is approved that amount would increase to $148.11 according to the utility’s filing at the commission.

Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of 4 percent to 10 percent Duke said in a news release.

Duke’s filing is similar to requests that Florida Power & Light and Tampa Electric Co. made recently because of volatile natural-gas prices. Utilities are supposed to pass through fuel costs to customers without profiting.

“The main drivers of the increased natural gas prices are reduced storage strong liquified natural gas export sales and producers focusing on low-cost maintenance drilling and exercising capital discipline” Duke said in the filing. “Recent storage levels are 9.2% less than this time last year and 2.5% below the five-year average.”

The commission on Dec. 7 approved allowing FPL to collect an additional $810 million from customers in 2022 because of natural gas costs. Tampa Electric filed a proposal last month to collect about $273 million more starting in February. The commission has not made a decision on that proposal.

Utilities each year file projected fuel costs that regulators then use to determine how much will be charged to customers in the subsequent year. If fuel costs are substantially higher than expected utilities can seek to collect more from customers a process known as seeking a “mid-course correction.”

Duke in August received a mid-course correction because of higher-than-expected fuel costs in 2021. It subsequently received approval to recoup those costs which totaled $246.8 million over two years to try to ease the monthly impact on customers’ bills — a strategy the utility described as a “mitigation” plan.

The new proposal comes on top of that. The filing said Duke needs to recoup another $168.6 million for 2021 and $145.6 million for higher-than-expected fuel costs in 2022. Duke is asking the commission to consider the proposal during a Feb. 1 meeting.

Florida utilities have become heavily dependent on natural gas in recent years as they have phased out dirtier-burning coal plants.

In a statement Friday Duke Energy Florida State President Melissa Seixas said the utility which has about 1.9 million customers is taking steps to try to help customers struggling to pay their bills.

“We are working hard to minimize the impact and provide customers the opportunity to better manage their energy usage and reduce their bills” Seixas said. “In addition we are managing our fuel and generation resources in the most cost-effective manner for our customers and our rate mitigation plan will continue to reduce some of the price pressure on customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3BvcnRjaXR5ZGFpbHkuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9sZWxhbmQtc3RvY2tzLXVwLW9uLWdyZWVuLXNwYWNlLXdpdGgtcGxhbm5lZC1kaXNjLWdvbGYtY291cnNlLTEzNS1hY3JlLWxhbmQtZG9uYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leland stocks up on green space with planned disc golf course 135-acre land donation,"The Town of Leland is planning a new disc golf course to replace the one at Founders Park. (Port City Daily/Alexandria Sands Williams)

LELAND — In the ever-growing Town of Leland the local government is attempting to preserve acres of green space as development spurs around them.

On Thursday town council took action on two items related to that goal: accepting a 135-acre donation from a developer and approving the budget for a future disc golf course.

“It is really important that we pay attention to these opportunities to acquire green space for preservation when we can” assistant town manager Niel Brooks said on a call earlier this week. “This is a couple of good opportunities to get new green space and new park land for the citizens of Leland.”

The town recently finalized the closings of two land acquisitions totaling approximately 14 acres for $45000 each. It is allocating another $160000 toward the cost of preparing the land and installing a new disc golf course called Trade Street Park.

The funds will cover a gravel access road and parking lot as well as some minor clearing for the course. The town will need to extend Trade Street Drive and is approaching Duke Energy and H2GO about possible encroachments into their nearby properties.

Disc golf is highlighted as a desired amenity in Leland’s 2018-adopted Parks Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. Currently the town maintains a nine-hole course at Founders Park but that needs to be relocated as the town embarks on significant renovations to the 8-acre park in the coming year. The estimated $6.8-million improvements project includes a new amphitheater and splash pad.

“It’s pretty much just a major overhaul of the park” Brooks said.

The N.C. Parks and Recreation Trust Fund also known as PARTF granted the town ​​$489000 for the Founders Park renovations. Designs are in the works and bids for work will likely go out in the spring.

The disc golf course at Founders Park installed at the request of the local enthusiasts of the sport in 2018 was always intended to be temporary. The proposed course off Trade Street if all goes according to plan will be permanent and double in size with 18 holes.

A free 135 acres

Also Tuesday council passed a resolution officially accepting a land donation from the developer of SeaBrooke.

Situated in the back of the community the land spans 135.38 acres borders the Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point rail yard and is likely majority wetlands Brooks said.

“Getting this land kind of kills two birds with one stone” Brooks said. “One it gives us a little bit of a buffer from the rail yard and then it also is a good area for just open space.”

The assistant town manager said the town has a relationship with the developer who was aware of the town’s interest in acquiring green space. They offered to transfer the unbuildable land at no charge.

Leland’s 2045 Comprehensive Plan the town’s strategy for the future adopted in November includes intentions to retain wetlands and open spaces while balancing the projected population growth.

Just as black and white film made way for Technicolor and resolution reached high definition so too will the current annual accounting of energy consumption make way for the better optics on hourly accounting or what is known as 24/7 hourly matching. Consumers need to know if their electricity is renewable or not and unfortunately green electrons are not physically Technicolor green.

Not keeping it 100%

In 2017 Google became the first major company to match its annual electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy. Now the claim of “100% renewables” is not what a layman might expect as it doesn’t mean that 100% of Google’s consumption came from renewables but rather that Google purchased enough renewable energy to match its annual consumption in the form of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) via power purchase agreements (PPAs). Of course Google’s facilities were still connected to mixed-energy grids and utilized power produced by fossil fuels.

This is one of the problems with current EACs: A company can claim energy generated during the day at a solar farm in the middle of the night a year later effectively meaning green energy operates as brown storage. This can be seen as a form of “greenwashing” and means corporate PPAs do less to decarbonize the grid than assumed. Unfortunately many companies don’t even realize they’re “greenwashing.” As Dan Goldman co-founder and managing director of U.S. green investment fund Clean Energy Ventures said at TBB Berlin 2021 “there are companies out there that have no idea how to know their emissions.”

To Google’s credit the tech-giant realized that “100% renewable” should be synonymous with “0% non-renewable” and the latter remains an impossibility when grid-connected. When Google looked more closely at its consumption it realized that it had to go much further to reach 24/7. After all since renewables like solar and wind are variable (and Google’s data centers are not) hour to hour the company was still relying heavily on coal and gas from the grid. It is now spearheading the concept of 24/7 and has set itself the goal of operating on carbon-free energy (CFE) 24/7 by 2030.

That gap between renewables procurement and actual renewables impact on the grid “is taken by 24/7” said Olivier Corradi the creator of electricityMap and the CEO of Tomorrow. He argues that 24/7 means that you “can’t report zero if space and time are not matched. And that is a big step because right now we’re saying that zero is misrepresentative because we don’t have enough granularity.”

Why go 24/7?

Obviously 24/7 refers to a temporal shift from annual to hourly energy accounting but 24/7 calls for spatial accounting too. This two-pronged focus is key to 24/7’s ability to drive grid decarbonization. Not only should renewable electricity be consumed in the same hour it was procured (unless it comes from storage) but it should also be procured via the same network.

“As the percentage (of renewables) increases it will continue to become more and more important that we’re aware of where and when renewable power is placed onto the grid in order to maximize impact” Chris Pennington the director of energy and sustainability for U.S. data management company Iron Mountain told pv magazine.

And 24/7 is gaining traction. As Hannah Hunt impact director for Re-Source Platform put it “both clean energy buyers and sellers are showing increased interest in exploring 24/7. RE-Source and Eurelectric have a joint 24/7 Task Force that includes more than 60 large energy buyers (including Google IKEA Microsoft Telefonica) sellers grid operators and technology providers. Even for companies that are not actively pursuing 24/7 we’re seeing interest to discuss the potential benefits and solutions.”

Similarly Google’s data center energy strategic negotiator Amanda Peterson Corio told pv magazine that the challenge of climate change means “we are already seeing growing momentum behind 24/7.” As examples Corio pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden’s “commitment 24/7 CFE for federal buildings in its infrastructure plan” and the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All ‘24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact’.

Of course the temporal-spatial aspect of 24/7 should drive the uptake of energy storage and improved grid infrastructure (particularly interconnectors) as well. It is a method of accounting that incentivizes the right behaviors. And 24/7 “will ultimately reinforce the value and impact of solar+storage solutions” said Pennington.

Timestamping output

Timestamping of electricity production is mounting as an important enabler of 24/7 renewables. That is at least according to the EnergyTag Initiative pushing to put hourly temporal information on EACs so that 24/7 is possible through Granular Certificates (GCs).

According to EnergyTag’s founder Toby Ferenczi timestamping is a way to verify hourly procurement of CFE reliably. “With GCs CFE is priced according to its real-world availability cheaply when it is in over supply and more expensive when it isn’t” he said.

The emergence of inspectable ledger technologies like blockchain among others means that granular traceability is within reach. EnergyTag is looking to provide a framework to which software companies can adhere with guidelines being designed to “protect against double counting double issuance and other issues important for making granular certificates a robust instrument” said Ferenczi.

However Corradi pointed out that there are other systems to make traceability trustworthy. One example is “flow-tracing” which tells you where electricity comes from by country of origin and could be applied to EACs to calculate how many GCs can be bought and sold between countries. Another option is to “publish everything as open data.” The necessary factor is that everybody calculates their data using the same methodology.

“Trust for me comes down to being able to be transparent about what you’re doing” said Corradi. “Which emissions factors are you actually using? How are you treating the imports and the exports on the grids? Are you able to have certificates go from one grid to the other? What are the rules that enable these things? How is storage considered?” These are the questions currently being discussed in the EnergyTag Initiative and Corradi said the decisions need to be transparent and “not hidden in some complex 200-page white paper.”

Google’s Corio believes the “24/7 carbon-free approach reflects an unparalleled level of transparency. It enables us to show hour-by-hour where we need to develop new clean energy projects advocate for policy changes and in some cases look to new technologies that can help fill in the gaps.” Looking to set a strong example in June Google released the 2020 CFE percentages of all its data centers and its overall progress toward the 2030 target.

Ultimately Corradi explained there are two ways of looking at traceability. The first is to say that it is impossible to know where an electron comes from and therefore if you buy X amount of renewables then you can claim to have used it (known as the purchasing power paradigm). The second to borrow a “smoothie” analogy offered by Corradi is that you can’t selectively choose different energy from your neighbor on the same grid in the same way you can’t selectively choose a particular fruit once it has been made into a smoothie. However said Corradi “you can pursue procurement that impactfully removes the fruits from the smoothie that you don’t want i.e. fossil fuels.” The more granular accounting becomes the more pre-emptively selective we can be and the more renewable the smoothie becomes.

The initiative’s discussions are not caught on anything “too divisive” said Ferenczi but are rather busily occupied with hammering out the extensive amount of detail required to cover the bases of such a complex system. Details such as: “how to ensure that the EnergyTag guidelines work with existing traditional certificate schemes? How to manage units less than 1 MWh? How to include storage? How to manage data quality issues?”

Popular content

“We need to make it very simple and easy for all types of energy consumers even those without large energy procurement teams or the ability to sign long-term purchasing agreements” said Ferenczi. “This is value that GCs can bring.” The value that any buyer whether they’re a small- or medium-sized business or Google can be sure where their energy is coming from.

Watch this space

Unfortunately not every member of the EnergyTag Initiative is as keen on spatial accounting as they are on the temporal. But time alone is not enough. Corio said the spatial element is “massively” important to Google’s 24/7 progress. “It is only by analyzing our hourly footprint at this regional level that we can begin to pinpoint the exact challenges of each grid where we operate to becoming truly carbon-free.”

Fundamentally what the 24/7 approach demands continues Corio is that we “think about the grid on which we operate. We cannot take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach if we want to move the needle towards reaching ‘absolute zero’ emissions.” And this needle needs a push because there are regions in the world “where we have so far been unable to purchase renewable energy because of market barriers and regulatory constraints” and “regions that do not have efficient wind and solar resources deployable at scale.”

Full-time skeptics

Not everyone is pro 24/7. One suggestion is that 24/7 will drive up the cost of renewables and EACs. In theory as Corradi points out if you “restrict the liquidity of the certificate then the price can increase.” But the point is whether 24/7 incentivizes the right behaviors. If renewables and EACs become scarce due to restrictions of time and space the price may rise but it should also incentivize energy storage interconnectors and other solutions to renewable intermittency.

In addition 24/7 should incentivize good policy. A company like Google isn’t likely to invest in a country if the grid isn’t up to scratch or the local renewables are not amenable to 24/7 procurement. As Corradi put it in the end a grid is just a big shared asset that takes time to decarbonize and “physically representative targets” send a “strong signal to policymakers [by saying] ‘I will make my decision on where to place my assets based on how clean of a grid you can provide in the future.’ And I think that is what is really interesting about 24/7.”

Another criticism touted by some corporates particularly those with high levels of emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors is that 24/7 is too much to ask. They complain annual targets are already difficult and that “big tech” is simply “moving the goalposts.”

Of course the goalposts haven’t moved; we just didn’t realize how far away they were. Annual 100% renewable matching is not the goal but decarbonization is in the same way that reaching the cloud line of a mountain isn’t the same as reaching the summit. As Google’s Corio put it “100% renewable energy matching is an important step on the path to full decarbonization but in order to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change we must target the ultimate goal of moving to fully carbon-free grids.”

Time to act

There are many ways actors can move to 24/7 CFE. Companies can improve their hourly carbon footprints by load-shifting the most carbon-intensive activities at times when renewables are most available.

On the policy front Corio calls for “wholesale market expansion and reform. We need more transmission to unlock congestion and deliver CFE to the regions where people live.” Another is to reduce restrictions on EACs such as the 1 MWh constraint. And one key policy would be the requirement for temporal matching of green hydrogen production. “It would be a disaster if we are allowed to claim hydrogen to be green based on electricity produced on a different grid at the right time” said Corradi.

There should also be policy discussion about panic buying of EACs during potential early 24/7 scarcity periods where bigger companies cause others to miss out.

The move to 24/7 feels inevitable. The more granular our view of the electricity system the more renewables can join and the more impactful procurement of renewable energy can be for grid decarbonization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnBhcGVycy5jb20vYXJjaGl2ZS8yMDIxLzEyL2NpdmljL3RheWxvci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtZGlubmVyLXNob3djYXNlcy1jYW5kaWRhdGVzLzMxMTE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taylor Christmas Dinner Showcases Candidates,"Asheville – Hundreds of GOP faithfuls from across the state of North Carolina gathered in Asheville for the 28th Annual Charles Taylor Christmas Dinner Saturday evening (December 11). Taylor represented North Carolina’s 11th congressional district (now the 14th district) from 1991 to 2007.

Taylor 80 first ran for congress in 1988 against incumbent James McClure Clark losing by about 1500 votes. In a 1990 rematch Taylor beat Clark by about 2700 votes to take and hold the seat until 2007 when Taylor lost to Democrat Heath Shuler.

The event raises funds for GOP candidates and allows republicans to network and get their message out to key political players in the Grand Old Party. Saturday’s event was no different. From US Senate hopefuls ready to fill the seat about to be vacated by Richard Burr who has chosen not to run for office this time around to Buncombe County sheriff and state representative candidates many offered reasons for party members to support their candidacy.

American Eagle Award

The event is also a time when the former congressman recognizes a GOP member by presenting them the American Eagle Award Winner which is awarded to an individual who Taylor believes does an outstanding job in representing the party’s values. This year’s recipient is Yancey County Sheriff Kermit Banks who is in his ninth term as sheriff. Past recipients were Cherokee Chief Michell Hicks Madison County resident Bruce Briggs Erwin Hills resident Mike Summey and Leicester resident Forest Jarrett to name a few.

Speeches

Over dinner the crowd was addressed by several speakers. First was NC State Treasurer Dale Folwell followed by NC House Speaker Tim Moore who told the crowd that the state finally has a budget after about three years without one even though the state constitution requires one. He also said that Democrats have fought against the voter ID bill even though 61 percent of residents voted for the bill when it was on the ballot a few years ago.

Next to speak were candidates for the US Senate. Congressman Ted Budd who President Donald Trump has endorsed was the first to speak. Budd is a small business owner who runs a gun store and training center in Davie County. He was followed by former Governor Pat McCrory who lost his job as governor to the current Gov. Roy Cooper. McCrory began his career with Duke Energy then was voted in as Mayor of Charlotte before running and winning the governor’s seat. Both touted their accomplishments and endorsements before pitching to the group reasons for their support. Last to speak was Congressman Mark Walker who admitted he came to North Carolina from Alabama for a girl but by the time he got here she had moved on. Rather than turning around and heading back he stayed and while in Bible College met his wife. He became a pastor for 16 years before running for congress.

Taylor who suffered a stroke after a horse-riding accident kept his remarks short basically saying the GOP had a good group of candidates running and urged all present to get out and vote for them. He then thanked everyone for coming and wished all a Merry Christmas.

The lawsuit filed last week in Homer District Court alleges Sterling resident Max Finch used a wiretap for years to avoid paying for energy for his business Alaska Canoe and Campground. Finch said he didn’t know about the wiretap or the stolen electricity and that it was the doings of a previous property manager.

It’s the second time HEA says it’s discovered the Sterling Highway campground and RV park stealing power.

“We’re generally not comfortable with anyone diverting energy because what they’re really doing — they’re not just taking from HEA they’re taking from all of our members” said Keriann Baker HEA’s director of member relations. “Because those costs are being passed onto all of us as a collective as a cooperative.”

Baker said linemen discovered the tap this fall when they went to investigate why a meter display had failed — something that in itself is routine.

But while they were at the property they found evidence of tampering and later discovered what looked like a man-made hole in the ground by an electric transformer pole. Underground they found two wires that were clamped onto a service line according to the complaint.

When the linemen asked him about the wires Finch told them an electrician he hired had put them there.

Linemen tried to investigate further a week later. But they couldn’t the suit said because Finch’s truck was right over the spot where they found the tampering. Finch for his part said it wasn’t his truck and he was out of the country at the time.

When the linemen returned the truck had been moved. When they investigated they found a service line had been tapped to divert electric current from the meter to another location on the property. They immediately removed the tampered wires and de-energized the meter according to the lawsuit.

Homer Electric said Finch started diverting electricity in November 2014 bringing the total power taken from the co-op without payment to at least $325543. The co-op estimates an additional $9992 in damages to property.

Finch said the rewiring was put in by a previous manager of the property who lived in Sterling and died in 2014. Finch said he managed the property and paid the bills while Finch was working away from home. He said the other manager probably tampered with the wires to save money.

“Any of the costs that were incurred from the business he had to pay for” Finch said. “And of course the electrical was the biggest bill.”

But said he didn’t know about the diversion. And he said he genuinely did not know he was not paying what he was supposed to be paying to HEA since there were so many bills for the property and variability in visitors staying there.

He said he wasn’t capable of doing that digging. And he said proof of that is he needed HEA’s help to fix an electrical issue.

“It was something that was bigger than me. I wasn’t capable of doing that kind of project” he said. “I just left it to HEA to figure out or I would’ve tried to cover my tracks somehow. But I didn’t do that.”

The suit said the truck parked over the site and the prior instance of tampering show that Finch is guilty.

In 2013 Homer Electric caught Alaska Canoe and Campground tampering with two meters which led to three exploded transformers and resulted in damages of almost $38751. Finch owed an additional $6025 in lost energy payments.

He repaid both those costs and was reconnected later that year. He said the other manager was responsible for that tampering too but that he paid up because he was the property’s owner.

Baker said it’s disappointing that Finch would tamper with the wires a second time after the co-op let him off on good standing in 2013. While the first instance was above ground the second was harder to detect below ground.

“Our position is you don’t just get wired tampered with six feet underground out of sight of anyone by accident” Baker said.

She said linemen are also concerned because someone could have gotten hurt from the tampered lines.

Former Army Major Gen Paul Eaton former Brigadier Gen Steven Anderson and former Army Major Gen Antonio Taguba made the worrisome claim in a column for The Washington Post.

'As we approach the first anniversary of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol we - all of us former senior military officials - are increasingly concerned about the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election and the potential for lethal chaos inside our military which would put all Americans at severe risk' the generals penned.

'We are chilled to our bones at the thought of a coup succeeding next time' they added.

Retired Army Major Gen Paul Eaton was among three former top military brass to warn that the country may be plunged into civil war if there is another coup attempt after 2024 election

Former Army Major Gen Paul Eaton (left) former Brigadier Gen Steven Anderson (center) and former Army Major Gen Antonio Taguba (right) penned a column in The Washington Post Friday warning of another coup attempt after the 2024 election similar to the January 6 Capitol riot that will divide the military and cause a possible civil war

The generals referenced January 6 2020 when thousands of fiery patriots and Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building which resulted in the death of five people

In such a polarized political atmosphere 'with loyalties split' the generals observed that 'some might follow orders from the rightful commander in chief while others might follow the Trumpian loser'.

'In this context with our military hobbled and divided US security would be crippled. Any one of our enemies could take advantage by launching an all-out assault on our assets or our allies' the column read.

They emphasized: 'The military and lawmakers have been gifted hindsight to prevent another insurrection from happening in 2024 - but they will succeed only if they take decisive action now'.

Eaton 71 was in charge of training Iraqi troop during Operation Iraqi Freedom between 2003 and 2004 during. After he retired Eaton became a vocal critic of former President George W. Bush who spearheaded the war in Iraq. and is currently a senior adviser to VoteVets.

Taguba 71 spent 34 years in the military and made headlines for an internal United States Army report on the abuse of detainees held at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq when it was leaked in 2004.

Anderson 65 had a 31-year career in the armed forces including 15 months working under General David Petraeus as a in Iraq.

Most recently Robert Palmer (pictured) 54 was sentenced to 63 months for his involvement in the January 6 riot where he assaulted police officers with a fire extinguisher and hurled wooden boards at them

The three retired generals noted that the events that unfolded on January 6 2020 - when thousands of fiery patriots and Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building and resulted in the death of five people - showed that 'the signs of potential turmoil in our armed forces are there'.

Since at least 185 people in attendance have since been charged with assaulting or impeding police in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential election victory.

The three generals were sure to note that 'more than 1 in 10 of those charged in the attacks had a service record'.

Most recently Robert Palmer 54 from Largo Florida was sentenced to 63 months in jail - the harshest sentence yet - for his involvement in the riot where he assaulted police officers with a fire extinguisher and hurled wooden boards at them.

The insurrection was a reaction to what ex-President Trump claimed was a fraudulent election and the former generals seemed angered that the Republican leader has yet to be 'held to account'.

But he's not the only one who maintains that the election was an honest one.

In May a group of 124 retired admirals and generals - the 'Flag Officers 4 America - published an open letter than questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.

The letter read: 'Without fair and honest elections that accurately reflect the “will of the people” our Constitutional Republic is lost. Election integrity demands insuring there is one legal vote cast and counted per citizen.

'Legal votes are identified by State Legislature’s approved controls using government IDs verified signatures etc. Today many are calling such commonsense controls “racist” in an attempt to avoid having fair and honest elections. Using racial terms to suppress proof of eligibility is itself a tyrannical intimidation tactic.'

Trump's Defense Secretary Chris Miller later testified that as his boss clung to power in the White House he was deliberately withholding military protection of the Capitol building before January 6.

'It is evident that the whole of our military was caught off-guard' Eaton Anderson and Taguba wrote.

But Miller said five months after the attack that he had three goals during the final days of the Trump administration: Avoiding a major war avoiding a military coup and avoiding sending troops to do battle with citizens on American streets.

A report revealed how in the weeks after Trump's election defeat while he refused to accept the outcome at the polls he tried to use loyalists to push through a withdrawal troops from Afghanistan Iraq and Syria Germany and Africa.

It was revealed that Trump's plan to withdraw troops completely from Afghanistan before leaving office was opposed by Miller and other senior officials who succeeded in persuading the president to keep to a plan that would decrease the number of troops to 2500.

It was apparently part of what Miller a US Army veteran who was only installed after Trump's election defeat saw as his duty.

Eaton Anderson and Taguba also mentioned the Oklahoma National Guard's new commander Army Brigadier General Thomas Mancino who refused to enforce the US defense department's Covid-19 vaccine mandate after a change in commanding officers.

Mancino said that he would listen to the state's governor Republican Kevin Stitt for orders who he also said is his commander in chief - not President Biden - since the Oklahoma Guard is not federally mobilized.

In the opinion column Eaton Anderson and Taguba called Mancino's refusal to enforce the vaccine mandate 'worrying'.

They also claimed the decision increases 'the potential for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines - from the top of the chain to squad level... should another insurrection occur'.

Ray Dalio (pictured) who has a net worth of $20.3 billion predicted that there is a 30 percent chance of US Civil War in the next decade

Meanwhile billionaire Ray Dalio predicts there is a 30 percent chance of US Civil War in the next ten years because of 'emotional' political polarization' but said the Constitution will probably save the nation.

Dalio is the founder of the world's largest hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates. This year he was ranked as the 88th richest person in the world with a net worth of $20.3 billion.

He made his bold claims in his new book 'Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail' which was published on November 30.

Dalio explained that he believes there is a 'dangerously high risk' that the country will have a civil war within in the next ten years and pointed to the rules of governance being 'ignored' and the 'exceptional amount of polarization' currently seen in the country.

'For example when close elections are adjudicated and the losers respect the decisions it is clear that the order is respected' he wrote seemingly referencing the Capitol riot.

'When power is fought over and grabbed that clearly signals the significant risk of a revolutionary change with all its attendant disorder.'

He noted that people including high-ranking officials have openly doubted the validity of recent elections and expressed their willingness to fight for their beliefs.

Dalio cites several studies as statistical proof of his claims of polarization within the country showing the deep divide specifically between the two political parties.

A 2019 Pew survey found that 55 per cent of Republicans and 47 percent of Democrats viewed the other as more immoral than other Americans and 61 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of Democrats said that those of the other party don't share their values.

Also 79 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans said they had 'cold' or 'very cold' feelings for members of the other party; 57 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of Republicans selected 'very cold'.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbHR3aXJlLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRpYy1jYW5hZGEvbGlmZXN0eWxlcy9sZW8tai1kZXZlYXUtdGhpcy13ZWVrLWluLW5vdmEtc2NvdGlhLWhpc3RvcnktZGVjLTIwLTI2LTEwMDY3MTAzOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LEO J. DEVEAU: This Week in Nova Scotia History: Dec. 20-26,"20 December 1952 — In an earlier time by this date the Sears or Eaton’s Christmas catalogues would have been thoroughly reviewed by many adults (over 400 pages) and the pages with great toys would have also been dog-eared by many children of a certain age.

For many who remember seeing the catalogues arrive three or four months before Christmas a nostalgic feeling may overcome them as no longer do such catalogues rest on a coffee table to be reviewed in a quiet moment as one considered ordering a gift or two or maybe even better ‘wishing’ to see a special item under the tree on Christmas morning. The only thing that remains the same today as back then is not to order too late for a Christmas delivery!

The Starr Acme Club Skate - Dartmouth Heritage Museum

21 December 1866 — As this year came to a close the Acme Spring Skate had become the most sought-after skate in the Canadian market. Designed and patented earlier by John Forbes and co-worker Thomas Bateman the skate was manufactured by the Dartmouth-based Starr Manufacturing Company. The design revolutionized how skates were worn in Canada and around the world.

As Shannon Baxter from the Dartmouth Heritage Museum points out “In the early days skates were merely sharpened blades of metal that were attached to the bottom of a boot typically with leather straps. These weren’t very secure so by the early nineteenth century skates were often attached to the bottom of boots with screws. The Acme Spring Skate was revolutionary; since it clamped to a boot with a spring-lock mechanism. This created a secure fit but didn’t require a skater to ruin a good pair of boots.” Starr’s would go on to employ 250 people manufacturing 100 pairs of skates a day.

However by the Depression years in the 1930s the Starr’s Manufacturing Company would struggle. With increased competition combined with various design changes as well as letting the patent slip on their skate design the skate factory was closed in 1939. Though the company would continue to make other products by 1996 their doors were closed for good. The factory site was demolished in 2000 and all that remains is a small greenspace now called Starr Park.

22 December 1944 — While crossing the Halifax Harbour the crew of the Halifax/Dartmouth ferry the Governor Cornwallis discovered a fire unfolding in the ceiling of the engine room. They manage to control it till the ferry docked and was unloaded. However the blaze could not be extinguished. The Halifax Fire Department sent a fireboat and tug to assist while thousands of spectators watched the event unfold from both sides of the harbour.

The ferry was tugged to open water near George’s Island where it was left to burn. It later sunk in the deep harbour waters near the island. It was determined that the fire was caused by poor installation of the heating furnace’s smoke pipe. The ferry had also been the first diesel-powered ferry used in Halifax Harbour.

23 December 1862 — Public excitement was mounting in Halifax as the new barn-like covered skating rink near the Public Gardens was preparing to open for the first time. With its entrance located off South Park Street the structure was reported to be one of the largest heated and lighted (by gas) covered rinks in Canada at 60 feet wide and 180 feet in length.

When the Halifax Skating Club had been formed earlier in the winter of 1862 they took to the ice on Griffins Pond in the Public Gardens. Their club members also had to be members of the Horticultural Society which supported the Public Gardens. As January approached skating club members were looking forward to moving into the new rink for their regular costumed skating masquerades. Their activities became so popular that they reached maximum membership capacity.

By 1889 after a fire and competition from another rink with the opening of the Empire Exhibit Hall (now the present site of the Cathedral Church of All Saints) the Halifax Skating Rink structure was demolished.

Roy A. Jodrey 1888-1973. - Public domain

24 December 1888 — Roy A. Jodrey was born in White Rock Kings County Nova Scotia (d.1973). His parents were newcomers to the area whose Lutheran ancestors had been the founding settlers of Lunenburg. His father Joseph was a cabinetmaker by trade who had sought a different life building new homes in the nearby village of Gaspereau as well as operating a sawmill business powered by a low head of water from a pond formed by the nearby Gaspereau River.

As one of four children Roy would often accompany his father to the sawmill and observed how water could power mechanical activities such as a busy sawmill. Dropping out of school after age 13 he first worked with his father in the sawmill and then began work with apple harvesting in the Annapolis Valley. By age 16 he had established his own company and was shipping apples to England. Harry Bruce in his book RA: The Story of Roy Jodrey Entrepreneur named him “Roy Jodrey boy trader in the international apple market.” Through correspondence courses Roy would also further educate himself on the basics of running a business — and in his case it would be the operating of many businesses.

By the closing years of the 19th century electric power began to appear in Nova Scotia and Roy Jodrey with his business partner Charles H. Wright saw it as opportunity. By 1920 they had attracted their friends neighbours and business partners as investors to form the Gaspereau River Light Heat and Power Company to generate power at Stiver’s Falls near White Rock. And shortly after they also formed the Gaspereau Valley Electric Light Company Ltd. to begin distributing power from Stiver’s Falls to the village of Gaspereau and beyond. By 1921 with more investors they also created of the Avon River Power Company with Roy as the managing director.

Later Roy Jodrey would also continue his knowledge of saw-milling with the creation of the Minas Basin Pulp and Power Company Ltd. founded in Hantsport in 1927 for the export of unbleached groundwood pulp. For a period of time the Avon River Power Company provided the necessary power to the new pulp mill.

Later Jodrey would construct his own power dam on the St. Croix River. All the while he continued to grow his own apples and broker other growers’ apples as well as construct more water dams and get involved in the founding of a retail service station chain.

By 1929 Roy decided to sell the Avon River Power Company to the Nova Scotia Light and Power Company. But shortly after when the Great Depression hit like many entrepreneurs he was virtually bankrupted overnight. However his Hantsport pulp and power mill operations managed to stay afloat and they would become the foundation of many of his other enterprises.

By 1933 he created the Canadian Keyes Fibre Company (re-named CKF Inc. in 1982) situated across from his paper mill in Hantsport to produce moulded paper trays and plates out of wood pulp fibres from the left-over paper pulp process at the mill. CKF Inc. now operates five plants across Canada employing 270 full-time employees at their Hantsport location and 600 across the other plants in Ontario and British Columbia.

In 1947 Roy Jodrey founded the Annapolis Valley Canners Ltd. By 1965 this became Avon Foods Ltd. with fruit and vegetable production plants and warehousing facilities based in the Annapolis Valley at Port Williams Waterville and Berwick sourcing produce from local farmers working several thousand hectares. Later canning plants were acquired in Ontario and the operations were all merged under a new brand name COBI Foods Inc.

By the time of his death in 1973 Roy Jodrey’s business operations and holdings had expanded considerably in real estate food production and processing various packaging interests transport operations and much more. Other vertically integrated operations would include a new subsidiary Maritime Paper Products Inc. and later Crown Fibre Tube Inc. as well as Scotia Recycling Ltd. all relying on recycled paper and cardboard.

By 1994 as a result of increasing environmental regulations the New Minas Pulp and Power plant’s groundwood operation came to an end. It continued though in the production of first-class paperboard sourced from old corrugated cartons and recycled paper. However by 2012 due to high freight costs significant international output demands plus the collapse of financial markets in 2008 it was decided to close the mill putting 147 people out of work.

Peter C. Newman once referred to Roy Jodrey as “an obscure apple farmer” but at the time (1957) Jodrey was a Canadian businessman holding fifty-six corporate directorship roles. He would say of his many enterprises “It is foolish to talk about one man or a few men even building a business like this. It takes a lot of people to do such a job.”

Salvation Army’s Red Shield Hostel Christmas dinner Halifax 1941. - Evangeline Foord/Nova Scotia Archives

25 December 1941 — Over Christmas during the Second World War the Salvation Army’s Red Shield Hostel in Halifax provided warmth and fellowship for military service personnel who found themselves in the city while on layovers and many many miles from home.

Many local volunteers assisted in running such hostels as well as canteens - just as they had done during the First World War. Besides the Salvation Army there were canteens throughout the city that served lower ranks and NCOs such as the YMCA Knights of Columbus Red Cross I.O.D.E. and various churches such as St. Mark’s Anglican which had begun the North End Services Canteen.

Though prohibition had been repealed earlier in Nova Scotia in 1930 there remained a strong social climate of temperance and as a result canteens and hostels were considered “dry.” Only members of private clubs were actually allowed to consume alcohol outside of their own homes.

There was one club though a private club for Allied sailors called the Ajax Club located on Tobin Street. It had opened in 1940 and was managed by Mrs. (Dolly) McEuen and over 60 volunteers — two cooks were the only ones to receive salaries. The club maintained two games rooms two dining rooms smoking lounges and a brass-railed bar that served draught or bottled beer at 10 cents a glass. Sailors could also order a home-style meal for 25 cents. The monthly attendance numbers at the club were estimated to be 10000-15000 from all Allied navies.

However by 1942 the club closed due to tensions in the local community over its bar — the club was located near the Fort Massey Church. Due to complaints the provincial liquor control commission refused to renew the club’s beer license. However not to be cowered McEuen and many of her volunteers went on to establish the Ajax Hospitality Headquarters on Spring Garden Road (then located in the Mills Brother’s block) where she created a network of community homes outside Halifax that provided rest and recuperation for British merchant seaman.

Painting: Portrait of A Boy 1827 by William Valentine - Public domain

26 December 1849 — Well known artist William Valentine died (b. 1798 in England). He had arrived in Halifax in 1818 and a year later was advertising himself as a portrait and landscape painter and a teacher of drawing. He soon extended his services to Prince Edward Island New Brunswick and St. John’s Newfoundland.

During his time in Halifax Valentine had created many portraits of eminent Nova Scotians and is considered after artist Robert Field (1769-1819) one of the most important portrait painters in early 19th century Nova Scotia. He also became a founding member of the Halifax Mechanics' Institute that promoted adult education.

A fire in his studio which destroyed many of his paintings and works is said to have contributed to Valentine’s decline dying at age 51. He was buried in Camp Hill Cemetery near his friend Peter Nordbeck who had been a well known silversmith and jeweler in Halifax.

Local teacher Dan Eaton stumbled across the alleged birthplace when he found an ancient stone marker with a cross carved in it while exploring behind the playground of Loxley Primary School where he works. It was standing in the middle of the woodland just steps away from a dense area of ancient holly bushes which reminded him of early depictions of the outlaw.

Ancient records have also come to light stating the outlaw who was also known as Robin of Loxley was born at Little Haggas Croft in Loxley village now a suburb of Sheffield.

The experts have found a reference to Robin in a manuscript stating he was born in “Locksley” around 1160. There are now calls for a statue depicting Robin as a young boy to be built in the village.

But the current Sheriff of Nottingham Merlita Bryan said: “Robin Hood is as much from Sheffield as Jarvis Cocker is from Nottingham.

“We get it – Yorkshire wants a piece of the legendary action. We’ve had similar claims from Kent Wales and elsewhere before but really everyone knows that he was from Nottingham and that his arch rival wasn’t the Sheriff of Sheffield.

Teacher believes he has found legendary figure's birthplace,"It hasn't gone down well in Nottingham which claims Hood as one of their own

A teacher claims to have found the birthplace of Robin Hood – and it would make him a Yorkshireman.

Dan Eaton believes an ancient marker stone and carved cross he discovered behind the playground of Loxley Primary School in Sheffield marks the cottage where the legendary folk hero was born.

His revelation is made in his book Reclaiming Robin Hood which is sponsored by Sheffield Council as part of a campaign to ‘bring Robin home’.

Hallamshire – an old name for Sheffield – was mentioned in medieval legend as Robin’s birthplace. And ancient records have come to light stating the outlaw Robin of Loxley was born at Little Haggas Croft Loxley in around 1160.

There are now calls for a statue depicting Robin as a young boy to be built in the suburb as part of Sheffield’s increasingly popular Robin Hood tourist trail

Co-author Dr David Clarke of Sheffield Hallam University said: ‘Loxley in Hallamshire was identified as Robin’s birthplace in two historical sources that date from the early 17th century.’

There are now calls for a statue depicting Robin as a young boy to be built in the suburb as part of Sheffield’s increasingly popular Robin Hood tourist trail.

But the book hasn’t gone down well in Nottingham which has long claimed the outlaw as its own.

Current Sheriff of Nottingham Merlita Bryan said: ‘Robin Hood is as much from Sheffield as Jarvis Cocker is from Nottingham. Everyone knows his arch rival wasn’t the Sheriff of Sheffield.’

Dan Eaton believes an ancient marker stone and carved cross he discovered behind the playground of Loxley Primary School in Sheffield marks the cottage where the legendary folk hero was born.

She added: ‘We get it - Yorkshire wants a piece of the legendary action.

‘We’ve had similar claims from Kent Wales and elsewhere before but really everyone knows that he was from Nottingham.

‘But we’re always happy for others to help spread the word about the world’s favourite outlaw.’

It has also been claimed the outlaw met his death around 1247AD after leaving the safety of Sherwood Forest to be healed by nuns in Kirklees Priory in West Yorkshire.

The Prioress was the mistress of one of Robin’s enemies and is said to have slashed open one of his veins while pretending to treat him."

Deutsche Welle reports a judgement was filed in Clapton's favor earlier this week at a court in the Düsseldorf area of Germany ... where he'd sued this 55-year-old widow who says her late husband bought the album years ago at a record store -- arguing she didn't know it was fake or infringing on his copyright.

The woman was reportedly trying to sell it on eBay for less than $12 -- something Eric and his team apparently caught wind of somehow and decided to fight it tooth and nail.

Word is they'd reached out this lady ... demanding she take down her eBay sale -- but word is she told Eric and co. to kick rocks and to stop harassing her. The Guardian reports she even said if they were that bothered with the $11 sale then go ahead and sue her.

This Guardian story adds more details on the Eric Clapton German bootleg story incl. a statement from his manager. Still doesn’t mention that the CD was most likely legal when purchased or explain why Clapton didn’t just have the eBay listed pulled tho. https://t.co/VWtzo2I6dK — David Bixenspan (@davidbix) December 17 2021 @davidbix

Well sue her he did ... and after her arguments of ignorance fell flat with the court following an appeal -- issuing an injunction preventing her from hawking the thing. She's also gotta pay the legal fees of both parties which reports say amounts to about $3800. If she keeps it up on eBay she could be fine hundreds of thousands ... or even go to prison for half a year.

Clapton's team told the Guardian ""Germany is a country where sales of bootleg and counterfeit CDs are rife which damages the industry and customers with poor quality and misleading recordings.

Guitar legend Eric Clapton doesn't have much patience for people trying to profit off his music - even if it is to the tune of $13.

The New York Post reports that a woman in Düsseldorf Germany has been sued by the ""Black Magic Woman"" singer after she listed a burned copy of a 1980s recording of Clapton in concert on eBay for €9.95 ($NZ13). She claimed she made the copy from an album bought by her late husband from a department store in 1987. Clapton said in an affidavit that the recording was illegal.

According to the post she told a Düsseldorf regional court she had no idea that what she'd done was illegal and appealed the charge. But her appeal was denied and she was stung with a $5600 fine said to cover the legal fees of each party.

If she attempts to sell the album again she could face a fine of up to $416000 and six months' jail time.

While Clapton has been busy keeping tabs on people out to make a quick $13 from his work he's also become an outspoken opponent of public health management of coronavirus refusing to perform in venues where unvaccinated people are denied entry and giving financial support to others openly against pandemic efforts.

It was reported earlier in 2021 that Clapton donated $1600 to UK boycott band Jam for Freedom to assist in the payment of fines incurred for breaching Covid safety protocols at a concert.

He's also teamed up with Van Morrison on a song ""Stand and Deliver"" which features the line: ""Do you wanna be a free man … Or do you wanna be a slave?"""

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

(December 18th),"Our Pick: Barella (Inter Milan — CM — 87)

The giant 6’7 Real Madrid keeper Courtois leads the charge on this TOTW. At 90-rated with decent positioning reflexes diving and handling this card is now clearly in the elite range of keepers. Raheem Sterling the Man City winger races down the touchline with his great pace and dribbling. The real highlight here is some better shooting and passing. Tielemans also gets an upgrade but take care to consider that this Leicester CDM will have to be supported with players who can actually tackle. As a fan of the majestic Andrea Pirlo I must say that these quarter-back-style stats hold a little appeal even if it isn’t for everyone. The Featured Player this week the guy with the star above his name and a double upgrade is RCD Espanyol left-winger Puado. Solid numbers here are backed with four star skill moves and weak foot. Good stuff!You shouldn't miss LWB Raum for his good bargain bin numbers but this pick has to be Barella all day long. While his shooting might be a bit dodge his all-around numbers give him that Goretzka De Jong and Valverde vibe. It comes at a 100k plus cost but for a well balanced Serie A CM that is not really that bad. High dribbling will give him an advantage around the box and when striding forth from deep midfield but maybe don't go for superstar passes. If you are looking for cheaper options consider Sandro Tonali’s champions league card even though it won’t ever see another dynamic upgrade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcGl1bmlrYXdlYi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtbWlzc2luZy1iYWRnZS1vci1yZXdhcmRzLWlzc3VlLXVuZGVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA acknowledges Apex Legends missing rewards & badge bug,"New updates are being added at the bottom of this story…….

Original story (published on August 17 2021) follows:

Apex Legends is one of the most played battle royale games of all time. In fact the game is so popular right now that it is closing in on PUBG and COD: Warzone.

Developed by Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts Apex Legends is a fast-paced battle royale where teamwork is the key to victory.

Having said that like every other video game Apex Legends players encounter some glitches every now and then.

The most recent issue affecting several Apex Legends players is the missing badge and rewards on levelling up bug.

According to user reports the game does not reward them with badges and rewards whenever they level up. Because of this player stats are also being affected.

Right now several players are confused about what is happening while others are frustrated because they are not getting rewards.

I heard that for some people stats weren’t saving such as kills or battle pass tiers but damage?? I know for a lot of people 2k is nothing but for me it’s an accomplishment and I was gutted when I didn’t get the badge I earned. Is this gonna get fixed and am I gonna get the badge or am I going to have to somehow do it all over again?

(Source)

So I’ve been playing for a while and I just got my 3k I haven’t gotten my 2 k but I was super excited cause the closes I got was alway around 1500-1800 but I got it and it’s not showing up do I have to win or get the previous badges like do I have to get 2k the 2.5k etc is there a fix to it?

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

ST PAUL Minn. — Drug makers were back in federal court this week with the aim of dismantling Minnesota's emergency insulin law.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America an industry group known as PhRMA asked the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court's ruling that preserved the new law.

Supporters of the law which is also known as the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act gathered outside the federal courthouse in St. Paul to lambast the drug industry's legal challenge.

""We know that more than 500 Minnesotans have used the program to access emergency insulin"" Rep. Mike Howard a Richfield Democrat and chief author of the emergency insulin supply bill told reporters.

""That’s nearly 500 Minnesotans who were in grave danger of losing their life just because they couldn’t afford this life-necessary drug. And what Big Pharma is trying to do in this courtroom today is rip insulin out of the hands of desperate Minnesotans that need their drug"" he continued.

Nicole Smith-Holt is the mother of the Alec Smith who died four years ago at age 26 while trying to ration his insulin and vowed to continue the quest to save diabetics who can't afford their medication.

""It’s amazing we actually have to be here. We actually have to fight for laws that protect our lives"" Smith-Holt remarked. ""It’s a tragedy. And we will not stop fighting until we can be guaranteed that this safety net continues to stay in place.""

The 2020 law allows diabetics to seek an emergency one-time 30-day supply of insulin from a pharmacy. Patients have the option to enroll in a program to receive 90-day supplies.

Three drug companies - Eli Lilly and Company Sanofi and Novo Nordisk - are required to donate supplies that are distributed to patients through the program. The donation model was suggested by Senate Republicans who said drug companies would sue if the state imposed a fee on drug companies to finance the program.

However the drug industry sued the state anyway calling it a violation of the United States Constitution's takings clause. The PhRMA lawsuit alleges Minnesota is taking property from drug companies without paying them for it.

""The district court had the power to strike down this unconstitutional law and should have done so"" Reid Porter the senior director of public affairs for PhRMA told KARE 11.

""The Minnesota law codifies repeated constitutional violations by taking manufacturers’ private property without just compensation instead of addressing a faulty system that stands in the way of common-sense solutions known to help patients afford their insulin"" Porter added.

U.S. District Judge David Doty granted the State of Minnesota's motion to dismiss the lawsuit last March ruling that the federal courts lack jurisdiction in this type of takings claim. Doty didn't rule on the constitutionality of the law itself but said the pharmaceutical companies must first attempt to gain compensation through the state's administrative claims process and the Minnesota State Courts system.

The safety net system is run through the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy which issues annual reports on the numbers of patients who've taken advantage of it based on reporting requirements placed on drug manufacturers.

As of March 465 Minnesotans had tapped into the system and supporters assume that number has grown in the nine months since then.

Among those who spoke at the courthouse press conference was Sara Ginsberg whose adult son has Type 1 diabetes and used the safety net program. She said her son had just taken a new job with the promise of health benefits and then discovered he had no drug coverage.

He changed jobs but ran low on insulin before his health coverage began. Ginsberg read a letter from his son saying he say a man on the street corner holding a sign that read ""Need insulin."" The man didn't know about the emergency program so Ginsberg's son took him to a pharmacy.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison who represents the state in defense of the insulin law issued a statement that reads in part:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvaGVhbHRoL29taWNyb24tbWF5LXNpZGVsaW5lLXR3by1sZWFkaW5nLWRydWdzLWFnYWluc3QtY292aWQtMTnSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL25ld3Nob3VyL2FtcC9oZWFsdGgvb21pY3Jvbi1tYXktc2lkZWxpbmUtdHdvLWxlYWRpbmctZHJ1Z3MtYWdhaW5zdC1jb3ZpZC0xOQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omicron may sideline two leading drugs against COVID-19,"WASHINGTON — As strained U.S. hospitals brace for a new surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the fast-spreading omicron variant doctors are warning of yet another challenge: the two standard drugs they’ve used to fight infections are unlikely to work against the new strain.

For more than a year antibody drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly have been the go-to treatments for early COVID-19 thanks to their ability to head off severe disease and keep patients out of the hospital.

But both drugmakers recently warned that laboratory testing suggests their therapies will be much less potent against omicron which contains dozens of mutations that make it harder for antibodies to attack the virus. And while the companies say they can quickly develop new omicron-targeting antibodies those aren’t expected to launch for at least several months.

A third antibody from British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline appears to be the best positioned to fight omicron. But Glaxo’s drug is not widely available in the U.S. accounting for a small portion of the millions of doses purchased and distributed by the federal government. U.S. health officials are now rationing scarce drug supplies to states.

“I think there’s going to be a shortage” said Dr. Jonathan Li director of the Harvard/Brigham Virology Specialty Laboratory. “We’re down to one FDA-authorized monoclonal antibody” with omicron because of the reduced effectiveness of Regeneron and Lilly’s drugs.

The delta variant still accounts for more than 95% of estimated U.S. cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But agency leaders say omicron is spreading faster than any past variant and will become the dominant strain nationwide within weeks.

Delivered by injection or infusion antibodies are laboratory-made versions of human proteins that help the immune system fight off viruses and other infections.

Glaxo’s drug developed with Vir Biotechnology was specifically formulated to bind to a part of the virus that is less likely to mutate according to the companies. Early studies of laboratory-simulated omicron by the drugmakers and outside researchers show promising results.

Supply of the drug is “extremely limited and additional doses of the product will not be available until the week of January 3rd” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in an statement posted online.

After pausing distribution last month to conserve supply HHS is now shipping 55000 doses of the drug called sotrovimab to state health departments with the doses arriving as early as Tuesday. An additional 300000 are expected in January.

The agency said it is distributing the drug to states based on their levels of infections and hospitalizations.

HHS recommends states conserve the drug for the highest risk patients who are most likely to have omicron infections either based on laboratory testing that can identify the variant or elevated levels of omicron spread in local communities identified as 20% and higher.

High-risk patients include seniors and those with serious health problems such as obesity heart disease diabetes and immune-system disorders.

Prior to the pause in shipments Glaxo’s drug accounted for about 10% of the 1.8 million antibody doses distributed to state health officials between mid-September and late November according to federal figures.

London-based Glaxo says it is on track to produce 2 million doses by May under contracts with the U.S. Canada the U.K. Japan and several other countries. The company is working to add more manufacturing capacity next year.

The loss of two leading antibody therapies puts even more focus on a pair of highly anticipated antiviral pills that U.S. regulators are expected to soon authorize.

The drugs from Pfizer and Merck would be the first treatments Americans can take at home to head off severe disease. Pfizer’s drug in particular has shown a powerful effect curbing hospitalizations and deaths by nearly 90% in high-risk patients.

“If it’s rolled out effectively this has a real big potential” to make up for antibody treatments said Andrew Pekosz a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. “That’s an immediate place where these antivirals could minimize the impact of omicron.”

Still initial supplies of both drugs are expected to be limited.

The shrinking toolbox of treatments is a painful reminder that the virus still has the upper hand in the U.S. even with more than 200 million Americans fully vaccinated.

Scientists around the world are racing to understand omicron including whether it causes more or less severe disease and how easily it evades protection from prior infection vaccination and antibody drugs.

“We’re certainly going to see hospitalizations rise” said Dr. James Cutrell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “If we have a lack of antibodies that’s certainly going to contribute to that many more patients needing to be in the hospital.”",,,,,,,,,

In 2016 the US-headquartered solar energy multinational went bankrupt which is said to be because of debts taken for aggressive acquisitions coupled with an internal financial muck-up. But the man who founded the company and ran it successfully for many years Ahmad Chatila lost no time in getting back on his feet. He put together an investment vehicle Fenice Investment Group (FIG) which has started a series of businesses.

Most of FIG’s investees are present in India a country that Chatila calls his second home.

SunEdison itself is back in the same name as a distributed energy developer headed by the original SunEdison’s India chief Pashupathy Gopalan.

Another FIG company Ohmium a US-headquartered company whose only manufacturing plant is in India made headlines recently by shipping a hydrogen electrolyser back to the US. NexGen Power Systems makes semiconductors with Gallium nitride instead of silicon a pathbreaking evolution in semiconductor technology. Arka Solar is also into rooftop solar. FTC Solar a tracker manufacturer which went public in the US recently has half its workforce in India.

FIG investee companies now have about 500-600 people working for them in India; this number will grow to 2000-3000 in three years Chatila told BusinessLine in an exclusive interview recently.

Chatila’s personal turnaround began in the form of his friends — former colleagues. Reminiscing the days after SunEdison going belly-up Chatila said: “I made some strategic mistakes I own responsibility for them. I had no money I lost all my wealth and had to take a loan on my house to pay my bills. I know the pain of failure and it is not just money.”

Just when he was wondering what to do next he was approached by TJ Rodgers the founder of Cypress Semiconductors which had also failed at that point in time. Rodgers invited Chatila to help turnaround a solar inverter company he had started called Enphase which was tottering on the verge of bankruptcy. Despite having misgivings over the business Chatila joined the company. In three years Enphase’s market capitalisation rose from $50 million to $30 billion and became the most valuable solar company in the US.

Even as this was happening Chatila started the Fenice Investment Group — an investment company with no money to invest but with the confidence that as he evolved he would find funds to invest. In time Chatila and Rodgers put the money they made in Enphase into FIG which started a bouquet of businesses.

Thumbs up for India

He makes a strong pitch for dollar-denominated solar tariffs which he says would attract funds from abroad especially from the developed rich (G-7 countries). (If the currency fluctuation risk is removed the returns would not be chipped away by any depreciation of the rupee.) “You are anyway buying oil in dollars” he notes pointing out that India’s oil bill would rise from $160 billion now to $250 billion by 2035. “When you import anything you are reducing the GDP of your country” he says. Dollar-denominated tariff would effectively mean that “you are paying yourself the dollars”.

Developed countries would have no option but to invest in India in green sectors because otherwise global emissions cannot be tamed. Dollar-denominated tariffs would galvanise FDI flows into India.

Chatila also recommends that the government fix interim targets for hydrogen renewable energy again to provide visibility to foreign investors. He feels that hydrogen is India’s chance to be what the US is today in energy. His company Ohmium is well-positioned to seize the emerging business opportunities he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LOUIS — The city’s economic development arm is launching a new $15 million loan fund to spur development and mortgage activity in neighborhoods that traditional lenders have tended to avoid.

The St. Louis Development Corporation says the new fund will help finance as many as 200 new or rehabbed homes.

Much of the money — $10 million — comes from $20 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds the St. Louis Board of Aldermen this summer directed to SLDC for a citywide housing development fund. SLDC will use federal New Markets Tax Credits to generate another $5 million in equity for the fund which will finance housing development and residential mortgages across north St. Louis and low-income areas of south St. Louis.

SLDC Director Neal Richardson said the fund will create “accessible homeownership opportunities” and “stimulate the markets” in neighborhoods that see little to no new development.

“I’m very excited for this initiative” Richardson told the SLDC board Thursday.

In a first step to launching the program the SLDC board approved issuing a request for proposals for a “master developer” that will administer the program under SLDC oversight. The chosen developer will extend loans worth around $2 million to $3 million to several sub-developers who Richardson said will try “to develop an entire block rather than one house at a time.”

The program aims to recruit minority- and women-owned sub-developers and contractors in an effort to grow capacity among minority-owned businesses in the city a goal within SLDC’s “equitable economic development” plan released last year.

Not only will the fund finance new construction and rehabs it will originate and service mortgages for the new homes overcoming a major obstacle in the targeted neighborhoods. Traditional mortgage financing can be impossible to obtain throughout much of north St. Louis because of low real estate valuations and the lack of “comparable sales” lenders and appraisers use to underwrite loans.

Richardson said the dual program will help begin to nudge up homeownership rates in areas where they have been in decline “for generations” and “build generational wealth and close that wealth gap” by helping residents buy property and build equity.

SLDC said it hopes to have a developer identified by February when staff plans to present a more detailed outline of the program to the board for approval. SLDC will maintain oversight as the money is loaned out to sub developers.

“This is going to be a very transparent process” Richardson said.

Bill Seddon who handles SLDC’s New Markets Tax Credit program said it’s the first time SLDC has used its regular allocation of the federal credits for housing development.

Some portion of the mortgages and developer loans could be forgiven to help the contractors and homeowners build wealth but ultimately the plan is to make the program fund a revolving loan operation that will ultimately lend out far more than $15 million — developing and underwriting hundreds of homes and mortgages.

“The goal is really to keep this going in perpetuity” Seddon said.

The new program faced an uncertain start over the summer when aldermanic leaders and Mayor Tishaura O. Jones clashed over how this initial round of federal stimulus funds were appropriated. An opinion from the then-acting city attorney questioned whether the $20 million for a citywide housing development fund would violate federal rules barring ARPA money from being used for “general economic development.”

The rules offer more leeway if funds are used in low-income areas and Jones ultimately spared the fund while using her line-item veto power to strip $33 million for redevelopment in several north St. Louis commercial corridors. At the time a mayoral spokesman said any concerns about the $20 million citywide housing development authority could be alleviated by shifting the money to affordable housing programs. But the money has stayed under SLDC purview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ob3VzdG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9hY3RpdmUtYWR1bHQtY3lwcmVzcy1jcmVlay1sYWtlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Active-adult apartment community to be built in Cypress master-planned community - Houston Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2021/12/18/active-adult-cypress-creek-lakes.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ob3VzdG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9hY3RpdmUtYWR1bHQtY3lwcmVzcy1jcmVlay1sYWtlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9oYXZlLXJzLTEwLWxha2gtaW4taGFuZC1zaG91bGQteW91LXJlcGF5LWhvbWUtbG9hbi1vci1pbnZlc3QtaW4tbXV0dWFsLWZ1bmRzLTExNjM5Nzk3MjU3NTA0Lmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL21vbmV5L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvaGF2ZS1ycy0xMC1sYWtoLWluLWhhbmQtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS1yZXBheS1ob21lLWxvYW4tb3ItaW52ZXN0LWluLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kcy9hbXAtMTE2Mzk3OTcyNTc1MDQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Have ₹10 lakh in hand? Should you prepay home loan or invest in mutual funds? | Mint,"Ravi Ujjwal is a 40 year old professional and he has ₹10 lakh surplus amount in hand. Now he is in confusion whether to prepay home loan or go for mutual funds investment . In fact Ravi is not the only personal who come across such situation. There are huge numbers of earning individuals who want to repay home loan whenever they have surplus amount in hand. They have a belief that coming out of loan repayment burden should be first and foremost objective of their portfolio management. However if we look at tax and investment experts’ views they think just reverse of it.

According to tax and investment experts home loan interest rate would be around 8 per cent whereas mutual funds interest rate that one can expect in long-term or say 10 years or more would be at least 12 per cent. So continuing with home loan EMI and choosing mutual funds instead of home loan prepay is a better option for an earning individual. Experts went on to add that continuing with home loan EMI helps save income tax outgo as well.

Mutual funds vs home loan EMI

Advising investors to continue with home loan EMI and invest surplus amount in mutual funds; Pankaj Mathpal Founder & MD at Optima Money Managers said ""If someone has taken home loan for 20 years he or she must remember that majority of the EMI portion comprise home loan interest in first 5 years. So prepaying home loan after paying most of the interest part won't be a wise decision. And one must remember that home loan EMI payment and mutual funds investment are two different aspects of portfolio management and they needs to be treated differently. Home loan interest rate would be around 8 per cent whereas mutual funds return calculator suggests that in long-term one can expect at least 12 per cent return on one's mutual fund investments. So it’s better to continue with home loan EMI and invest the surplus money in mutual funds.""

Income tax benefit

Highlighting the income tax benefit in choosing mutual funds instead of home loan prepayment; Vinit Khandare CEO & Founder at MyFundBazaar India said ""On the flipside continuing home loans EMI will get you income tax deduction benefits. Moreover if more than half your tenure is over for your home loan it doesn’t make any sense to prepay as majority of the interest component of the home loan has been already paid.""

Eye on retirement planning

On how mutual funds will enable an investor to create extra fund for retirement corpus; Vinit Khandare of MyFundBazaar India said ""Assume keeping certain presumptions in mind - home loan interest rate of around 8 per cent and mutual funds RoR being 12 per cent - having ₹10 lakhs in hand it will be beneficial for the investor to grow one's money through mutual funds investment because it will enable investor accumulate promising corpus towards its retirement.""

The three-bedroom penthouse sits atop the luxury One Onslow Avenue development one of the premier residential projects completed by John Hindmarsh’s eponymous national construction giant a decade ago.

The penthouse of Elizabeth Bay’s landmark One Onslow Avenue building has sold for about $21 million.

A slew of well-heeled apartment dwellers have been lured to buy into the landmark block of nine including Joanna McNiven widow of businessman John McNiven for $9.7 million in 2011 and Aussie John Symond who’s accumulated three apartments over the years.

Symond currently owns just one apartment after he offloaded two of them in 2018 including the sub-penthouse for $7.25 million to Sino Gold founder Nick Curtis and his wife Angela."

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Here are companies at the top of the Index earning Trendsetter status:

Don’t you worry; we’ve got you covered. Here are some fun goodies you can put under the tree for the Trek fan in your life. Best of all these gifts should arrive in time for Christmas!

1. Facemasks

While it’s a bummer that we’re still masking you can do it the Starfleet way with these fantastic facemasks. Fortunately there are masks for many iterations of Trek. Etsy seller DreamsIntoSeams has masks for The Original Series Deep Space Nine and my personal favorite Voyager.

2. Sticker Stocking Stuffers

If you’re looking to sweeten a stocking stickers are a nice touch. Best of all even if you don’t know anything about Star Trek with this random assortment of Star Trek stickers your favorite Trekker is bound to find something they’ll enjoy in this surprise sticker pack. With assortments as low as 10 and as big as 50 you can stuff a lot of stockings with these stickers!

Buy it here on Etsy.

3. Stained Glass Star Trek

Would you like to class up the windows in your favorite Trek fan’s office or home with a little geek chic? You’ll definitely want to check out these Trek-inspired stained glass window clings. GeekOrthodoxArt makes an array of stained glass-style window clings with several different Federation ships.

Pick between the original Enterprise the Enterprise D Voyager and the Discovery.

4. Trek the Tree

Hallmark doesn’t have the corner on Star Trek Christmas ornaments. You can find a variety of Trek-inspired ornaments on Etsy. I’m particularly fond of this one with Mr. Spock. The classic Christmas sweater vibe is perfect this time of year.

5. Trek your Friends and Family!

If you’re looking for something truly unique for your favorite Trek fan put them in the Captain’s Chair. Seriously! There are several Etsy sellers offering custom Trek portraits but sockandkeyportraits has digital delivery as soon as Christmas Eve. Your favorite Trek fan can stand on the bridge of the Enterprise D or take the conn of the original Enterprise.

6. Drink Up on the Go Lower Decks Style!

You can be a great friend and help your resident Trekkie get a jump on those healthy New Year’s resolutions. Help them drink more water with the crew of the Cerritos! This stainless steel double-walled 20 oz tumbler comes in an assortment of Lower Decks designs including Borg and Pakled! Plus with a Friends mash-up you’ve got a truly unique gift.

7. Cheers to Holiday Cheer!

Finally we could all use a cup of cheer this time of year. These unique rocks glasses are perfect for feeling like you’re at Quark’s bar or Ten Forward while you kick your feet up with long winter’s Trek-athon. The Trek fan in your life can pour up their favorite Trek-inspired cocktail or enjoy some good Scotch neat like Scotty. These glasses come in a set of four perfect for raising a glass to the holiday season with your bridge crew.

It’s like Santa’s workshop in my basement. To prep myself for wrap-apalooza I make myself a mug of hot cocoa (filled to the brim with marshmallows please) and sit with all my supplies scattered in front of me and a terrible holiday movie playing in the background. It’s so meditative.

But this holiday season I’ve been thinking about ways to make my life easier while still creating a special touch of magic. After all we need a little something festive right about now but don’t necessarily have the time or mental space to go all out the way we have in years past.

Luckily special touches don’t mean stocking up on a whole craft store’s worth of supplies. We’ve rounded up three easy ideas that are also beautiful and meaningful. Your loved ones will be delighted—and so will you when you see that lovely matching stack of gifts!

1. DIY wrapping paper + twine

This is an especially fun DIY that you can do with your kids. The paint will be messy and even more special with their help. Just dot your box with the paint of your choice (a wide brush works best for this!) then thread some jingle bells with twine and tie a simple bow to secure.

2. Add a classic family photo

You can print photos very inexpensively these days using a home printer or at your local drugstore—the more candid and sweet the better! Just wrap your gift as you normally would then secure a ribbon around it. Tape your photo and voila wrapping paper that doubles as a treasured keepsake.

3. Velvet ribbon + fresh greenery

This look is very chic but also extremely doable—our favorite combination! I have my daughter help gather some seasonal greenery for the project though you can grab some faux sprigs at a craft store. We wrap in the usual way then tie with a thick velvet ribbon. Simply tuck your piece of greenery under the ribbon and secure with a bit of tape.

And while most canvases are rooted in reality artist Aaron Long prefers to create compositions that ignite the imagination. His series of carefully rendered oil paintings depict faraway locations inspired by the fantasy genre.

From haunting blue cities illuminated by the night sky to pristine forest environments the artist traverses an array of different destinations each of which appears fully formed in his paintings. Long uses traditional techniques to portray fantastical locales as realistically as sites that exist in real life. Whether it is foreign architecture or a new mountain range he faithfully adapts these original concepts as he sees them in his mind.

Based in Missouri Long has been painting since 2013. “I discovered my love of painting through online tutorials like Bob Ross and Kevin Hill” he tells My Modern Met. “I also discovered my love of making fan art when I tried recreating [scenes and places] from Lord of the Rings and Skyrim in my landscape paintings.” Most of his work is based on fictional places from video games books and TV shows.

You can purchase original art and prints via Long's Etsy shop and keep up to date with his latest projects by following the artist on Instagram.

Part of her expenses were to buy medical supplies for her daughter who has juvenile diabetes. The daughter also needs constant monitoring and attends medical appointments in Boston. The mother receives no child support and due to COVID-19 she was no longer able to work her part-time job.

As she tried to keep up with her family’s rent during the pandemic she fell behind on her Eversource electricity bill. She reached out to the Needy Fund and was able to receive assistance with part of her bill which allowed her to get on a reasonable payment plan.

Rockwall police said military-grade munitions and equipment were found inside the newly-purchased storage unit at The Vault Storage off East Ralph Hall Parkway.

Authorities said any items that posed a threat to public safety were removed or destroyed.

A couple bought the storage unit up for $3000.

They said they usually go after collectible units but in this case they knew they had to call police.

Justin Grimes and his wife Jeana have been buying up storage units for a few years but this unit was different.

""This is probably the most extreme intense unit that we have found"" Grimes said. ""It’s better safe than sorry.""

Friday afternoon the Grimes uncovered military grade munition and weaponry inside.

The couple said the previous owner an elderly man stopped paying rent so they purchased the locker for $3000.

Grimes who served in the Marine Corps himself said he had a suspicion when he saw some inventory photos online.

""I knew what was in there. I called the police to come verify what I think I already knew"" he said. ""I still don’t know what all they took.""

Rockwall police won’t disclose all of the possible military inventory.

""Our first concern is the safety of the public"" said Rockwall PD Lt. Aaron McGrew.

McGrew confirmed they called in the Garland Bomb Squad the United States Air Force and the FBI to set up a perimeter Friday night.

Ralph Hall Parkway was shut down and nearby businesses were evacuated.

""There was one device that was unstable and needed to be made safe and they took it into a field directly behind"" McGrew said.

The Grimes documented the overnight investigation on their YouTube channel Grimes Finds.

Once federal agents cleared out early Saturday morning they started to sift through what was left.

There are several boxes they haven’t even had time to go through before they head straight to auction.

Rockwall police said they handed the investigation over to the FBI to decided exactly where the weapons came from and whether these weapons were legal to own.

The opinion was solicited by international lawyer Melinda Janki and the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW). It was submitted to the EAB as part of the public feedback period for the Yellowtail EIA. That period concluded on Wednesday.

Dr Cordes is an Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Biology at Temple University in Philadelphia with over 20 years’ experience in deep sea ecology hydrocarbon seeps and is recognised by his peers as an expert. He has been chief scientist on 10 research cruises. The research in his lab is focused on understanding the areas of the deep sea that support the highest biomass communities: deep-water coral reefs natural hydrocarbon seeps and hydrothermal vents. He studies these ecosystems at all levels of organisation – from energy flow in ecosystems and patterns of community assembly down to gene expression and microbial processes.

The expert reviewed several sections of the EIA that dealt with his area of expertise and produced his findings. He noted that with most offshore projects like Exxon’s at the depth of more than 1000 metres the EIA is missing critical pieces of information that are required to make informed decisions relating to the potential impacts of the Yellowtail project.

With the seeming rush to have the project approved Dr Cordes highlighted that Environmental Management Resources (ERM) – the consultant selected by ExxonMobil to conduct the EIA – failed to provide substantial data about the distribution of potentially sensitive species for particularly benthic organisms in the area. Benthic organisms refer to organisms living on or near the sea bed.

“I found large parts of the EIA difficult to assess because of the poor quality of the maps provided. There was no position information (latitude and longitude) provided… and the bathymetric data were extremely low resolution which resulted in very wide-spaced depth contours in the images. Certainly EEPGL and its partners have higher-resolution multibeam echosounder (MBES) data in the project area as well as high-resolution seismic reflectivity data that could reveal the presence of hard substrate in the vicinity of the proposed site” Dr Cordes said in his findings.

Zeroing on the particular sections he looked at Dr Cordes highlighted that under the heading ‘Marine Geology/Sediments and Marine Benthos’ in the EIA he found that the overall conclusion of a negligible impact on marine sediments to be particularly questionable.

Pointing to a section of the EIA which states “While the mortality rate of immobile taxa individuals from physical disturbance resulting from installation of the subsea infrastructure will be high the population is not anticipated to be sensitive to the reduction in individuals within the limited area affected” Dr Cordes said he is baffled as to how the conclusion was arrived at since there is the glaring absence of data on the population size of potentially sensitive species inside the area of impact and in the region.

He questioned the absence of that data by highlighting ERM’s effort to explain the marine stratigraphy (rock layers) with the provision of high resolution maps measuring the depth ocean. He concluded that those maps indicate that Exxon has access to the data.

“From this low resolution version of the image it is still apparent that there are submarine canyons in the area and possibly some hard-substrate areas near the project location. There is also one small area covered by side-scan sonar outside of the proposed project site. Were there no autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) side-scan data acquired within the project area? These data would reveal areas of high relief that likely represent hard substrate habitats in the vicinity.

“There are also some areas delineated in purple on the map. I suspect that they represent areas of high surface acoustic reflectivity interpreted from the back-scatter of MBES data or from the 3D seismic data that surely exist for this project. These kinds of signals almost invariably indicate the presence of hard-substrate areas. If that is what they are they are very close to the proposed site possibly within 2 km if I am interpreting the grid on the map correctly” the expert opined.

He also pointed out the scarceness of the data relating to fish. This comes at a time when fishermen have been experiencing low catches and serious questions have been raised about the impact of Exxon’s activities on marine life. Additionally environmentalists have been continually calling out Exxon for the scant regard it has given to a baseline study for fishes.

ERM in the EIA said that “no fish were captured deeper than 1000 meters” but Dr Cordes said with the clear absence of studies on the deep-sea fauna of Guyana there is the possibility of that claim being false. He cemented his opinion in the fact that a recent study of the deep-sea fishes off of the northern coast of Brazil listed 30 fish species with a bathymetric distribution that exceeds 1000 metres depth.

“…and it is highly likely that the majority of these also occur off of Guyana as deep-sea fishes in general have a very wide distribution. This demonstrates that their sampling of this community was obviously incomplete” he said.

Sensitive species

He added that ERM’s statements relating to the finds of coral fragments confirm his suspicions of sensitive species in the project area. He said that in numerous places in the EIA the presence of deep-sea coral species is mentioned including the reef-forming species Madrepora oculata and Solenosmilia variabilis as well as long-lived black corals. He also questioned ERM’s assertions that the presence of these species are just “remnant” populations or indications of “nascent recovery” of a past population.

“Based on my 10+ years of experience with photographic surveys from AUVs this certainly indicates that there are more deep-sea coral populations that remain to be discovered. Interestingly the corals in Fig. 7. 9-10 do NOT look like black corals but rather gorgonian octocorals. These samples and likely many more obtained during the impact assessment surveys should be examined by a true expert” he opined.

In conclusion he stated “The EIA is deficient and the EPA does not have the scientific and technical information required to make an informed decision about the potential impacts of the proposed project in the Stabroek block. The distribution and abundance of hard substrata and a complete assessment of the distribution and abundance of hard substrate fauna including deep-sea corals and cold-seep endemic fauna (chemosynthetic tubeworms and mussels) are required before any conclusions about the impacts on regional populations of sensitive benthic species can be reached. Without this information this project is highly likely to have greater impacts than those indicated here.”

The Yellowtail project is ExxonMobil and partners’ fourth development in the Stabroek Block and is considered the largest undertaking since Guyana became an oil-producing nation. As part of the Yellowtail Project ExxonMobil plans to drill between 40 and 67 wells for the 20-year duration of the investment. It is intended to be the largest of the four developments with over 250000 barrels of oil per day targeted once production commences. Based on the schedule once approval is granted engineering commences in 2022 and production in the latter part of 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZW10di5jb20ucGcva3BobC1jb25ncmF0dWxhdGVzLXNhbnRvcy1vc2wtbWVyZ2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KPHL congratulates Santos-OSL Merger – EMTV Online,"Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) under Managing Director Wapu Sonk of PNG has commended Santos Ltd and Oil Search Ltd over successful completion of merging.

Santos being a regional industry has expressed strong interest in PNG as it has plans to pursue a greater role along with Kumul Petroleum Total SA and ExxonMobil in various oil and gas development projects in PNG.

The Managing Director for KPHL commended Oil Search for been the mainstay over PNG’s focused oil and gas resources development in the country.

“As direct beneficiaries of OSL in the early stages as former employee and now partners in various projects I would like to farewell a name that was synonym with oil and gas in the country for over 30 years.

“Without OSL we couldn’t see some of those major development changes in the country through both direct and indirect investment such as tax credit schemes direct cash injection through corporate tax employee tax employment opportunities and many other positive impacted through corporate social responsibility programs made over the years in the project footprints and elsewhere” Sonk said.

Sonk said the change of guard now creates better opportunity for Kumul Petroleum as the leading host partner to Santos and other major global industry players giving prominence to the NOC while adding value to various investments as well as adding value to the industry and country itself.

The Managing Director said as the host NOC and partners Kumul Petroleum is looking forward to working with Santos and pick up on the leagues left by OSL to create more values and opportunities that mutually benefits all partners and shareholder in the business.",,,

(NYSE: FDX) and one of the world’s largest express transportation companies completed its support for the 2021 Student City program run by global NGO Junior Achievement (JA) Japan. At Student City FedEx Express welcomed more than 280 sixth-grade elementary students from five schools in the Shinagawa-ku district of Tokyo. These students demonstrated business creativity with new ideas for future shipping solutions guided by FedEx volunteers who mentored the students on the basics of trade and economy.

Student City is a mock-up town located in an elementary school in Shinagawa-ku Tokyo where students get the opportunity to work in various companies. This program runs throughout the year and is open to all public elementary school students in Shinagawa-ku. This year the program was held completely online due to the pandemic.

During this month-long program students showcased new ideas for customer experience at points of pick-up and delivery in different situations. Students undertook tasks that included developing ideas for more convenient pick-up options for customers in rural areas in Japan and creative delivery options for customers who can only receive packages at home on Sundays.

During the online final presentation sessions students impressed with ideas such as collaborating with local taxi companies supermarkets convenience stores and train stations to expand pick-up and delivery points. Other ideas included using advanced technology like smartphone apps and drones to enhance customer convenience. Students brainstormed these ideas with FedEx volunteers and even conducted sales forecast and cost estimation analysis compared service quality and prices and checked employee workloads mirroring the real working environment at a logistics company.

FedEx volunteers helped the students work effectively in groups such as listening to others’ opinions and sharing their thoughts for better communication.

“It was great to see young minds sharing new perspectives seeing the future of the logistics industry and finding ways to implement new ideas. I would like to thank Junior Achievement Japan who transformed this program to be completely online this year so the students could continue to participate in this incredible opportunity” said Kei Alan Kubota Managing Director Japan Operations FedEx Express. “I feel inspired by the students’ fresh ideas to improve the customer experience which is a priority for us at FedEx. In today’s business environment trends and demands continue to shift and we are always looking at new ways to adapt to best serve our customers.”

FedEx has been supporting the Student City program in Japan since 2011. FedEx highlights educational support for young people as one of the key areas of its commitment to global social responsibility. The opportunities for students include the annual business idea contest FedEx/JA International Trade Challenge (ITC) which is held across APAC markets. This is in line with the company’s FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal which is to make a positive impact on 50 million people around the world by the company’s 50th anniversary in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3VsZC1sYW5kbG9yZC1hbWF6b24tZmVkZXgtd2FsbWFydC0xODAwMDA1MzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You could be a landlord for Amazon FedEx and Walmart with these REITs that net up to a 4.4% yield — you can even ...,"You could be a landlord for Amazon FedEx and Walmart with these REITs that net up to a 4.4% yield — you can even collect on a monthly basis

Being a landlord is one of the oldest ways to earn a passive income. And these days you don’t have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.

Check out real estate investment trusts which are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.

REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants fixing damages or chasing down late payments. Instead they simply sit back and enjoy the dividend checks rolling in when they pick a winning REIT.

Of course the COVID-19 pandemic did impact some commercial real estate. And not all REITs are the same. If you are a landlord for e-commerce giant Amazon for instance you should have no problem collecting a steady stream of rental income.

With that in mind let’s take a look at two REITs paying oversized dividends to investors — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash.

Amazon’s landlord

The first one is STAG Industrial (STAG) a REIT that owns and operates single-tenant industrial properties throughout the U.S. Its biggest tenant is Amazon.

The company’s portfolio consists of 517 buildings totaling approximately 103 million rentable square feet across 40 states.

Note that 434 of the 517 properties are warehouses which happen to be an essential part of e-commerce.

Moreover a tenant survey in 2020 revealed that around 40% of the REIT’s portfolio handles e-commerce activity.

To see how solid STAG Industrial is take a look at its dividend history.

Since the company went public in 2011 it has paid a higher dividend every single year.

While most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule STAG Industrial pays shareholders every month. The monthly dividend rate stands at 12.08 cents per share which translates to an annual yield of 3.2%.

STAG Industrial shares are up 50% year to date. If you don’t feel comfortable picking individual stocks in this elevated market you can always build a diversified passive income portfolio automatically just by investing your spare change.

Walmart’s landlord

When it comes to paying monthly dividends one company stands out above all — Realty Income (O).

Realty Income has been paying uninterrupted monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That’s 616 consecutive monthly dividends paid.

Better yet since the company went public in 1994 it has announced 114 dividend increases.

Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of nearly 11000 commercial properties located in all 50 states Puerto Rico the UK and Spain. It leases them to around 650 tenants operating across 60 industries.

This means even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn the impact on company-level financials will likely be limited.

For instance while Realty Income rents some properties to AMC Theaters — whose business was hurt by COVID-19 — it also has Walgreens FedEx and Walmart as some of its top tenants. And these businesses turned out to be largely pandemic-proof.

Earlier this week the REIT increased its monthly cash dividend to 24.65 cents per share giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 4.4%.

To put things in perspective the average dividend yield of S&P 500 companies is just 1.3% today.

Looking beyond REITs

Of course stocks are volatile. And even the best REITs are not immune to the market’s ups and downs.

Diversification is key — and you don’t have to stay in the stock market to get it.

If you want to invest in something insulated from stock market swings take a look at some lesser-known alternative assets.

Traditionally investing in sectors like exotic vehicles or multifamily apartment buildings or even litigation finance have only been options for the ultrarich.

But with the help of new platforms these kinds of opportunities are available to retail investors too.

BrightDrop has delivered the first 500 examples of its electric commercial vehicles the EV600. The first customer to receive the new last-mile delivery van is FedEx.

“The delivery of the first BrightDrop EV600s is a historic moment born out of a spirit of collaboration between two leading American companies” said Mitch Jackson FedEx’s chief sustainability officer. “Transforming our pickup and delivery fleet to electric vehicles is integral to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals announced earlier this year. This collaborative effort shows how businesses can take action to help usher in a lower-emissions future for all.”

FedEx intends to make its global operations carbon neutral by 2040. With the help of GM and BrightDrop the company now has a fleet of delivery vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions.

Based on GM’s Ultium platform the delivery van has a range of 250 miles (402 km) per charge and it supports up to 120 kW DC fast chargers which can deliver 170 miles (247 km) of range in as little as an hour.

The vehicle has sliding pocket doors wide cabin walkways and over 600 cubic feet (16990 liters) of cargo space. It is also equipped with a 13.4-inch infotainment system and a cargo area security system with motion sensors.

So far BrightDrop has received more than 18000 total orders with more than 12000 for the EV600 and 5400 for the smaller EV410.

“As e-commerce continues to grow BrightDrop is thrilled to partner with FedEx in our mission to dramatically reduce vehicle emissions from delivery and deliver a brighter future for all of us” said BrightDrop CEO Travis Katz. “FedEx has ambitious sustainability goals and the speed with which we brought the first BrightDrop electric vehicles to market shows how the private sector can innovate and help bring solutions for some of our biggest climate- and emissions-related challenges.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE1NTI0L2ZlZGV4LXJlY2lldmVzLWZpcnN0LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtYnJpZ2h0ZHJvcC1ldjYwMNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE1NTI0L2ZlZGV4LXJlY2lldmVzLWZpcnN0LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtYnJpZ2h0ZHJvcC1ldjYwMC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fedex Recieves First Deliveries Of Brightdrop EV600,"Follow us today...

When BrightDrop was created GM was keen on using the brand to help give the auto giant a slice of the growing EV sales pie. The Ford Transit EV and even entries Rivian and Bollinger Motors are showing the world that there is indeed pent-up demand for a full-size commercial van. But beyond testing and teaser photos we haven't heard much about the EV600 in a while. That changed this week with BrightDrop revealing that it has shipped its first production EV600 vans to FedEx.

FedEx Wil Be Valuable Testing Ground For Brightdrop

While it may seem like BrightDrop is following the same old script that we have seen countless times from other van makers these FedEx vans will help provide the young firm with valuable real-world data. FedEx vehicles cover alot of miles and they also haul alot of parcels and other bulky cargo when they go through their routes every day. These two things alone will provide opportunities to see how real-world stresses affect the EV600's range. For example the various parcels that are moved from place to place in the van will affect the range between charges especially if they have to haul bulky items.

FedEx has also played a pivotal role in the EV600's development with the company already testing BrightDrop's EP1 pallets in the field with that project being green-lit before GM spun off BrightDrop itself into a separate company earlier this year.

“The delivery of the first BrightDrop EV600s is a historic moment born out of a spirit of collaboration between two leading American companies” said Mitch Jackson chief sustainability officer FedEx. “At FedEx transforming our pickup and delivery fleet to electric vehicles is integral to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals announced earlier this year. This collaborative effort shows how businesses can take action to help usher in a lower-emissions future for all.”

BrightDrop EV600 Gets 250 Miles Of Range Targets Rivals

Thankfully the EV600 can match the bulk of the hype that it has generated with BrightDrop officials claiming that the van can get up to 250 miles on a single charge. The van is also a hybrid of both a traditional cargo van and a step-in style van with BrightDrop claiming that it combines the best of both into a unique package.

While the five that made their way to FedEx won't make much of a dent in the broader sales picture right away they will play a big role in GM's broader green future. In the case of the EV600 it will help GM make its operations carbon-neutral by 2040.

In the meantime BrightDrop will also be working to make up some ground in the segment with the van facing an early threat from Rivian and their commercial van which has already begun making deliveries for Amazon in both Los Angeles and San Francisco with the company ultimately hoping to order 100000 vans. Archrival UPS is also entering the EV wars but the company is working with the UK-based firm Arrival Ltd and has placed an initial order for 10000 delivery trucks.

GM says that deliveries of the anticipated electric SUV are now ready to begin. Like the electric delivery vehicle the Hummer EV is based on the Ultium platform.

GM

With vehicles now ready for delivery it means the lucky buyer of the Barrett Jackson auction for VIN 001 can now take delivery of their vehicle. The auction benefited the Tunnel to Towers Foundation and when the hammer finally fell it sold for $2.5 million. The anonymous buyer's vehicle has a white exterior and a Lunar Horizon interior. It's also fitted with the Extreme Off-Road Package featuring under-body armor underbody cameras 18-inch wheels and 35-inch off-road tires.

GM

The most impressive part about the Hummer EV is that it has 1000 horsepower and promises 11500 pound-feet of torque. Despite being a massive electric vehicle it's able to reach 60 mph from a standstill in three seconds and has a 350-mile driving range. It also has a unique crabwalk feature making the big vehicle more maneuverable on the trails.

Edition 1 Hummer EVs rolling off the assembly line have an Interstellar White exterior and Lunar Horizon interior. The starting MSRP is $110295. The vehicle also has Super Cruise which is what GM calls its hands-free driving system. Super Cruise works on more than 200000 miles of enabled roads around the country and has an automatic lane changing feature. GMC sold all of the Edition 1 models but it points out reservations are still available for other Hummer models.

GM

Interestingly GM and Ford fought a short legal battle in court over the ""cruise"" portion of the Super Cruise name. Ford debuted its own driver-assist technology called BlueCruise and GM took exception to that. GM demanded that Ford cease using the word ""cruise"" as GM claimed it owned a trademark on it. Ford was quick to point out that ""cruise"" had been used to describe driver assistance systems for decades and that GM was far from the first to use it. Eventually the two settled the spat out of court and each continued to use their respective ""cruise"" technologies."

CAPE CANAVERAL Fla. -- Sixty years after NASA set the goal and three years after its Parker Solar Probe launched the spacecraft has become the first to ""touch the sun."" The Parker Solar Probe has successfully flown through the sun's corona or upper atmosphere to sample particles and our star's magnetic fields.

""Parker Solar Probe 'touching the Sun' is a monumental moment for solar science and a truly remarkable feat"" said Thomas Zurbuchen the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in a statement.

""Not only does this milestone provide us with deeper insights into our Sun's evolution and (its) impacts on our solar system but everything we learn about our own star also teaches us more about stars in the rest of the universe.""

The announcement was made at the 2021 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday and research from the solar milestone has been published in the Physical Review Letters.

The Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 and set out to circle closer and closer to the sun. Scientists including the spacecraft's namesake astrophysicist Eugene Parker want to answer fundamental questions about the solar wind that streams out from the sun flinging energetic particles across the solar system.

NASA launched a spacecraft on a mission to smash into an asteroid to see if a space rock could be knocked off course if one were to threaten Earth.

The sun's corona is much hotter than the actual surface of the star and the spacecraft could provide insight about why. The corona is one million degrees Kelvin (1800000 degrees Fahrenheit) at its hottest point while the surface is around 6000 Kelvin (10340 degrees Fahrenheit).

The spacecraft has already revealed surprising finds about the sun including the 2019 discovery of magnetic zig-zag structures in the solar wind called switchbacks.

Now thanks to Parker's latest close approach to the sun the spacecraft helped scientists determine that these switchbacks originate from the solar surface.

Before Parker Solar Probe's mission is done it will have made 21 close approaches to the sun over the course of seven years. The probe will orbit within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface in 2024 closer to the star than Mercury -- the closest planet to the sun.

Although that sounds far researchers equate this to the probe sitting on the four-yard line of a football field and the sun being the end zone.

NASA said it's Hubble space telescope found persistent water vapor over the atmosphere of Europa one of Jupiter's moons.

When closest to the sun the 4-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shields will have to withstand temperatures close to 2500 degrees Fahrenheit. However the inside of the spacecraft and its instruments will remain at a comfortable room temperature.

""Flying so close to the Sun Parker Solar Probe now senses conditions in the magnetically dominated layer of the solar atmosphere -- the corona -- that we never could before"" said Nour Raouafi Parker project scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel Maryland in a statement.

""We see evidence of being in the corona in magnetic field data solar wind data and visually in images. We can actually see the spacecraft flying through coronal structures that can be observed during a total solar eclipse.""

Getting up close with a star

In April the Parker team realized their spacecraft had crossed the boundary and entered the solar atmosphere for the first time.

It occurred when the spacecraft made its eighth flyby of the sun and registered magnetic and particle conditions specific to a boundary where the sun's massive solar atmosphere ends and the solar wind begins -- 8.1 million miles above the surface of the sun.

""We were fully expecting that sooner or later we would encounter the corona for at least a short duration of time"" said Justin Kasper lead study author University of Michigan professor and deputy chief technology officer at BWX Technologies Inc. in a statement. ""It is very exciting that we've already reached it.""

Parker wove in and out of the corona several times over the course of a few hours during the April flyby which helped researchers understand that the boundary called the Alfvén critical surface isn't a smooth circle around the sun. Instead it has has spikes and valleys. Understanding the presence of these features could allow scientists to match them with solar activity from the sun's surface.

During the flyby Parker made another intriguing encounter as it passed 6.5 million miles from the sun's surface. It passed through a feature called a pseudostreamer a large structure rising above the surface of the sun that has been observed from Earth during solar eclipses.

When the spacecraft flew through the pseudostreamer things were quiet just like in the eye of a storm. Typically Parker is bombarded with particles as it flies through the solar wind. In this case particles moved slower and the zig-zagging switchbacks decreased.

The spacecraft will likely fly through the corona again in January during its next flyby.

""I'm excited to see what Parker finds as it repeatedly passes through the corona in the years to come"" said Nicola Fox division director for NASA's Heliophysics Division in a statement. ""The opportunity for new discoveries is boundless.""

Parker is likely to be in the right place at the right time during future flybys as the sun's 11-year cycle heats up with activity over the next few years. Every 11 years the sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one.

It's important to understand the solar cycle because space weather caused by the sun -- eruptions like solar flares and coronal mass ejection events -- can impact the power grid satellites GPS airlines rockets and astronauts in space.

The newest solar cycle which began in December 2019 has been predicted to peak in July 2025 which means an increase in solar activity.

This means that the outer edge of the sun's corona will expand and Parker will likely get to spend more time flying through the sun's mysterious outer atmosphere.

""It is a really important region to get into because we think all sorts of physics potentially turn on"" Kasper said. ""And now we're getting into that region and hopefully going to start seeing some of these physics and behaviors.""

The sun is the literal star of the show in our solar system but we’re still trying to figure out our celestial disco ball.

Debates about the sun were first posed by ancient Greek philosophers. Thousands of years later the combined work of people like Copernicus Galileo Kepler and Newton helped determine that planets orbit the sun.

Many questions about our sun remain like the nature of the energized wind that streams away from it across the solar system or why the fiery orb’s outer atmosphere is so much hotter than the surface.

It’s why NASA sent the Parker Solar Probe on a seven-year mission to investigate in 2018. The spacecraft has already uncovered surprising things.

Now at its closest approach to the sun yet we’re getting to the good stuff.

This illustration shows the Parker Solar Probe nearing the sun. NASA

It’s official: Humans have used a spacecraft to “touch the sun” and revealed some unusual insights about our star.

The Parker Solar Probe successfully flew through the sun’s corona or upper atmosphere to sample particles and our star’s magnetic fields. This NASA goal was 60 years in the making.

Because the spacecraft will continue to draw closer to the sun especially during an anticipated peak in solar activity even more surprises are sure to be in store as the mission goes on.

Fantastic creatures

This critter’s got legs and knows how to use them. In fact it has the most legs of any living animal.

It’s a true millipede with 1306 legs. Mille means “thousand” in Latin but known millipede species topped out at 750 legs until this discovery.

Scientists found the real McCoy living deep underground in Western Australia. It’s only 3.7 inches (9.5 centimeters) long but it has 330 body segments.

In case you’re wondering the researchers recounted the legs just to be sure.

A long time ago

Sheep can be found all over the Faroe Islands. William D'Andrea/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory

A previously unknown human population lived on the isolated Faroe Islands hundreds of years before the Vikings arrived – and researchers found out thanks to ancient sheep poop.

The rugged archipelago located between Norway and Iceland was first reached by people who brought livestock with them in 500 AD. The Vikings later arrived in the 800s.

Analysis of sediment cores taken from a lake on one of the Faroe Islands helped researchers establish a timeline of when the non-native sheep and their human owners arrived.

The exact identity of these people remains a mystery but the team has an idea of who they were thanks to some intriguing clues.

Other worlds

Mars is the scientific gift that keeps on giving. This week researchers made several groundbreaking discoveries that change our understanding of the red planet.

It turns out that the Perseverance rover has been driving over the remains of ancient volcanic lava for months – something that was “completely unexpected” for mission scientists.

The rocks that Percy has sampled so far were also found to have interacted with water multiple times and some of them include organic molecules.

And a European orbiter investigating Valles Marineris on Mars – picture the Grand Canyon but 10 times longer five times deeper and 20 times wider – found it has “significant amounts of water.”

Consequences

The Arctic is suffering as our planet warms. The typically frozen biome failed its annual health check due to the climate crisis.

More than 100 scientists shared the news in the Arctic Report Card this week. The report tracked changes in sea ice snow temperatures animals and even vegetation all pointing to the fact that the Arctic is melting.

Meanwhile researchers warned that a critical ice shelf in Antarctica could shatter within the next five years. Its presence is safeguarding the so-called “Doomsday glacier.”

Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier already accounts for about 4% of annual global sea level rise. Irreversible changes throughout the planet could result from its demise.

Discoveries

Keep these facts in your hat for trivia night:

– These meat-eating dinosaurs could sprint as fast as Usain Bolt – yet another reason to be glad “Jurassic Park” isn’t real.

– NASA’s Juno mission just revealed dreamy new images of Jupiter and the otherworldly sounds of its moon Ganymede.

– Are neurosurgeons and rocket scientists really smarter than the rest of us? This is what the research team found.

While claims that the probe “touched the sun” are a bit misleading the reality is that entering the Sun’s atmosphere is a truly remarkable achievement and almost immediately provided data on solar magnetism and solar winds which we could never have collected from Earth.

Back on the 28th of April Parker passed what is known as the Alfvén critical boundary. The sun has no actual surface but the roiling material inside is kept in check by a magnetic field and gravity—but heat and pressure can push some material further.

It is at this moment that the ejected material is classified as the “solar wind”: highly energetic solar material that leaves the Sun in a zig-zag pattern and moves so fast that it passes the boundary and arrives at Earth in the form of radiation.

Scientists had no idea where the Alfvén critical boundary was and as the Parker Solar Probe continued to orbit the Sun it’s eighth revolution saw it pass a point of around 8.1 million miles from the surface where the magnetic and particle data changed informing scientists it had passed through the boundary and was within the Sun’s atmosphere also known as the corona.

What we learned

“We were fully expecting that sooner or later we would encounter the corona for at least a short duration of time” said Justin Kasper lead author on a new paper about the milestone published in Physical Review Letters.

After the initial entry Parker passed in and out of the boundary several times proving that rather than a smooth sphere it’s wrinkled and bent according to pressures coming off of the Sun itself. Understanding how events on the surface impact this boundary can help scientists better understand the solar wind and how it affects the solar system.

A particular moment in orbit brought Parker to within 6.5 million miles from the surface where it captured images of a pseudostreamer massive columnar structures that rise above the Sun’s surface and which make up the dramatic tentacle shapes coming off the Sun seen during a total solar eclipse.

Strangely the pseudostreamer was like a storm system in that the edges were extremely active but in the center conditions quieted.

At this point it bears mentioning that in order to avoid being melted from the intense heat thus far left out of the discussion Parker has to travel at 320000 miles per hour which makes it the fastest thing build by humans. Its heat shield behind which the instruments are protected staves off heat up to 2500°F (1400°C).

In 2019 when Parker first entered the edge of the Alfvén critical boundary environment it discovered the origin of the zig-zag pattern of the solar wind. On its 6th orbiting of the Sun collected data showed the zig-zags known as switchbacks occurring in patches and have a higher percentage of helium—known to come from the surface of the sun the photosphere.

The switchbacks’ origins were further narrowed when the scientists found the patches aligned with magnetic funnels that emerge from the photosphere called supergranules. These supergranules could be the genesis of the solar wind altogether. A fascinating discovery.

Over the next few years Parker will continually dart in and out of the corona taking readings and one point will see it reach 3.8 million miles from the surface.

“I’m excited to see what Parker finds as it repeatedly passes through the corona in the years to come” said Nicola Fox division director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters. “The opportunity for new discoveries is boundless.”

The probe captured the first photos ever from within the corona and those images were then turned into this incredible 13-second timelapse video.



The footage shows what the Parker Solar Probe saw as it passed through the Sun’s corona back in August 2021 flying through structures known as coronal streamers.

“These structures can be seen as bright features moving upward and downward in this video compiled from the spacecraft’s WISPR (Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe) instrument” the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory writes. “Such a view is only possible because the spacecraft flew above and below the streamers inside the corona. Until now streamers have only been seen from afar.”

These are the same streamers that can be captured from Earth in photos of total solar eclipses.

“Flying so close to the Sun Parker Solar Probe now senses conditions in the magnetically dominated layer of the solar atmosphere – the corona – that we never could before” says Parker project scientist Nour Raouafi. “We see evidence of being in the corona in magnetic field data solar wind data and visually in images. We can actually see the spacecraft flying through coronal structures that can be observed during a total solar eclipse.”

The Milky Way can be seen rotating across the frame in the timelapse but what’s even more incredible is that multiple planets in the Solar System were also captured in the images. There are even views of Earth as seen from within the Sun’s atmosphere.

Here are the features and planets labeled in still frames by astrophysicist Grant Tremblay of the Center for Astrophysics a collaboration between Harvard and the Smithsonian Institution:

The Parker Solar Probe will continue to make closer and closer approaches to the Sun’s surface over the coming years and it is likely to enter the Sun’s corona again as early as next month.

Reolink Go Plus integrates a 4MP camera and supports person and vehicle detection just like Reolink RLC-810A model I reviewed earlier this year. I have three Reolink cameras and I’m somewhat satisfied except that the connection to WiFi cameras is often unreliable and I have to rely on Cloud backup to play video captures most of the time. The Ethernet-connected Reolink RLC-810A has a much more reliable connection. So I’ll have to see if the Reolink Go Plus camera is more accessible over 4G LTE than WiFi cameras.

I’ll start the review by checking out the packages and going through the initial setup for the Reolink Go Plus smart security camera.

Reolink Go Plus unboxing

I received two separate packages one for the camera and the other for the solar panel.





We’ve got the key features for each in English French Spanish German and Italian. There’s not much for the solar panel except it’s “easy to setup” and weatherproof with an IP65 rating

but we’ve got a few more details about the camera with 4G LTE network support person/vehicle detection two-way audio and IP65 ingress protection rating for outdoor use. Not this camera only supports 4G LTE and there’s no WiFi or Ethernet at all.

The solar panel includes a long micro USB cable attached to it in a weatherproof fashion a mount with a screw set some UK/EU compliance documents and a multilingual “operational instruction” manual.

At the back of the panel we can see the solar panel supports up to 6V up to 3.2W of output power. Two of my Reolink cameras are using this type of solar panel and none of the cameras ever went out of power including Reolink Argus Eco which I’ve used since June 2019 or for about 2.5 years. I’m based in Thailand so it probably helps as well.

The package for the camera itself includes a wall mount with a pack of screws a belt and mounting plate for tree mounting a micro USB cable for charging the battery a rechargeable battery a rubber skin cover to further protect and hide the camera several “24-hour video surveillance” sticker in English French Spanish German and Italian as well as a user manual also written in five languages.

The battery has a custom design with 27.37 Wh capacity (3.65V/7500 mA) and is charged through pogo pins inside the camera.

We can clearly see the lens and PIR sensor in the photo above but the front of the camera also comes with a light sensor a status LED six infrared lights and a small opening for a microphone.

The micro USB port is protected with a plastic cover when not using the solar panel and a grid for the speaker. The back features a thread for the mounting kit.

This is what the camera looks like with the mount and the rubber skin cover. It can help somewhat hide the camera when mounted to a tree for instance.

Initial setup

Let’s setup the camera. We’ll first need to remove the back cover by rotating counterclockwise.

This reveals the compartment for the batteries and the slots for a SIM card and a microSD card. If you’ve just purchased the microSD from the shop you’d probably be able to just install it for it to work. But since most of my microSD cards have spent some time in a Raspberry Pi or another single board computer the camera will not recognize those due to the non-standard partition. So each time I install a microSD card in a camera I use Gparted to make sure there’s a single partition formatted with FAT32.

With that done I took the nano-SIM card from my phone (with a 10 Mbps unlimited unmetered plan) to insert it into the camera and did the same for the microSD card I’ve just repartitioned and formatted followed by the installation of the battery.

Shortly after inserting the battery I got a voice prompt saying “Network connection succeeded”. That’s a good sign! I also started to charge the battery as recommended in the user manual but I then noticed the battery already has a good charge it may not be absolutely necessary.

I already have the Reolink Android app installed on my phone so I just taped on the ‘+’ button to add a new camera and scanned the QR code on the camera to start the process…

After scanning the QR code I was asked to create a device password and select whether the camera will be used indoor or outdoor.

This follows some warning about using battery cameras since they can record continuously and what consideration should be taken into account such as frequency of motion strong heat or light may trigger many false positive interference may cause connection issues and so on. The procedure ends with a QR code that can be used to share or add the device again later on. It’s useful as scanning the QR code after the camera has been installed on a tree might be inconvenient. Anyway I got the stream working immediately after clicking on Finish. No need to configure the Internet parameters in the camera or anything like that. So I suppose if the SIM card works on your phone and there’s no pin it’s safe to assume it would go just as smoothly with any SIM card.

By default the camera operates at low resolution with a bitrate around 400-500 Kbps but I switched to high resolution with the bitrate varying from 1.5 to 3 Mbps. There’s also a fluent mode that provides a balance between quality and bitrate. Of course the bitrate will depend on the scene itself as well but determining the maximum bitrate may save you a few bucks per year on your cellular plan.

The next step will be to install the camera near my house gate that’s outside the Wi-Fi range and test the various features of the camera. I’d like to thank Reolink for sending the Go Plus and solar panel for review. The bundle reviewed here can be purchased on Amazon for $249.99 but you’ll also find it on Reolink shop.

The Browns (7-6) host the Las Vegas Raiders (6-7) at 5 p.m. Monday at FirstEnergy Stadium in a game crucial to Cleveland’s playoff hopes. With a victory the Browns would move into first place in the AFC North.

The game was postponed from Saturday and Browns players have until 2 p.m. Monday to produce a negative test and be activated from the reserve/COVID-19 list.

“Blessed to be healthy and have had no symptoms Praying to test negative for COVID” Mayfield wrote followed by three praying hands emojis.

A source told the Beacon Journal on Wednesday that Mayfield was vaccinated and asymptomatic but there had been no further indication of how he was feeling since.

As of Sunday evening the Browns had 23 players and three coaches — including coach Kevin Stefanski — on the list. That also includes backup quarterback Case Keenum. Third-stringer Nick Mullens was called up from the practice squad as a COVID-19 replacement on Thursday. Signed on Sept. 1 Mullens had his first practice with the starting unit on Saturday.

Browns' COVID-19 list:Which Cleveland Browns are out with COVID-19 as they prepare for Las Vegas Raiders?

One who is not faring as well as Mayfield is Browns strong safety Ronnie Harrison Jr. who tested positive Friday. Harrison posted on Twitter Sunday “Covid a Mfer ... got me feeling like I’m under a spell or sum” followed by two laughing and two crying emojis.

The AFC North remains up for grabs with the Cincinnati Bengals (8-6) in the lead after Sunday's 15-10 road victory over the Denver Broncos. The Baltimore Ravens (8-6) lost 31-30 to the Green Bay Packers (11-3) Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium.

If the Browns beat the Raiders their 8-6 record would tie the Bengals and Ravens. The Browns would have the three-team tiebreaker edge on the Bengals and Ravens by virtue of their 2-1 record in games among the three clubs. The Bengals are 1-1 in those games and the Ravens 1-2.

The Browns play the Packers on Christmas Day in Lambeau Field followed by games at Pittsburgh on Jan. 3 and at home against the Bengals on Jan. 9.

Cleveland came in as winners of 9 of 11 including five in a row the longest active streak in the East. They also came to Milwaukee rested and boasting a defense that was second in opponent points per game (101.5) and defensive rating (103.6). They were however without starters Evan Mobley (13.8 points 8.3 rebounds) and Isaac Okoro (9.3 points) due to the league’s health and safety protocol.

Milwaukee on the other hand was playing its fifth game in seven days (and the second of a back-to-back) and its third straight with only 10 players available. Among the seven players unavailable were starters Giannis Antetokounmpo and Bobby Portis (health and safety) along with Khris Middleton (left knee hyperextension).

Then just before tipoff the Bucks announced that Jrue Holiday Grayson Allen and Pat Connaughton would not start.

So once the teams did take the hardwood the Bucks couldn’t make up for such lopsided accounting in a 119-90 loss.

Box score:Cavaliers 119 Bucks 90

Connaughton would play for the Bucks but just 19 minutes off the bench as head coach Mike Budenholzer elected to go to with an eight-man lineup. Two-way rookies Javonte Smart and Sandro Mamukelashvili second-year guard Jordan Nwora and veterans George Hill and DeMarcus Cousins started while Semi Ojeleye and Thanasis Antetokounmpo returned from calf injuries to contribute some time.

Holiday and Allen did not play.

“Those guys have played a lot” Budenholzer said. “I was to think if it would be like the bullpen analogy we went with a bullpen game and then we never got to the high leverage innings. Those guys have given us so much including (Friday) night. They really really laid it out. The whole group did. They did again tonight. So just trying to be big picture. Grayson’s a little bit under the weather but proud of the guys that played. They really competed.”

Even when the Bucks had their full complement of players in a tough eight-point win over the Cavaliers on Dec. 6 the Bucks had problems with the Cleveland bench trio of Kevin Love Ricky Rubio and Cedi Osman and that was the case again Saturday. Osman had a team-high 23 points on 8 of 12 shooting while Rubio had 15 points 10 assists and three steals. Love added 15 points seven rebounds and four assists.

Darius Garland (22) and Jared Allen (14) were the only Cleveland starters to reach double figures.

Cleveland inched ahead of Milwaukee into third place in the East at 19-12 overall while the Bucks dropped to 19-13. They are 2-4 when Antetokounmpo doesn’t play and 6-11 if one or more of the Big Three of Antetokounmpo Holiday and Middleton are absent.

Nwora led the Bucks with 28 points on 11 of 21 shooting including 4-for-8 from behind the three-point line. He also recorded his second straight double-double by pulling down 11 rebounds.

“It’s good – I get to learn grow with my teammates that are out there with me and have fun” Nwora said. “I wish we could’ve won the game but it was good to be out there get reps against a good Cleveland team.”

Mamukelashvili had 17 points and Hill had 14.

Cousins played a season-high 27 minutes and had a double-double with 12 points on 4 of 11 shooting and 12 rebounds. He also had four steals and four turnovers.

""Just getting that feel the rhythm of finding my shots throughout the offense of getting used to taking those shots and being able to knock down those shots I think I got a good opportunity tonight"" Cousins said of the importance of extended minutes. ""Obviously a lot of shots didn't fall but as I said it's part of the process. I'm confident in my ability I'm confident I'll be able to find my rhythm eventually. So I'll just keep pushing forward.""

Milwaukee used a 19-6 run over five minutes that bridged the end of the third and the start of the fourth quarter to trim a 30-point deficit to 97-80 on a Mamukelashvili three with 8:58 to go but Garland put a halt to that momentum by picking Mamukelashvili’s pocket and turning it into a basket for Markkanen. Dean Wade then followed with a three to put Cleveland back up comfortably 103-80 with 7:13 to go.

The Bucks never got within 20 again.

The Cavaliers were finally able to distance themselves from the Bucks in the third quarter using a 19-2 run midway through to turn a 72-59 lead into a 91-61 advantage. The bench scored 17 of those points.

“They made threes is what it felt like"" Budenholzer said of that key stretch. ""It felt like Osman – really the whole night but that stretch – made a few threes and Love the same thing the whole stretch made some threes. Rubio is just kind of setting the table and mixing in a couple threes. He’s just a really smart player. All three of those guys I think just smart kind of see and feel the court in a good way and they were able to go on a nice run.”

The Bucks managed to get it down to 93-69 by the end of the quarter thanks to an 8-2 run capped by an Ojeleye three-pointer with 40 seconds left.

Ojeleye played for the first time since Nov. 15 logging 18 minutes. He went 1 for 7 from the floor for three points and pulled down seven rebounds.

Milwaukee looked to be in danger of watching Cleveland run away with the game in the first half after the Cavaliers went up 42-24 early in the second quarter but the Bucks rallied to stay connected and trailed 62-51 at the break.

It took the Bucks almost 2½ minutes to get up their first shot of the second quarter once they began the frame with five turnovers and they didn’t score until the 8:59 mark. But the Cavaliers only managed to stretch a 14-point first-quarter lead to 18. The Bucks used a 15-7 run to get back within shouting distance at 49-39 at the 4:06 mark a stretch fueled by Hill (four points two assists) and Cousins (five points). The Cavaliers lead yo-yoed between 10 and 14 points the rest of the way.

Nwora led the Bucks with 16 points while Cousins had 10 points seven rebounds four steals and three turnovers in the first half. Osman came off the bench to lead the Cavaliers with 15 points at the break making 3 of 4 three-pointers. Garland had 14 points and Rubio added nine point and six assists.

Cleveland shot 53.3% (24-for-45) from the field in the first half and scored 11 points off 10 Milwaukee turnovers. The Bucks shot 41.7% (20-for-48) from the field.

The backup Bucks started the game strong taking a 15-11 lead when Cousins hit a three at the 6:47 mark of the first quarter but the Cavaliers were bolstered by Osman Rubio and Kevin Love off the bench to outscore the Bucks 23-5 the rest of the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvbHN1LzIwMjEvMTIvMTkvZWZ0b24tcmVpZC1sb29rLWxzdS10aWdlcnMtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1jZW50ZXIvODk1NzU3MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Efton Reid: A look at the LSU Tigers basketball center,"Efton Reid: A look at the LSU Tigers men's basketball center

WWE has announced two segments for Monday's RAW from the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee WI.

Bobby Lashley and MVP will be on Monday's RAW to address why Lashley fought his way into the WWE Title match at the upcoming WWE Day 1 pay-per-view to make it a Fatal 4 Way with Seth Rollins Kevin Owens and WWE Champion Big E.

WWE wrote in their official RAW preview ""Bobby Lashley ran the gauntlet defeating Kevin Owens Seth Rollins and WWE Champion Big E in three separate singles matches to earn a spot in the WWE Championship Match at Day 1. The perceived disrespect at the exclusion of The All Mighty from the WWE Title hunt set off a chain of events that led to WWE Officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville giving Lashley the unique opportunity. After taking advantage of KO and Rollins' attempted schemes Lashley was able to turn Day 1's Triple Threat Match into a Fatal 4-Way by defeating Big E (thanks to an assist from MVP) in The All Mighty's third match of the night. With the WWE Championship now in his sights at Day 1 what does Lashley have to say to his future opponents? Tune in Monday night on Raw at 8/7 C on USA to find out!""

RAW will also feature the return of The Cutting Edge hosted by WWE Hall of Famer Edge. His special guest will be Maryse.

Edge and The Miz have been feuding for a few weeks now and will do battle at WWE Day 1. This week's RAW saw Maryse walk out on The Miz after he tried to use her as a shield during an in-ring fight with Edge.

WWE noted in their RAW preview ""The Miz is not the only one with the 'most must-see talk show in WWE' as Edge returns to host 'The Cutting Edge' with special guest Maryse! The Rated-R Superstar will hear from Maryse just weeks before squaring off with her husband The Miz at Day 1. Edge will look to find out what is going on between Maryse and The Miz after she slapped The A-Lister for using her as a shield to hide from Edge's attack last week. Hear all the drama and find out if it will have any effect on Day 1's match between Edge and The Miz this Monday night on Raw at 8/7 C on USA.""

There have been rumors on WWE Hall of Famer Beth Phoenix getting involved in the Edge vs. Miz feud to set up a potential tag team bout with couple vs. couple but there's no word on if WWE is moving in that direction.

Stay tuned for more on Monday's RAW episode. Below is a promo for the show:

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports

An interesting part of the rise of the transaction newsbreaker (including ESPN figures like Adrian Wojnarowski Adam Schefter and Jeff Passan as well as other people like Stadium/The Athletic’s Shams Charania and NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport) is how many athletes in particular even seem to ascribe status to news on them coming from one of those particular sources. The latest case there comes from Milwaukee Bucks’ forward Bobby Portis (seen above during a Dec. 4 game against the Miami Heat) who was placed on the NBA COVID-19 health and safety protocol list Thursday. That was reported both nationally (by Charania and others) and locally but it didn’t draw a particular tweet from Wojnarowski. And Portis noted that Saturday:

Damn Woj ain’t even report me being in health and safety protocol that’s tough 😩🤣🙃 — Bobby BP Portis (@BPortistime) December 18 2021

For his part Wojnarowski had a pretty good response:

Sorry People's Champ. Get out soon. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) December 18 2021

This shouldn’t be seen as a big issue. Obviously an individual insider does not tweet every single transaction that happens in their league. And whether an individual insider covers a particular move is not necessarily about the significance of the move; often they’ll relay smaller things that they managed to get before anyone else but won’t bother to repeat mid-range stories that are already out there. (They usually wind up at least tweeting about the really big stories even if they didn’t break them but not necessarily the middle ones.) And Portis’ move to the list did draw plenty of national and local coverage so it’s not like no one noted it and his tweet reads like more of a funny note than a real grievance against ESPN or Wojnarowski.

With that said though there is an interesting thing to consider here from the status side. Notable news about athletes has value which is part of why all these insiders are prominent (and of course they do much more than transactions but transactions are a significant part of their role). That’s also part of why outlets like The Players’ Tribune have found success in getting big athlete news out there (although they’re usually more focused on first-person perspectives) and why schools have teamed with them for different approaches than the standard press release and it’s part of why some athletes just break their own news on Twitter.

But the Portis commentary here illustrates the value at least some of these people see in having the top insiders talk about them. That helps explain why they don’t just tweet all their news themselves. And it also helps add some context to reports about Woj allegedly sending a pitchdeck on his social media clout versus competitors to potential sources. Portis’ news here was covered by Shams but not by Woj and he seems not entirely thrilled with that outcome. So maybe he and/or his agent need to take a look at that pitchdeck.

How much will a fully loaded Mach-E set you back?

The high-end Ford Mustang Mach-E is known as the GT and it offers a motor that produces up to 480 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque which is pretty impressive for an EV.

While the Select could only reach a range of 230 miles the GT will get you farther with its extended range capabilities. You can expect to cruise for around 270 miles in the GT trim before having to stop for a charge.

The Mach-E GT also clearly has the Select beat when it comes to acceleration power. It can reach 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds. (Additionally the Performance Edition GT can achieve this feat in even less time clocking in at 3.5 seconds).

All of these perks come with a hefty price tag of course. The MSRP for the Mustang Mach-E GT is just under $62000. While that’s more affordable than some luxury EVs on the market it’s still steep for many consumers.

What are the prices of the Ford Mustang Mach-E’s EV competitors?

If you’re in the market for a new EV you’ll want to shop around before you decide that the Ford Mustang Mach-E is the car for you. Other options you might want to consider include the Hyundai Kona EV the Chevy Bolt EUV the Kia Niro EV and the Volkswagen ID.4. So how do these vehicles compare to the Mustang Mach-E when it comes to MSRP?

The Hyundai Kona EV is an interesting case when it comes to pricing. As Kelley Blue Book notes the 2022 model starts at $34000 for the basic SEL trim. This is actually $3000 less than the 2021 Kona EV went for.

Also going down in price for 2022 is the Chevy Bolt EUV. The Bolt EUV LT’s base model has an MSRP of $33000 plus a $995 destination charge. The higher-end Bolt EUV Premiere meanwhile starts at $37500.

A little higher on the pricing scale is the 2022 Kia Niro EV a crossover SUV which starts at $39900. However it’s still more affordable than the Mustang Mach-E if you’re not quite sure you want to shell out the dough needed for Ford’s new EV.

Finally there’s the Volkswagen ID.4 which in 2021 also started at just under $40000. So all of these alternatives to the Mustang Mach-E are somewhat more affordable but only you can decide whether they offer everything you want in your EV.

Whatever EV you decide on make sure to take advantage of any federal state or local tax breaks rebates and other financial incentives for your purchase. Buying an EV can often be a great financial choice for reasons beyond just fuel savings."

The Daily Beast broke the story about Johnston’s removal from the show citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. According to the site’s report the ban came from “top staff” on the series however they’re trying to keep his removal quiet and not make “a big deal” about his absence.

Johnston’s alleged involvement in the event came to light publicly last March after the FBI released photos of individuals who “took part in the violence” at the U.S. Capitol. Johnston’s pics are available online as suspect #247–AFO (Assault on Federal Officer):

While Johnston has not publicly confirmed his attendance nor has he been arrested numerous colleagues have identified him as a participant in the riot. Cassandra Church who worked with Johnston on Harmontown wrote on Twitter “I’m no detective but I do know Jay. He said he was there. And that’s him in the picture. So…” Another Harmontown colleague Spencer Crittenden stated in a now-deleted tweet that Johnston is “also a craven Trump supporter and was there at the time.” Tim & Eric’s Tim Heidecker also “fully confirmed through reliable sources” that Johnston was present at the riot.

Johnston has not appeared in the current season 12 of Bob’s Burgers. His other voice acting credits in animated series include Rick and Morty Mary Shelley’s Frankenhole and Moral Orel the latter of which he also directed and produced. His onscreen credits include Better Call Saul Arrested Development The Sarah Silverman Program and Mr. Show with Bob and David.

Bob’s Burgers is co-produced aired by and animated by subsidiaries of Fox Corporation which also owns Fox News Channel a primary source of right-wing disinformation.

Fox Corporation has continued to produce fabricated claims and conspiracy theories about the riots including a recent three-part film called Patriot Purge that suggests January 6 was a “false flag” operation by the U.S. government to hurt conservatives. Two right-wing Fox News contributors Stephen Hayes and Jonah Goldberg quit the network in the fallout from that series.

We all have a purpose in life. Some of us never find it. Michelle and Eric Smith found theirs in a Jacksonville North Carolina coffee shop that sits several hundred feet from where many of the storied Montford Point Marines are buried. When the wife and husband team began Brewed Downtown nine years ago and gradually built it up into a solid business they could not have foreseen that they would one day be hit by a pandemic a supply chain crisis inflation and the ever-expanding corporate machine.

What kept Michelle and Eric going was not money though they certainly needed to earn enough to maintain a lifestyle Michelle described as ""not poor but not middle class either."" Perhaps working Americans is the best way to describe them and what kept them moving forward was community.

I have to admit that I had become jaded with that word. I have lived in Los Angeles for the past 25 years and the hardest thing to find there or in other urban areas is a community or even a sense of one. Most of the businesses lining the streets where I live are corporate-owned and their windows are often covered in ads trying to entice the dollar out of my pocket and into theirs.

However when I walked into Brewed Downtown for the first time there was a sense of Déjà vu as Michelle rolled up to me on her mobility scooter and greeted me with a mug of freshly brewed coffee that hit the spot. Customers stumbled in sleep still in their eyes and they were greeted by their names. As Eric made breakfast in the kitchen conversations were picked up from where they were left off last time.

FOX BUSINESS POLL: VOTERS THINK BIDEN IS MAKING INFLATION WORSE

I felt like I was back at my old coffeehouse job in Monterey where I worked the night shift as a teenager. Most of my customers were Army personnel from nearby Fort Ord and I had gotten to know them quite well. It reached the point where I looked forward to my shifts so I could continue my conversations or debates with them. That job had become my community and sadly that job business and community disappeared overnight when President Clinton shuttered Fort Ord.

Michelle confided to me that she feared the business could not survive both the supply chain crisis and inflation. When the pandemic hit Brewed Downtown was one of the few businesses to remain open. Workers pumped food out through the drive-thru window to their thankful regulars.

After many months Michelle and Eric thought they had seen the worst. Then the supply chain crisis hit them hard. Still Michelle managed finding substitutions wherever possible. She was determined not to cut items from the menu since her regulars had their favorites but eventually it was slimmed down.

WATCH:

Then the prices began to rise on everything. She used to order 500 cups for about $50. Several weeks ago that price rose to $148. The same thing went for lids straws napkins flavored syrups coffee beans and all the food items that filled the fridge and pantry.

As the days went by and the prices continued to rise without respite Michelle and Eric saw their bottom line dipping into the red. How could they reverse it? They inched up the prices several cents but 85% of their customers are Marines who make ""next to nothing."" Michelle knows the life of service well; she is a Navy veteran herself.

Then the bottom dropped out. Last August she received a phone call from her sales representative at US Foods informing her that the company would no longer be able to service her business. The representative said that only the top 35% of all accounts would continue to receive shipments. In other words corporate America got theirs while small businesses were left to fend for themselves.

The sales representative told Michelle it was not personal. A fighter by nature Michelle tried not to take it personally but she couldn’t help it. She told me US Foods got its start with small businesses and grew on the back of small businesses to become the behemoth it is today. Michelle felt burned by the disloyalty after ordering from the company for 50 weeks every year for nine years straight.

Michelle and Eric did not hang their heads for long since the only thing they know how to do is work and be kind to other folks. They began grocery store runs extending their work day by several hours and buying items for the same prices as the rest of us. Their bottom line dipped further into the red.

BIDEN DEMOCRATS AND CHINA ARE TO BLAME FOR AMERICA'S STAGFLATION MESS

To make matters even worse when they turned on their television in the evenings they heard leaders who were either tone deaf or far removed from the struggles of small businesses across America. President Biden who prides his Scranton working-class roots announced that the Port of Los Angeles would be open an extra 60 hours a week to ease the supply chain crisis when it was already running 24 hours a day for seven days a week. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg blamed the lack of workers on the lack of child care ignoring the fact there was a child care issue before the pandemic and people still went to work. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen repeatedly minimized the threat of inflation even as prices continued to rise before her very own eyes.

When I asked Michelle how she was going to survive her eyes welled up. She did not speak of herself or her husband or the business. She spoke of the community. She told me about the woman that came in with a disturbed look on her face. When Michelle asked what was wrong the woman revealed that she had been told that she had cancer would need to have both breasts removed and only had a 17% chance of surviving. Michelle then told me of the teenage girl who was so shy that she rarely spoke to anyone. Yet for some reason she felt comfortable enough with Michelle to visit nearly every day for lunch and conversation. There were many more stories that Michelle told me stories made possible because of the community that she and Eric created.

The thing that I liked about Michelle and Eric is that they don’t live with their heads in the clouds. They know that many people would tell them to just quit the business and give up. But quitting is one thing they do not know how to do and one only has to look into Michelle’s past to understand why.

Before she graduated from high school in Reno Nevada she joined the Navy. Her brother had tragically died from cancer a few years before and her parents were in massive debt due to medical bills. Michelle told them to take the college money they saved for her and her brother and pay off the bills. She would go into the Navy and make her own way in the world.

She worked every day of her life except for maternity leave. Even a motorcycle accident that led to the eventual amputation of her leg could not stop her. She and Eric found themselves working for a corporation for years and like many fellow small business owners they decided to take a chance on themselves their American Dream. They knew they wanted to be near the beach and a military base and they made their home in Jacksonville. Michelle told me she loves her town without reservation and cannot imagine herself anywhere else.

Before I left Brewed Downtown to fly home Michelle gave me a long and emotional hug. Eric gave me a firm handshake that said it all. I was leaving two good friends and that is a testament to their character. When I returned to Los Angeles I drove by my regular Starbucks and stopped at the small coffee shop that I had driven by countless times. The owner an Argentinian woman made me a cup of coffee nearly as good as Michelle’s. What struck me was the pride that she showed in her coffee and the interest that she showed in her customers. These people make communities possible. We have lost many of these folks over the years especially the last few. The loss to the fabric of our society will be profound if we allow more of these working Americans to fall by the wayside.

Customers stumbled in sleep still in their eyes and they were greeted by their names. As Eric made breakfast in the kitchen conversations were picked up from where they were left off last time.

FOX BUSINESS POLL: VOTERS THINK BIDEN IS MAKING INFLATION WORSE

I felt like I was back at my old coffeehouse job in Monterey where I worked the night shift as a teenager. Most of my customers were Army personnel from nearby Fort Ord and I had gotten to know them quite well. It reached the point where I looked forward to my shifts so I could continue my conversations or debates with them. That job had become my community and sadly that job business and community disappeared overnight when President Clinton shuttered Fort Ord.

Michelle confided to me that she feared the business could not survive both the supply chain crisis and inflation. When the pandemic hit Brewed Downtown was one of the few businesses to remain open. Workers pumped food out through the drive-thru window to their thankful regulars.

After many months Michelle and Eric thought they had seen the worst. Then the supply chain crisis hit them hard. Still Michelle managed finding substitutions wherever possible. She was determined not to cut items from the menu since her regulars had their favorites but eventually it was slimmed down.

WATCH:

Then the prices began to rise on everything. She used to order 500 cups for about $50. Several weeks ago that price rose to $148. The same thing went for lids straws napkins flavored syrups coffee beans and all the food items that filled the fridge and pantry.

As the days went by and the prices continued to rise without respite Michelle and Eric saw their bottom line dipping into the red. How could they reverse it? They inched up the prices several cents but 85% of their customers are Marines who make ""next to nothing."" Michelle knows the life of service well; she is a Navy veteran herself.

Then the bottom dropped out. Last August she received a phone call from her sales representative at US Foods informing her that the company would no longer be able to service her business. The representative said that only the top 35% of all accounts would continue to receive shipments. In other words corporate America got theirs while small businesses were left to fend for themselves.

The sales representative told Michelle it was not personal. A fighter by nature Michelle tried not to take it personally but she couldn’t help it. She told me US Foods got its start with small businesses and grew on the back of small businesses to become the behemoth it is today. Michelle felt burned by the disloyalty after ordering from the company for 50 weeks every year for nine years straight.

Michelle and Eric did not hang their heads for long since the only thing they know how to do is work and be kind to other folks. They began grocery store runs extending their work day by several hours and buying items for the same prices as the rest of us. Their bottom line dipped further into the red.

BIDEN DEMOCRATS AND CHINA ARE TO BLAME FOR AMERICA'S STAGFLATION MESS

To make matters even worse when they turned on their television in the evenings they heard leaders who were either tone deaf or far removed from the struggles of small businesses across America. President Biden who prides his Scranton working-class roots announced that the Port of Los Angeles would be open an extra 60 hours a week to ease the supply chain crisis when it was already running 24 hours a day for seven days a week. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg blamed the lack of workers on the lack of child care ignoring the fact there was a child care issue before the pandemic and people still went to work. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen repeatedly minimized the threat of inflation even as prices continued to rise before her very own eyes.

When I asked Michelle how she was going to survive her eyes welled up. She did not speak of herself or her husband or the business. She spoke of the community. She told me about the woman that came in with a disturbed look on her face. When Michelle asked what was wrong the woman revealed that she had been told that she had cancer would need to have both breasts removed and only had a 17% chance of surviving. Michelle then told me of the teenage girl who was so shy that she rarely spoke to anyone. Yet for some reason she felt comfortable enough with Michelle to visit nearly every day for lunch and conversation. There were many more stories that Michelle told me stories made possible because of the community that she and Eric created.

The thing that I liked about Michelle and Eric is that they don’t live with their heads in the clouds. They know that many people would tell them to just quit the business and give up. But quitting is one thing they do not know how to do and one only has to look into Michelle’s past to understand why.

Before she graduated from high school in Reno Nevada she joined the Navy. Her brother had tragically died from cancer a few years before and her parents were in massive debt due to medical bills. Michelle told them to take the college money they saved for her and her brother and pay off the bills. She would go into the Navy and make her own way in the world.

She worked every day of her life except for maternity leave. Even a motorcycle accident that led to the eventual amputation of her leg could not stop her. She and Eric found themselves working for a corporation for years and like many fellow small business owners they decided to take a chance on themselves their American Dream. They knew they wanted to be near the beach and a military base and they made their home in Jacksonville. Michelle told me she loves her town without reservation and cannot imagine herself anywhere else.

Before I left Brewed Downtown to fly home Michelle gave me a long and emotional hug. Eric gave me a firm handshake that said it all. I was leaving two good friends and that is a testament to their character. When I returned to Los Angeles I drove by my regular Starbucks and stopped at the small coffee shop that I had driven by countless times. The owner an Argentinian woman made me a cup of coffee nearly as good as Michelle’s. What struck me was the pride that she showed in her coffee and the interest that she showed in her customers. These people make communities possible. We have lost many of these folks over the years especially the last few. The loss to the fabric of our society will be profound if we allow more of these working Americans to fall by the wayside.

Many believe that Islamic financial products are only suited to Muslim savers. They are wrong though as they are not designed to exclude others. Instead these products offer a different approach.

“Islamic banking is a credible alternative to conventional banking. It is a principle-based approach to banking based on Islamic law which is available to anyone irrespective of their faith” says Mohamed Naeem Ebrahim the head of retail at FNB Islamic Banking.

More non-Muslim savers are being drawn in by the Islamic products. Old Mutual points out that 25% of its sharia investments come from non-Muslim investors.

READ: Banks looks to take advantage of growing interest in Islamic finance on the continent

“Our sharia funds are open to Muslim and non-Muslim investors” says Maahir Jakoet portfolio manager at Old Mutual Investment Group.

“The Old Mutual Albaraka Shari’ah Funds are also aimed at anyone who wants to manage their wealth in a way that is consciously ethical by aligning their investments with their values and beliefs without sacrificing returns.”

SHARIA FINANCE DEFINED

But what exactly is sharia finance and why should these products be considered?

According to the Banking Association SA Islamic finance is based on four main principles: the prohibition of interest ethics that prohibit investment in unlawful businesses transparency and equitable sharing of risk and reward primarily through the use of profit- and loss-sharing contracts.

Simply put these products do not offer interest in the traditional sense as most would understand it and they will not trade the shares of companies that deal in the production of weapons alcohol gambling and pornography for instance.

READ: Standard Bank’s Shari’ah Banking wins at the 2021 Global Islamic Finance Awards

Instead they tend to invest in private equity deals property and exchange-traded funds. To adhere to the principles Islamic scholars are consulted about investment decisions.

A SHAKY START

Islamic finance had a shaky start in South Africa. Jaame Limited was the first Islamic bank to launch locally in 1980 but it was soon liquidated due to financial difficulties.

However there are now several established providers offering Islamic banking and investment products including Old Mutual Absa FNB Franklin Templeton Momentum and Al Baraka Bank.

The products on offer vary. Investors can choose from transactional accounts Islamic term deposit accounts savings accounts sharia-compliant funds and bonds (sukuk) from the likes of Franklin Templeton.

“Sukuk – bonds that are sharia compliant – have continued to steadily make their way into the financial mainstream. This is because they can exhibit characteristics of lower volatility greater diversification stronger risk-adjusted returns and higher yields than developed market bonds” explains Mohieddine Kronfol lead portfolio manager of the Franklin Global Sukuk Fund.

Companies are constantly looking to expand their product offering. Old Mutual for instance offers three funds to investors which include the Old Mutual Albaraka Balanced Fund the Old Mutual Albaraka Equity Fund and the Old Mutual Albaraka Income Fund and it also has plans to launch a Global Islamic Fund.

READ: Eskom may borrow R1bn through a JSE-listed Sukuk eight years after first floating the idea

There are even sharia-compliant insurance products on offer (takaful). Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance in which members contribute money to a pool system to effectively protect others against loss or damage.

DO THESE PRODUCTS OFFER A GOOD RETURN?

For the most part the sharia principles will stop your money from gaining exposure to riskier stocks. This some feel is a disadvantage – particularly if you’re wanting to get good returns in a short time.

However these investment principles have proved to be significantly advantageous in that they generally avoid financial meltdowns and scandal-hit businesses and as a result offer a more solid stable “return”.

“At Old Mutual our investment approach incorporates the higher purposes and objectives of Islamic law by actively incorporating environmental social and governance (ESG) principles and the UN sustainable development goals and by sharing common values with the higher objectives of Islamic law – which among other things seeks the preservation and protection of life resources and the environment” says Jakoet.

Kronfol adds:

Over the past 12 years we have had a number of stressful environments including the 2008 financial crisis emerging market sell-offs Brexit and oil market setbacks and yet the sukuk asset class has continued to generally outperform its conventional peers.

A MATURE MARKET?

These days investors have a better choice of products than those who were considering Islamic finance back in the 1980s.

It has become easier to compare products as the main players all display their product information and fund fact sheets online.

If they’re still confusing many financial planners are now well versed in these products too and can offer advice to investors on the most suitable ones for their portfolios.

But despite the maturity of Islamic finance in the broader South African market the product range still has some way to go before offering a similar variety to conventional banking and investment products.

But this is changing. The ESG principles are becoming a major focus as the world tries to attain net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

As more Islamic products are added to the market it’s becoming increasingly difficult to argue that they do not deserve a place in most households’ portfolios.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A report by German technology site Winfuture shows the supposed images of the Garmin Fenix 7 series Venu 2 Plus Epix Gen2 and Instinct 2 series smartwatches.

The post shows that the Fenix 7 series may consist of three models: the standard Fenix 7 7S and 7X all of which are rumored to be made of both reinforced plastic and stainless steel. At least one model will carry over the built-in solar panel from the top-end Fenix 6 that charges the device while you’re wearing it while others will include the familiar tracking features. It appears that the base model will only come in black while the Fenix 7S may have an all-white variation as well as an option that has a rose gold frame with an off-white band. Winfuture doesn’t provide any additional details on the rumored 7X.

The Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round and comes with new health tracking features

Also included in the post is the Epix Gen2. Garmin originally debuted the Epix smartwatch in 2015 and unlike its predecessor the leaked images show that the Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round. The Epix Gen2 looks to have built-in GPS like the original along with features new to the Epix line of watches including a blood oxygen sensor heart rate monitor and sleep tracking capabilities.

Images of the Instinct 2 and 2S show that the watches may have retained the same rugged look that the original Instinct had when it was first released in 2018. Winfuture claims the watches use an e-ink display that allows the device to conserve battery life and also comes with features that track your heart rate steps and sleep. The white variation of the base Instinct smartwatch appears to have an integrated solar panel. However it remains unclear what the differences are between the 2 and 2S but it’s possible that the 2S is the smaller of the two. The same can be said for the Fenix 7 and 7S considering that the previously-released Fenix 6S and Fenix 5S models have smaller displays.

The Venu 2 Plus seems to have an additional third button that the standard model doesn’t have

Lastly Winfuture shows us more of what appears to be the Venu 2 Plus. Leaked images of this smartwatch have already been floating around the internet and the images here only corroborate what the initial leak shows. The device is rumored to have both black and white variations as well as come with an OLED display. It also seems to have an additional third button that the standard Venu 2 doesn’t have but it’s unclear what it may be for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9nYXJtaW4tdmVudS0yLXBsdXMtc21hcnR3YXRjaC1hcHBlYXJzLWFnYWluLWluLWxlYWtlZC1pbWFnZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Venu 2 Plus smartwatch appears again in leaked images,"Having been hugely impressed by the Garmin Venu 2 we're very much looking forward to what Garmin does next with this series – and it's looking increasingly likely that what will be coming next is the Venu 2 Plus.

Well-known and usually reliable tipster @evleaks has posted leaked images of the upcoming Garmin Venu 2 Plus smartwatch images which look as though they're official device renders produced by Garmin itself.

You may remember that back in November an image supposedly showing the Venu 2 Plus appeared on Garmin's own support site. It was quickly taken down but it tipped us off to the idea that a follow-up to the Venu 2 was on the way.

Garmin Venu 2 Plus pic.twitter.com/P4gFFvaTXdDecember 17 2021

As with the previous leak there isn't much that's new in terms of design when it comes to the Venu 2 Plus. However there does appear to be a third physical button on the side of the casing which some have suggested could be used to launch a digital assistant.

The Venu 2 story so far

We don't know too much else about the Garmin Venu 2 Plus at this stage but considering the nomenclature that Garmin is going with here we're assuming that there isn't going to be a massive amount of difference from the original Venu 2.

The Garmin Venu 2 offers all the basics you would expect from a smartwatch plus numerous advanced features to appeal to fitness enthusiasts and runners in particular – there's super-accurate GPS and the Garmin Coach app for example.

As with most Garmin watches the Venu 2 is available with a choice of strap colors and case sizes and starts at $399.99 / £349.99 / AU$629. If a Venu 2 Plus is indeed on the horizon expect those prices to jump up slightly.

Opinion: smartwatches deserve digital assistants

The Apple Watch 7. (Image credit: TechRadar)

As impressive as Garmin's wide range of smartwatches are there's one key feature they lack: an on-board digital assistant. That puts them at something of a disadvantage compared with competing models like the Apple Watch 7 (with Siri) and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 (with Google Assistant).

A third physical button on the casing for the Venu 2 Plus suggests that this might be about to change. It's possible that Garmin could add its own digital assistant to the watch – or at least enable voice commands for launching features on the device.

Smartwatches have relatively tiny screens making them difficult to operate by hand. What's more they're often being used while our hands are busy whether that's lugging shopping around or trying to propel ourselves to a new personal best.

That's where voice commands come in: being able to stop and start run tracking for example or get a current heart rate reading using a voice command would make the Garmin Venu 2 Plus an appealing prospect (and the feature would then no doubt roll out to other Garmin smartwatches too).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ2FybWluLTIwMjItc21hcnR3YXRjaC1saW5ldXAtd2hhdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin's 2022 Smartwatch Lineup Looks Gorgeous,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ2FybWluLTIwMjItc21hcnR3YXRjaC1saW5ldXAtd2hhdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9nYXJtaW5fdmVudV8yX3BsdXNfZXBpeF9nZW4yX2Zlbml4XzdfaW5zdGluY3RfMl9sZWFrZWRfcmVuZGVycy1uZXdzLTUyMzUxLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massive leak reveals Garmin's new Venu Epix Fenix and Instinct series smartwatches,"Garmin unveiled the Venu 2 and Venu 2S smartwatches in April and we know a Plus variant exists since we saw its leaked image last month revealing the design color options and a few features. Now a massive leak by WinFuture reveals Garmin is planning to introduce more than one smartwatch since the publication posted over three dozen official-looking images of the Epix Gen2 Fenix 7 Fenix 7S Instinct 2 and Instinct 2S in addition to the Venu 2 Plus we've already seen.

Garmin Epix Gen2

The Garmin Epix Gen2 will have an in-built GPS like the original Epix and come with an altimeter and the standard set of health and fitness features including heart rate monitoring sleep tracking and blood oxygen saturation monitoring.



Garmin Epix Gen2

The Epix Gen2 is made of fiberglass-reinforced polycarbonate and 316L stainless steel. It's MIL-STD-810 certified and is water-resistant up to 100 meters.

The leaked images reveal the smartwatch has a total of five buttons - three on the left and two on the right flanking two holes.



Garmin Epix Gen2

Garmin Fenix 7 Fenix 7S and Fenix 7X

The Fenix 7 series includes the vanilla S and X models. All of them come with the usual health and fitness features. They are made of 316L stainless steel and some variants will come integrated with solar panels to charge the battery when you are under the sun.



Garmin Fenix 7

We don't know what the Fenix 7X will look like but the pictures of the vanilla 7 and 7S shared by the publication tell us the former will arrive in the 47mm size and the latter in 42mm. Both are water-resistant up to 100 meters and MIL-STD-810 rated.



Garmin Fenix 7S

However while the Fenix 7 and the rest of the 7S color models have ""Power Glass"" ingrained on their back covers the white version of the 7S has ""Fiber-Reinforced Polymer"" written suggesting different builds.



Garmin Fenix 7S

That said like the Epix Gen2 the Fenix 7 and Fenix 7S also have a total of five buttons each.

Garmin Instinct 2 and Instinct 2S

The Instinct 2 and Instinct 2S feature in-built GPS and come with heart rate monitoring step counter and sleep counter in addition to other activity tracking features. However both smartwatches pack e-ink displays for longer battery life between the charges.



Garmin Instinct 2

The Garmin Instinct 2 also has MIL-STD-810 certification and its grey-ish color model packs a solar panel so that its battery can be charged when under the sun.



Garmin Instinct 2

Like the Epix and Fenix series smartwatches the Instinct 2 watches also have a total of five buttons each.



Garmin Instinct 2S

Garmin Venu 2 Plus

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus' screen tells us it will feature a step counter and heart rate monitor. However the rear side of the smartwatch reveals even more features including 50-meter water resistance and in-built GPS/multi-GNSS allowing smartphone-independent route tracking.

The smartwatch's display is covered with Gorilla Glass and the watch body is made of stainless steel. This particular model we are looking at is the 43mm version and it remains to be seen if there will be a smaller/bigger variant on offer.



Garmin Venu 2 Plus

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus' back cover also has ""Music"" ingrained suggesting it will have onboard storage for offline music playback.

You can also see that the Venu 2 Plus' strap has Quick Release 20 printed on it meaning it's 20mm wide and can be removed/replaced easily by the users.



Garmin Venu 2 Plus

In addition to these seven smartwatches Garmin is planning to announce the new color models of the Vivomove 3 Vivomove Sport and Approach S12. It's unclear when exactly the US-based company will unveil these smartwatches but since the official renders are already out it shouldn't be too long before Garmin introduces these wearables.

A telling moment came near the end of a recent Des Moines City Council discussion about plans to upgrade Principal Park the city-owned downtown baseball stadium where the minor league Iowa Cubs play.

The ballpark was rebuilt in the early 1990s back when it was called Sec Taylor Stadium in an expensive project that included the city borrowing money and suburbs chipping in since the Cubs attract visitors from throughout the region.

The precise terms of the financing 30 years back were escaping the current mayor the city manager the city attorney or the six City Council members. One man did have some specifics at his fingertips. That institutional memory resided with Sam Bernabe Iowa's general manager since 1986 who after coming to the lectern brought council members up to speed as they pondered spending plans for today's round of improvements.

More:Iowa Cubs to be sold to California-based sports-entertainment firm Endeavor

More:Minor league baseball owners wonder: Can Endeavor make investments in Iowa Cubs other teams pay off?

Bernabe's longevity is but one reflection of the uncommon stability the I-Cubs and central Iowa have mutually enjoyed. Des Moines' professional baseball history stretches back well over a century; the city has been host to a top-level farm club since 1969 and has been the Chicago Cubs' Triple-A affiliate since 1981. Even before Major League Baseball took over and overhauled the entire minor league structure last year teams frequently changed their affiliation their home cities and their ownership. But Des Moines has benefited from several constants for over 20 years: The Cubs one of the nation's best attendance figures and the Greater Des Moines Baseball Co. headlined by local businessman Michael Gartner.

A few weeks after Bernabe's recitation Gartner announced that the I-Cubs were being sold to Endeavor a California conglomerate that has its hands in a number of industries but is probably best known for owning UFC the mixed martial arts governing body. Endeavor also bought eight other baseball clubs and says it has its eyes on acquiring more.

So the upgrade plans for the team clubhouse facilities aren't the only things bringing change where the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers meet. Bernabe will remain general manager and the parties assure that fans should not expect big changes that will hurt their experience in going to games.

Endeavor's arrival nonetheless made some longtime patrons nervous. ""I think they've always done things the right way"" season ticket holder J.T. Nutt told the Register's Tommy Birch of the Gartner-led owners. ""I just hope the new ownership group continues to do the same.""

Endeavor's big plans seem to indicate that baseball will become the latest industry where owners seek to get big and use instantaneous communication to help take advantage of economies of scale. That could eventually mean thinner local staffs for such things as ticket sales and marketing. But perhaps Endeavor will see that location-specific quirks at concession stands and such promotions as Iowa's B-Bop's burger race are worth retaining.

No matter how attentive Endeavor executives are to local needs and tastes it's natural to feel some wistfulness about these sorts of evolutions. For baseball fans the feeling might even build on ambivalence about transformations in the game on the field — where balls hit in play have become scarce as smart people zero in on skills and practices that correlate with winning and players take extra time to focus on delivering faster pitches and swinging for the fences.

In the best scenario Endeavor will use its ownership of multiple teams to produce an influential independent voice with a better chance of bending Major League Baseball's ear than the cities and franchises who lost their affiliated professional teams last year or will struggle to meet league-imposed facilities requirements. Perhaps Endeavor can help persuade MLB to recognize the value to the big leagues of nurturing old and new fans through affordable visits to relaxing parks with compelling players on their way up.

In the worst scenario far-off owners eventually will try to hold Des Moines hostage with the threat of seeking greener pastures. (The lease agreement that the City Council will transfer to the new owners Monday keeps the I-Cubs at Principal Park through at least 2027.)

For now suburbs should join the city of Des Moines in exploring reasonable spending and private fundraising to support ballpark upgrades and as in any other offseason hunker down for the 114 days until the home opener.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXBvbGljZS1vZmZpY2VyLXNlcmlvdXNseS1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWNyYXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas police officer seriously injured in crash,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Authorities in Las Vegas report an officer was injured in a crash that occurred over the weekend.

More and more platforms that help businesses understand where their data came from and how to best use it are emerging to meet this need. Whether in no-code/low-code environments or highly sophisticated structures solutions that empower companies to organize their data and create the right data architecture for their business are going to be more important than ever in 2022.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDE1MTcvYWNoaWV2aW5nLW9wZXJhdGlvbmFsLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UuaHRtbNIBSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDE1MTcvYWNoaWV2aW5nLW9wZXJhdGlvbmFsLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Achieving Operational Resilience,"If the word “disruption” sounds familiar it’s because we’re living in one of the most volatile times in recent history. The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges for supply chains and third-party relationships which in turn has had a ripple effect on the market and an organization’s ability to provide products and services.

Recently two famous examples in Asia-Pacific alone have been highlighted by KPMG to demonstrate just how susceptible these supply chains can be to disruption: Some semi-conductor manufacturers will not return to full production capacity for two or three years creating new stresses for a wide range of technology-orientated industries. Furthermore a surge in demand for bicycles has results in part and equipment shortages across the region disrupting transportation networks.

By looking at the impact of this disruption we can see that operational resilience is imperative for organizations to prevent mass disruption. The good news is that it is achievable. It just means that as governance risk and compliance challenges are ever-changing the constant rise of new regulations also requires the implementation of a strong integrated risk management plan.

Why is Operational Resilience Needed?

According to Gartner operational resilience is defined as “initiatives that expand business continuity management programs to focus on the impacts connected risk appetite and tolerance levels for disruption of product or service delivery to internal and external stakeholders.”

So how did operational resilience suddenly become such a hot topic? The pandemic border tensions cyberattacks and operational failures have forced organizations to identify their most critical business services consider vulnerabilities that are broader than cyberattacks and IT failures and define a consistent approach to prevent adapt and respond. In essence operational resilience provides assurance to protect against various mishaps that can arise within an organization. And those threats such as the pandemic have made the construction of this framework even more vital.

Recently we’ve learned a lot about the way the world works under pressure. For one we need to be able to look at what processes used to work which ones are still useful and which ones are broken and need changed. The frequency of manual processes within businesses is continuing to shrink especially when considering the sheer number of organizations with a hybrid or work from home model. While these changes can seem overwhelming and maybe even uncomfortable to an extent it’s the root of what operational resilience is. Being able to pivot in times of change while displaying grit and determination will lead to positive adoptions when transformation is least expected. Small amounts of progress soon lead to large-scale noticeable change which will prove beneficial to an organization from top to bottom.

Achieving Operational Resilience Through Risk Management

One of the first steps in achieving a strong operational resilience plan is to understand the volume and velocity of interconnected risks that exists within the organization as well as third-party risks. Then the shift can be made to automated processes. Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has rocketed to the forefront for organizations that want to make their routine processes – whether its financial human resources marketing or otherwise – as efficient as possible. That being said human intelligence still does reign supreme especially when logical decisions are involved because of the direct proximity to the process at hand.

AI also allows for multiple risks to be managed simultaneously which becomes especially prevalent in times of chaos. In contrast a disorderly manual process to manage risks can lead to little or no progress.

Finding Stability in Times of Chaos

Speaking of managing multiple risks at the same time – what happens when conflicting regulatory priorities come to the surface? As noted by a report on the Asia-Pacific regulatory environment by Deloitte there are a large number of new and escalating regulatory challenges that organizations face: “Many of the themes have to do with resilience and sustainability” the report notes. “Respond with agility to a changing landscape; to weather market events with minimal service disruptions; and to work towards long-term sustainability of their business models. We also consider upcoming challenges presented by the application of new technologies and the looming threat of climate change.”

Because of this an organization is bound to face a dilemma when considering which regulation to sort through first. But not only do global companies need to constantly be aware of these regulations but a holistic view of regulatory requirements will uncover issues that were previously hidden. Once again AI can establish a common risk platform that leads to a singular number assessing an organization’s risk standpoint. Outside of AI regulatory priorities can be handled within boardrooms where executives can build practical solutions to manage risks while forming a consensus opinion on their risk management landscape.

Even when the best laid out risk management plan is thought-through several external threats can arise such as security breaches and ransomware attacks. While no risk management plan is inherently perfect a carefully-designed solution that is executed properly is the best form of crisis management for an organization.

Looking Ahead to the Future of Operational Resilience

An integrated risk management approach is key to achieving operational resilience regardless of what type of business you lead. As Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) solutions become more sophisticated data gradually moves from qualitative-based to quantitative. This means that information that was once complex and difficult to sort through is now easy to understand and to translate into action. Once again AI can only do so much on its own – people must retain active involvement in the risk management process. For example it is critical to engage the frontline as they are often your first line of defense. You need to equip them with the physical tools to adhere to all compliance and regulatory policies. Furthermore combining digital platforms with artificial intelligence allows risk leaders to interpret and learn from data highlight patterns and effect specific tasks and outcomes.

If it was not obvious by now a strong risk management solution is the backbone to being operationally resilient. With proper processes in place to mitigate and attack risks before they become a real threat the likelihood of chaos ensuing in the wake of a crisis becomes much less. The pandemic is just one example of how companies can get derailed when issues such as flaws in the supply chain arise.

Although the decisions involved in managing growing threats or potential attacks and compliance issues may seem overwhelming the truth is achieving operational resilience is not as far-reaching as organizations once envisioned. Integrated risk management becomes the key to achieving operational resilience and helping you turn volatility into order."

Brand should take a stand not offer platitudes

How consumers are interacting with social media (plus a newfound love for TikTok)

Email falling out of favor

Challenges are on the horizon for navigating the data tracking value exchange



Mean what you say but also say it at the right time and place





Written by Jeremy King - CEO and Founder of Attest.





The past couple of years have seen rapid shifts in consumer behavior. With the pandemic still rearing its head worldwide the unpredictability doesn’t show signs of stopping. For marketers 2022 will surely be another year that challenges their ability to get closer to the ever-changing consumer and find their next waves of growth. To better understand the tides of consumer sentiment as we head into the new year Attest went straight to the source to learn what’s top of mind for the American consumer in 2022 and how these priorities are shaping the digital marketing landscape.Marketers who want to appeal to American consumers in 2022 should be looking to tickle the nation's funny bone. While 2021 was all about motivational messaging and inspiration — understandable in highly uncertain times — Americans want brands to grab their attention and put a smile back on their face in the year ahead.When asked what three types of messaging would appeal to them most for Attest's 2022 US Consumer Trends Report  57% said they wanted brands to make them laugh and entertain them. Boomers in particular wanted to see this kind of approach with nearly two-thirds (66%) choosing it as their top pick.However just because the outlook for 2022 is more positive than for 2021 doesn't mean that consumers aren't interested in motivational messaging anymore. It was selected by 47% of the 2000 respondents of the Consumer Trends Report as a favored approach ahead of educational thought-provoking and reassuring tactics.While brands should be trying their best to help consumers look on the bright side they need to tread carefully when it comes to taking a stand on political issues. Around a quarter (24%) of Americans said that they don't want brands to get involved with political matters suggesting that adopting causes could be counter-productive for brands especially if they only make tokenistic efforts on these issues.However among those Americans that did want to see brands taking a stance poverty and inequality was the most commonly-chosen issue with 36% selecting this topic. A narrow second in the list was racism — interestingly only 30% of Boomers wanted to see brands address this matter compared to 46% of those in Gen Z. Digging further into this area Attest's ' You The Consumer ' report found that almost half of consumers (45.5%) think brands are doing the right amount to further issues of social justice. No respondents strongly disagreed with the statement: 'brands are doing enough to further social justice issues'.Now that we’ve covered off on the kind of messaging that will resonate in the new year where are consumers hankering to see it come to life? There’s good news for social media marketers here with more people interacting with brands on social media in 2021 than they did in 2020. To put this into perspective the percentage of Americans who say they don’t interact with or follow brands has decreased from 23% to 17%.However there's only one platform that's actually seeing significant growth and that's TikTok. Brand interaction on TikTok has risen from 15% to 25% from last year. To no surprise this has been largely driven by Gen Z 45% of whom say they’re connecting with brands on the platform.At the top of the pile though sits Facebook with 60% of respondents saying they interact with brands on this platform. However there has been no notable growth in this figure while Snapchat and Pinterest are also showing signs of stagnation. Instagram and Twitter are seeing dramatic slides in brand interaction slipping from 43% to 38% for the former and 29% to 21% for the latter.But marketers shouldn't turn their back on Instagram just yet. It's still overall the favored platform of Gen Z while Facebook is where it is at for the other generations - Millennials Gen X and Boomers. YouTube is still holding strong and with 48% of consumers interacting with brands on the platform it comes second only to Facebook overall. Relative newcomer Twitch is forcing itself into contention with 8% of Americans following brands on this platform; unsurprisingly it's Gen Z who are most interested in Twitch.While Gen Z are smitten with TikTok and Twitch they certainly don't feel the same way about email. Nearly one-fifth (18%) say that they don't want to hear from brands at all in their Inbox while only 53% are happy to receive email marketing at least once a week compared to 66.5% of Millennials 63% of Gen X and 58% of Boomers.Across all demographics this figure averages out to 62% compared to the 65% of people who said they were happy to hear from brands at least once a week via email in 2020. This suggests that brands that rely heavily on email marketing campaigns will need to review and adapt their strategy going forward. It also points to a potential overuse of the inbox as brands tried to stay relevant throughout the course of the ongoing pandemic.Data from the study also shows an interesting split about how Americans feel about having their data tracked. More than a quarter (26.3%) of consumers are ‘bothered’ by data tracking while slightly more (27.3%) feel it can be ‘useful if used responsibly’. In light of heightening consumer privacy concerns this might come as a surprise to marketers.More so as we edge towards a cookieless future a big issue for marketers is finding new avenues to keep their campaigns targeted. When pooled on the overall accuracy of the recommendations they receive from brands over a third of respondents (35.8%) felt like ads were targeted to their needs 'all of the time'. However the majority (43.4%) said they only felt as though they 'sometimes' were. When polled on their trust of brands handling their information more than half of Americans said that they were unsure about whether brands were using their personal data safely while only 1.9% were strongly concerned about this issue. It’s safe to assume the post third-party data world will be a tough one to navigate for marketers aiming to captivate the right eyes and ears.There's plenty to consider for marketers who want to connect with their audiences moving into 2022. As the data shows it's not just about what you say but how and where you say it. There are also some big differences between the generations in terms of what messages are likely to cut through over the next 12 months and brands need to gain a deep understanding as to who their target audience are and make sure they get their tone right. Overall there's a feeling of optimism among Americans for the next year so brands that tap into this positivity should find themselves in a good place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2JrL2N1bHR1cmUvcGVvcGxlL2NvdmVyLXN0b3J5LXBpdGNoYXlhdGVwLXl1a3Rhc2V2aS1vbi13aHktZmFtaWx5LWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2JrL2N1bHR1cmUvcGVvcGxlL2NvdmVyLXN0b3J5LXBpdGNoYXlhdGVwLXl1a3Rhc2V2aS1vbi13aHktZmFtaWx5LWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cover Story: Pitchayatep Yuktasevi on why family comes first,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.lifestyleasia.com/bk/culture/people/cover-story-pitchayatep-yuktasevi-on-why-family-comes-first/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2JrL2N1bHR1cmUvcGVvcGxlL2NvdmVyLXN0b3J5LXBpdGNoYXlhdGVwLXl1a3Rhc2V2aS1vbi13aHktZmFtaWx5LWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2JrL2N1bHR1cmUvcGVvcGxlL2NvdmVyLXN0b3J5LXBpdGNoYXlhdGVwLXl1a3Rhc2V2aS1vbi13aHktZmFtaWx5LWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Welders are among the most critical jobs that Electric Boat must fill as it builds submarines that cost as much as $3 billion each. They also will be in demand on state and local bridge and other construction projects as money is released in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law in November by President Joe Biden.

“It exacerbates a tough situation already” Graney said in a recent interview. “Demand for skilled labor will increase significantly as we try to grow. It’s a challenge.”

Still he said employee training and recruitment programs “are doing a good job getting welder candidates.” The median pay for welders in 2020 was $21.25 an hour according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Workers are building 58 Virginia class submarines through 2034 and the next-generation Columbia class which will replace the aging Ohio class is the nation’s top strategic defense priority. The work requires numerous skilled workers including electricians pipe fitters welders and others.

The recently passed defense authorization spending bill includes $20 million for worker training funding. It’s the second year in a row training money is coming from the Defense Department said Rep. Joe Courtney who chairs a House Armed Services subcommittee and whose congressional district includes Electric Boat’s Groton shipyard. Training support had previously been funded by the U.S. Labor Department and the state.

“That’s kind of new territory for the Department of Defense to get into job training” he said. “But I think the need for it is blindingly obvious.”

The size of the infrastructure spending bill — about $1.2 trillion with an estimated $550 billion in spending above baseline levels — guarantees that different sectors of the U.S. economy will be in competition according to the Brookings Institution. It will promote greater demand for materials such as steel cement lumber and other products “in some cases creating greater competition between government businesses and households for the same goods” it said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said competition for welders and possibly other submarine workers was not a surprise outcome of the infrastructure legislation he and other congressional Democrats enthusiastically supported.

“Nobody needed to be a Nobel-winning economist to see the pressures that would be exacted in creating new jobs” he said. “It’s a good thing but there’s also the need for skills training. This was kind of elemental.”

John Beauregard special adviser to the president of the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board said the pace of training has accelerated more than in 2019 before the pandemic with more training classes scheduled. But fewer students are participating down to 10 to 12 from about 15 two years ago he said.

The schedule of classes will handle volumes of students “that rivals 2019” Beauregard said.

“We’re not there yet” he said. “We’re going on such a pace churning out the same levels of graduates. We’re turning them out in different ways.”

Jamison Scott a Woodbridge manufacturer and executive director of ManufactureCT an advocacy group said finding welders is “impossible.” Training lapsed during the pandemic and the skills are not taught in high schools he said.

In addition family-owned manufacturers can’t easily compete with large employers for welders Scott said.

“Those of us who need welders — they’re not there right now” he said.

The Rapidly Emplaced Bridge System (REBS) is a vehicle-mounted power-launched aluminum bridge system developed by the General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) for the US Army. It was designed to provide U.S. Army Stryker and Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Teams’ Combat Engineer Companies a rapidly employed gap-crossing capability to enhance mobility and maintain pace with maneuver forces.



The Bridge laying system of the REBS is transported launched and retrieved with an M1977 Common Bridge Transporter. It consists of a hydraulically powered launch and recovery pallet and a two-section horizontally-launched bridge. The REBS can also be transported on an M1067 Palletized Load System Trailer (PLST). A crew of two can deploy the REBS within 10 minutes. The REBS can support normal crossings up to 13 meters for Military Load Classification (MLC) 40 tracked and wheeled vehicles (MLC 50 wheeled under caution).



The horizontally free-launched REBS system is operated by a crew of two. The remotely controlled hydraulic launching and retrieving sequence is carried out from the truck-mounted bridge adapter pallet using an integrated launcher.

The purchase of these tanks is under the Australian project LAND 907 Phase 2 for the modernization of the main battle tank armored recovery vehicle and tank supporting systems.

SEPv3 is the latest upgraded version of the popular American Abrams tank. The United States began testing the prototype of this version nearly six years ago and in 2017 a “green light” was given for their production. The first produced unit leaves the production line only in 2020. According to the characteristics SEPv3 has better communication and networking capabilities as well as increased overall performance and power distribution.

Manufacturers from General Dynamux have integrated into the SEPv3 version a brand new control system as well as linearly replaceable modules. This version has a significantly improved IED protection package as well as an upgraded Ammunition DataLink [ADL] for air projectile use. The tank is integrated with optical infrared solutions from another well-known manufacturer – Flir.

The SEPv3 turret features a 150mm M256 smoothbore gun and passive ballistic protection. The latest version integrates fasteners new and with better features. The explosive jet armor and protection system is Trophy.

LAND 907 Phase 2

Australia is modernizing its combat armored vehicles. The Royal Australian Armed Forces currently has 59 units of M1A1 Abrams tanks which the government bought in 2004 and was to replace the German Leopard AS1 tank.

The LAND 907 Phase 2 program envisages Australia producing the necessary equipment using supplies from the United States. Earlier this year it became clear that Canberra was ready to purchase at least 160 M1A1 tank structures/hulls to use for the production of seventy-five [75] Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 tanks twenty-nine [29] M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicles; eighteen [18] joint assault bridges M1074; six [6] M88A2 Hercules Combat Recovery Vehicles; and one hundred and twenty-two [122] AGT1500 gas turbine engines.

The main contractors will be General Dynamics Land Systems Sterling Heights MI; BAE Systems York Pennsylvania; Leonardo DRS Arlington Virginia; and Honeywell Aerospace Phoenix Arizona.

Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 has a problem – its weight

Earlier this year the U.S. military completed testing of the Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 in cold climates. The testers concluded that the Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 works great at subarctic temperatures in Inner Alaska.

But whether this war machine will be able to reach distant battlefields during conflict is a question that has not yet been answered writes Forbes contributor David Axe.

According to him the upgraded version of the classic Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 is really a very very heavy vehicle. The increased weight will complicate the tank’s transportability in the long run which is a cause for concern among Pentagon experts.

Thanks to design features including new electronics and an improved auxiliary power unit the third version weighs almost 74 tons.

And if you add to this additional armor anti-missile active defense system and mine cleaning unit then the mass of the tank will increase to a staggering 92 tons the author of the article emphasizes.

The Army's Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) is a fifteen-ton tracked heavily armed drone being prepared for future warfare. The Army is currently evaluating its performance in conjunction with a variety of technologies including 30mm Chain Guns high-fidelity sensors attack drones anti-tank missiles smoke obscurants and electronic warfare.

Attack possibilities and new tactical applications are greatly multiplied by using an unmanned vehicle which can integrate many heavy armor technologies into a lighter weight high-speed deployable system.

“When you design just to be remote you can accomplish many of the things of a larger vehicle and a much smaller package because obviously you don't have to package people and then you don't have to package protection. And so it's likely that we'll see the kinds of capabilities that historically would track to a larger platform in smaller and lighter platforms” Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman Director of the Next-Generation Combat Systems Cross-Functional Team at Army Futures Command told the National Interest in an interview.

Coffman explained the service is now refining requirements and testing prototype RCV-Ms and plans another intense set of evaluations at Fort Hood Texas next year. Some of the Army’s industry partners include Textron Systems QinetiQ and General Dynamics Land Systems.

“We're gonna do company-level operations in Texas using offensive and defensive scenarios to really hone the requirements in the lessons of some of the things on future battlefields” Coffman said.

Without needing to operate with heavy armor to protect a crew a robotic armed vehicle can integrate a wide sphere of technologies to include advanced computing electronics multi-domain command and control equipment and a wide range of weapons.

“RCVs are payload agnostic. We can have counter-drone we can have smoke sensors and lethality. We can have anything that you can imagine on the battlefield on a robot. That is exciting stuff” Coffman said.

RCVs can operate as expeditionary forward attack platforms to test or breach enemy mechanized forces conduct high risk surveillance missions under enemy fire or network with aircraft or aerial drones to integrate ground-air operations.

Some may fire 30mm or 50mm cannons javelin anti-tank weapons or find targets for overhead precision air attack. As new technologies are tested the Army anticipates it will continue to refine concepts of operation. As various innovations are introduced the Army will make assessments and evaluate what Coffman described ast “trade spaces” with which to evaluate options for the vehicles.

“These cannons (30mm and 50mm) are providing trade spaces for Army senior leaders to make decisions that will absolutely change the geometry and the lethality of future vehicles” he added.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Nephew Hobey had in his possession an elaborate scrapbook that Hobey’s mother had compiled. He graciously allowed me to bring the scrapbook back to Minnesota and Jim Thaxton’s Sports Film & Talent Company duplicated it which allowed us to have all the pictures stories and headlines we now have in our possession.

While in New York I also contacted a number of media people to get their input and support for the award. I met personally with Mark Mulvoy hockey editor for Sports Illustrated at that time and Judy Weiss who worked in the New York office of Hockey News. On the phone I talked with Tom Murray and Charlie Halpin of Hockey News in Toronto and Larry Klein of Sport Magazine. They were all very helpful and supportive of such an award. I also spent more time with Rudi Riska while in New York and received more of the background on the Heisman Award.

From there I solicited suggestions recommendations support and approval from Dennis Poppe and William Hunt of the NCAA Hal Trumble of the Amateur Hockey Association Bill Cleary Harvard hockey coach and Executive Director of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Lefty Smith Notre Dame Hockey coach and President of the American Hockey Coaches Association along with W.C. Stryker.

The next step was to establish an Advisory Committee of well recognized and respected hockey icons and legends that we felt could add their expertise and prestige to the award. With the help of Walter Bush and the member of the Organizational Committee a committee was formed that consisted of Thayer Tutt Bob Ridder Don Clark Bill Cleary and Snooks Kelly. Walter Bush would serve as the Chairman of this committee. This committee was responsible for overseeing the Award and for selecting a 13-person selection committee that would ultimately name the winner.

A network of all college coaches in the NCAA divisions I II and III was established to determine the top ten candidates. They all voted for the three best players in their estimation. The votes of the coaches determined who the top 10 finalists would be. Our problem during the first couple of years was that we in an attempt to be all-inclusive gave equal weight to Divisions II and III and ended up with too many players from those divisions in the top 10. Following this the 13-man selection committee would select the ultimate winner.

This selection committee would be made up of equal representation from the East and the Midwest. One person would be designated to represent the daily newspapers the magazines the electronic media the American Hockey Association the NHL scouts and the Hockey Coaches Association thus creating twelve members. The Decathlon Chairman of the Committee was the thirteenth member and would only vote in the event of a tie. Members were to serve two-year terms. After two years the Advisory Committee appointed new members.

The first Hobey Baker Award winner was Neal Broten. He was announced at the Decathlon Club before a very sparse media audience on March 20 1981. The black tie award banquet was held at the club on March 30 1981 with Gordie Howe as guest speaker. The Master of Ceremonies was the legendary Ray Scott and the long awaited event was a complete sell out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2lieDk1MC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMtY29udGludWUtaW4tdHdvLWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50cy1pbi1saWJlcnR5LWFuZC1odWRzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigations Continue in Two Fatal Accidents in Liberty and Hudson,"Police investigations are continuing in two separate fatal accidents that took place this week.

On Thursday December 16th at approximately 3:52pm New York State Police were called to 482 Stanton Corner Road near Liberty New York for a single vehicle rollover accident.

Mobile Medic personnel and the Town of Liberty Fire Department were the first to arrive at the scene.

State Police say that the driver of a 1995 Dodge Ram truck was driving on Stanton Corner Road and missed the curve left the road on the north shoulder and overturned.

The driver was later identified as 18-year-old Robert J. Lands of Neversink. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the driver to miss the curve.

In a separate incident that took place on Wednesday December 15 2021 State Police were called to the Triform Camphill Community in Hudson for a report of an accident.

When troopers arrived they say that found 23-year-old David H. Wagner a resident at Triform was killed after being hit “...by a Chevrolet 3500 while clearing brush with fellow employees and volunteers at the facility. The incident” police say “appears to be accidental in nature at this time but remains an open investigation.”

As a result market players are positioned for a strong report when the memory giant releases quarterly results in Monday’s post-market.

Shiba Inu broke November support at $0.00003510 at the start of December and has ticked lower into the second half of the month. It’s still trading above the long shadow carved during the Dec. 4th selloff raising odds that sell stops are accumulating below $0.00002915. A violation of that price level could generate a rapid volatility spike dumping the cryptocurrency into the .786 Fibonacci retracement level of September into October uptrend at $0.00002280.

The Omicron-induced flight to safety has benefited high dividend stocks that can weather economic headwinds. General Mills Inc. (GIS) broke out to an all-time high last week exhibiting high percentage gains rarely seen in the food production stocks. Adding to upside the company pays a healthy 3.02% forward dividend yield that will ease pain when more favorable conditions return to the ticker tape. GIS reports Q2 2022 earnings ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell.

Carol Salverson a certified professional dog trainer told Oil City she has been working with Project Kenny for the past four years. The organization pairs dogs with veterans and trains the dogs to recognize and interrupt episodes of anxiety and nightmares.

“The whole purpose for the service dog is to help integrate them back into the community and be part of the community” Salveson said.

The veteran and dog get one private lesson and one group lesson per week and the veterans conduct their own training at home. The whole process takes about a year Salveson said.

“The important piece is socialization. The dogs have to be able to go out in public.” Salveson said the dogs are ideally trained for service from an early age though an existing pet with the right temperament can also be trained.

“I always say that the dogs don’t cure the PTSD they help you get through it” Salveson said.

Of the roughly two dozen veterans Salveson has worked with over the past four years some had been unable to go shopping or dine out due to anxiety and PTSD. Others have overcome chronic thoughts of suicide through the program. Salveson noted that she’s seen an increase in trauma in female veterans due to sexual abuse while in active service.

She said the training is also a relief for the veterans’ families.

“PTSD is hard on the whole family and I’ve seen over and over again how the dogs help the whole family deal with the issues that the veteran is dealing with.”

These operations have previously taken place out of Salveson’s home and other organizations have occasionally provided space.

Project Kenny helped lease the space located at 1005 Falcon Road in Mills. General obedience classes will take place under the business name The Dog Spot and profits will go to support the Project Kenny services which are provided by volunteer efforts and at no cost to the veterans.

The Project Kenny side of the operation is currently open: Classes at The Dog Spot are expected to begin in mid-January.

With the new facility Salveson said she is also working to expand the service for first responders affected by PTSD.

Salveson an Air Force veteran and retired teacher said she was called to this work through a personal tragedy: Her son Bobby was a Green Beret who died by suicide in March 2017.

“I had no idea really how PTSD affects our veterans. Not until it hits home until it’s your son.” At the memorial she said she recognized that her son’s teammates were struggling too.

“It was so obvious so I thought what can I do to help?” She and Bobby both loved dogs and so she started attending a school to become a professional trainer that year.

“The dogs are my therapy too” Salveson said reflecting on the journey over the past four years.

“But the fact that I can help his teammates the fact that I can help other veterans is invaluable. I just want to help them.”

If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide please call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)

Donald Wiley Hudler

Charlotte - Don Hudler spent a lifetime helping people achieve the American Dream the part of it that included a great American automobile. A child of Detroit he rose in the ranks of General Motors when GM was King. Early in his career he sold us on the power and prestige of Cadillacs. Years later he became president of Saturn GM's daring new compact car.

Donald Wiley Hudler left us on Dec. 9 2021. Until the day he died at age 87 he was as his wife so simply and powerfully put it ""A real car guy.""

Don was born in Detroit on July 20 1934 with his twin brother Ron sons of Fred and Myrtle Hudler. The dye was cast early. His dad worked for GM moving the family to Ohio around World War II when he was assigned to supervise a plant that was manufacturing military vehicles. Don and Ron attended Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware Ohio where Don ran track and belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon. The brothers shared a Cadillac on campus though their friends thought each one had their own since no one could tell the Hudler boys apart. After graduating in 1956 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration Don began working for GM.

In a career spanning 43 years there was no stopping him.

He held a number of key GM positions starting with Cadillac including National Merchandising and Marketing Director. He spent three years in Madrid Spain as Regional Director of Marketing with responsibility for Belgium France Italy and Spain. When GM created the Saturn Corp. in 1985 for the compact car market Don sculpted the company's marketing effort that stressed value reliability and customer service. He served as president of Saturn from 1995-99. In many ways he became the face of innovation for the world's largest automaker. At six feet four with long silver hair and an air of quiet confidence he was the man for the job. Don was also a Vice President of GM.

He wasn't into accolades just achievement. He'd say ""Smart peacocks don't fan their feathers until they're at the top of the hill."" No wonder colleagues considered him a game-changer. Don was also known for his hard work fairness and generosity.

Even his personal life was enriched by GM. Dannielle Colliver worked at an advertising agency in Detroit that handled the Cadillac account. That's how she met Don. Dannielle later rose to Director of Advertising for Chevrolet. They were married in 1993 and moved to Charlotte in 1999 after he retired from GM. Don continued his automotive interests by owning Saturn dealerships in Dallas and Houston and later Cadillac and Hyundai dealerships in Houston.

Don is survived by his wife Dannielle Colliver-Hudler and stepdaughter Victoria (Robyn) Colliver both of Charlotte.

A private memorial service is planned.

A gift in his honor can be made to the Scholarship Fund at Ohio Wesleyan University 61 S. Sandusky St. Delaware Ohio 43015 (www.owu.edu/give). Half of any funds will be designated for female students. During his time with GM he helped promote educational scholarships as well as blood drives and organ transplant programs. He also served on the boards of Coachmen Industries Saab and Compaq Corp.

The family is grateful for the care and kindness shown by everyone at Sharon Towers where Don was a patient at the Health Care Center.

Don Hudler was a man of substance a leader in a great American industry during those glory years when your dad (or mom) pulling into the driveway with a new GM car was the stuff of dreams come true.

He was also a man of style. Don found time to indulge his love of travel. Before his illness he'd sit on the terrace of their home in Charlotte a cigar in one hand a glass of wine in the other their Cadillac in the garage. Life was good.

Arrangements are in the care of Kenneth W. Poe Funeral & Cremation Service 1321 Berkeley Ave. Charlotte NC; 28204 (704) 641-7606.

The message: You can do your part to save the planet if you’re rich that is.

In a press release on Friday GM announced the beginning of “a new era” for the company marked by the delivery of its first next-generation electric vehicles. Unfortunately that new era is headlined by the Hummer EV Edition 1 a $110295 car with an estimated 329 miles (529 kilometers) of range “modular sky panels” the ability to do a “crabwalk” and drive diagonally and an “extract mode” to navigate over boulders and water.

Luckily this isn’t GM’s last EV. The company which is working towards selling only zero emission cars and trucks by 2035 has plans to release 30 new electric vehicles over the next four years. According to the release two-thirds of those new cars will be available in North America.

“Both commercial and retail customers will benefit from the EV experience from exhilarating acceleration to low cost of operation versatility and ability to customize after the sale” GM president Mark Reuss said in a statement. “GM is ideally positioned to provide EVs for every customer in every segment retail or commercial.”

While I do get that it makes business sense to create an electric vehicle for certain customer segments debuting a luxury electric truck like this when the planet is in crisis is flabbergasting. We need to electrify everything and fast to tackle climate change. A lthough the all-electric Hummer EV Edition 1 is an (unnecessary) example of the change we need its price tag will keep it out of reach for the majority which is exactly the opposite of what is needed . (Electrek reports that less expensive versions of the Hummer EV beginning at $80000 will begin to hit the market over the next two years).

Don’t be fooled into thinking that GM doesn’t know how to make cars that benefit the planet and its business though. Besides starting to ship the Hummer EV Edition 1 GM also began delivering its BrightDrop EV600 electric delivery trucks to customer FedEx which has ordered 500 EV600s. The EV600 can travel 250 miles (402 kilometers) on a maximum charge and carry up to 2200 pounds (997 kilograms).

FedEx chief sustainability officer Mitch Jackson told CNBC that sustainability is a core part of the business and that it was looking at the scalability of electric vehicles.

“We use a lot of vehicles in our operation and we need a lot of vehicles in order to make a sizeable difference in our operations” Jackson said according to the outlet. “We need that scale and we need that production capability.”

The world also needs a lot of electric vehicles to make a sizeable difference in its response to the climate crisis. Those vehicles need to be accessible to all and designed with the majority of society’s needs in mind. In other words they’re very different from the Hummer EV Edition 1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vZ20taHVtbWVyLWV2LWNydXNoZXMtdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1waWN0dXJlL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vZ20taHVtbWVyLWV2LWNydXNoZXMtdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1waWN0dXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GMC Hummer EV custom icons include cheeky Tesla Cybertruck easter egg,"By

It appears that Tesla is not the only automaker that has a big sense of humor. For the GMC Hummer EV General Motors opted to provide the hulking all-electric pickup truck with a set of custom icons that users could select for several of the vehicle’s functions. Interestingly enough one of these icons features the Hummer EV seemingly running over one of its most likely competitors.

GM’s cheeky icon for the Hummer EV was seen in a recent video from noted automotive reviewer Doug DeMuro who was fortunate enough to get behind the wheel of the all-electric pickup truck. The Hummer EV offers drivers a notable degree of customization from the icons used for some of the vehicle’s features to the names of the functions themselves listed in the infotainment system.

The Hummer EV’s custom icons are numerous with some depicting fun images such as space capsules and dinosaurs. Perhaps the most interesting however was an illustration of the Hummer EV seemingly running over and crushing what appears to be the Tesla Cybertruck. The custom icon is simple but it’s hard not to recognize the Cybertruck’s angular lines beneath the illustration of the Hummer EV.

In a way the Hummer EV’s cheeky Tesla Cybertruck Easter Egg bodes well for GM’s current electric vehicle strategy. GM after all is known as a rather serious no-nonsense automaker that rarely experiments. The Hummer EV’s infotainment system from its smooth Unreal Engine-powered graphics to its fun custom icons suggests that GM is at least willing to try new things as it enters the electric vehicle age.

As for whether the Hummer EV will really be able to crush the Tesla Cybertruck in real life that would definitely be something worth looking forward to. Both vehicles after all are designed to be as tough as possible and both carry the best technology that their respective automakers could offer. With this in mind it might not be too long before a real bout between the Hummer EV and the Tesla Cybertruck happens. And when it does it would likely make for some compelling entertainment.

Aodhán Roberts 19 received the accolade for overcoming personal barriers in his life and the work he has done within the community.

Taking place every two years the Legacy Award is one of the most prestigious accolades a young person can receive for their social action or humanitarian work.

The 20 Legacy Award recipients were chosen by an independent judging panel chaired by Diana’s brother Lord Spencer who had the difficult task of selecting just 20 from a pool of exceptional individuals already recognised for their impact on society with The Diana Award in 2020 or 2021.

Aodhán was presented with the award at an awards ceremony held at the Spencer home at Althorp House in Northamptonshire.

On receiving the award Aodhán said: “I was overwhelmed with absolute gratitude to be accepting the Diana Legacy Award in Althorp House presented by Lord Spencer. This is an award that means so much to me and something which will continue to help me thrive in my own work and in life. I couldn’t have done this alone.

“When I was growing up I lived on borderline poverty I didn't do very well in school and I went through a lot of bereavements.

“I was often told that I wouldn't get any GCSEs and I would get nowhere in life - now I'm getting opportunities like this being regularly successful in funding applications and study at university.

“I would like to use this as a push for myself to keep inspiring the creativity and motivation in other young people.”

In addition to the award Aodhán has access to a unique two-year development programme on which he will be paired with a mentor from Gilead Sciences who are also the title sponsor of the awards.

The programme aims to provide them with the opportunity to enhance their skills in four key areas - leadership community development social entrepreneur- ship and technology.

Following the shooting dead of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry in April 2019 Aodhán set up the social media page ‘Derry Footage’ to share stories and encourage other young people to speak up against wrongdoings.

Despite having struggled in mainstream schooling eventually being withdrawn from mainstream education after 70 referrals and eight suspensions Aodhán overcame his problems and still managed to achieve nine GCSEs.

T

hen Aodhán lost his grandmother his mother’s partner and his own mother in just a few months.

At the age of 17 he found himself on his own with no legal guardian or financial stability.

But he refused to let these tragedies crush him. It was while studying creative media in college that he created ‘Derry Footage’ that gave him a chance to create a sense of community and togetherness in Derry and share untold stories that deserved greater attention.

He released the short film ‘Impairment’ to bring attention to the recurrent problem of drink-driving and was shortlisted in several film festivals.

Last year he released ‘Overcoming Adversity as a Community’ which showcased the unique sense of community in Derry and how we can pull together during times of crisis.

His photography series covering the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Derry was also shared by mainstream media outlets such as the BBC.",,,,,,,,,

The Bangalore-headquartered startup which is a market leader in payments processing in India said Sunday evening it has raised $375 million in its Series F financing round. The new round which brings more capital to the startup than all its other previous financings put together was co-led by Lone Pine Capital Alkeon Capital and TCV.

Existing investors Tiger Global Sequoia Capital India GIC and Y Combinator also participated in the new round said Razorpay which has raised over $740 million over the past seven years.

Razorpay accepts processes for — and disburses money to — small businesses and enterprises. It also operates a neobanking platform through which it offers credit cards and working capital to businesses. It also offers an international payments gateway that supports over 90 currencies.

Some of its other offerings include helping businesses with collating tax and compliance disbursements generating payment links that can be shared via email or through instant messaging services subscription plans with automated recurring transactions on various payment modes and automatic reconciliation of incoming transactions using virtual accounts and UPI IDs.

The startup — whose offerings are similar to those of Stripe the global payments giant that has little to no presence in India — has also entered a few nations in Southeast Asia in recent years.

Razorpay which processes $60 billion in transactions annually (up from $5 billion in 2019) says it has amassed over 8 million businesses including Facebook Swiggy Cred National Pension System and Indian Oil among its customers. Of the 42 startups that have become unicorns in India this year 34 of them use Razorpay.

“Our payments business continues to keep getting stronger. In the last one and a half years we have also been able to prove our thesis on neobanking and lending” said Harshil Mathur co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay in an interview with TechCrunch this week.

“We want to ensure that when you start a company and sign up with Razorpay we do everything for you on the financial side — from opening a bank account to building payments and disbursals and salary payouts. You don’t have to step out and use multiple tools” he added. As these businesses grow Razorpay grows with them he said.

Mathur and Shashank Kumar (co-founder of Razorpay) — pictured above — met at IIT Roorkee college. At the time small businesses in India faced a myriad of challenges in accepting money digitally and existing payment processing firms weren’t focused on catering to the needs of them.

At a $7.5 billion valuation up from just a little over $1 billion last year Razorpay is now one of India’s most valuable fintech startups. But getting to this stage hasn’t been easy.

The co-founders struggled to convince bankers to work with them in the initial years of the startup. The conversations were slow and the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenges to investors numerous times they recalled in an earlier interview.

“Over the last seven years we’ve tirelessly worked toward making Razorpay a technology and product company that is people-first. If there is one thing the Razorpay team has committed to doing since 2014 it is to never stop reinventing” said Kumar.

The startup plans to continue to focus on expanding its product offerings and also hire over 600 people to fuel its growth in India and Southeast Asia.

But Razorpay which recently introduced a feature that saves shoppers’ information — password card details addresses — during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments is not looking to offer a consumer-focused neobanking service Mathur said.

“We might do some consumer-focused stuff but we want to stay away from pure consumer offerings for two reasons. We don’t see any huge value add that we can bring that other players in that ecosystem aren’t already offering and also we don’t see anything significant that we can gain by entering that business” he said.

Razorpay is also gearing up to become IPO-ready he said but noted that the startup won’t be exploring the public markets for at least two and a half years.

“As the leading online payments player in the rapidly accelerating Indian digital payments market Razorpay has continued to innovate and blaze new trails” said Deepak Ravichandran general partner at Alkeon Capital in a statement.

“With a broad set of products across payments banking and software that provide a seamless end-to-end experience for merchants (who have been historically underserved by legacy payment providers) and geographic expansion on the horizon we are thrilled to be partnering with Harshil Shashank and his team who have continued to execute on their vision. We could not be more excited for the journey ahead.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiywFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMTIxOTAwNTEwNC9lbi9SZXN0YXVyYW50LUJyYW5kcy1JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLUluYy4tUGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1BbnQtR3JvdXAtdG8tQWNjZWxlcmF0ZS1EaWdpdGFsLVRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uLW9mLUl0cy1SZXN0YXVyYW50LU9wZXJhdGlvbnMtQWNyb3NzLUFzaWEtUGFjaWZpY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurant Brands International Inc.

The company an online insurance comparison marketplace called Insuranks recently announced a position that entails traveling internationally once per month for a calendar year while blogging vlogging and posting about your adventures on social media. Only a single applicant will be selected the company said.

That person will be additionally allotted up to $2000 for return flights $3000 for accommodations $600 for food and drink allowance $1000 for activities and $500 for vehicle hire. To cash out you'd also need to publicly promote Insuranks' insurance packages.

The timing may be unfortunate: Covid's new omicron variant is currently surging across the world throwing travel plans into disarray. Multiple countries have limited international travel in recent weeks including India Australia and several European Union nations.

Currently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that U.S. citizens become fully vaccinated before going abroad. That definition may soon include booster shots White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday.

Plus while a year of travel sounds like a potential antidote for pent-up wanderlust there are risks to becoming a full-time vagabond.

Frequent travel disrupts routines — especially if you're traveling across multiple time zones. The Mayo Clinic warns that jetlag can affect cardiac rhythms disrupt sleep affect concentration and cause gastrointestinal distress. It can also lead to weight gain according to a 2015 study published in medical journal Cell Metabolism.

The best course of action experts say is to schedule your flights around your sleep patterns. If you're able to sleep on planes that means taking overnight flights: Departing New York City for London at 8 p.m. gives you seven hours to snooze before landing around 8 a.m. local time.

But if engine noise and a lack of leg room forces you to pass the time with in-flight movies try to land in London around 2 a.m. — roughly 9 p.m. in New York — and get a relatively normal night's sleep once you're off the plane.

If you're still interested in the Insuranks gig you'll have to post a 60-second Instagram video as part of the application explaining why it's your dream job. You'll also need to publicly nominate other friends family members or wanna-be globetrotters to do the same.

According to the company's website judges will choose the ""most creative entry.""

Applicants must also be at least 18 years old and have a valid passport. Applications close on Monday January 31.

It began with an ice storm and a deadly winter freeze that swept across the state of Texas. As Texas residents hunkered down to fight off the dangerous cold and protect pets and pipes from the winter weather the staff of The Dallas Morning News did all of those things too and then started reporting the stories of our community.

In the days following they found residents working to have water and power restored to their homes.

The visual storytellers of The Dallas Morning News have continued to present the stories of our community with empathy grace intrigue and wit. Each day members of this team come together with only one goal in mind: to do better than the day before. We understand that on many days we encounter people experiencing some of the most impactful days of their lives.

Then co-owner Wyc Grousbeck asked a simple question that left Udoka stumped.

Last June a small but powerful Celtics contingent flew to New York to interview Nets assistant Ime Udoka for Boston’s head coaching vacancy.

Udoka has never considered a life outside of basketball and he has never wanted to.

This was a man who skipped his school prom to play in late-night pickup games. Who took graveyard shifts loading trailers for FedEx just so it wouldn’t disrupt his training sessions. Who returned to practice with the Portland Trail Blazers the day after his father’s sudden death.

For Udoka basketball is all-consuming and fulfilling and essential. So his answer to Grousbeck’s question may have sounded overdone but it was honest.

“For me” he said “there’s nothing else.”

A rough beginning

Udoka has made millions of dollars over his career as a player and coach. He has been called on to defend players such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James and to devise ways to stop them. He has a movie-star fiancée and is now in charge of bringing one of the world’s most prestigious pro teams to the summit.

But throughout his journey he has generally kept the struggles that led him to this point to himself.

His father Vitalis came to Oregon from Nigeria to attend Portland State and chase the American dream but he found that it was not that simple. He held various jobs as a laborer and often faced discrimination and racism. More than once he was fired when he tried to stand up for himself.

“We’d tell him to just not say anything so he could keep working” said Ime’s sister Mfon. “But he said he was being mistreated. It’s hard being a Black person in America and a foreigner at the same time.”

Vitalis and his wife Agnes who was from Illinois tried to shield their children — James Mfon and Ime the youngest — from the family’s financial hardships but it was not easy.

They briefly lived in a motel after being evicted from their home before Ime was born. When the electricity was shut off in their Portland apartment Agnes would gather everyone near the gas oven to stay warm.

Food boxes arrived from local charities and whenever Mary Gossart a close family friend brought vegetables from her garden the family acted as if it was a feast. Gossart bought sneakers for the children and when she learned that Ime and James did not have beds after moving into a new home as elementary school students she purchased bunk beds for them at a friend’s garage sale.

Basketball was such a passion for a young Ime that he could often be spotted dribbling on the way to school. Courtesy of Mfon Udoka

Ime understood the challenges too. When he played in youth basketball tournaments he would fill his backpack with free bottled drinks and bring them to his family.

They did not have cable television but Ime and his father would listen to Trail Blazers games on the radio together. Ime would record other games on network television and watch them on a loop before dribbling to his middle school to practice the moves he had just seen.

“There’s not a day I can remember when I didn’t play basketball unless I was sick” Ime said. “We were poor. We didn’t go on family vacations. It was just basketball. I’d play by myself when it was raining everything. Neighbors probably looked at me like ‘Why is this kid out there every [expletive] day?’ ”

A long winding road

Udoka knew basketball could be a route out of poverty but his dedication was mostly sparked by his enchantment with the sport.

He would go to midnight sessions at the local Salvation Army gym and take buses around the city in search of pickup games. He skipped parties and dances and most activities that did not involve a court.

“ ‘We were poor. We didn’t go on family vacations. It was just basketball.’ Ime Udoka on his childhood

“He never stopped.” said Bobby Harris his former Jefferson High coach.

Finding stability remained a challenge however. Udoka played for Eastern Utah Junior College and the University of San Francisco before returning home to Portland State.

The 6-foot-6-inch forward was dominant as a senior and NBA scouts noticed but he tore his ACL in February 2000. He opted for a surgery with a shorter recovery time but greater risk in which a piece of his hamstring was used to repair the knee ligament.

Udoka returned four months later and spent training camp with the Trail Blazers before he was cut and signed by the Fargo-Moorhead Beez of the International Basketball Association. He was paid $200 a game and the team traveled by bus and stayed in cheap motels. About 10 games into the season Udoka tore his ACL again.

He had no health insurance but this second procedure was paid for by Willie Stoudamire who ran the midnight basketball session where Udoka had spent so much of his childhood and who was the father of former NBA standout and current Celtics assistant Damon Stoudamire.

When Udoka woke up after that second surgery a doctor told him that a piece of cartilage was missing from his knee. He said Udoka would likely experience pain for years and that he should consider a new career path.

“I knew that if I had one more injury it’d all be over” Udoka said. “But there was never a doubt that I was going to try.”

He spent eight months in Portland loading trailers at FedEx mostly on graveyard shifts and did squat workouts using heavy packages. He would return home around 8 a.m. eat breakfast and start his basketball training that included pickup games against Trail Blazers players.

“ ‘“I knew that if I had one more injury it’d all be over. But there was never a doubt that I was going to try.”’ Ime Udoka on his torn ACL

Over the next few years he toiled on the fringes of the NBA. There were summer-league stops and training camp invites some more promising than others. He made his debut after signing a 10-day contract with the Lakers when Kobe Bryant injured his shoulder in January 2004.

“Then Kobe walks in after a few days raises his arm above his head and goes ‘I’m good’ ” Udoka said. “In my head I’m watching like ‘[Expletive] of course Superman came back this quick.’ ”

His pinball-like path continued with several more stopovers before Udoka was called up from the D-League by the Knicks late in the 2005-06 season. The following year after president of basketball operations Isiah Thomas had taken over as the team’s coach he summoned Udoka outside the Wynn Casino during the Las Vegas summer league.

“You’re never going to be a 20-point scorer but the guys respect you and listen to you and you play the right way” Thomas said. “I think you’re going to be a great coach one day.”

Udoka had never considered the possibility but a seed had been planted.

Shaken by tragedy

Throughout her family’s struggles Agnes Udoka used to tell friends that if she just had one child reach the NBA everything would turn out just fine. And Ime was constantly on the doorstep.

In 2006-07 after he was released by the Knicks he landed with his hometown Blazers and made the final roster. The family was overjoyed.

Udoka did not play in the preseason opener. He was getting ready for the second game a few days later when his mother called and said something had happened to their father. He and his sister should come quickly.

Ime and Mfon rushed to their parents’ apartment where they found Vitalis Udoka unconscious on the floor. He had suffered a massive heart attack and died soon after.

Udoka takes some solace in the fact that Vitalis knew he had reached the NBA. But it was crushing that he would never see what came next.

“I went to practice the following day and everybody was looking at me like ‘Why are you here?’ ” Udoka said. “But basketball was all that could take my mind off of things. It’s always been that way.”

Udoka traveled with the team to Utah for a game against the Jazz and when he was alone in his hotel room he finally broke down.

On the court though he seemed to find a home. He started 75 games for the Trail Blazers and knew he would not be returning to the minor leagues any time soon. Spurs assistant coach Brett Brown had scouted a few of Portland’s games against the Lakers and he was impressed by how Udoka did not back down from guarding Bryant.

“You’ve got to see this guy” Brown told longtime Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.

The following year San Antonio offered Udoka a three-year $9 million contract. It was perfect. But two days later Popovich called and said that team doctors had noticed the cartilage missing from Udoka’s surgically repaired knee. The offer was rescinded.

“I started tearing up on the phone” Udoka said. “I was just like ‘Are you [expletive] kidding me?’ ”

The Spurs were still interested just at a steep discount: two years $2.5 million. Udoka eventually took the deal anyway and realized he would have to prove himself once more.

He spent two productive years with the Spurs then played for the Kings for one season before returning to San Antonio where he spent half a season before being released.

In February 2010 when Udoka played for the Kings he had met actress Nia Long when a mutual friend set them up while they were both in Boston. Long was filming a pilot for NBC and Udoka was playing against the Celtics.

They talked in a hotel lobby until 1 a.m. and the next night went to an Italian restaurant in the North End. They started dating and eventually got engaged. On Nov. 7 2011 Long gave birth to their son Kez but the joy from that moment was fleeting.

Agnes Udoka had become very ill and mostly kept her health private even from her children. A few weeks after Kez was born she took a turn for the worse and was diagnosed with late-stage cancer.

Ime the baby of the family had always been closest to his mother. When he was a small child and Agnes woke up early to work at a bakery he would follow her outside sobbing because he did not want her to leave.

When he played for the Spurs and had a guaranteed salary for the first time he purchased a home for her in north Portland and surprised her with the keys.

Agnes was rushed to the hospital on Thanksgiving morning and she died two weeks later.

‘I already know who you are’

When Udoka played for Portland State he often made strategy suggestions to the coaching staff. On the Spurs he had spent so much time at the team’s training facility that the coaches joked that he might as well join them.

Udoka started an AAU program in Portland while he was playing for San Antonio and during summers he would return home to coach that squad which included future NBA players Terrence Ross and Terrence Jones. Also Udoka took part in coaching clinics at the NBA Players Association’s camp for the top college prospects.

Udoka went to Spain after his mother’s death and played well and in the summer of 2012 he returned to the United States to support Jones and Ross who were playing in the NBA’s Las Vegas summer league.

One day he was visiting with the Spurs staff there when Popovich pulled him aside. He said that assistant coach Jacque Vaughn was joining the Magic and he wanted Udoka to replace him. Udoka was taken aback.

“Just think about it” Popovich told him. “I’m going to interview some people but I already know who you are. Keep me in mind.”

Udoka had several multiyear offers to play overseas but he also had a family and he knew that his playing career would not last much longer. He accepted the Spurs job and went in headfirst.

He’d study film deep into the night and bounce into Popovich’s office with suggestions on how to tweak a play. It did not take long for him to emerge as one of the head coach’s most trusted confidants.

“I’d ask him if he thought something was going to work and he’d tell you straight up” Popovich said. “You’d respect his opinions because he didn’t have a thousand of them.”

In the summer of 2014 forward LaMarcus Aldridge a prize of the free agent market met with the Spurs and several other teams in Los Angeles. He had played with Udoka in Portland and the two had a strong bond. After his meetings Aldridge was taking a private jet back home to Dallas.

“ ‘“I’d ask him if he thought something was going to work and he’d tell you straight up. You’d respect his opinions because he didn’t have a thousand of them.”’ Gregg Popovich on coaching with Ime Udoka

“And Ime just hopped on the plane and was like ‘I’ll fly with you’ ” Aldridge said. “I thought he just wanted to go back to Texas but he was like ‘Nah I got on so if you had any questions I could answer them.’ ”

For three hours the two talked about the things Aldridge might not have been comfortable asking the Spurs’ top brass. As they walked off the plane afterward Aldridge turned to Udoka and told him he was coming to San Antonio.

“I think one of the first parts of being able to coach is being selfless” Aldridge said “and Ime has had that since Day 1.”

Boston bound

In May after longtime president of basketball operations Danny Ainge retired and was replaced by Brad Stevens the former coach’s most immediate responsibility was finding his own replacement.

“And the name that kept coming up from everybody you talk to” Stevens said “was Ime’s.”

Brett Brown told Stevens that Udoka was the kind of coach players would truly want to win for. Popovich’s pitch was more direct.

“I told Brad that if he’s looking for a partner a team player a guy that has knowledge and gets along with people and players respect the hell out of” Popovich said “he’s your guy.”

Stevens completed two Zoom interviews with Udoka during the Nets’ conference semifinal series against the Bucks and Udoka was encouraged by their similar views of the game.

Still Udoka did not want to get his hopes up. Over the past few years he had interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Hornets Magic Raptors Pistons and Cavaliers and he hadn’t gotten any of them.

“I could tell that frustrated him” said Udoka’s brother James. “He waited a little longer than he wanted but the opportunity he got ended up being the best one.”

After Brooklyn’s Game 7 loss Stevens Grousbeck Pagliuca and vice president of player development Allison Feaster met with Udoka for several hours at Pagliuca’s Manhattan offices and Boston’s brass was rapt.

Udoka was scheduled to do a Zoom interview for the Wizards’ head coaching opening on June 23 and Stevens asked him to push it back as far as he could. Two hours before the meeting with Washington Stevens called and offered the job.

When Udoka walked back into the living room at his Brooklyn home his family knew what had happened just from his smile. Mfon was in Nigeria when her brother’s news broke and watched it reverberate through the country. On one television show it was pointed out how the Celtics’ colors — green and white — are the same as those in the Nigerian flag.

“Nigerians are very proud people” Mfon said. “Right away one tribe started to try to claim Ime and then our actual tribe was like ‘No he’s one of us.’ ”

When Udoka called Popovich later the Hall of Fame coach started crying. During their time together in San Antonio others in the organization jokingly referred to Udoka as Popovich’s stepson because of their obvious bond.

“Ime’s had it tough in many ways” Popovich said. “He never made a bunch of money as a player and had injuries cut his career short. He put in the time here and then saw other guys go and get jobs. So when he got this job it was just very satisfying and easy to be over-the-moon happy for him.”

The next challenge

Udoka was sitting in a private room at a Seaport steakhouse recently and between bites of New Zealand salmon he talked about the obstacles that ultimately led him to this point: the injuries and the tragedies and the minor leagues and the job filling trucks with packages.

But he only talked about them because he was being asked about them. This is the way with Ime Udoka. Popovich said he knew most of Udoka’s backstory but very little of it had been revealed by Udoka himself. Despite his personal struggles Udoka never wanted people to feel sorry for him.

“And that was very telling to me” Popovich said. “There were no excuses.”

Udoka has now achieved the biggest goal left on his list but that list is ever changing. Now that he is a head coach he wants to become one of the best there ever was.

The start of this season has been slightly bumpy for the Celtics who entered Saturday night’s game against the Knicks in the middle of the pack in the Eastern Conference just like last year. There are times when Udoka seems exasperated trying to get his players to give the two things his own life was built on: focus and maximum effort.

Still he remains relentlessly determined to bring another championship to this city that knows winning so well. He is living in a modest apartment in downtown Boston and his friends joke that there is probably not even anything on the walls. He is just here for this game same as it ever was same as it will always be.

“I don’t look at it as a negative thing to say you’re a basketball lifer” Udoka said. “There’s nothing wrong with that. It got me to where I’m at.”

Reuters-Yonhap



By Park Jae-hyuk



Multiple global investment banks have promoted many of their Korean senior executives recently in light of the contribution of lucrative deals on the Korean market to their earnings this year according to industry officials Sunday.



The latest example of this was Credit Suisse (CS) which announced Wednesday that it had appointed both Shim Jong-min and Kim Sei-won as new managing directors ― a rank below partners.



Shim who was born in 1981 became the youngest managing director working at the Seoul offices of global investment banks. After working for Macquarie and Nomura he joined CS in 2014 and handled the sale of Asiana Airlines last year and the initial public offering (IPO) of KakaoBank this year. He also advised on Korean Air's sales of its in-flight meal and duty-free businesses Olive Young's pre-IPO IMM Private Equity's sale of Taihan Cable & Solution and SK E&S' issuance of redeemable convertible preferred shares.



Kim who worked for UBS and served as the chief financial officer of a local fashion firm Nanda advised on SK's investments in Vingroup and Masan Group as well as on Doosan's sales of its subsidiaries and Carlyle's investment in KB Financial Group. He also participated in Krafton's IPO allowing his company to make a handsome profit from the deal.

Goldman Sachs promoted Lee Seok-yong and Park Ji-eun to managing directors last month.



Since former Goldman Sachs Korea co-head Choi Dong-suk was appointed a managing director in 2010 this is the first time for Korean executives of the U.S. firm's Seoul office to be promoted to managing directors. Although Goldman Sachs appoints its new managing directors biennially the position is only allowed to 6 percent of its entire employees worldwide.



Lee who worked for Boston Consulting Group is known for his expertise in the tech media and telecommunication businesses ― he advised on Kakao Pay's IPO Coupang's listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the sale of Woowa Brothers.



Park who majored in economics and mathematics at Columbia University and earned a Master's in financial mathematics from New York University has specialized in derivatives markets.

It shows that more than one-third of the return in the S&P 500 this year has come from just 5 stocks.

Some investors become concerned when they see statistics like this.

It’s all a house of cards.

What happens when these companies take a dive?

This isn’t healthy market behavior.

Stocks are detached from reality.

Sure if and when the biggest stocks fall the market will likely fall as well. That’s just how the stock market is constructed.

But it actually makes sense these companies would have such an outsized impact on returns since they have an outsized impact on fundamentals.

After hearing Michael and me on Animal Spirits discuss how the biggest companies are carrying the index this year Pranav Ghai from CalcBench sent me some research to show why it’s justified that the market is so top-heavy.

Here’s what he did:

Took the profits numbers from 2016-2021 by calendar year for every company in the S&P 500.

Sorted those companies from most to least profitable.

Took the top 25 companies in terms of net income and compared their profits to market cap weights in the index.

Compared the top 25 names each year to the remaining stocks in the S&P.

This is the result:

Each year since 2016 the 25 biggest companies have produced even more profits than their weighting in the S&P 500.

Not only are the 25 biggest companies becoming larger relative to the index but so are their fundamentals. In 2020 the top 25 names made up 37% of the index but 56% of the profits!

So far this year the 25 most profitable companies make up 42% of the S&P 500 and 46% of the net income.

You can shake your head at how big these companies are getting but they are big for a reason. The fundamentals more than back up their market caps.

For example through the end of the third quarter of 2021 Apple makes up a little more than 6% of the index but also brought in around 6% of the profits. Google made up 4.5% of the index and 4.3% of net income. Facebook (sorry I’m not calling it Meta) had a 2.4% weighting with 2.5% of profits.

The numbers don’t always match up so neatly1 but these companies sit on the throne for a reason. They have become such a large part of the overall market because their fundamentals have been so strong.

As certain segments of the market have been getting crushed of late it may feel like it’s only huge tech stocks that are doing well but that’s just not the case.

In fact 85% of S&P 500 companies have positive returns this year.

The S&P is now up 26% on the year. It certainly helps that Apple (+31%) Microsoft (+47%) and Google (+65%) are all having strong years.

But 48% of all stocks in the index are up by more than 26% this year. Nearly three-quarters of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 10% or more this year.

Interestingly enough the equal-weighted S&P 500 is also up 26% this year just like the market-cap weighted version.

The mid cap index is up 20% this year. The energy sector is up more than 50%. Financials have climbed 36%. Small cap value stocks are up 24%.

It’s not just big tech stocks soaring. It just feels like that because these stocks are now so important to the overall market.

And there is a reason they are so big and important.

They’ve earned their place at the top of the mountain.

But these aren’t the only stocks rising this year. It just feels that way.

File Photo by John Angelillo/UPI | License Photo

Dec. 18 (UPI) -- After three months of arguments and witness testimony Theranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes' criminal fraud trial is now in the jury's hands. Holmes 37 who founded the blood-testing start-up Theranos in 2003 in Palo Alto Calif. faces nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for an alleged scheme to defraud investors which led the company to dissolve in September 2018.

She was indicted in June 2018 along with former Theranos President and Chief Operating Officer Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani who faces the same charges for allegedly making false and misleading statements to investors about developing a device that could run a full range of blood tests with only a finger-prick sample.

Both have pleaded not guilty. Balwani faces trial next year.

Arguments came to a close in Holmes' case late Friday as Judge Edward Davila gave the jury instructions about how to consider testimony and evidence they've seen the San Jose Mercury News and CNBC reported.

The panel will start its deliberations Monday.

Holmes' defense attorney Kevin Downey argued Friday his client never intended to defraud investors telling the jury in closing arguments that Holmes with a net worth $4.5 billion at one point never sold any shares.

""At the first sign of trouble crooks cash out criminals cover up and rats flee a sinking ship"" Downey said.

Holmes instead ""went down with that ship when it went down"" he continued. ""That is who this woman is. You don't need more from me to know what her intent was.""

Theranos raised $945 million from high-profile investors such as News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch Don Lucas and the family of former education secretary Betsy DeVos.

""People lost money"" Downey said. ""Ms. Holmes certainly did not intend for people to lose money. That's a bad event and a failure on her part.""

Prosecutor John Bostic said in his rebuttal ""The disease that plagued Theranos wasn't a lack of effort it was a lack of honesty.""

Bostic added that while there were people in the company who valued accuracy and reliability of the startup's technology ""Holmes was not one of those people and she was in charge.""

""We see a CEO of a company who was so desperate for the company to succeed so afraid of failure that she was willing to do anything"" he asserted.

Holmes testified late last month that she was sexually and emotionally abused by Balwani who along with being a top company official was also her boyfriend after leaving Stanford University where she claimed she was raped.

Bostic said jurors must put the abuse allegations out of their mind stating there is ""no evidence connecting the allegations of abuse with the actual charged conduct.""

Earlier this month Holmes testified that she gave a reporter incorrect information about the company's technology in 2014.

By Ronni Newton

At a ceremony Thursday in the Town Hall auditorium the West Hartford Fire Department welcomed a new fire marshal and fire mechanic and the eight recruits who graduated Dec. 10 from the Connecticut Fire Academy were officially given their badges.

Assistant Chief Mike Sinsigalli who also serves as the fire marshal is retiring this month and Robert Grimaldi has been appointed as the department’s new fire marshal.

Grimaldi was hired in November 2019 as deputy fire marshal after nearly three decades of service with the Bristol Fire Department and is “eminently qualified” to lead the fire marshal’s office Chief Greg Priest said.

“It is not uncommon for friendly banter between our operations division and the marshal’s office with jokes that the fire marshals want to blow out candles on birthday cakes to prevent fires and various versions to that joke” Priest said. “Deep down though each division no matter how big or how many personnel are assigned relies upon the other to perform critical functions in our core mission which is to protect the citizens of West Hartford.”

Sinsigalli has been with the department for 22 years Priest said. “He’s literally considered a subject matter expert in his field and has deftly navigated a growing town while faced with many challenges. He is a pariah to the operations division having prevented numerous fires that they were then not able to fight.”

Grimaldi was given the oath of office for his new position Thursday by Mayor Shari Cantor.

Jeremiah Bassett who was previously a mechanic with the West Hartford Public Works Department was also sworn in officially Thursday for his role as fire mechanic.

Bassett has already been hard at work in his new role and Assistant Chief O’Callaghan praised him for getting things done amid many challenges including back-ordered parts.

“I was thinking man this guy is cool under pressure” O’Callaghan said. “Well come to find out Jeremiah is a hockey coach and he is in charge of corralling 60 little hockey players which is probably equal to trying to corral five firefighters near an ice cream bar.”

The eight recruits who received their badges were among the 10 new hires welcomed by the West Hartford Fire Department on Aug. 31. Firefighter Joseph Lee and Firefighter Erik Wilson were already certified and immediately assigned duties while the other eight began a rigorous 16-week training program as part of the Connecticut Fire Academy’s Class 68 along with recruits from Bridgeport Bristol Easton East Hartford East Haven Fairfield Greenwich Manchester Middletown Naugatuck New London North Haven Ridgefield Southington Torrington West Haven Willimantic and Wilton.

Priest said the entire West Hartford group received high praise at the Fire Academy but also acknowledged a few notable achievements from the recruits’ training experience including that Firefighter Vince Avarista was one of two recruits in the 70-person Fire Academy class to earn the prestigious “Instructors award” and Firefighter Derek McDermott was selected by his peers to be class platoon leader.

Firefighter Kristen Tyrseck served in the honor guard for the graduation ceremony and Firefighters Audrey Ozga and Pierre Descollines were featured in a recruiting video promoting diversity.

The Connecticut Fire Academy training program is extremely rigorous O’Callaghan said and includes “long runs during the extreme heat and bitter cold. Running towers until you are dizzy. Going through obstacles in full firefighting gear soaked in sweat on your belly back or knees or whatever body part you have to get through.” You’re under a microscope and constantly being judged while also homesick and lonely.

“Some say the CFA is too difficult and some challenging parts are unnecessary. I do not agree. I believe this is where we find our next great leaders who navigate stress chaos failure and hardship” O’Callaghan said.

When he saw the first report cards from the eight new recruits O’Callaghan said he was so proud. He told them so in an email – the only way he was able to communicate with them during the training – telling them they were connected by one simple word: grit. “You all have it and are demonstrating ownership of this word every day …”

Priest extended his congratulations and said this is a great community a great team and he has high expectations. “The four cornerstones on the Chief’s Challenge Coin are duty pride commitment and excellence. They are good guides for a successful career. Live up to each one. Do your best and represent the patch well.”

HAS,Hasbro,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hcnlzdWUuY29tL2hhc2Jyby1kb2N0b3Itc3RyYW5nZS1pbi10aGUtbXVsdGl2ZXJzZS1vZi1tYWRuZXNzLXRveXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Reveals 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' Toys So Let's Get to Speculating!,"Recommended Videos

There’s two things we love more than anything: one is predicting what will happen in upcoming films and television series. The other is collecting toys. Naturally these two interests have combined to form a Voltron-like fusion of new toy announcements and rampant plot speculation that fuels the nerdverse. So naturally when Hasbro dropped their Legends line of toys based on ‘Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness’ we flocked online to analyze these new action figures in an attempt to unearth plot secrets from the Marvel film.

So far what we’ve seen backs up previous details from the highly anticipated sequel. There are three different versions of Dr. Stephen Strange available which include Defender Strange (the costume he wears in a recent run of Defenders comics) Astral Form Strange and the classic Strange in his cape.

Joining Strange are figures for his fellow sorcerers Wong (Benedict Wong) and Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who was Strange’s mentor turned enemy:

Finally there’s a figure for America Chavez/Miss America who will be played by Xochitl Gomez. All six figures contain pieces that can be combined to make build-a-figure Rintrah a green minotaur sorcerer who was mentored by Dr. Strange in the comics. Rintrah is rumored to be voiced by Adam Hugill (The Watch 1917).

So far Defender Strange is the most revealing toy drop in the line which suggests a Strange from a different dimension dropping into the film. Defender Strange sees the Doctor without the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation. This Defender look first appeared in Matt Fraction and Terry Dodson’s Defenders series which saw Strange working alongside Hulk and Manor to defend the planet.

This may mean that we’ll see Mark Ruffalo in the film (a safe bet as he’s one of the remaining Avengers). But we may also catch a glimpse of Namor the Sub-Mariner who is rumored to be played by Tenoch Huerta (The Forever Purge) and will serve as the antagonist in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

But what’s more curious are the characters absent from the toy line. Why is there no Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch toy? We already know Wanda appears in the film but is her role smaller than we previously thought? Or is it being expanded in the reshoots which wrapped this week?

Inspired by both Loki and Spider-Man: No Way Home the sequel is said to be including more character cameos and pop-ins from other dimensions so the film can have “more fun with the multiverse.”

There’s also no sign of a toy for Rachel McAdams’ character Dr. Christine Palmer. LOL just kidding no one cares about Christine. And of course there will be more toy drops in the future before the film premieres. The Marvel Legends are currently available for pre-order today at Target with Defender Strange as a Target Exclusive.

Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness hits theaters May 6 2022.

Trailing 3-1 in the opening minute of the third period the Rochester Americans (15-8-0-0) scored three straight unanswered goals in less than 10 minutes including a pair from rookie forward Peyton Krebs to earn a 4-3 come-from-behind win over the Hershey Bears (12-8-2-1) in the final meeting of the season between the two teams Sunday at Giant Center.

GAME SUMMARY PHOTO GALLERY

It was the second straight night the Amerks rallied in the third period to come away with a win following last night’s 4-3 shootout victory over the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.

With tonight’s win the Amerks have collected at least one point in six of their last 11 games against Hershey going 5-5-1-0 dating back to the start of the 2016-17 campaign. Additionally Rochester is 8-3-0-0 over its last 11 games dating back to Nov. 19 while they stifled the Bears’ three-game win streak to set them at a 6-5-0-0 mark over that same stretch.



In each of the of the 12 previous matchups the winning club has posted three or more goals. After the conclusion of the 462nd all-time regular-season meeting between the American Hockey League’s two senior-most franchises Rochester is 193-216-53 in its lifetime against Hershey which includes a 5-2-1-0 mark in the last five years.

Rochester forward Peyton Krebs notched his first multi-goal game in the AHL with two goals on the night including the game-winner with 2:51 remaining in regulation while captain Michael Mesch (0+2) recorded his seventh multi-point effort of the season with two assists to take over the team’s scoring lead. Forward Ryan MacInnis (1+0) notched the first marker of the night with his fifth of the season while defenseman Ethan Prow (1+0) scored his third tally of the season. Forwards Brendan Warren (0+2) Sean Malone (0+1) and JJ Peterka (0+1) and defenseman Oskari Laaksonen (0+1) all added assists on the night.

WATCH: GAME HIGHLIGHTS

While appearing in his 300th pro game goaltender Michael Houser (3-1-0) made his fifth start and sixth appearance in an Amerks sweater this season stopping 30 of 33 shots he faced to help lift him to his third win on the year.

Hershey forwards Ryan Dmowski (1+1) and Garret Pilon (1+1) both recorded multi-point efforts with a goal and an assist each while defenseman Ryan Nardella (1+0) tallied his third goal of the season with his second period marker. Forwards Axel Jonsson-Fjallby (0+1) and defensemen Michal Kempny (0+1) and Dylan McIlrath (0+1) all added helpers during the contest.

Netminder Ryan Bednard (0-1-0) made his first start in the AHL since May 2 2021 when he was with the Syracuse Crunch. Bednard took the loss in his first game with Hershey making 30 saves on 34 shots.

As the Amerks held the Bears scoreless in the first period it was MacInnis who would get Rochester on the board just 3:20 into the contest. MacInnis converted from the left side of the crease with assists from Malone and Mersch to set the score at 1-0.

KREBS SCORES HIS FIRST OF THE GAME

The remainder of the first frame would then go silent with Rochester registering 12 shots on goal and Hershey just six.

Just as Rochester held Hershey scoreless in the first the Bears would return the favor to the Amerks in the second period.

With a wide-open net 3:56 into the middle stanza Dmowski would notch his third of the season for the bears. As Houser moved to the right of the net the left side remained wide open for Dmowski to tie knot the matchup at 1-1.

At the 15:00 mark Nardella would help Hershey take its first lead of the contest. Sitting atop the right face-off dot Nardella would rip a shot through traffic to give Hershey a 2-1 lead heading into the final frame.

PROW TIES IT UP IN THE THIRD

When the third period got underway it would take just 56 seconds for Hershey to find a two-goal cushion. Pilon would fire a wrister over the stick-side of Houser to put the Bears up 3-1.

After a tripping penalty was called on Hershey 5:30 into the final frame the AHL’s top power-play unit would capitalize on its third and final power-play opportunity on the night.

Receiving a pass from the far point Krebs was placed at the top of the left face-off circle from where he’d sneak a shot through the short side of Bednard to bring the Amerks within one goal at the 7:12 mark. All but one of Krebs’ four goals this season have been scored on the man-advantage.

With 7:51 to go in the final frame the Amerks would tie up the game at three apiece. As Prow trailed the play the defenseman joined the rush at the last second. Setting himself up in the shooting lane Prow received a nifty pass from Mersch and deposited a well-placed shot over the glove hand of Bednard for this third of the season.

KREBS SCORES THE GO-AHEAD GOAL

Less than five minutes later Krebs would find his second goal of the game to seal the deal for Rochester. As Warren was trying to gather the puck off the boards he’d shovel a pass back to Krebs who would take it to the net. After his initial shot was stopped Krebs quickly gathered his own rebound and made good on the second opportunity to give Rochester the 4-3 lead with 2:51 to play.

Hershey pulled Bednard for the final minutes of regulation looking for the equalizer but Houser and the Amerks were able to hold on to complete the season sweep over Hershey.

The Amerks return home for the first time in ten days this Wednesday Dec. 22 as they take on the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins in their final game before their official holiday break.

The Washington Capitals have re-assigned goaltender Zach Fucale to the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

Fucale 26 became the first goaltender in franchise history to record a shutout in his NHL debut when he stopped all 21 shots against the Detroit Red Wings on Nov. 11 at Little Caesars Arena. In eight games with the Bears this season Fucale has posted a record of 4-2-2 with a 2.80 goals-against average and a .889 save percentage.

During the 2020-21 season the Laval Quebec native led the AHL in goals-against average (1.80) and ranked second in save percentage (.932) establishing career highs in both categories. The 6’2″ 189-pound goaltender played the most games (11) he has played at the AHL level since the 2017-18 season posting a 9-2-0 record. Fucale’s nine wins were tied for eighth in the AHL while his two losses were the fewest among goaltenders with at least 660 minutes played. Fucale and Pheonix Copley received the AHL’s Harry “Hap” Holmes Memorial Award presented to the goaltenders on the team which allows the fewest goals per game in the regular season.

The hospital which first earned accreditation as an adult trauma center from the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation (PTSF) in September 2017 is now accredited through Sept. 30 2024.

“Timely appropriate care is essential for people who have suffered traumatic injuries” said Don McKenna regional president Holy Spirit Medical Center and Penn State Health Hampden Medical Center. “This reaccreditation affirms that Holy Spirit Medical Center has the skillful teams and the facilities to provide exceptional trauma care to people from across the West Shore and central Pennsylvania.”

According to the PTSF the most common causes of injury that bring patients to a trauma center are falls and motor vehicle crashes. Other common causes of injury include burns gunshot wounds and assaults.

Trauma centers treat patients from incidents such as motor vehicle accidents falls and acts of violence. Holy Spirit Medical Center’s trauma team is led by Dr. Dale Dangleben medical director of trauma and is supported by skilled medical and surgical providers and nursing and support personnel all of whom are crucial to the program’s success.

Holy Spirit Medical Center also has a rooftop helipad that allows for rapid access to emergency care for severely injured patients who are flown to the hospital.

There are four levels of trauma centers in Pennsylvania. Both Levels I and II are required to provide the same level of medical care and expertise. However a Level I trauma center is required to perform research have a surgical residency program and serve an annual volume of 600 major trauma patients. A Level II trauma center must have an annual major trauma patient volume of 350. Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center is the only Level I trauma center in Pennsylvania for both adults and children.

In addition to high-level surgical and medical care trauma centers such as Holy Spirit Medical Center provide community outreach and trauma prevention programs.

The PTSF is responsible for establishing standards for accrediting trauma centers at varying levels based on a hospital’s resources and capabilities to follow trauma protocol. Standards are based on guidelines established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L2NhcGl0YWxzLXJlY2FsbC1zbml2ZWx5LWZyb20tYWhsLWhlcnNoZXkv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3ZhY2Fwc2ZhbnMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTkvY2FwaXRhbHMtcmVjYWxsLXNuaXZlbHktZnJvbS1haGwtaGVyc2hleS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitals Recall Snively From AHL Hershey,"Photo: NHL.com The Washington Capitals have recalled forward Joe Snively a native of Herndon Va. from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

The planning board last week voted 6-0 in favor of the $500 million project giving the Maxal Group the go-ahead to build three 25-story towers on the Hess site located at 615 River Road. The project is a scaled-down version of the original proposal and resolves the federal lawsuit once and for all.

“We want to thank the Planning Board for granting us the approvals that we have long sought” Bruce Sturman the managing director of the Maxal Group said in a prepared statement. “We look forward to bringing a sophisticated quality complex to Edgewater.”

The developer plans to convert the existing pier once used by Hess for barges to create ferry service to Manhattan. There will also be 20000 square feet of commercial space at the high-rise complex — scaled down from 60000 square feet originally proposed — plus construction of a two-acre park and access to the Hudson River Walkway.

The deal calls for the developer to deed five acres of the property to Edgewater for construction of either a school or recreational facility. Edgewater officials cited the potential for school overcrowding when they opposed a larger version of the project in 2015.

The borough’s consultant Benecke Economics of Riverdale estimates the project will increase school enrollment by 143 children once it is complete. Borough Administrator Gregory Franz said it’s too early to tell whether it will be necessary to build a new school.

Of the 1200 units 180 are being set aside as affordable housing. Once complete Edgewater estimates it will collect about $4.4 million annually through a tax break granted to the developer known as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes or PILOT.

The 19-acre site on River Road is one of the last large chunks of land on Jersey side of the Hudson River that is available for redevelopment. Hess shut the refinery in 2013 and the Maxal Group bought the property a year later for $26 million and has been trying to redevelop it ever since.

The developer 615 River Road Partners initially proposed building five towers with more than 1800 units and 60000 square feet of retail space. Edgewater balked at the plan and in 2017 moved to take the property through eminent domain to build a public works yard and parking.

That move prompted 615 River Road Partners to file a civil rights suit in U.S. District Court. The suit alleged the developers had been denied a fair hearing in Edgewater because borough officials were beholden to Daibes the powerhouse developer who has done numerous high-rise projects in town including the Alexander the Saint Moritz and Mariner’s Landing.

Daibes denied the allegation that he exerted any undue influence over borough officials. The lawsuit was settled in December 2019 giving the developer the green light for a scaled-down project to construct three towers and 1200 units. But it still took two years for Edgewater to give its final approval.

Sturman said The River Road project is designed to create the maximum amount of open space to provide visual corridors to the Hudson River and New York City skyline. The project is being drawn up by FXCollaborative of New York the architectural firm that designed the New York Times building in Manhattan and the Northside Piers on the Brooklyn waterfront Sturman said.

HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3Jldmlldy16ZW1pLWJlYWNoLWhvdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Hilton's Zemi Beach House in Anguilla,"

I've had my eyes set on visiting the Zemi Beach House in Anguilla ever since it was brought into the Hilton Honors program.

It's one of just a handful of properties that are part of Hilton's fledgling luxury brand LXR. The photos I saw online were stunning and it consistently got glowing reviews from repeat guests. I needed to experience it for myself.

With an abundance of unused vacation days and several Hilton free-night certificates to burn I decided planning an end-of-year Caribbean getaway was the perfect way to check it out. Getting to Anguilla wasn't as easy as visiting some of the more popular islands in the area but in the end I was able to truly disconnect soak up lots of sunshine and get great value from my certificates.

Booking

Standard Garden View rooms at the Zemi Beach House start around $860 per night including taxes but can top $1400 per night during busier periods. Since this is classified as a resort you can partially offset the cost with the up to $250 annual resort statement credit you get by holding the right cobranded Hilton credit card.

While Hilton doesn't publish an award chart standard room rewards here consistently cost 95000 Hilton Honors points per night. That's equivalent to $570 based on TPG valuations making this an excellent use of your points. Alternatively if you hold an eligible cobranded Hilton credit card like I do this could also be a terrific opportunity to redeem your Hilton free night certificates.

I ended up booking my weeklong stay using a mix of certificates points and cash. This was easily one of my best uses of the Hilton free night certificate to date.

Location

Zemi Beach House is in a quiet part of Anguilla in Shoal Bay East. It's on the northeast side of the island so the beach was facing the Atlantic side as opposed to the Caribbean. While the beach was still idyllic — and regarded as one of the best beaches on the island — this meant it had slightly more rocks than other locations and the water was a bit more choppy. There also wasn't much within walking distance of the hotel with the exception of some beach shacks like Gwen's Reggae Grill.

Getting there

Unfortunately getting to the island was more challenging than I had expected. At the time of my visit there were no nonstop flights between the mainland U.S. and Anguilla's Clayton J. Lloyd Airport (AXA) though American Airlines has since launched semiweekly flights from Miami (MIA) and will soon add a third weekly flight. My next best option was to fly into St. Maarten's famous Princess Juliana Airport (SXM). From there I had the option of taking a boat shuttle to Anguilla or a regional flight.

I ended up trying both options — and will write a separate guide comparing them — but in short I preferred flying. The flight was less than 10 minutes long (fun fact: this is the world's shortest international flight) and the transfer process from my inbound flight was very straightforward. The ferry took much longer and was almost the same price — about $100 each way.

I arranged my taxi rides in advance through the hotel and was able to charge them to my room. The ride from the airport cost $18 and took about 10 minutes while the one to the ferry terminal took 20 minutes and cost $26.

Check-in

My check-in experience was almost seamless. At the Anguilla airport my travel companion and I were met by a representative from the hotel who guided us to our taxi and took our welcome drink orders for when we arrived at the resort — a choice of rum punch or fruit punch. When we pulled up to the property there were staff members waiting to greet us who already had all our arrival paperwork prepared.

There were two lobbies at the resort. One was at the top of the property intended for check-in and check-out and the other was at the bottom of the resort along with the restaurants and main pool.

The front desk staff was super friendly but I was disappointed to learn that my top-tier Hilton Diamond Status wouldn't get me many benefits on this stay. Breakfast and Wi-Fi were already included for all guests and the hotel only upgrades elites to rooms with better views not suites. So even if you book an ocean view room outright don't expect an upgrade to a room with a plunge pool or one of the apartment-style suites.

The room

After checking in our luggage was loaded onto a golf cart and we were driven down the steep hill for a quick tour of the property before eventually heading to our room.

The 76 guest rooms are spread across three buildings and all involve some walking (and potentially stair climbing) to get to the main pool and beach area. Only the residences are directly on the beach.

I was assigned a two queen ocean view room on the third floor of building number three which is the furthest of the bunch. While no longer required by Hilton there was a seal on the door signifying the room had been deep-cleaned and undisturbed since that cleaning.

The room was listed as 600 to 700 square feet on the hotel's website and while I didn't pull out my tape measure the size seemed accurate. It felt quite spacious even with the two queen-size beds.

The front door opened to a hallway with a minibar immediately on the right. It was stocked with a small but adequate selection of alcohol soft drinks and snacks. The prices were fairly reasonable too (for a minibar that is). Beers cost $6 a bottle soft drinks were $3 to $4 and spirits were $20 to $45 for 200 ml to 375 ml bottles. There were also an Illy coffee machine hot water kettle and an ice bucket that was seemingly always full of fresh ice.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

The beds were dressed in crisp white Italian Frette linens and were incredibly comfortable. They had simple wooden frames that were tastefully offset by coral stone-carved bas-reliefs just above the headboards. I also appreciated that there were U.S. power outlets adjacent to the beds a necessity in today's world.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

Across from the beds was a wall-mounted TV with premium movie channels as well as a long table with two wooden chairs.

There was a more comfortable chair in the corner of the room but I would have preferred if there was also a round table for in-room dining. The thought of eating next to my companion while facing a blank wall just didn't appeal to me. To be fair there was a better setup for in-room dining on the balcony (more on that in a moment) but it wouldn't have worked during the sporadic showers.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

There were two closets where you could find the usual amenities as well as complimentary flip flops and a beach bag – two fewer things to pack. However there weren't any slippers — and they weren't available upon request.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

My favorite part of the room was the bathroom — and more specifically the freestanding soaking bathtub. It was complete with a sliding wood bathtub tray stocked with bath salts a loofah and a rubber duck.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The bathroom was bright and large featuring a vanity with two sinks a walk-in shower and a separate makeup table. I loved the combination of unique materials in the bathroom like the stone sinks copper piping and wooden accents. Toiletries were by Malin+Goetz and were rum-scented fitting for this Caribbean resort.

All rooms offered large balconies furnished with two comfortable seats a small dining table and two dining chairs. Although it felt somewhat obstructed the ocean view was beautiful nonetheless.

While I didn't actually enter a garden view room I imagine the view would have looked something like this:

Amenities

Naturally the highlight of the resort was its amenities. And because there weren't a tremendously high number of rooms the public spaces never felt too crowded.

The centerpiece of the property is a zigzag-shaped infinity pool. It overlooks the ocean and even has an underwater window which makes for a great photo op. It is only slightly heated but gets plenty of sunshine during the day.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 Zemi Beach House part of Hilton's LXR Hotels & Resorts in Anguilla. BENJI STAWSKI/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3

There are plenty of loungers around the pool and they all have a good view of the ocean thanks to the pool's zigzag design. There are also a number of cabanas that are free to use. Although this pool is open to families it was always fairly quiet during our stay and there was never a fight for chairs. However the hotel's electronic music selection felt a bit out of place.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The pool deck was stocked with fruit-infused water and free sunscreen — another thing you don't need to pack (or overpay for on the island).

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

The resort's other pool a three-tier adults-only infinity pool is just up the hill closer to the guest rooms.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

It offered plenty of seating but there were rarely other guests here. That's likely because it didn't get nearly as much sunlight as the main pool didn't offer ocean views and the water felt much colder. However if you're looking to swim laps this is the place to do it.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Where I (and most other guests for that matter) spent most of my time was on the beach. The water shone a pristine turquoise color perfectly complementing the soft white sand. While some parts of the beach are a bit rocky they were avoidable.

The beach offered enough loungers to go around and reserving a chair wasn't necessary. However unlike at the pools people started to reserve them anyway during the second half of my stay when the resort got busier. Despite that the beach still felt more exclusive than your run-of-the-mill resort and had no locals trying to sell you something.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There were attendants to help guests find a spot and set up the chairs. They also always offered complimentary bottles of water in bags of ice which I much appreciated.

The beach also had a station with sunscreen and more water.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

The resort offered kayaks stand-up paddleboards and snorkeling gear at no charge to guests. Unfortunately the staff determined the water was too rough to actually use any of the equipment during my stay — a potential downside to staying on the Atlantic side of the island.

Another standout feature of the resort was its Thai-style spa. The treatment rooms are housed in a 300-year-old wooden house shipped from Thailand. Other features include a vitality pool the island's only hammam various relaxation areas and a juice bar.

Offerings include massages facials healing rituals and scrubs with 50-minute massages starting at $170. I had the five elements massage which was a truly relaxing experience. The massage therapist was thorough and tailored the session to my needs.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Just across the spa is an astroturf tennis court. It is free to use during the day and racquets are included too. The hotel had provided a cooler with water bottles towels and bug spray which was a thoughtful touch.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

For those who prefer working out indoors there is a 24-hour fitness center. It is on the smaller side but still well-equipped (sans Pelotons). It would have been nice if the resort offered group fitness or yoga classes but it sadly didn't.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

While I didn't see many children during my stay there was a kids club for those ages 4-12. It was included for no additional charge which could be a real money-saver for families.

Free Wi-Fi was available throughout the resort including at the beach. Speeds measured 19.15 Mbps download and 18.28 Mbps upload. That isn't the fastest I've encountered but should suffice for streaming movies and FaceTiming relatives back home.

Food and drink

Food and drink is an area the hotel could improve in.

With one exception none of the dishes I had were particularly bad — but none of them were particularly exciting either. Overall the food felt more akin to what you'd expect from a megaresort than a hotel of this caliber. Prices were a bit steep but in line with expectations for the island.

The hotel's main restaurant is called 20 Knots. It's right by the beach and was open for breakfast lunch and dinner.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There were a variety of seating options but my favorite was outside at the tables on the sand. There's just something so satisfying about dining barefoot with your feet sinking into the sand.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

Breakfast was buffet-style and included for all hotel guests. It offered the usual suspects like made-to-order eggs French toast pastries cereals cheeses and cold cuts but lacked some local flavor. For instance it would have been nice to have tropical fruit like mango or coconut in addition to the berries and melon.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

My companion and I also ate most of our dinners here though it didn't take long to get tired of the food options. The menu ranged from pizza and pasta to tacos lobster and steak.

We tried our best to stick to local dishes that would exemplify island cuisine but our options were limited. My favorite dish was the red Caribbean curry ($26) with tofu mixed vegetables raisins coconut rice and mango chutney while my companion was a fan of the grilled spicy lobster ($55). The local red snapper fillet ($28) was tasty too albeit not very authentic with its thick lemon butter sauce. The Caribbean lobster mac and cheese ($28) and tuna tartare ($23) were bland and worth skipping.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

20 Knots also provided the beach and poolside food. The fish tacos ($23) mahi-mahi skewers ($23) and burger ($26) all hit the spot. That said I'd still recommend trying out the nearby beach shack Gwen's Reggae Grill for lunch instead (where I highly recommend their grilled seafood and rum punches).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The hotel's other restaurant is Stone and it was only open for dinner. It was meant to be more upscale with higher prices to match. However its Asian-European fusion menu didn't really appeal to us so we didn't try it out.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

The hotel also offered two themed dinners that we partook in.

The first was a Caribbean beach BBQ and it was not to miss. It cost $65 and included a buffet of salads and fresh-off-the-grill meat and seafood including lobster. This was definitely the tastiest meal we had on site at a relatively good value.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

The second was sushi night and it was a huge letdown especially considering how much the staff had hyped it up. While our expectations weren't very high the meal was so bad that my companion and I left to eat at 20 Knots instead.

The prices were comparable to what you'd pay at a restaurant like Nobu — think $17 for a six-piece vegetable roll $7 for a piece of tuna nigiri and $26 for a miso cod bite. But the quality was far from it. Our lobster and spicy salmon rolls were drenched in heavy sauces and the fish tasted off. (Not to mention the order took an hour to come out.)

There are a total of three bars with the main one being Bohio. There was often live music here and this is also where the sushi bar was located. Cocktails cost $16 mocktails cost $8 and beers were $6 to $8.

There is another bar on the beach right by 20 Knots.

And finally there is the Rhum Room an ultra-chic rum-and-cigar lounge. There was a dedicated ""rummelier"" who had extensive knowledge of the more than 100 varieties on hand.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

I'm not usually a big rum drinker but I thoroughly enjoyed my fruity ""Guabanacex Sour"" cocktail ($18) and learned a lot from my tasting session. The presentation was also wonderful.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

If you preferred to eat in the privacy of your room or balcony there was 24-hour room service available with no delivery fee. There was even a continental breakfast option that guests could order for no additional charge.

Service

Service definitely matched my high expectations from the LXR brand.

Everyone I interacted with was friendly and seemed well-intentioned. I was greeted by name throughout the stay and the beach attendants knew that I wanted a chair in a sunny spot each day.

Upon arrival there was a Diamond welcome gift waiting for me: a fruit plate and bottle of prosecco. During our days on the beach the staff brought around fruit skewers cold towels and once even free cucumber cocktails. Nightly turndown service was automatically provided and always included freshly baked cookies and water bottles.

The service deteriorated a bit as the hotel's occupancy went up but I'll give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and assume it was because it had recently reopened and wasn't fully staffed yet.

Accessibility

The resort did not cater well to those with disabilities.

There were no specially adapted accessible rooms and the property lacked some key accessibility features like a pool lift Braille signage ramps for all public spaces and grab bars in the bathrooms. As mentioned the resort was set on a steep hill so those with mobility concerns probably would need to call up a golf cart to get around.

Overall impression

All in all my first experience with the LXR brand was a success. The Zemi Beach House has beautiful grounds and the service was top-notch. This is not your run-of-the-mill Hilton.

The resort was generally quiet and relaxing and although there were family-friendly amenities like a kids club it didn't feel overly family-focused making it perfect for couples and families alike. While getting there wasn't a total breeze the island had an exclusive feeling and ultimately wasn't that far especially considering the new nonstop flight options from the U.S. My Hilton elite status didn't go very far but I still felt like I got terrific value from my free night certificates and points.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3RyYXZlbC9kaXNjb3Zlci9wcm9wZXJ0eS9GbG9yaWRhLVVTL0RlbHJheS1CZWFjaC9UaGUtUmF5LUhvdGVsLURlbHJheS1CZWFjaC1DdXJpby1Db2xsZWN0aW9uLUJ5LUhpbHRvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Ray Hotel Delray Beach Curio Collection by Hilton | The Hotel Collection | Amex Travel,"*Terms and Conditions

Please note access to the benefit may take up to 24 hours to take effect on your Card after Account opening. Purchases by both the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However the total amount of statement credits for eligible purchases will not exceed $200 per calendar year per Card Account. Fine Hotels + Resorts® program bookings may be made only by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic Platinum and Additional Platinum Card Members. The Hotel Collection bookings may be made by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic and Additional Platinum Card Members and Companion Platinum Card Members on the Platinum Card Account. Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card Members are not eligible for the benefit. To receive the statement credits an eligible Card Member must make a new booking using their eligible Card through American Express Travel on or after July 1st 2021 that is prepaid (referred to as ""Pay Now"" on amextravel.com and the Amex App) for a qualifying stay at an available participating Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection property.

Eligible bookings do not include interest charges cancellation fees property fees or other similar fees or any charges by a property to you (whether for your booking your stay or otherwise).

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. Please refer to AmericanExpress.com/FHR and AmericanExpress.com/HC for more information about Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection respectively.

Home 2 Suites by Hilton Shenzhen Bao’an is located in the Bao’an district and offers convenient access to major transport hubs.

The Home 2 Suites brand was launched in 2009 and has surpassed its 500th hotel milestone globally. It aims to allow travellers to maintain their everyday lifestyles with flexible room configurations and home-like amenities. The rooms include a modular kitchenette and flexible workspace with a ‘working wall’.

Other amenities include a daily complimentary breakfast with Chinese and Western dishes a 24-hour market offering food drinks and other essentials a fitness centre and laundry room and a multi-functional lobby which includes café Coffee 2 Tea.

The group said that the launch is driven by the rising demand for extended-stay experiences and that China is experiencing “buoyant domestic travel demand” along with a “continued urbanisation of second- and third-tier cities.”

A recent report from Hilton revealed that reservations increased by approximately 30 per cent compared to 2019 in the group’s extended-stay bookings.

As such Hilton has partnered with Funyard a subsidiary of Country Garden to develop over 1000 properties in China over the next 30 years which includes a pipeline of over 60 Home 2 Suites properties in major business districts and transport hubs of China’s first tier cities provincial capitals and emerging markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbWF5c3ZpbGxlLW9ubGluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMTk1MzU3L25ld3MtdG8taG90ZWxzLWZvcm1lci1lbnF1aXJlci1idWlsZGluZy1vbi1uYXRpb25hbC1yZWdpc3RyedIBbWh0dHBzOi8vbWF5c3ZpbGxlLW9ubGluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMTk1MzU3L25ld3MtdG8taG90ZWxzLWZvcm1lci1lbnF1aXJlci1idWlsZGluZy1vbi1uYXRpb25hbC1yZWdpc3RyeS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News to hotels former Enquirer building on National Registry,"The former Cincinnati Enquirer building at 617 Vine Street is now home to The Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites hotels.

Embedded in the floor of the former Cincinnati Enquirer building is a brass marker.

The former Cincinnati Enquirer building now two hotels is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Polished black and gray marble floors shimmering bronze elevator doors and meticulously painted ornate ceilings. The first-floor lobby of The Enquirer Building at 617 Vine Street in Cincinnati may look the same as it did when the newspaper was housed under its roof but its function has shifted.

No longer home to the newspaper publication it now hosts travelers in the form of two hotels a Hampton Inn and a Homewood Suites.

Opened in early 2015 the two Hilton hotels share the ground-floor lobby as well as the next two floors. Although they have separate registration and breakfast areas other amenities are shared: a fitness room a recreation room a bar a library and conference rooms.

The suites situated on the fourth through eighth floors are spacious and designed to accommodate travelers on extended stays. The hotel rooms are located on the top floors.

Original windows facing Vine on the first four floors remain. The thematic decor throughout pays homage to not just the newspaper but also to the city of Cincinnati.

Designed by architects Lockwood Greene and Company the 14-story limestone building was built in the early 1900s.

Entrance to the building is gained on the ground floor and a grand staircase or elevators may be used to access the second story which functioned as the advertising and marketing area for the newspaper.

At one time the building housed both the printing operation and the offices. In 1979 the paper’s printing location moved to the intersection of Western Avenue and Liberty Street. The offices followed moving in 1992 to Elm Street.

In recognition of the building’s architecture and historical significance it earned a spot on the US Register of National Historic Places.

And thanks to its location it’s conveniently within walking distance of many downtown attractions including several restaurants Fountain Square and the Aronoff Center for the Arts.

Merry Monroe Holiday window painting,"On a chilly blustery day in December the windows in the downtown Village of Monroe came alive with holiday spirit.

Families teens and young children came out to share their creative vision with the community. More than a dozen windows were painted with characters from Frosty the Snowman to Charlie Brown The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as several original designs.

The project was sponsored by the Monroe Downtown Revitalization Committee who provided the paint and assembled a panel of judges to award prizes generously donated by local businesses including Amendola’s Bossi’s Bakery The Depot Cigar and Candle Shop Empire Diner Flagship Cinemas Planet Pizza and Plum House Sushi. Home Depot donated painting supplies including brushes drop cloths painter’s tape and more.

The award for Best Overall Design went to Donna and Sofia Lappetito for their Charlie Brown Christmas design.

“Monroe Free Library patrons and staff are enjoying our amazing painted windows” said Mary Duffy the library’s assistant director. “Not only at the library but each painted store window brings so much holiday spirit to our Village. Thank you to all the contest participants and the Monroe Downtown Revitalization Committee for making our Village even more merry and bright this holiday season”

Added: Monroe resident Peggy Kazdan: “It was so much fun to be a part of this day to bring winter festivity to Downtown Monroe.”

If you're anything like me then you'll probably also get a kick out of these interior paint color names. I combed through some popular paint brand collections and chose the ones that made me giggle—and in some cases roll my eyes. Admittedly whoever is in the interior paint-naming industry seems to be a little less pun-prone and definitely less risqué than whoever names nail polishes ( and don't have anything on Dead Salmon and Disco Nap for example) but there are certainly some clever and fun ones. Plus I'm starting to believe the weirder the name the prettier the color so this is also a good place to be if you need paint inspiration.

Either 1) Drink every time you cringe laugh or think of an obscure pop culture reference 2) write down the first thing each name makes you think of and use the results as a Rorschach Test or 3) send this to friends and have everyone submit haikus with their favorite combinations of the paint color names and the best one wins...

But perhaps none quite like the one that's taken hold today.

There are excavators and bulldozers seemingly everywhere pushing dirt into tall piles and leaving everything -- and everyone -- covered in a coat of wind-blown dust. The space they are carving out of the desert floor will house a long list of new factories that were ordered up by anxious CEOs across the world when the pandemic roiled their global supply routes.

Ambu a Danish medical device maker is erecting a facility on the outskirts of the city. Several miles away Keeson Technology Corp. a Chinese furniture maker is building a second plant here just months after opening its first. Boyd Corp. a California-based conglomerate recently inaugurated one factory and plans to build three more. And MGA Entertainment a California-based toymaker began cranking out Little Tikes Cozy Coupes from its plant last month even before construction crews had cleared out debris piles or paved the parking lot.

What's the rush at MGA?

The company has 750 containers of toys stuck in supply-chain hell at ports around Los Angeles. Produced in China those items were supposed to be on U.S. store shelves this holiday season. That won't happen says Isaac Larian MGA's chief executive officer. But the Juarez plant is now shipping two truckloads of toys into the U.S. each day and that number will soon grow to 10. What's more Larian plans to break ground on a second factory in Mexico next year and will begin shifting some of MGA's Chinese production to these plants.

""We have big ambitions and big plans for Mexico"" he says.

This in the lingo of corporate executives is near-shoring one of the biggest economic transformations sparked by the pandemic: Shrink the length of the supply chain to keep production closer to its final destination and reduce the risk of some snag messing things up along the way. A shorter chain is a stronger chain the thinking now goes and there's a growing sense that this new approach will remain in vogue in C-suites long after Covid fades.

For the multinationals that do business in the red-hot U.S. economy near-shoring often means northern Mexico where labor costs are cheap land is plentiful and the border is just a short ride away. El Paso Texas is less than 10 miles to the north of most of the new plants in Juarez.

Other border cities -- Tijuana along the west coast and Reynosa Matamoros and Piedras Negras far to the east -- are undergoing similar industrial booms providing a much-needed lift to a Mexican economy that has been slow to recover from last year's collapse.

For more than half a century now the factories in these cities have been a key cog in the U.S. supply chain. Known in the industry as maquiladoras they take imported parts assemble them into consumer and industrial products and then ship them north.

When NAFTA the free trade deal between the U.S. Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994 multinationals set up maquiladoras at a frenetic pace. Juarez alone is home to plants owned by General Electric Honeywell International Bosch Foxconn Technology Siemens and Electrolux among others.

Years later the region began to stagnate when China entered the World Trade Organization. Many companies pulled out of Mexico and set up shop in China where labor costs were even lower. Flareups of gruesome narco violence along the border only added to the exodus.

China kept stealing U.S. market share from Mexico right up until Donald Trump took office in Washington. When he started slapping tariffs on Chinese-made products Mexico suddenly looked pretty attractive again to executives. Then the pandemic came along and turbocharged the shift. Keeson the furniture maker is Exhibit A for this: It first made plans to open a factory in Juarez shortly after Trump launched his trade war against Beijing and it sped up those plans by a full year when Covid hit.

""Manufacturing is coming back for sure"" says Jason Tolliver a managing director who helps oversee logistics and industrial services in the Americas for real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield PLC. The conversations he's having with corporate leaders he says indicate this wave of investment along the border is just beginning. ""It is structural and it's long term.""

The boom is so intense in Juarez that industrial real estate is suddenly getting tight: 98% of existing space is already leased and the price has jumped more than 20% over the past year to about $5.25 per square foot according to Jesse Melendez a director at industrial real estate company Intermex.

Intermex is rushing to cash in. It's leasing out 5 million square feet more of factory space in the city today than it did a year ago and it's building four additional factory sites. They will be tightly clustered in what is now just a barren field on the city's southwestern edge.

As excited as Melendez is about the boom he's already mentally preparing for the bust that often follows. ""In my career I've typically seen the valleys and peaks seven to 10 years apart"" he says. He figures the slowdown will begin by 2024.

As Melendez drove through the city on a recent weekday afternoon that seemed like a distant thought. ""Hiring"" signs kept popping up all around him -- on the facades of factories on buses in shop windows.

This is what lured Efrain Gonzalez back to Juarez from his native Veracruz in the south.

People associate Mexican migrants with the U.S. labor market but the truth is many of them like Gonzalez end their journeys just miles south of the border especially when the maquiladoras are humming like they are now.

The factory jobs offer pay that while a fraction of typical U.S. wages is markedly higher than what the migrants can earn back home in the impoverished south of Mexico. And they don't have to worry about getting deported.

Gonzalez 49 earns a little over $80 a week plus benefits like free lunch at the Keeson plant which produces the company's Ergomotion adjustable beds. He said he knew he'd find work as soon as he set foot back in Juarez a few months ago. The sight of all the new factories going up made that clear. ""There's a lot of work here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmlvZGllc2VsbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3BpbGxhcnMtb2YtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMjUxNzg5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pillars of New Production,"2025 International Biomass Conference & Expo

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Photo: Shelby American

The 1967 Shelby GT 500 was the first model built in the Shelby GT 500 range and was based on the 1967 Mustang and equipped with a 7.0-liter Police-Interceptor V8 powerplant. It produced 355 hp and 420 lb-ft (569 Nm) of torque. One year later in 1968 Ford began utilizing a more potent version of the aforementioned 7.0-liter powerhouse with a unique 16-bolt pattern exhaust face naming it ""The Cobra Jet."" Consequently the Cobra GT500 KR was born with the initials ""KR"" standing for ""King of the Road."" Only 1200 units were ever built in its less than one-year production run.The second iteration of the GT500KR nameplate came many years later first revealed in 2007 at the New York International Auto Show for the 2008 model year. It featured a modular supercharged and intercooler version of the GT500 V8 engine in this configuration producing 547 hp and 510 lb-ft (691 Nm) of torque. The model continues to be a rare sight on the road having a production run of about 1700 units.The big surprise for enthusiasts came recently when Shelby American announced the return of one of their most famous vehicles the Ford Shelby GT500KR Mustang in honor of the company's 60th anniversary next year. The third reincarnation of this icon will either be sold as a standalone model or a post-title upgrade package for the 2020-2022 Shelby GT500. The main caveat is that the vehicle will be produced in extremely limited numbers.The vehicle will become their most powerful ever production model the 2022 Shelby GT500KR Mustang getting its muscle from a heavily tuned version of the GT500's 5.2-liter V8 and developing a whopping 900 hp thanks to a 3.8-liter Whipple supercharger. Other engineering advancements include the addition of a high-volume supercharger intercooler and heat exchanger an upgraded cold air intake uprated half-shafts and not least a Borla exhaust system.The chassis and suspension setups are not forgotten the new GT500KR getting height-adjustable front and rear springs upgraded sway bars and a recalibrated MagneRide suspension system. The vehicle sits proudly on a pair of Shelby one-piece 6061-T6 forged aluminum wheels measuring 20x11 inches up front and 20x11.5 inches at the rear enveloped by high-performance rubber.Exterior improvements include a fully-functional lightweight dry carbon fiber hood working wonders cooling the supercharged engine bay a pair of side vents pulling heat off the exhaust manifold. Additional carbon fiber is utilized on the redesigned front splitter gurney flap and rear diffuser. There will also be a lot of 60th anniversary badging but that will be reserved only for the 2022 models. Optionally buyers will be able to opt for an even more aggressive widebody kit a polished supercharger painted stripes and even a rear seat delete.Although past iterations of the Shelby GT500KR were produced in four-figure numbers the 2022 ""King of the Road"" will be even more limited than that. Shelby plans to offer only 60 upgrade packages worldwide for existing models at a starting price of $54995. Furthermore only 225 GT500KR's will be built for the 2022 year starting from $127895 a price that takes into consideration the only base GT500 configuration.In other words playing with the options list can get even more expensive than that but for the right buyers these numbers are entirely worth it.

The supercharged ‘Stang celebrates Shelby American’s 60th anniversary.

(Shelby American)

The Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR or “King of the Road” is returning to reclaim its muscle car throne for only the third time in over half a century.

(Shelby American)

In honor of Shelby American’s 60th anniversary American automotive legend Carroll Shelby’s namesake company announced a limited-edition souped-up version of what’s already Ford’s most potent ‘Stang.

(Shelby American)

The King of the Road package was first introduced in 1968 and revived only one other time from 2008 to 2009.

While the last Shelby GT500KR produced 540 horsepower Car and Driver reports that this one’s upgraded 5.2-liter V8—aspirated by a 3.8-liter supercharger—will crank out 900-plus horsepower on 93-octane fuel.

(AP) — The jury that will weigh 11 charges of fraud and conspiracy against former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes finally got the case Friday afternoon after a three-month trial that captivated Silicon Valley.

The hand-off came after lawyers for the opposing sides wrapped up a second day of painstaking final arguments to sum up their respective interpretations of the evidence submitted to the jury. That included the testimony of 32 witnesses — including Holmes herself — and more than 900 exhibits.

The eight men and four women on the jury began their deliberations late on Friday and will take the weekend off before resuming Monday morning to decide whether Holmes turned her blood-testing startup into a massive scam. If convicted on all counts Holmes 37 could face up to 20 years in prison.

In his final attempt to persuade the jury to acquit Holmes lawyer Kevin Downey likened her final days running a then-reeling Theranos to a captain valiantly trying to save a sinking ship.

Had Holmes committed any crimes she would have been scurrying to jump overboard like a scared rat Downey told jurors as he wrapped up roughly five hours of closing arguments. Federal prosecutors spent three hours Thursday explaining why the jury should convict her.

Referring to a 2016 turning point that threatened to ruin Theranos Downey asked the jury: “Did she leave? No she stayed. Why? Because she believed in this technology.""

As he did Thursday Downey again depicted Holmes as a well-meaning entrepreneur who never stopped trying to perfect Theranos’ blood-testing technology and use it to improve health care.

“She believed she was building a technology that would change the world"" Downey proclaimed Friday.

Federal prosecutor John Bostic offered a rebuttal arguing that Holmes made her attempts to salvage Theranos under intense scrutiny that gave her few other options. He cited evidence to argue that she consistently sought to deceive people whenever she thought she could get away with her alleged ruse.

“At so many forks in the road she chose the wrong path"" Bostic said.

Bostic's rebuttal echoed many of the themes touched upon in Thursday's arguments when fellow prosecutor Jeffrey Schenk cast Holmes as a charlatan who brazenly lied to become rich and famous. Those purported goals were achieved in 2014 when Holmes became a media sensation with an estimated fortune of $4.5 billion based on her 50% stake in Theranos.

The trial revolves around allegations that Holmes duped investors business partners and patients about Theranos' technology. She repeatedly claimed that the company's new testing device could scan for hundreds of diseases and other problems with a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick instead of a needle stuck in a vein.

The concept was so compelling that Theranos and Holmes were able to raise more than $900 million some of that from billionaire investors such as media magnate Rupert Murdoch and software titan Larry Ellison. The Palo Alto California company also negotiated potentially lucrative deals with major retailers Walgreens and Safeway. Holmes soon began to grace national magazine covers as a wunderkind.

Unknown to most people outside Theranos the company’s blood-testing technology was flawed often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients who took the tests.

After the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016 Theranos eventually collapsed. The Justice Department filed its criminal case in 2018.

“People lost money"" Downey acknowledged Friday. “That is a bad event and a failure on (Holmes') part."" But he added none of it was criminal.

Downey told the jury that Holmes didn't realize the scope of the problems until a Theranos laboratory director informed her in March 2016 that the company had to invalidate 60000 of its past blood tests.

Had Holmes thought any crimes been committed Downey posited she would have tried to cover them up and perhaps sell some of her stock. Not only did she never sell a share Downey said she continued to try to salvage the company. Her turnaround efforts included ousting Theranos' chief operating officer Sunny Balwani who also had been her lover.

In a dramatic turn on the witness stand last month Holmes testified that Balwani had been covertly controlling her diet her friendships and more while subjecting her to mental emotional and sexual abuse. Although the testimony cast Holmes as Balwani's pawn Downey never mentioned the alleged abuse and its effects on Holmes during his closing arguments.

The jury has been left to consider whether partner abuse may have affected some of her decisions at Theranos. In the prosecution's closing argument Schenk reminded the jurors that finding Holmes guilty of fraud won't mean they discounted her abuse allegations.

Bostic revisited the issue Friday telling the jurors they shouldn't allow sympathy to sway their decision on the fraud charges. “There is an extensive record for the charges of fraud in this case"" he said. “There is much less evidence of what happened between Miss Holmes and Mr. Balwani.""

Balwani's lawyer adamantly denied Holmes' accusations in court documents that the jury never saw. Jurors also never heard from Balwani who intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination had been called to testify. Balwani 56 faces similar fraud charges in a separate trial scheduled to begin in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5oYXJ0cy04MDAtaHAtYXVkaS1ycy1xOC13aWxsLWdpdmUtaHlwZXJjYXJzLW5pZ2h0bWFyZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,800-HP Audi RSQ8 Will Give Hypercars Nightmares,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5oYXJ0cy04MDAtaHAtYXVkaS1ycy1xOC13aWxsLWdpdmUtaHlwZXJjYXJzLW5pZ2h0bWFyZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

So when a vintage IBM I/O Tester came into their possession a full machine makeover was all but inevitable.

The I/O Tester dates from around 1965 which roughly coincides with the introduction of IBM’s lauded System/360 computer mainframe. In addition to the computer itself business customers could order a variety of peripherals with their computing system. These included storage devices printers additional operator consoles and so on. Since these peripherals shared the same I/O design a portable hardware testing rig was a sensible design choice. One portable low-voltage tester could be paired with any number of IBM peripherals doing away with the need to have unique debugging panels on every piece of computing hardware.

Fast forward to the present day and the IBM I/O Tester looks positively antique with its blinkenlight lamp panel and switches. To use the tester simply connect up one (or both) of its chunky 104-pin connectors to your IBM peripheral of choice insert the accompanying paper overlay and voilà. Operators could then observe the status of the many lamps to evaluate the inner digital workings of the connected peripheral. Depending on the connected hardware the tester could reveal the contents of data registers printing status disk and tape transfer status and probably much more. The purpose of the tester’s ninety indicator lights is completely dependent on the attached peripheral and the paired paper overlays are essential to comprehend their meaning.

After [Ken Shirriff] deciphered the documentation it wasn’t long before the tester could be powered up using 24 VAC (normally supplied by the equipment being tested). Several burned out lamps were noted for replacement. The lamp assemblies required minor surgery due to a dubious design choice and at least one of the toggle switches needed a new guide and a heavy dose of contact cleaner before it came back to life.

For the moment [CuriousMarc] is using the blinkenlights panel as a surprisingly striking retro clock. With a literal truckload of vintage IBM hardware sitting in his storage it’ll be exciting to see whether this restored tester will be pulled back into operational service someday.

Pete was born January 31 1943 in Oil City PA. He is survived by his wife of 57 years Vivian Lukasiak. He is also survived by his daughter Sandy Chaney (Brett) of Frederick MD; and his son Chris Lukasiak (Canyon) of Franklin TN. He is survived by his grandchildren Jessica Chaney (Frederick MD) Gabriel Lukasiak (Marta) (Leesburg VA) Joshua Zachary Benjamin and Hope Lukasiak all of Franklin TN; and great-grandchildren Senna and Enzo Lukasiak of Leesburg VA. Pete is also survived by his siblings Michael Lukasiak of Leeper PA Mark Lukasiak of Oil City PA and Matt Lukasiak of Rehoboth Beach DE. Pete was greeted in heaven by his parents Virginia and Stanley; his siblings Judith Lukasiak Samuel Lukasiak Judd Lukasiak and Mary English; as well as his grandson Bryan Chaney.

Pete grew up as the oldest of eight in a lively household in Oil City PA. He was educated in the Catholic school system of Oil City PA where he enjoyed football girls and sports cars. Pete joined the Air Force out of high school and spent 3 ½ years serving in Germany during the early Vietnam era. Following his time in the service he began his college career at The University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh PA through the GI bill gathering a young wife and child along the way. Pete loved to tell everyone the stories of taking his young daughter to enjoy cookies from the bakeries of Pittsburgh while taking her along to classes as Vivian worked nightshifts as a nurse.

Once out of college Pete began a career for IBM where he worked for many years as a technical editor then a writer and was reassigned a few times in various areas of the country ultimately ending up in Frederick County MD. His children Sandy & Chris developed a love/hate relationship with those red felt pen editor marks on their school papers he edited.

He grew to love Frederick County and was active in his children’s sports activities. One more move requirement from IBM had Pete rethinking his career path since he was not willing to leave Frederick County and he began work at this point for trade associations in the greater DC area.

Pete was a DC Road warrior for many years - 270 and the Beltway were his daily regimens before the days of remote work or cell phones were even beginning to be a possibility! His first stop was The Aluminum Association in Washington DC where he quickly learned that industry and made many friends. He then moved over to the National Auto Dealers Association in McLean VA where he helped manage some of their publications.

Following NADA Pete was asked to lead the National Auto Auction Association as its executive director moving the association to what was then the quiet hamlet of Urbana Maryland in a historic building. Pete led the association for over 14 years and helped to grow their size and influence. More importantly he made great friends throughout the industry and traveled all over for conferences and speaking engagements. He used to joke that he had to check the telephone book in the nightstand of his hotel room when he woke up in the morning to remember where he was.

Pete then transitioned to lead the Pennsylvania Independent Auto Dealers Association in Harrisburg PA for several years until his retirement. He moved his road warrior act north to Harrisburg each day rather than DC - perhaps an easier commute for traffic but certainly not shorter. In his retirement after many years of road and airplane travel Pete enjoyed a quiet retirement tending his yard and enjoying his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

A celebration of Pete’s life will be held at 4 p.m. on Saturday January 29th close to what would have been his 79th birthday at Stauffer Funeral Home 1621 Opossumtown Pike Frederick. The family will receive friends from 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday at the funeral home.

Researchers say China’s improvements in quantum computing will help its armed forces which are the world’s third strongest.

Quantum computing is a kind of computing that lets high-powered machines solve problems that are too difficult for normal computers.

The idea for quantum computing was discovered by American physicist Richard Feynman in 1980. International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a 2019 study that it has two important military uses. It can understand secret military messages and it can break into secure communications.

Alexander Vuving is a professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific center for security studies in Hawaii. He said he thinks China spends a lot of money on research and development. He also said that the government uses private civilian companies to develop its military.

Last month consulting business Booz Allen Hamilton said that within 10 years Chinese “threat groups” will gather information that permits quantum computers to find new valuable materials. These could include drugs and chemicals.

China on the move

It is not known how far Chinese researchers have developed quantum computing. The U.S. defense department’s 2021 report to Congress on China says the Asian superpower continues to seek leadership in important technologies with possible military uses.

The report added that China’s 14th Five-Year Plan an economic plan pushes quantum technology in many fields.

Heather West is a researcher with market research business IDC in Massachusetts. She said Quantum computing could help find hidden “military vehicles.” It could also permit countries to gain more information about other country’s militaries.

Vuving said quantum computing around the world is at a “nascent stage.” But many countries are in a race to develop it. He said they include the United States India Japan and Germany in addition to China. He said anyone in the lead would likely not last long as competitors would quickly copy their improvements.

Multiple countries at risk?

Chen Yi-fan is an assistant professor of diplomacy and international relations at Tamkang University in Taiwan. Chen said “Taiwan the United States or the European Union are all likely targets for China to launch quantum computing attacks as long as countries do not have robust quantum cryptography to defend.”

In August 2020 the administration of then-President Donald Trump National Science Foundation and Department of Energy announced a plan to spend $625 million over five years on quantum research and development.

“We’re seeing a lot of research and development going into the Department of Defense in the U.S.” West said. She said “I don’t think they would be pouring money into it if they didn’t think there was that potential.”

Carl Thayer is a retired professor of politics at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He said smaller countries could not compete with China’s quantum computing resources. He added that they would need engineers technicians and money.

Exclusive: Rishi Sunak under pressure over California talks with healthcare firms last week

Rishi Sunak is under growing pressure to say who he met in California last week after it emerged he sat down for talks with American healthcare firms.

The Chancellor jetted off just as Omicron got its grips into the UK but was forced to cut his trip short flying back on Friday for crisis talks with hospitality leaders.

Labour has called on Mr Sunak to publish all his meetings in the sunny state after the Mirror revealed he missed a virtual roundtable with pub and restaurant chiefs.

Instead he met with US healthcare company Grail owned by Illumina for which David Cameron is a paid adviser to learn about tech being rolled out to NHS patients.

Fears the Government plans to sell off parts of the NHS are mounting after the Health and Care Bill - dubbed the NHS Corporate Takeover Bill - was pushed through the Commons.

The new legislation could allow private health care representatives to sit on NHS boards.

Pat McFadden Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury has urged the Chancellor to reveal his work diary for his time in California.

MPs are required to publish details of any external meetings - and must have an official present for all discussions relating to Government business.

In his letter to the Chancellor Mr McFadden said: “It is not clear why you left the country in the midst of all this.

“The impact of the latest situation on business was already well underway by Tuesday of this week.”

The driver lists names such as Arc A380 Arc A350 Arc A370M Arc A350M and Xe A200M which are likely to be low-end parts. We are also getting to hear that the upcoming DG3 Elasti Battlemage lineup will transition to a multi-GPU architecture in 2023 similar to AMD's RDNA 3.

4 Reviews

Recently we have seen information about how Intel is likely to segment the Arc Alchemist DG2 lineup. Intel is expected broadly classify Arc Alchemist offerings into SOC1 and SOC2 lineups that target a broad range of competitor GPUs such as from the Nvidia GeForce MX450 on laptops all the way to the RTX 3070 on desktops. Now we are getting to know the likely marketing nomenclature of Arc Alchemist cards thanks to information from Intel's own driver.

Intel's test driver version 30.0.101.9999 contains references to five Arc Alchemist cards viz. the Arc A380 Arc A350 Arc A370M Arc A350M and Xe A200M. We have seen the Arc A380 referenced in a benchmark leaked by TUM_APISAK before so this particular naming scheme is very well legit. Also the Arc A380 in that leak was shown to feature 6 GB VRAM but we know that Intel has up to 16 GB offerings on the anvil.

That being said the above GPUs aren't the only ones that Intel would be offering next year. The naming scheme suggests that the A3xx series would pertain to the entry-level models. We expect to see at least five variants each with 512 384 256 128 and 96 execution units (EUs). While SOC1 would be comprised of GPUs with 512 384 and 256 EUs SOC2 will include 128 and 96-EU SKUs.

Performance numbers with Arc Alchemist are anybody's guess at this point. We expect to see more leaks in the run up to launch. However Intel seems to be already focusing on Arc Alchemist's successor Arc Battlemage codenamed DG3 Elasti.

According to information from YouTuber Tom from Moore's Law is Dead who's had considerable success in leaking Arc-related information so far Arc Battlemage will aim straight for the upcoming top dogs from Nvidia and AMD. Arc Battlemage may very well transition to a multi-GPU architecture similar to what is being expected from AMD RDNA 3.

Apparently Intel wanted to go all guns blazing with DG2 but efficiency issues led them to do an ""RDNA 1"" with DG2. Besides we are also hearing that the 256-EU Alchemist part will be a straight 50% slice from the top-end 512-EU chip as Intel wants does not want to have any low-performing tiers in the entire lineup. Any low-clocking chips would get an EU cut and get transferred to the next lower tier. This explains why the company wanted to test waters with mid-range cards first before venturing into flagship dGPUs.

Of course this is just preliminary information and things are not entirely set in stone at this point. But the learnings from Arc Alchemist will be extremely valuable for Intel if they indeed have plans to disrup the flagship dGPU space with Battlemage in 2023.

Nine Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake-P Laptop CPUs Leaked & Benchmarked Within Geekbench Strong Single & Multi-Threaded Performance

The Intel Alder Lake-P series will be replacing the entire Tiger Lake-H45 H35 and UP3 portfolio of chips. It will max out at 14 cores in the top SKU which will comprise 6 Golden Cove cores & 8 Grace Mont cores. The parts replacing the Tiger Lake-U15 series will feature 2 Golden Cove cores and 8 Gracemont cores. The chips will pack both GT2 and GT3 Xe configurations with up to 96 Execution units.

Intel Alder Lake-P U/H Series Configurations:

2 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (U15) 4 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (U28) 6 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (U28) 4 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (H45) 6 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (H45) 6 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU (H45)



Other features of the platform will include support for Thunderbolt 4 PCIe Gen 5.0 lanes & WiFi 6E. When it comes to memory support the Intel Alder Lake-P chips will get both LPDDR5 and DDR5 configurations. It is likely that Intel will release Alder Lake-P first with LPDDR5 variants while the higher-end Tiger Lake-H successors will come outfitted with DDR5 memory.

Starting with the lineup there are six 45W (H45) and three 28W (U28) chips that have been leaked within Geekbench. These include the flagship Core i9-12900HS with 14 cores / 20 threads at up to 5.0 GHz Core i7-12700H with 14 cores / 20 threads at up to 4.9 GHz Core i7-12700H with 14 cores / 20 threads at up to 4.6 GHz Core i7-12650H with 10 cores / 16 threads at up to 4.5 GHz. The Core i5 lineup is comprised of the 12500H and 12450H both featuring 12 cores / 16 threads & 8 cores / 12 threads respectively.

Moving down to the Intel Alder Lake-P U28 series we have the Core i7-1280P with 14 cores / 20 threads at up to 4.7 GHz Core i7-1260P with 12 cores / 16 threads at up to 4.6 GHz and the Core i5-1240P with the same core configuration but at a lower 4.4 GHz boost clock.

Comparing the overall CPU performance of these chips is still a bit messy considering all of the different laptop configurations these are featured within. Cooling configurations and OEM set power limits can affect performance too and to add to it further these chips aren't essentially retail variants but engineering samples. The sample size right now is also too small to provide an exact performance metric but the data shared by Videocardz helps give an idea of where the 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake laptop CPUs are going to fall in against the competition.

The performance numbers posted above give us a rough idea of where the Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake CPU will land. In both single-core and multi-core performance the Intel lineup easily beats AMD's Ryzen 5000H lineup and will be very competitive against AMD's Ryzen 6000H lineup too as that one is based on an optimized Zen 3 core and not a new architecture with more cores. Expect more from Intel and its new laptop lineup at CES 2022 on 4th January.

The new budget has added $1 billion of wages and $1.4 billion worth of stock compensation. Most of it will go to current employees but some will be used to attract new hires.

Intel said in a statement that pay restructuring was ""designed to enable Intel to win the fierce battle for talent in today's competitive market"" according to The Oregonian which saw the presentation. It will ""reignite"" their culture and ""drive"" the company's business strategy.

In Oregon which houses some of Intel's largest manufacturing facilities the company pays about $4.6 billion annually to its 21000 local employees. Globally it has around 110000 employees.

The new budget has added $1 billion of wages and $1.4 billion worth of stock compensation. Shared evenly it would come out to about $20000 per employee.

It will however be directed disproportionately to employees with specialized knowledge and to high performers. Intel might be worried about its competitors poaching talent which is something Intel is itself infamous for.

According to various company-review sites historically Intel has had a habit of underpaying its technicians. Intel's meager annual raise features prominently in negative reviews of the company. The atmosphere on Intel's manufacturing line is also said to be tense; lately in particular. To that end Intel wants to relieve some of that tension with more paid time off and mental health support services.

Intel needs to make itself more appealing if it wants to attract enough workers to staff its many planned expansions which include a $3 billion addition to its Oregon campus a $7 billion fab in Malaysia their third Irish fab and a planned fab in Germany.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlb3MvMjAyMS0xMi0yMC9hY2VyLWNlby1vbi1jaGlwLWNydW5jaC1hbmQtaW50ZWwtcy1hc2lhLWludmVzdG1lbnQtdmlkZW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Acer CEO on Global Chip Shortage Intel's Asia Investment,"Why did this happen?

TSMC has treated Apple with kid gloves something that had top Intel executives flying over to Taiwan to discuss 3nm capacity as Intel plans to become one of TSMC's top customers by 2023 (more on that below). Apple has reportedly agreed with TSMC to take its complete first batch of 3nm production.

Apple accounts for over 25% of TSMC's revenue



In addition during a global chip shortage that changed the supply-demand balance in the industry TSMC raised the price it will charge Apple for its A-series SoCs by only 3% starting next month; other TSMC customers will have to deal with price hikes up to 20%. Thanks to a Bloomberg-DigiTimes report we now know much of TSMC's total business is Apple-related.

The report notes that Apple accounts for 25.9% of TSMC's business. Last year the chip manufacturer took in $45.51 billion in revenue which means that Apple's share of that business amounted to $11.4 billion. Second on the list is chip designer MediaTek and that firm was responsible for 5.8% of the foundry's gross. No other TSMC client makes up over 5% of its revenue.

AMD is third and makes up 4.4% of TSMC's top line. Next is Qualcomm which contributes 3.9% of TSMC's revenue. The remainder of the list includes Broadcom (3.8%) Nvidia (2.8%) Sony (2.5%) Marvell (1.4%) STM (1.4%) ADI (1.06%) and Intel (.84%). The latter's inclusion at the bottom of the list makes sense since Intel does have its own foundry but currently it is behind TSMC when it comes to the production of cutting-edge chips.





The U.S. chip designer reportedly flew out of Taiwan last Wednesday. Intel's Gelsinger also spoke with Axios on HBO recently and explained the push for obtaining 3nm capacity. ""Apple decided they could do a better chip themselves than we could"" Gelsinger said.""And you know they did a pretty good job.""





The executive was talking about the M-series chips that Apple designed (and were built by TSMC using its enhanced 5nm process node) to replace Intel components inside Macs. The M1 (16 billion transistors) the M1 Pro (33.7 billion transistors) and the M1 Max (57 billion transistors) were announced earlier this year. Apple does use the M1 on the iPad Pro.







Besides seeking 3nm capacity from TSMC Intel is interested in the foundry's 7nm 6nm and 5nm processes as it seeks to stop rival AMD (also a TSMC client) from encroaching on its market share.



Intel seeks to take back process leadership from TSMC and Samsung







Gelsinger added ""So what I have to do is create a better chip than they [Apple] can do themselves. I would hope to win back this piece of their business as well as many other pieces of business over time."" Intel also has announced plans to develop angstrom-scale chips and ramp up production of them in 2024. One angstrom (1A) is equivalent to .1nm and Intel is hoping that this innovation will make Intel the leading foundry able to produce chips carrying the highest number of transistors.







Intel used to be the leader in this department but both TSMC and Samsung have taken over while Intel has struggled. The general rule is that the smaller the process node the smaller the transistors that fit inside a chip. And that is important because as more transistors are placed inside a chip the more powerful and energy-efficient a chip is.





For example the Apple A4 SoC that powered the iPhone 4 in 2010 was built using TSMC's 45nm process node and it contained 1.3 billion transistors. The A15 Bionic that powers the iPhone 13 line contains 15 billion transistors each and is produced using tsmc's enhanced 5nm process node.







The big question for the industry is whether transistor size can continue to shrink allowing for more of them to fit inside a component as small as a chip. That is the key to the production of more powerful and energy-efficient chips. As for Intel it is expected to be TSMC's third-largest customer by 2023.



As a result Intel seeks to outsource some of its chip production to TSMC which explains the meeting held last week. Supposedly TSMC offered Intel production capacity at 4nm with testing done at 5nm. The meeting was held to ""avoid [Intel] fighting with Apple."" Among the Intel executives who traveled to Taiwan was CEO Pat Gelsinger who recorded a video before leaving for the country last week."

Black women are making power moves in the finance industry. According to MarketWatch Sharon Bowen has been appointed to serve as the New York Stock Exchange board chair.

The appointment is historic as it marks the first time a Black woman has served in the role. Bowen has broken barriers and changed the narrative surrounding representation in the finance space throughout her entire career. She made history as the first African American to serve as the Commissioner of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Before joining the CFTC she was selected by former President Barack Obama to serve as vice-chair and acting chair of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Bowen who holds degrees from the University of Virginia and Northwestern University has focused on transactional and corporate law throughout her career. She’s also been a fierce advocate for diversity and inclusion serving on the boards of organizations centered on civic engagement.

Bowen’s appointment comes as there has been a stagnancy surrounding racial and gender diversity in stock trading. Research shows Black women account for just over 10 percent of the finance industry. In 2017 at the age of 22 Lauren Simmons became the second African American woman trader in NYSE history.

“I think we have had enough time to make enough plans on what diversity looks like and what the importance of it is” she shared in a statement according to CNBC. “Working at the trading floor where all of my clients were white men I really felt like I had a social responsibility to go on and really make sure that more people were included at the table and more people were part of the conversation. A lot of what I do today is not just about personal finance but it is also about getting more people into the financial industry as a whole if they so choose.”

Reuters-Yonhap



By Park Jae-hyuk



Multiple global investment banks have promoted many of their Korean senior executives recently in light of the contribution of lucrative deals on the Korean market to their earnings this year according to industry officials Sunday.



The latest example of this was Credit Suisse (CS) which announced Wednesday that it had appointed both Shim Jong-min and Kim Sei-won as new managing directors ― a rank below partners.



Shim who was born in 1981 became the youngest managing director working at the Seoul offices of global investment banks. After working for Macquarie and Nomura he joined CS in 2014 and handled the sale of Asiana Airlines last year and the initial public offering (IPO) of KakaoBank this year. He also advised on Korean Air's sales of its in-flight meal and duty-free businesses Olive Young's pre-IPO IMM Private Equity's sale of Taihan Cable & Solution and SK E&S' issuance of redeemable convertible preferred shares.



Kim who worked for UBS and served as the chief financial officer of a local fashion firm Nanda advised on SK's investments in Vingroup and Masan Group as well as on Doosan's sales of its subsidiaries and Carlyle's investment in KB Financial Group. He also participated in Krafton's IPO allowing his company to make a handsome profit from the deal.

Goldman Sachs promoted Lee Seok-yong and Park Ji-eun to managing directors last month.



Since former Goldman Sachs Korea co-head Choi Dong-suk was appointed a managing director in 2010 this is the first time for Korean executives of the U.S. firm's Seoul office to be promoted to managing directors. Although Goldman Sachs appoints its new managing directors biennially the position is only allowed to 6 percent of its entire employees worldwide.



Lee who worked for Boston Consulting Group is known for his expertise in the tech media and telecommunication businesses ― he advised on Kakao Pay's IPO Coupang's listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the sale of Woowa Brothers.



Park who majored in economics and mathematics at Columbia University and earned a Master's in financial mathematics from New York University has specialized in derivatives markets.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Unfortunately almost half of our world’s children are at risk of not reaching their full developmental potential. The COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult for everyone but little is known about the long-term adverse impact this may have on the world’s most vulnerable children currently living in countries with ongoing threats of violence displacement and conflict. Unfortunately much of these dangers have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Peacebuilding initiatives particularly during the early childhood years are more important than ever as the international community prepares to navigate a post-pandemic world.

Special journal issue ""Love and Fear""

When looking for contributors to a special issue tackling the concepts of Love and Fear in the medical journal Comprehensive Psychoneuroendocrinology Sue Carter Distinguished University Scientist and Rudy Professor Emerita of Biology at Indiana University and an expert in the endocrinology of love reached out to Dr. James F. Leckman Neison Harris Professor in the Yale Child Study Center and Professor of Pediatrics to provide insight into the importance of early childhood peacebuilding initiatives that target young children and their families.

Love and peace across generations: Biobehavioral systems and global partnerships

Dr. Leckman assembled a team of experts and practitioners in the field of early childhood development (ECD) and peacebuilding around the globe including notable colleagues from Yale University and the Early Childhood Peace Consortium (ECPC) to partner with for this special journal issue. Yale contributors consist of Dr. James F. Leckman Catherine Panter-Brick Ph.D. Angelica Ponguta Ph.D. M.P.H. Rima Salah Ph.D. Franz J. Hartl J.D. Michael F. McCarthy M.A. and N. Shemrah Fallon. This international collaboration resulted in the seminal paper Love and Peace Across Generations: Biobehavioral Systems and Global Partnerships.



Linking early childhood development with neuroscience and peacebuilding

The paper emphasizes the importance of the early childhood years on a person’s lifelong development a focus that was widely championed by Yale Professor Emeritus of Psychology the late Edward Zigler widely known as the “founding father” of Head Start who was a pioneer in the field of early childhood development and a champion for the rights of children. The paper outlines in detail the link between neuroscience and peacebuilding particularly the influence that neuropeptides have in influencing social interactions attachment love fear trauma compassion and empathy. The paper also specifies the role of parents in providing nurturing environments. Furthermore the authors highlight successful early childhood development initiatives that have been implemented in conflict-affected countries as well as argue that it is imperative for our next generation of youth to play an active and leading role in peacebuilding initiatives.

When you pay attention to the beginning of a story you can change the whole story. Raffi Cavoukian singer and founder of Canada’s Centre for Child Honouring

Key action points

The authors call on the international community to address four key action points that support young children and their families:

expand political will and funding through advancement of the early childhood-related Sustainable Development Goals create a policy environment that supports nurturing care build capacity to promote ECD through multi-sectoral coordination and ensure accountability for ECD services increase research and foster global and regional leadership and action.

Scholars discuss policy options for regulating single-use plastic bags.

Font Size: A A A

Americans use 100 billion plastic bags every year. Only about 1 percent of these bags get recycled. The other 99 billion go to landfills or become litter which can cause harm in a number of ways. For example plastic bags produce toxins and break down into microplastics that enter the soil and waterways. In urban areas plastic bags can contribute to flooding by clogging storm drains.

Currently these urban tumbleweeds are unregulated at the federal level. To fill this void individual states and localities have taken various approaches to reducing plastic bag usage including by imposing taxes banning plastic bags and creating other incentives for reusable bag use.

Washington D.C. imposed the nation’s first plastic bag regulation in 2009 closely followed by Montgomery County Maryland. Today eight states—California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Maine New York Oregon and Vermont—and several localities have adopted some form of plastic bag regulation.

Although no federal plastic bag regulation exists experts see plastic waste reduction as a bipartisan issue. Several pieces of proposed and enacted legislation relating to plastic waste management received bipartisan support during the Trump Administration. One pending bill in the U.S. Congress proposes a framework to hold single-use plastic producers fiscally responsible for recycling products after consumer use and to phase out carryout plastic bags through a tax. During the COVID-19 pandemic however multiple industries have increased their reliance on plastics which has stalled momentum for the bill.

Despite this delay in federal plastic regulation in the United States several efforts are underway to try to regulate plastic bags at the international level. Two-thirds of United Nations member states have expressed willingness to enter a multilateral agreement to reduce plastic waste analogous to a Paris Agreement for plastics. Although the Biden Administration’s climate plan remains relatively vague on plastics reduction several major NGOs and multinational companies such as Coca-Cola have indicated support for international plastic reduction negotiations.

Perhaps such bipartisan and international support for plastic bag regulation will call the federal government to action in the United States. But some environmentalists argue that regulating plastic bags in the name of combating climate change would be largely symbolic since other types of single-use plastics and food waste contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than plastic bags. Others contend that plastic bag regulation can play an important role by creating social norms that can inspire further environmental regulatory efforts.

This week’s Saturday Seminar highlights research papers that explore various plastic bag regulations and offer possible lessons from these policies."

This is an important distinction.

Gender bias is one of the most common forms of unconscious bias in the workplace and women in the financial sector are particularly vulnerable to its implications. Men rarely set out to impede a woman’s success – because when it comes to performance we are equal. If of course we choose to be.

Diversity within the workplace has been proven to be beneficial for the long-term success of a company. In a world facing more complicated challenges similar to what was brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic the way we pull together and face the challenges in an immensely difficult operating environment is what makes us successful – there is simply no more room for gender politics.

At Invesco our client-centric approach enabled our EMEA business to grow in assets under management. We have been able to achieve this success by delivering for our clients through collaborative thinking a unified structure and by recognising that clients wish to consolidate their service providers.

Consolidation is a dynamic that will continue into 2022 with clients likely to reduce the number of providers and focus on limited partnerships. The global macro-outlook will however continue to be a challenge and asset managers will have to navigate volatility as the world moves past Covid.

The volatility is tempered somewhat by a slow return to normality – many of us are now back in the office and that is very good news for face-to-face collaboration. It is refreshing to be back together as one unified team bouncing ideas off each other and going the extra mile to deliver even more for our clients.

As a woman in finance a domain typically dominated by men I have always thrived by directing my focus on ensuring that we are supporting our clients in achieving their objective and delivering a consultative service. The willingness to learn from my clients and peers is a key component to progressing my career and pushing myself forward – but of course male or female there are times when everybody faces challenges in reaching the top.

When it comes to the ‘glass ceiling’ that women face there may well be circumstances where unconscious bias means that a man might prefer working with another man. We’re all social beings. But I believe those instincts very quickly dissipate when a woman steps up and delivers on the job.

When you give results that glass ceiling will ultimately shatter. My advice to women who want to climb the ladder is to find an ally who can help them navigate things – and push them to challenge the status quo. They can also act as a role model to learn how to gain confidence in your ideas. It is true that women are generally more ‘agreeable’ but if we leverage it to secure good outcomes for ourselves then we can achieve confidence in a different way.

With confidence the rest will follow – challenging yourself and those around you working outside of your comfort zone and advocating for even greater diversity within the workplace. It’s all there for the taking; as women we just need to realise there is still a difficult and long journey ahead but we should stay focused on achieving our ambitions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tLnNnL21lbnMtY29sbGVnZS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDEzNzI5ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Howard 79-57 North Carolina A&T (19 Dec 2021) Game Recap - - ESPN (SG),"NEWARK N.J. -- — Kyle Foster had 18 points and nine rebounds as Howard easily defeated North Carolina A&T 79-57 on Saturday.

Iron Mountain Associates developed The Colony subdivision and is now looking to off-load some of the excess land it owns in the area.

The Park City Council was very interested in the idea at last Thursday’s meeting.

If the deal is finalized the 218 acres of land that is being offered to the city would be added on to approximately 326 acres of land the city already owns in the area. A deed restriction would then be put on the property to preserve it as open space.

Mayor Andy Beerman said he highly encourages the council to pursue the deal after he leaves office next month.

“We are out of land to build on in Summit County"" he said. ""We’ve also seen that land take on incredible value. I think the motivation by those that wish to develop it is growing by the day and I think as we’ve seen some legal maneuverings at the legislature and other places to go after land with deed restrictions that frankly keeps me up at night. I know that we have these lands protected. I know that we’ve done a good job defending those approaches but I’m all for belt suspenders super glue duct tape everything to make sure that we have every possible layer of protection on these properties to make sure they stay open space as we’ve worked so hard for them to be.”

Mayor-Elect and current Councilor Nann Worel will step into Beerman’s shoes on January 4th. She also spoke in favor of the deal but asked what annual costs the city would be responsible for if it took over the land.

“I just think this is an incredible offer and very generous"" said Worel. ""My only question is for ongoing maintenance like weed abatement and whatever else you have to do to the land clearing out dead wood and that kind of thing is there any estimate of what that might add to the city’s expenses on the land?”

Summit Land Conservancy Executive Director Cheryl Fox told the council the organization is hoping to raise a stewardship endowment with help from neighboring property owners to minimize the cost to the city.

City Trails and Open Space Manager Heinrich Deters told Worel exact numbers would be calculated as the process moves along but annual maintenance is definitely something the council should keep an eye on.

“The idea behind this one is to do stewardship up front so you don’t add to that annual monitoring cost"" said Deters. ""That would be a one-time [payment] but the maintenance of the actual land yeah that’s a real cost and I can give you an estimate when we come back.”

If given final approval the deal would increase the city’s open space total to over 10000 acres.

With a thumbs-up from the council city staff is expected to continue its due diligence on the land and begin negotiating the terms of the deal with Iron Mountain Associates Summit Land Conservancy and Summit County.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlyb25tb3VudGFpbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvaGFycmluZ3Rvbi10by1sZWFkLWlyb24tcml2ZXItcG9saWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harrington to lead Iron River police | News Sports Jobs - The Daily News,"IRON RIVER — Curt T.

Just as black and white film made way for Technicolor and resolution reached high definition so too will the current annual accounting of energy consumption make way for the better optics on hourly accounting or what is known as 24/7 hourly matching. Consumers need to know if their electricity is renewable or not and unfortunately green electrons are not physically Technicolor green.

Not keeping it 100%

In 2017 Google became the first major company to match its annual electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy. Now the claim of “100% renewables” is not what a layman might expect as it doesn’t mean that 100% of Google’s consumption came from renewables but rather that Google purchased enough renewable energy to match its annual consumption in the form of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) via power purchase agreements (PPAs). Of course Google’s facilities were still connected to mixed-energy grids and utilized power produced by fossil fuels.

This is one of the problems with current EACs: A company can claim energy generated during the day at a solar farm in the middle of the night a year later effectively meaning green energy operates as brown storage. This can be seen as a form of “greenwashing” and means corporate PPAs do less to decarbonize the grid than assumed. Unfortunately many companies don’t even realize they’re “greenwashing.” As Dan Goldman co-founder and managing director of U.S. green investment fund Clean Energy Ventures said at TBB Berlin 2021 “there are companies out there that have no idea how to know their emissions.”

To Google’s credit the tech-giant realized that “100% renewable” should be synonymous with “0% non-renewable” and the latter remains an impossibility when grid-connected. When Google looked more closely at its consumption it realized that it had to go much further to reach 24/7. After all since renewables like solar and wind are variable (and Google’s data centers are not) hour to hour the company was still relying heavily on coal and gas from the grid. It is now spearheading the concept of 24/7 and has set itself the goal of operating on carbon-free energy (CFE) 24/7 by 2030.

That gap between renewables procurement and actual renewables impact on the grid “is taken by 24/7” said Olivier Corradi the creator of electricityMap and the CEO of Tomorrow. He argues that 24/7 means that you “can’t report zero if space and time are not matched. And that is a big step because right now we’re saying that zero is misrepresentative because we don’t have enough granularity.”

Why go 24/7?

Obviously 24/7 refers to a temporal shift from annual to hourly energy accounting but 24/7 calls for spatial accounting too. This two-pronged focus is key to 24/7’s ability to drive grid decarbonization. Not only should renewable electricity be consumed in the same hour it was procured (unless it comes from storage) but it should also be procured via the same network.

“As the percentage (of renewables) increases it will continue to become more and more important that we’re aware of where and when renewable power is placed onto the grid in order to maximize impact” Chris Pennington the director of energy and sustainability for U.S. data management company Iron Mountain told pv magazine.

And 24/7 is gaining traction. As Hannah Hunt impact director for Re-Source Platform put it “both clean energy buyers and sellers are showing increased interest in exploring 24/7. RE-Source and Eurelectric have a joint 24/7 Task Force that includes more than 60 large energy buyers (including Google IKEA Microsoft Telefonica) sellers grid operators and technology providers. Even for companies that are not actively pursuing 24/7 we’re seeing interest to discuss the potential benefits and solutions.”

Similarly Google’s data center energy strategic negotiator Amanda Peterson Corio told pv magazine that the challenge of climate change means “we are already seeing growing momentum behind 24/7.” As examples Corio pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden’s “commitment 24/7 CFE for federal buildings in its infrastructure plan” and the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All ‘24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact’.

Of course the temporal-spatial aspect of 24/7 should drive the uptake of energy storage and improved grid infrastructure (particularly interconnectors) as well. It is a method of accounting that incentivizes the right behaviors. And 24/7 “will ultimately reinforce the value and impact of solar+storage solutions” said Pennington.

Timestamping output

Timestamping of electricity production is mounting as an important enabler of 24/7 renewables. That is at least according to the EnergyTag Initiative pushing to put hourly temporal information on EACs so that 24/7 is possible through Granular Certificates (GCs).

According to EnergyTag’s founder Toby Ferenczi timestamping is a way to verify hourly procurement of CFE reliably. “With GCs CFE is priced according to its real-world availability cheaply when it is in over supply and more expensive when it isn’t” he said.

The emergence of inspectable ledger technologies like blockchain among others means that granular traceability is within reach. EnergyTag is looking to provide a framework to which software companies can adhere with guidelines being designed to “protect against double counting double issuance and other issues important for making granular certificates a robust instrument” said Ferenczi.

However Corradi pointed out that there are other systems to make traceability trustworthy. One example is “flow-tracing” which tells you where electricity comes from by country of origin and could be applied to EACs to calculate how many GCs can be bought and sold between countries. Another option is to “publish everything as open data.” The necessary factor is that everybody calculates their data using the same methodology.

“Trust for me comes down to being able to be transparent about what you’re doing” said Corradi. “Which emissions factors are you actually using? How are you treating the imports and the exports on the grids? Are you able to have certificates go from one grid to the other? What are the rules that enable these things? How is storage considered?” These are the questions currently being discussed in the EnergyTag Initiative and Corradi said the decisions need to be transparent and “not hidden in some complex 200-page white paper.”

Google’s Corio believes the “24/7 carbon-free approach reflects an unparalleled level of transparency. It enables us to show hour-by-hour where we need to develop new clean energy projects advocate for policy changes and in some cases look to new technologies that can help fill in the gaps.” Looking to set a strong example in June Google released the 2020 CFE percentages of all its data centers and its overall progress toward the 2030 target.

Ultimately Corradi explained there are two ways of looking at traceability. The first is to say that it is impossible to know where an electron comes from and therefore if you buy X amount of renewables then you can claim to have used it (known as the purchasing power paradigm). The second to borrow a “smoothie” analogy offered by Corradi is that you can’t selectively choose different energy from your neighbor on the same grid in the same way you can’t selectively choose a particular fruit once it has been made into a smoothie. However said Corradi “you can pursue procurement that impactfully removes the fruits from the smoothie that you don’t want i.e. fossil fuels.” The more granular accounting becomes the more pre-emptively selective we can be and the more renewable the smoothie becomes.

The initiative’s discussions are not caught on anything “too divisive” said Ferenczi but are rather busily occupied with hammering out the extensive amount of detail required to cover the bases of such a complex system. Details such as: “how to ensure that the EnergyTag guidelines work with existing traditional certificate schemes? How to manage units less than 1 MWh? How to include storage? How to manage data quality issues?”

Popular content

“We need to make it very simple and easy for all types of energy consumers even those without large energy procurement teams or the ability to sign long-term purchasing agreements” said Ferenczi. “This is value that GCs can bring.” The value that any buyer whether they’re a small- or medium-sized business or Google can be sure where their energy is coming from.

Watch this space

Unfortunately not every member of the EnergyTag Initiative is as keen on spatial accounting as they are on the temporal. But time alone is not enough. Corio said the spatial element is “massively” important to Google’s 24/7 progress. “It is only by analyzing our hourly footprint at this regional level that we can begin to pinpoint the exact challenges of each grid where we operate to becoming truly carbon-free.”

Fundamentally what the 24/7 approach demands continues Corio is that we “think about the grid on which we operate. We cannot take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach if we want to move the needle towards reaching ‘absolute zero’ emissions.” And this needle needs a push because there are regions in the world “where we have so far been unable to purchase renewable energy because of market barriers and regulatory constraints” and “regions that do not have efficient wind and solar resources deployable at scale.”

Full-time skeptics

Not everyone is pro 24/7. One suggestion is that 24/7 will drive up the cost of renewables and EACs. In theory as Corradi points out if you “restrict the liquidity of the certificate then the price can increase.” But the point is whether 24/7 incentivizes the right behaviors. If renewables and EACs become scarce due to restrictions of time and space the price may rise but it should also incentivize energy storage interconnectors and other solutions to renewable intermittency.

In addition 24/7 should incentivize good policy. A company like Google isn’t likely to invest in a country if the grid isn’t up to scratch or the local renewables are not amenable to 24/7 procurement. As Corradi put it in the end a grid is just a big shared asset that takes time to decarbonize and “physically representative targets” send a “strong signal to policymakers [by saying] ‘I will make my decision on where to place my assets based on how clean of a grid you can provide in the future.’ And I think that is what is really interesting about 24/7.”

Another criticism touted by some corporates particularly those with high levels of emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors is that 24/7 is too much to ask. They complain annual targets are already difficult and that “big tech” is simply “moving the goalposts.”

Of course the goalposts haven’t moved; we just didn’t realize how far away they were. Annual 100% renewable matching is not the goal but decarbonization is in the same way that reaching the cloud line of a mountain isn’t the same as reaching the summit. As Google’s Corio put it “100% renewable energy matching is an important step on the path to full decarbonization but in order to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change we must target the ultimate goal of moving to fully carbon-free grids.”

Time to act

There are many ways actors can move to 24/7 CFE. Companies can improve their hourly carbon footprints by load-shifting the most carbon-intensive activities at times when renewables are most available.

On the policy front Corio calls for “wholesale market expansion and reform. We need more transmission to unlock congestion and deliver CFE to the regions where people live.” Another is to reduce restrictions on EACs such as the 1 MWh constraint. And one key policy would be the requirement for temporal matching of green hydrogen production. “It would be a disaster if we are allowed to claim hydrogen to be green based on electricity produced on a different grid at the right time” said Corradi.

There should also be policy discussion about panic buying of EACs during potential early 24/7 scarcity periods where bigger companies cause others to miss out.

The move to 24/7 feels inevitable. The more granular our view of the electricity system the more renewables can join and the more impactful procurement of renewable energy can be for grid decarbonization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5jaGVzdGVyc3Rhci5jb20vd2luY2hlc3Rlcl9zdGFyL3NhbnRhLXJldnMtdXAtZm9yLXNwZWNpYWwtZGVsaXZlcnktdG8tZXZhbnMtaG9tZS9hcnRpY2xlXzIyN2Q0NDlmLTYyOTctNTI4Ny04YzdmLWVhZmI2NTQyY2MxYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santa revs up for special delivery to Evans Home,President Stephen “Einstein” O’Connor (left) and Vice President Keith “Farva” Frier of the Winchester-based Blue Ridge Mountain Men chapter of the Iron Legacy Motorcycle Club are seen last month helping with a Thanksgiving food distribution at CCAP in Winchester.

Scalise 61 of Fayetteville is running as a Republican to replace Washington County Judge Joseph Wood. Wood announced in May he's a candidate for lieutenant governor.

Patrick Deakins justice of the peace for District 5 announced his candidacy for county judge in October. Sharon Lloyd grants administrator for Washington County announced her candidacy in November. Both are Republicans.

The county judge's salary this year is $123615. The Quorum Court approved raising the pay for all county elected officials to the maximum allowed by state law as part of the county's 2022 budget. Under state law county judges and sheriffs in class 7 counties -- Benton Pulaski and Washington counties -- have a maximum salary of $137349.

Scalise ran unsuccessfully for Fayetteville District Court District 2 Division 4 judge in 2020 losing to Terra Stephenson in a runoff for the position.

Scalise is an attorney with a private practice in Fayetteville and also works as a business development executive for J.B. Hunt. He first moved to Fayetteville in 1989 and has lived in the city continuously for the past 20 years. He received his law degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law and has a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Grove City College in Pennsylvania.

Scalise is married to Jacqueline Post Scalise. They have three children.

Scalise said his aim is to bring his passion to serve the community to the office of county judge.

""Washington County deserves a judge who has experience integrity common sense and vision for the future"" he said. ""An honest judge who is fiscally responsible and a good steward of the taxpayers dollars. A judge who is accessible and listens to what you have to say. Who puts the county first and leads by example.""

Scalise said Washington County's rapid growth with a population of 245339 projected to grow to 500000 in the next 25 years means county government must maintain and upgrade the county's 1100 miles of roads and county bridges. He said he will work with local regional and state governments and agencies to push for a ""beltway"" around the ""big four"" cities of Northwest Arkansas.

Scalise also said he will prioritize public safety including keeping pay for law enforcement up to market rates and expanding the county's detention center.

Scalise also said he will work to improve workforce training in the region update the county's planning and development regulations and keep county government records and data secure.",,,,,,,,,

A platoon of U.S. Army soldiers linger in the shade of canvas tents and grass roof huts smoking swatting at flies napping passing their time in purgatory with grass and childish jokes. Among them is Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) a private first class his comrades call “Professor” on account of college degrees.

Along with their dog tags some of the soldiers wear pendants around their neck: a peace symbol a Star of David a lucky horseshoe. Jacob's necklace bears the symbol for ahimsa the Jain Dharma principle of nonviolence.

In any other film these details could be considered minor references but here they are just a few of the many instances in which Jacob’s Ladder uses sacred imagery to tell the story of a broken man desperately clinging to the shattered fragments of his past life.



Without warning the camp is attacked by an unknown enemy. All hell breaks loose. Some of the soldiers begin to convulse and shake as fire and brimstone rain from the sky. Men are eviscerated and dismembered.

Jacob escapes into the jungle. In a POV shot he’s ambushed and bayonetted in the gut by an unseen attacker. He falls to the ground and with a match cut awakens on a New York City subway train three years later. He’d fallen asleep reading a paperback copy of Albert Camus’s existentialist novella The Stranger and missed his stop. His right hand rests on his abdomen where he'd been stabbed.

Jacob steps off the train and finds that the exit from his platform is locked so he must cross over to the other side to get out. As he steps onto the tracks another train suddenly barrels toward him. He dives out of its way catching a glimpse of ghostly faces through the windows as it roars by.

Jacob is now a veteran and a postal worker living in a cozy Brooklyn apartment with his girlfriend Jezebel (Elizabeth Peña). It's revealed that prior to the war he’d been a doctor married to another woman Sarah (Patricia Kalember) and the father of three children one of whom Gabe (Macaulay Culkin) was killed in a tragic auto accident.



The majority of the film’s directly religious references are tied to Judeo-Christian beliefs. (The title itself is a nod to the vision of Old Testament patriarch Jacob who saw a ladder leading from the earth up to heaven.) Jacob and Jezzie’s apartment is a veritable reliquary of spiritual objects d'art: a Christian cross crossed again with a pair of swords hangs on the wall next to the window. A replica of Hugo Rheinhold’s Ape with Skull is perched on Jacob’s desk the open book at the primate's feet inscribed with the words ""Eritis sicut Deus..."" which translates to ""You will be like God..."" The rest of the page is ripped away omitting the last part of the sentence ""...scientes bonum et malum."" Knowing good and evil.







Prayer beads are draped over the shelf on the headboard next to a candlestick base in the image of Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker (originally conceived as a likeness of poet Dante Alighieri in the sculptor’s masterwork The Gates of Hell).



Next to the bed is a shelf lined with books like Savage God and The Magical Philosophy while elsewhere in the apartment A Witches Bible Volume I: The Sabbats Demonology The Roots of Evil and Dante's The Divine Comedy are interspersed with academic texts on sociology and psychology.

These objects provide insight into the psyche and soul of a man concerned with the origins of human nature and it’s this curiosity that drives him to investigate the relationship between his demonic visions and the revelation that he and his platoon were the subjects of a military psy-op gone wrong.



The filmmakers use several effective techniques to break down the barriers of Jacob’s reality in particular editor Tom Rolf’s jump/smash/match cuts between Jacob’s medevac in Vietnam his horrific visions and his post-war life in New York City.





Many of the demons are portrayed as half-human ghouls with obscured and contorted faces horns and leathery appendages protruding through broken skin though some all-out monsters do appear. Makeup effects were supplied by J. Gordon Smith's Toronto-based FxSmith company. The demons' vibrating effect was achieved by under-cranking the camera to 4 fps for playback at 24 fps.

""All through the movies you're dealing with demons and angels and hell and heaven and I spent a year maybe more trying to wrestle with how to do it — how to do a devil with horns and not make people laugh"" said Lyne in a contemporaneous interview (Cinefantastique Dec '90). ""I tried to make it all human-based — sort of thalidomidey — fleshy horns from the bone a tail that looks a little like a schlong. I didn't want these things easily dismissed as too familiar. I did a lot of shaking vibrating tortured things.""

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3QtZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvai1hbGFuLWplcnJ5LWpvaG5zb24tb2JpdHVhcnktcGl0dHNidXJnaC9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQwNTEyMDA5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: J.

Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago City Council is moving forward with Mayor Brandon Johnson's plan to borrow more than a billion dollars to fund an array of economic programs.

The massive 37-year borrowing plan relies on winding down the city's dependency on the controversial tax-increment financing program also know as TIF. I has has been long been criticized as a patchwork and politically based system for funding construction projects around the city.

When a TIF district expires the tax revenues it holds are released back to the city school system and other local governments that levy property taxes in the area.

Officials say they will let enough special taxing districts expire to generate the money needed to repay the debt. But wary financial analysts TIF experts and even some alderpeople have warned that the city will get access to those recurring revenues only if city officials let the districts expire on schedule - which would be a sharp departure from the city's past practice.

“My granddaughter was born with a heart condition and I just didn’t want her to just be at anyone’s day care where she wasn’t cared for properly” Brown said. “When I got laid off it’s almost like this is what my calling was: working in the child care field.”

Brown decided she would not only care for her granddaughter but she would bring back her home day care center. After starting back up Brown decided to shift from a family child care center to a group child care center which would allow her to care for more children. And with help from her brother she began renting a building.

By 2018 Little Crawler’s Daycare 4022 N. 27th St. was officially in business. For Brown whose granddaughter passed away at the age of 5 the day care became a place where she could honor her granddaughter’s memory.

While the building had adequate space the landlord failed to take care of it and eventually it was seized by the bank.

This past August Brown purchased the building during a sheriff sale with help from a $360000 loan she received from Northwest Side Community Development Commission 4201 N. 27th St.

“For us it was really important about keeping that business operating so that that service can be offered to those families” Ebony Johnson the business resource manager said. “And the fact that it’s within one of our designated service areas made it even more impactful for us.”

Northwest Side CDC is a community development financial institution or a nonbank lender Johnson explained. The organization’s CDFI committee must determine if the organization can proceed with a loan or put it on hold.

When it came to Brown the possibility that her business could be displaced which in turn would affect families is one of the reasons the committee approved the loan Johnson said.

Renata Bunger the business development director explained how the Northwest Side CDC supported Brown throughout the process. Not only did the organization give her the loan but it stood by her side during the sheriff sale Bunger said adding that the organization was able to give Brown the loan with help from PNC funding.

Now that Brown owns the building the Northwest Side CDC is helping her to improve it. Two rooftop panels need to be replaced as well as some doors and the playground needs to be updated Brown said. An inspector also pointed out several spots in need of tuckpointing.

Johnson explained the organization’s role includes identifying resources and keeping in contact with Brown.

For example the organization is helping her get the center accredited. At the moment Little Crawlers Daycare has two stars but Brown is working with a YoungStar technical consultant to improve the center’s rating and possibly get accredited through the National Association for the Education of Young People.

“It’s not just getting the loan in our portfolio” Bunger said. “It’s also all this extensive backend stuff so that she stays in and so that her physical asset issues are addressed the financial management and everything going forward.”

Willie Smith the executive director of Northwest Side CDC noted that a lot of child care buildings are older buildings in need of repairs. In Brown’s case before she was the tenet and couldn’t make changes now that she’s the owner it’s a matter of funding.

“In regard to what she needs to repair there are some additional dollars that we may be able to assist her with” Smith said. “Another part of that ongoing counseling technical support is assisting her with coming up with a plan with how all these items get corrected to ensure her facility is in great shape.”

It’s about providing capital and planning assistance Smith said. When the organization began in 1983 its goal was to assist manufacturing companies he said and while it still does that to some extent its main focus is helping small businesses and residents through its lending program green infrastructure and community organizing.

“You cannot silo the community organizing from the small businesses from the green infrastructure” Smith said. “It’s all one total movement…for the betterment of the community.”

It’s about bringing life to the community by supporting the businesses in the community Bunger said case in point being Little Crawler’s Daycare which is a female Black-owned business in a Black community.

Milwaukeeans also play a role in uplifting and supporting their fellow residents.

Keep the dollars in the community Bunger said. Support local businesses Smith said and be cognizant of the impact.

Be open to sharing resources Johnson said noting that taking a communal outlook on it might encourage people to share more. She added there needs to be more clarity regarding where businesses can find resources.

Looking ahead to 2022 Northwest Side CDC plans to develop its infrastructure to support more small businesses pursue real estate development projects and increase the number of high performing businesses.

“Northwest Side CDC is a business that likes helping their community because they’re right down the street from me” Brown said. “They’re trying to build up this area and they’re very helpful in other areas not just in funding.”

In addition to making necessary repairs Brown is focusing on other issues such as obtaining and retaining reliable staff. It’s a common problem among many day care centers she said. Her plan is to offer a SIMPLE IRA Plan to employees which is similar to a 401(k).

Despite all the work that still needs to be done Brown knows she’s in the right field.

“The rewarding part is seeing the smiles on the kid’s faces” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The proof lies within their newest flagship location in downtown Los Angeles.

FOX Business reported on Wednesday that the California Retailers Association (CRA) is seeking additional funding for the state's task force to work alongside local law enforcement to assure protection for businesses.

Of the three CRA tasks forces in the state the Southern Division leads the greater Los Angeles area where the nation's biggest bank called on Klutch Sports Group CEO Rich Paul to speak at its latest ribbon cutting along with other JP Morgan Chase personnel.

""We support investing in downtown Los Angeles through branches like this one and in other city centers"" says a Chase spokesperson.

CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION FIGHTING FOR ADDITIONAL RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCES: ‘IT’S NOT LETTING UP

Paul whose partnership with Chase began in 2020 and has extended in 2021 founded Klutch Sports Group back in 2012.

Chase served as the Financial Services Sponsor for Klutch Conversations in 2020 and currently plays the same role for Klutch Academy.

The latter is a curated off-season program that prepares rookies and their families for life as professional athletes. The in-depth journey was captured this past Summer in a 5-part docu-series currently airing on BET.

Through Klutch Academy Paul intends to educate the parents of future clients about the pre-draft process which includes hiring a representative. While parents and players are pitched through a presentation of the process they are unaware of the detail.

Paul says Klutch Academy helps to eradicate the ""negative recruiting"" that takes place in the business.

The partnership with Paul and Klutch Sports Group not only underscores the bank's investment to promote financial health and literacy in urban centers but aligns with the bank's $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment to ""advance economic growth and opportunity for Black Hispanic and Latino communities"" by the end of 2025.

JPMORGAN TELLS UNVACCINATED WORKERS TO STAY HOME

From at least January 2018 through November 2020 JPMorgan employees including managing directors and other senior supervisors allegedly exchanged thousands of messages through text WhatsApp and personal email accounts about securities matters including investment strategy discussions of client meetings and communications about market color analysis activity trends or events according to the SEC.

The agency noted that no record of the communications were preserved by the investment bank as required under federal securities laws and that JPMorgan admitted its failures were companywide and that its practices were not hidden.

""JPMorgan received and responded to commission subpoenas for documents and records requests in numerous commission investigations during the time period that it failed to maintain required securities records relating to the business"" the SEC's order states. ""In responding to these subpoenas and requests JPMorgan frequently did not search for records contained on the personal devices of JPMorgan employees relevant to those inquiries.

""JPMorgan’s record-keeping failures impacted the commission’s ability to carry out its regulatory functions and investigate potential violations of the federal securities laws across these investigations""

As a result JPMorgan will pay $125 million to resolve the SEC's charges and has agreed to hire a compliance consultant to review its policies and procedures regarding employee communications and make recommendations for improvements. It will also pay $75 million to the CFTC to settle charges from its separate investigation into the matter.

Prior to the SEC and CFTC's actions the investment bank enhanced its policies and procedures and increased training relating to the use of approved communications methods including personal devices. It also made significant changes to the technology available to employees. A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment.

Networking covers a wide variety of today’s top business connectivity initiatives whether it’s cloud computing or 5G implementation or software-defined infrastructure.

Any enterprise setup that allows users to share data across the information system is a form of networking and requires networking professionals to design configure and manage the infrastructure over time.

The networking job market has grown quickly to meet the needs of all kinds of companies especially as their users and network components continue to the cloud and the edge.

Whether you’re an experienced networking professional a new tech graduate or someone who’s looking for a career change learn more about the market for networking careers and how you can sharpen your skills to meet networking job criteria:

The Networking Job Market

The networking market

The enterprise networking market reached a value of $50.6 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $64.6 billion by 2024 according to Grand View Research.

Networking job types

Network engineer: one of the most versatile and highly sought after networking professionals. Network engineers focus on designing optimizing and developing networking infrastructure but they also frequently assist with ongoing network management.

Network technician: primarily handles tactical upgrades bug fixes and troubleshooting for network hardware and software.

Network administrator: think of this role as the network’s operations manager. Network administrators handle most maintenance monitoring and general management features of a network after it’s set up. They are also frequently in charge of designating responsibilities to other networking roles.

Network support specialist: frequently more user experience (UX) focused. If a network or its components are experiencing outages or other problems this individual acts as the communication liaison between the users and solutions they need.

Network security engineer: focuses on developing technical physical and regulatory safeguards to secure different components of a network. They may work closely with a network administrator especially when focusing on network monitoring needs.

Conclusions

A key advantage of the networking job market is the wide range of available roles. You don’t necessarily have to have a relevant bachelor’s degree to qualify as many roles lean more heavily on a candidate’s knowledge of specific technologies.

Hands-on experience and relevant certifications are weighted heavily in the networking job market especially for network security and support roles.

Networking is the backbone of nearly every other technical market due to the connectivity it provides to technical innovations. Because of its ubiquity across industries and companies networking careers are some of the most versatile and stable tech career paths to pursue.

According to TheHackerNews.com and other cybersecurity sites blogs and even CNN this remotely exploitable fl aw also impacts thousands of major products and services from a number of companies such as Amazon Apache Apereo Atlassian Broadcom Cisco Cloudera ConnectWise Debian DockerFortinet Google IBM Intel Juniper Networks Microsoft Okta Oracle Red Hat SolarWinds SonicWall Splunk Ubuntu VMware and Zoho etc…etc posing an unprecedented software supply chain risk.

According to Checkpoint – the Israeli cybersecurity firm unlike other major cyberattacks that involve one or a limited number of software Log4j is basically embedded in every Java-based product or web service. The vulnerability has been dubbed the Log4Shell. It is very difficult to manually remediate it.

The vulnerability because of the complexity in patching it and easiness to exploit is likely to be around for years to come unless companies and services take immediate action to prevent the attacks on their products by installing the patches or upgrade versions and thoroughly vetting their entire software applications and servers.

How many are willing to take the time and effort to carry out this exercise with its related costs and possible downtimes?

To illustrate the severity of this vulnerability this piece of java logging software – Log4j is used in many applications and software packages and applications and more critically in networking equipment including fi rewalls and other intrusion detection devices. It is part of a widely used library of software modules that are integrated into many applications and Internet services. In fact it is so widespread that you may not even know how many applications or services on your PC laptop or Smartphone may be using Log- 4Shell.

In the days after the vulnerability was publicised many cyberattackers have jumped on the exploit bandwagon and almost 80 per cent of corporate networks globally already have been under attack as of the December 15. Furthermore criminal gangs acting as access brokers have begun using the vulnerability to gain initial foothold into target networks and then sell the access to ransomware- as-a-service (RaaS) affiliates on the Darknet following the business model which I had highlighted in previous articles.

Incidentally this now includes nation-state actors originating from China Iran North Korea and Turkey with Microsoft’s Detection the “activity ranges from experimentation during development integration of the vulnerability to in-the-wild payload deployment and exploitation against targets to achieve the actor’s objectives”. The large-scale weaponisation of the remote code execution flaw has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add Log4Shell to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog giving federal agencies a deadline of December 24 to incorporate patches for the vulnerability and urging vendors to “immediately identify mitigate and patch affected products using Log4j”.

Although hackers have been exploiting the bug since the beginning of December according to researchers from Cisco and Cloudfl are attacks ramped up dramatically following Apache’s disclosure last week. So far cyberattackers have exploited the flaw to install cryptominers on vulnerable systems steal system credentials burrow deeper within compromised networks and steal data according to a recent report from Microsoft. The range of impacts is so broad because of the nature of the vulnerability itself.

Software developers use logging frameworks to keep track of what happens in any given application. To exploit Log4Shell an attacker only needs to get the system to log a strategically crafted string of code.

From there they can load arbitrary code on the targeted server and install malware or launch other attacks. Notably in seemingly benign ways like by sending the string in an email or setting it as an account username. Whilst the full extent of the exposure is still coming emerging less fastidious organisations or smaller developers who may lack resources and awareness will be slower to confront the Log4Shell threat.

The vulnerability is already being used by a “growing set of threat actors” US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly said in a statement last Saturday. She added that the fl aw is “one of the most serious I’ve seen in my entire career if not the most serious” in a call with critical infrastructure operators on Monday as first reported by CyberScoop. In that same call a CISA official estimated that hundreds of millions of devices are likely affected. The hard part will be tracking all of those down. Many organisations don’t have a clear accounting of every program they use and more importantly the software components within each of those systems. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre emphasised last Monday that enterprises need to “discover unknown instances of Log4j” in addition to patching the usual suspects.

By its nature open source software can be incorporated wherever developers want meaning that when a major vulnerability crops up exposed code can lurk around every corner. Even before Log4Shell software supply chain security advocates had increasingly pushed for “software bills of materials” or SBOMs to make it easier to take stock and keep up with security protections. Security professionals note that while it’s important to be aware of the vulnerability’s inevitable lasting impact the first priority is to take as much action as possible now to shorten that tail as the frenzy of exploitation continues. “If you have an internet-facing server vulnerable to Log4Shell that you haven’t patched yet you almost certainly have an incident response on your hands” says incident responder and former NSA hacker Jake Williams. “Threat actors were quick to operationalise this vulnerability.”

Williams adds that while logging systems are important and it can be risky to implement fixes quickly it should be technically doable—and worth it—for most organisations. “On the defense side we’re seeing a lot of enterprises afraid to patch without testing” he says.

“That’s the wrong approach in this case.” The concern remains too that the situation could get even worse. Attackers could potentially develop a worm that exploits the fl aw and spreads automatically from vulnerable device to the next. But while it’s technically possible it may not be a top priority for malicious hackers as they are more likely trying to breach networks to insert covert command and control malware. Cyberattackers will still look for creative new ways to discover and continue exploiting as many vulnerable systems as possible.

The scariest part of the Log4Shell though is how many organisations won’t even realise that they have systems or applications at risk as many use customised software or even inhouse developed software that integrates the modules or libraries with the Log4Shell. Once it’s compiled and working as expected who goes back to check the original code assuming it’s still available and the developers properly documented everything!

As former Chairman of Microsoft – John W. Thompson points out – “Second issue is the rapidly accelerating increase in the number of vulnerabilities that get discovered every day. And equally importantly is the shortening of time between the discovery of the vulnerability and the release of an exploit”.

Here’s acknowledging that some information was sourced distilled and quoted from cybersecurity sites blogs and news agencies. As always God bless and stay safe in both digital and physical worlds this weekend.

(Reuters) - Canada's Bank of Montreal is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. arm of French bank BNP Paribas SA the Wall Street Journal reported late on Sunday citing people familiar with the matter.

The Canadian lender could finalize an agreement as soon as this week assuming the talks don't fall apart according to the report.

The deal would facilitate Bank of Montreal's expansion into the United States where it has worked to build its presence in recent years. Combined the banks would have some $870 billion in assets the report added.

Bloomberg had reported last week that Bank of Montreal has expressed interest in buying San Francisco-based the Bank of the West the U.S. arm of BNP Paribas.

BNP and Bank of Montreal did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The French bank was working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to assess a sale of the 147-year-old unit in a deal that could value it at around $15 billion with potential suitors including Bank of Montreal Toronto-Dominion Bank and Ohio-based KeyCorp.

You don’t have to look hard to find a musical that involves a group of cheery high school kids (usually band geeks and theater nerds) who join forces to support some cause like suicide awareness (Dear Evan Hansen) or alienated adolescents (Be More Chill). It’s a far cry from the teen dramas of the past in which high school kids were essentially evil and did what they could to sabotage their classmates (Heathers Mean Girls). It must be nice to attend high schools absent of bullies and large-scale disappointment.

But another one of these feel-good-despite-the-bad high school musicals has just emerged and it’s a gem. Kimberly Akimbo (now playing at Atlantic Theater Company’s Linda Gross Theater through January 15 2022) takes on a teen’s very unusual malady and turns it into one of the feel good stories of the decade.

Led in the title role by the magnificent award-winning Victoria Clark (a woman of a certain age but definitely not a teen) and her gorgeous sonorous soprano Kimberly Akimbo is the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who has a genetic disorder which causes her to age at a rate of four times a normal person. So by the age of four she looked sixteen; and by the age of sixteen when we join her in this story she’s liable to die of old age. Is this a real thing? It is. Tackling the subject in a biology class presentation Kimberly and her friend give us some of the details of progeria and while she’s trying to be lighthearted about it the facts are too heartbreaking and she’s not able to face the class or this unfair reality.

While Kimberly is mentally and emotionally still a teen her immature and irresponsible parents force her to behave like an adult as well becoming the voice of reason in her own household. Her father (Buddy brilliantly played by the comically perfect Steven Boyer) a difficult-to-like drunk shows up late to pick her up from school events; and her mother lazily records video messages to her unborn child while nursing bandaged wrists as she recovers from carpal tunnel surgery. The household is an emotional mess and we haven’t even met her ex-con deadbeat Aunt Debra (an absolutely hysterical Bonnie Milligan) yet.

But there’s refuge at school for the very shy Kimberly who despite appearing as if she’s in her 70s attracts the attention of the anagram-happy word-nerd Seth (the handsome and charming silky-voiced newcomer Justin Cooley. (Pay attention to this kid he’s going to be a big star someday soon). Outwardly they look like Harold and Maude but really they’re two teens falling in love and it’s as sweet and believable a romance as you’ll ever see on stage.

Rounding out the cast are Kimberly’s four classmates an enthusiastic group attempting to raise enough money for Dreamgirls costumes for their Show Choir. They are also unknowingly wrapped up in a love quadrangle which Debra brutally illuminates with a couple of snarky comments. Debra recruits the young performers as well as Seth and Kimberly to be her “crew” for an elaborate and very serious white-collar crime which they accept blithely. After all they all need a large cash infusion in order to pursue their dreams. Somehow the seriousness of their conspiracy never seems to occur to any of them and that’s part of the charm of the musical—none of the dire circumstances ever pull us underwater and they ultimately fall out of focus in favor of the developing love affair. Teen romance is like that.

Kimberly Akimbo’s appeal comes from the teaming of Jeanine Tesori’s (Fun Home) music and David Lindsay-Abaire’s book and lyrics. Director Jessica Stone pulls together the terrific songs with Danny Mefford’s delightful choreography and the strength of Clark and Cooley’s utterly charismatic and heartfelt performances and infectious smiles leaving the audience with full hearts despite being witness to a woeful and tragic tale of a young woman with a stunningly unfair and awful disease. It’s a terrific musical that shouldn’t be missed. There are rumors that it may be transferring to Broadway but this is a year in which nothing is certain. So see it before it closes in mid-January or the opportunity may not arise again.

Kimberly Akimbo. Through January 15 at Atlantic Theater Company’s Linda Gross Theater (336 West 20th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues). Tickets: ovationtix.com

Energy company Kinder Morgan Energy Partners will pay $2.5 million in fines penalties and assessments following the November 2020 underground gasoline spill that spewed over 63000 gallons of gasoline into a Walnut Creek waterway California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced last week.

“While we can’t undo the damage already done to the community and the environment we are here today to secure justice for the residents of Walnut Creek and announce the sentencing of Kinder Morgan” Bonta said at a press conference.

Maintenance workers first reported a compromised pipeline on Nov. 20 2020 near South Broadway in Walnut Creek and also reported the smell of gasoline near the Walnut Creek Flood Control drainage canal near Walnut Creek and Arroyo channels on Dec. 2 2020.

Upon an extensive investigation of the incident from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife The Department of Justice deemed Kinder Morgan Energy Partners’ SFPP system in violation of two state codes — California Government Code 8670.64 which penalizes those who knowingly cause an oil spill and fail to follow administrative directions and Fish and Game Code 5650 which states it’s illegal to dump oil in the waterways.

According to the investigation SFPP employees waited until there were visual signs of a gasoline spill before contacting the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services despite earlier warning signs. SFPP also allegedly took over two weeks to measure the size of the spill and complete an incident report to corresponding state agencies.

The energy company pleaded no contest to the criminal charges.

Along with the fine the Contra Costa County Superior Court ordered SFPP to be on an 18-month probation. During that time the company must train staff on how to notify agencies of potential spills install leak detection systems in its pipeline and improve spill volume calculation speeds.

“This plea agreement represents our strong partnership with the Attorney General’s office and to pursue companies and hold them liable and penalize when they pollute when they knowingly failed to begin appropriate cleanup measures as required by state law” said Wildlife Officer Ryan Thiem of CDFW at the press conference.

Bonta said he’s committed to bringing justice to those who harm California’s environment and communities.

“Today’s sentencing should serve as a reminder to corporate polluters everywhere: if you endanger our communities and environment by failing to follow the law you will be held accountable” Bonta stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a statement United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555 announced that the tentative agreement includes “significant wage increases added workplace protections a secure retirement and quality healthcare.”

At 6 a.m. December 17 Fred Meyer and QFC workers around the greater Portland area went on on strike in the midst of contract negotiations between Kroger and Local 555 the union that represents workers at Fred Meyer and QFC locations in Oregon and Southwestern Washington. The union was seeking substantial wage increases for its workers who hadn’t received hazard pay for almost a year and a half according to the union. The strike was intended to last until midnight on December 24 but a statement released late on Friday announced the end of the strike and the newly reached tentative agreement.

The unfair labor practices strike however was instigated by conflicts during the negotiation process; the union said Kroger representatives “violated their legal duties to negotiate in good faith.” According to the union Fred Meyer refused to provide the union with information it needs to negotiate and process grievances; in particular the union says the company was withholding information related to compensation which the union needed to investigate a potential violation of their contract. According to Local 555 spokesperson Miles Eshaia the union believed nutrition and combination checkout clerks were not being paid adequately under their current contract; when they asked for information related to their wages the company did not comply with their request. In response a Fred Meyer spokesperson told the Portland Mercury that the company is negotiating in good faith and will “continue to be compliant with all labor practice laws and legal requirements.”

Earlier this week the union claimed Fred Meyer and QFC were violating state law in their recruitment of replacement workers by not telling them about the impending strike. According to ORS 662.215 employers cannot hire professional strikebreakers to replace striking employees and cannot hire temporary employees to fill in during a work stoppage without disclosing the strike. Fred Meyer job listings posted on LinkedIn this week did not note the strike; the same is true for jobs posted on Recruit.Net.

“Fred Meyer should not break the law by tricking a worker into hurting another worker” said Dan Clay President of UFCW Local 555 in a press release. “While it may be standard operating procedure for these companies to try to break a strike they ought to be open and honest with their attempts to harm workers fighting for a better life.”

From Fred Meyer’s perspective the hiring of employees during the strike was necessary so the business could continue to function as an essential business. “At Fred Meyer and QFC we take our responsibility to maintain access to food and essential items for the communities that we serve very seriously. Our goal is to achieve a fair and balanced outcome for our associates and we will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes to do so” a Fred Meyer spokesperson told Eater in a written statement. “Since the union has decided to threaten a work stoppage in the middle of the negotiation process and during an ongoing pandemic we will do everything we can within the scope of the law to ensure that we are able to continue to provide access to food and essential items.”

According to a Portland Fred Meyer employee who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional retaliation many of the physical job postings in Fred Meyer locations did in fact acknowledge the strike — in a photo submitted to Eater Portland a job posting at Fred Meyer read “Now hiring temporary associates... willing to cross a picket line.”

It’s not the first time Fred Meyer workers had authorized a strike this year: Fred Meyer warehouse workers represented by Teamsters Local 117 almost instigated a work disruption that would have impacted 180 grocery stores around the Northwest back in July. Fred Meyer reached an agreement with Fred Meyer before going on strike however.

The details of the contract are still under wraps; the union says it will release more information about the agreement once members have the opportunity to review and vote to ratify. Information about when the voting will finish have yet to be released as well. Local 555 represents 29000 workers in Oregon Southwestern Washington Idaho and Wyoming including employees of grocery stores like Albertsons and Safeway.

The union has been in negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike which began Friday morning at stores in Portland Bend Newberg and Klamath Falls.

Two leaders of the Oregon Education Association right which represents Oregon teachers joined the crowd outside the Hawthorne Fred Meyer in Southeast Portland Dec. 17 2021. A weeklong strike by unionized employees at some Oregon Fred Meyer and QFC stores began at 6 a.m. Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB

After the strike authorization at least one Fred Meyer store posted a sign saying it was seeking temporary workers willing to cross picket lines.

A sign inside the Stadium Fred Meyer on NW 20th Place in Portland states the company is looking for temporary associates who among other things must be “willing to cross a picket line” Dec. 17 2021. A weeklong strike by unionized employees at some Oregon Fred Meyer and QFC stores began at 6 a.m. Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB

Prior to reaching a tentative agreement union representatives said that Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers in violation of contract terms. A UFCW spokesperson has also said the grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process.

The UFCW said this inadequate pay and lack of documentation constitute unfair labor practices — and it’s on the basis of these unfair labor allegations that the UFCW had been preparing to strike.

A spokesperson for Fred Meyer has said the company is following and plans to continue to follow applicable labor laws.

The Portland Democratic Socialists of America members of other unions and supporters of the labor movement gathered in front of the Fred Meyer location on Northeast Weidler Street at 4 pm Friday to support striking members of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 555. About 120 picketers formed a line in front of the store and marched at two parking-lot entrances chanting and holding signs.

The picketers slowed traffic and in some instances obstructed drivers trying to enter the store parking lot.

“Go to another store!” They yelled as motorists attempted to turn into the lot. “There’s a Safeway down the road!”

Picketers were greeted with both supportive honks and disparaging comments from passing motorists. The store manager and security personnel came out to tell picketers to leave but to no avail.

Fred Meyer began advertising temporary jobs at its stores and on Kroger’s website earlier this week asking for workers willing to cross the picket line. No experience necessary. (Union representative Miles Eshaia told WW on Thursday that the union’s attorney had sent Fred Meyer a cease-and-desist letter earlier in the week alleging the company was breaking Oregon law by not initially making clear it was seeking to hire strikebreakers.)

The union struck over what it deemed unfair labor practices including insufficient pay for certain departments including grocery and checkout.

The strike came at a particularly inopportune time for the grocery retailers just over a week shy of Christmas. Eshaia attributes the swiftness of the deal to the strike rendering stores wastelands.

“The community was just straight-up behind us the pressure the customers helped put on the employer from the very beginning en masse just not crossing our picket line” Eshaia says. “Of course you had people who would plow through and honk and yell and that happens but the majority of the people really respected our lines.”

He thinks the grocers realized the magnitude of the strike quickly: “It might be one of those things where they were waiting to see how it goes and then they were like ‘Oh no.’”

Fred Meyer president Dennis Gibson said in a statement: “We are so grateful to our Fred Meyer and QFC associates for everything they do for our customers and our community. That’s why we’ve invested in their wages health care and retirement.”

The date of the union vote has not yet been released nor have details of the tentative agreement. When asked if the company granted most of the union’s demands Eshaia said he wouldn’t divulge details of the agreement before members saw it. WW asked if union leaders were happy with the deal.

“That’s a loaded question because leadership can only be happy if members are happy” Eshaia says. “But the committee does consist of members and everyone recommended the settlement.”

Malik revealed that a simulator complex was being set up at Karachi airport where all airlines Civil Aviation Authority offices and training centres were operating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYXJ5bmV3cy50di9waWEtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYS0zMjAtc2ltdWxhdG9yL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vYXJ5bmV3cy50di9waWEtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYS0zMjAtc2ltdWxhdG9yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PIA gets first Airbus A-320 simulator,"KARACHI: The national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has acquired the first Airbus A320 simulator for the training of pilots refresher courses and air safety ARY News reported on Saturday.

The state-of-the-art Reality 7E Evolution Airbus A320 Full Flight Simulator (FFS) was acquired from L3Harris Technologies that will be installed at PIA Training Centre (PTC) in Karachi.

Pakistan will become the first country in the region that has acquired an A320 simulator for pilots’ training and air safety. It is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan has 670 pilots of Airbus A320.

Before acquiring the modern simulators the pilots were bound to travel abroad for refresher courses along with an inspector of civil aviation.

The installation of the Airbus simulator will end the huge expenditure of the national flag carrier for pilots’ training. It was learnt that pilots’ training was conducted at the cost of almost $300 per hour in the foreign countries excluding the travel and accommodation spendings.

The national airline has started the construction of a simulator complex in which the simulators of Boeing 747 777 and Airbus 320 will be installed. The simulator complex will be linked to the airport hotel.",,,,,,,,,

NEW YORK — The man in the tux rekindles a time so long ago. “When I was 17 it was a very good year” he sings evoking images of small-town girls and soft summer nights.

But there’s no hiding from the lights not tonight. We know where Bob Anderson is taking us to the autumn of his years. The Las Vegas lounge legend is now center stage at Carnegie Hall this Saturday night filling the hall with the voice of Frank Sinatra.

The classic Sinatra timbre rides a wave of music by a 32-piece orchestra. Anderson has been remade to look just like Sinatra the artwork from makeup designer Ron Wild. The singer wears a $3500 tux he bought just for this show. His mannerisms the cock of head and casual flip of the backhand are all there.

At times you feel Old Blue Eyes himself has inhabited Anderson’s physical being. In an age where a hologram could be created to play this show Anderson is starring in a kind of movie come to life. The singer is leading us to a Sinatra show at Circus Maximus at Caesars Palace or before then the Copa Room at the Sands.

Are we watching the autumn turn to winter tonight? It feels the culmination of Anderson’s rich career as an all-time impressionist or “interpreter” as the description has evolved.

But it’s not the end not for Bob Anderson who starred at the Top of the Dunes for a decade ending in 1985 and was a fixture on the Strip and national-TV talk shows for a generation. He and is team are convinced it is the start. Sinatra’s 106th birthday would be Dec. 12 just a night after this show but they are treating this tribute as a new adventure.

Luck Be a Lady

For Anderson’s Sinatra show Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage is without question the platform for something bigger. His production team rented the space spending at least $150000 for to pay for the venue for this one show.

In effect Anderson has turned the historic hall into a regal auditioning platform. Between a half-dozen and 10 owners and representatives of Broadway theaters arrived to check out this show formally titled “One More For The Road.”

“I want to people to know what’s happening over here” Anderson said in his hotel suite overlooking Manhattan the morning of the show. “They may think that Carnegie Hall took Bob Anderson rather than our people paying for the thing for Bob Anderson to be on that show. That is the case.”

The show was performed for members of the Nederlander Organization which controls nine theatres; and Jujamcyn Theaters which own five Broadway venues. The Shubert Organization which owns 17 theaters is reviewing film from the footage that was taped by the Carnegie crew.

And hey Anderson might turn the whole saga into a reality show. The scramble for the show to adhere to the state and venue’s pandemic policies itself would be worth an episode.

Anderson said the Carnegie Hall production was able to recoup its investment. Official numbers are 2238 tickets sold about 150 more comped — the vast majority to first responders invited to the show — in a hall seating 2804. It is easily the largest theater crowd in New York on the night of the performance.

It’s also the largest audience assembled at Carnegie Hall during COVID a stat that should stand for the foreseeable future as New York’s mass-gathering policies change by the day because of the Omircon variant surge.

Anderson’s entourage is led by primary backers and co-producers Keith Maas and Carolyn Klucha of Twin Palms Entertainment. The relationship is familial as Klucha is also Anderson’s niece.

Maas and Klucha began following Anderson in 2018 and jumped onboard as producers in September. Twin Palms teamed for the Carnegie Hall show with Bob Anderson Productions. That company received a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) which funded the Carnegie Hall show.

In addition to the production lineup headed up by Anderson along Dianne Russomanno works as business manager Stephen Eich is back as director and Patricia Dockswell as production manager. This is a tight dedicated group.

The Sinatra show has been Anderson’s passion and even artistic obsession for upwards of a decade. He can perform many impressions of course from Tony Bennett Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr. Tom Jones Johnny Mathis Bobby Darin and Nat King Cole. But it was his Sinatra interpretation that led to his run with “Frank. The Man. The Music” at Palazzo Theater. That show performed for a year on the Strip closing in November 2015 just before what would have been Sinatra’s 100th birthday.

That decision stung Anderson. He wanted to be onstage as Sinatra for No. 100. As it was he refused to allow his show to perish. He built a team to present a concert video at Avalon Hollywood theater in Los Angeles in 2017 with Todd Fisher’s production company at the helm. That footage was also sent to Broadway operators.

In December Anderson forged a partnership with Tony Award-winning theater exec Eva Price and her partner Carl Flanigan and their Maximum Entertainment Company. Price’s credits include by “On Your Feet” the Gloria and Emilio Estefan story; “Dear Evan Hansen” and the revival of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma.” She’s worked with more than 15 Broadway musicals plays and concerts and is a member of The Broadway League’s Board of Governors.

As a result Anderson’s Sinatra revival was in line for a theater with talks ongoing until COVID wiped out all Broadway shows. Carnegie Hall was Anderson’s next destination to relaunch his Sinatra musical for interested theater operators and keep this dream alive. As Anderson said “We wanted to be able to market this show as being Sinatra from Carnegie Hall. That would be a powerful selling point.”

In that regard the win was in the moment Anderson stepped onstage.

“To me having not sung as Sinatra in so long I felt good” Anderson said. “But more important I felt the audience loved it. I really felt the energy on that stage.”

Come Fly With Me

Anderson took a quartet of classic Vegas musicians to make up the core of his orchestra otherwise filled with many of New York’s finest players.

Joey Singer who spent more than a quarter century touring with Debbie Reynolds is pianist and music director. Bob Sachs whose Vegas performances date to Sam Butera and Keely Smith and who backed Wayne Newton is on bass. Bob Chmel (Frank Sinatra Jr. Pia Zadora Jerry Lewis Bob Hope and Doc Severinsen) plays drums. And a member of Sinatra royalty Danny Falcone whose father Vince was Sinatra’s bandleader for 10 years at the end of his career is on trumpet and also contracted the entire orchestra.

All are made their debut at Carnegie Hall. It’s an interesting place to knock off the rust.

“You know the history when you walk in you know that Tchaikovsky opened the room and Vladmir Horowitz played here. Everyone in the world has played here” Singer said at the show’s after-party. “There is no other place for Carnegie Hall. So yeah it’s a real thrill it’s hard to put into words what an awesome feeling it is to be here.”

Sachs said the gravity of the show did not escape him.

“It is pretty amazing that the first show we do after being off for two years is at Carnegie Hall” Sachs said. “Sometimes you wish you had an opportunity to do the show elsewhere in preparation yeah. But you know you just have to step up to the plate and do your thing. Overall I thought it was a great experience.”

Chmel said “The closest I ever came to Carnegie Hall was a town hall show here with Frank Jr. while ago so this was a first for me. I’m 78 now so it took a long time but here I be! Thank you Jesus right?”

Falcone often referred to Sinatra as “Grandpa” when he was a kid.

“I’m sitting there looking out at the audience and it’s just mind-blowing” said Falcone who has backed Celine Dion Lady Gaga on the Strip and is a member of Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns. “It was just too much. I thought the band sounded phenomenal.”

My Way

Anderson has had to make some difficult decisions about where to spend his partners’ capital. The orchestra is not positioned on risers. They sit flat onstage. Risers are expensive Anderson says $45000 to bring in and another $45000 to haul away. An advanced onstage monitor setup to help the band hear what they are playing more clearly has also been scrapped.

Of course there is no video or production effects in the show. If you are looking for LED and smoke machines ad Carnegie Hall you’re in the wrong place.

It’s entirely music and singing Anderson at the mic and Singer at the rudder.

Anderson glides into the performance seeming to feel his way around the stage. He’s working out the kinks right in front of us. He’s thinner than we remember having lost weight after his own battle with COVID several months ago (which took him out of a weekend of shows at South Point Showroom in August).

But Anderson is forever a natural showman having performed for five hours unscheduled recently at the Italian American Club’s dining-room lounge. This about a week before what was likely the most important gig of is career.

Anderson is funny that way taking a lounge gig as seriously as Carnegie Hall. Finally playing a full show as Sinatra he catches his groove about a third of the way through flying through “Get Me to the Church On Time” “Lady Is a Tramp” “My Kind of Town” “New York New York” building to the closing coupling of “That’s Life” and “My Way.”

Anderson introduces Deana Martin Dean Martin’s headlining daughter and her husband John Griffeth; and baseball legend Joe Torre from the audience. Anderson earns all of his four standing ovations from that Carnegie crowd.

And for what is next Anderson relates talks at several venues among them Mohegan Sun in Connecticut and also Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City He’s booked at Key Largo Anglers Club in Florida in March and is looking at adjacent Coral Reef Reef (a favorite of Jimmy Buffet). His current Broadway general management firm KGM is setting up meetings with Broadway reps in January.

But as always the clock is ticking and the calendar’s dates flipping for the headliner in the autumn of his years. Frank Sinatra’s contemporaries are no longer with us his original fans dwindling. Few musicians ever actually performed with him in his Las Vegas heyday. And the pandemic is not cooperating. The show is beholden to forces the showman can’t control.

But the music he says will survive for all seasons.

“I’m showing you the way he was and if you like Frank Sinatra you will know most of the songs” Anderson says. “But there will be some younger fans who will not know him they are not gonna know these songs. OK maybe they’ll learn something because this is what Frank Sinatra was all about.”

El escritor y contador de historias presentará este lunes 20 de diciembre sus dos libros en A Coruña

Iván Fernández Amil está de enhorabuena por partida doble. El escritor y contador de historias coruñés lleva años siendo el gallego con más seguidores en la red social LinkedIn y celebra la llegada del año nuevo con dos buenas noticias: la publicación de su segundo libro Historias de Galicia que nadie te había contado 2 y recibir la Medalla de Oro ""Batalla de La Coruña 1809"" por parte de la Asociación Royal Green Jackets que conmemora la batalla de Elviña en la que se forjó la leyenda de Sir John Moore. La asociación ha querido reconocer la contribución de Fernández Amil a que se conmemore la historia de Galicia a través de sus episodios y personajes más celebrados.

Portada del segundo libro de Historias de Galicia que nadie te había contado

El escritor y contador de historias colabora semanalmente en los diarios Quincemil y Treintayseis narrando en su sección Historias de la Historia algunos de los episodios más memorables de la historia de Galicia. Este segundo libro es una recopilación de otros 40 artículos que se unen a los 30 recopilados en el primero ambos editados por Publicaciones Arenas. El lunes 20 de diciembre a las 20:00 tendrá lugar la presentación de las dos obras -la primera fue en petit comité por causa del Covid-19- en el salón de actos de la ONCE en A Coruña con la presencia del presidente de la Xunta de Galicia Alberto Núñez-Feijóo prologuista del primer libro.

Pero además de ser el artífice de algunos de los artículos más leídos en la corta pero prolífica vida de estos diarios digitales Iván es también un reconocido creador de contenidos y contador de historias en LinkedIn donde cuenta con más de 57.000 seguidores. El buen hacer de Fernández Amil le hizo ser ganador del premio TopInspira otorgado en esta red social. En esta entrevista nuestro compañero y amigo nos cuenta cómo ha conseguido convertirse en un referente que llega a todos los rincones del mundo.

¿Cómo surgió la idea de comenzar a escribir en LinkedIn?

A principios de 2018 más o menos comencé a publicar en LinkedIn sobre compras logística… ¿Por qué? Pues porque creí que mi experiencia podría ayudar a los demás que los problemas que yo había resuelto podrían tenerlos en ese momento otras personas que quizá leyendo cómo yo los había solucionado podría ayudarles.

Y vi que a la gente le gustaba mi contenido pero también cómo lo contaba. Así que me dije ¿por qué no usar esta “habilidad” para contar historias para aportar valor a los demás y ayudarles? Y comencé a publicar historias sobre emprendimiento empresas éxitos y fracasos o personajes que han cambiado el mundo. Y descubrí que a la gente le ayudaba les entretenía les hacía olvidarse de sus problemas durante 1.300 caracteres. Di con la tecla. La gente dice que inspiro pero yo creo que simplemente tengo un don para contar historias.

¿Cómo surgió la idea de las Historias de la Historia de Quincemil? ¿Pensabas que ibas a encontrar tantos relatos maravillosos de Galicia?

Realmente fue una idea de Pablo Grandío fundador de esta casa. Un día me contactó a través de LinkedIn y me preguntó si me interesaría usar mi don para contar historias sobre Galicia en Quincemil un proyecto que se estaba cocinando todavía en aquel momento. Uno o dos meses después del nacimiento del diario Se publicaba mi primera “Historias de la Historia” de Galicia. Y llevamos nada más y nada menos que 140 ya. La verdad es que no me imaginaba que podrían existir tantas y tantas extraordinarias y desconocidas historias sobre Galicia. Y las que todavía quedan por descubrir y publicar. Aún me siguen sorprendiendo.

Iván Fernández Amil posa en Arenas Libros con su primera obra.

De todos tus artículos de Quincemil ¿cuál es el que más te gusta? ¿Cuál es el que más te ha sorprendido por los comentarios recibidos?

El primero que publiqué en Quincemil lo recuerdo con mucho cariño en abril de 2019 porque fue un homenaje a una empresa que revolucionó su industria además de ser un lugar donde tuve el placer de trabajar durante varios años Calvo. Si una empresa gallega fue revolucionaria innovadora y sobre todo inspiradora en el mundo conservero fue Calvo. En la actualidad muchas de sus innovaciones son estándares en la industria. Y conseguir todo eso por parte de una pequeña empresa de un pequeño pueblo en el Noroeste de la Península es una auténtica heroicidad.

Y hay otros dos artículos que me encantan porque son historias de personas normales que cambiaron la historia y la vida de millones de personas. La historia de las hermanas Touza tres hermanas de Ribadavia que salvaron a cientos de judíos de los nazis y la historia de la espía Araceli González una lucense que junto a su famoso marido Garbo consiguieron engañar a Hitler para hacerle creer que el Desembarco aliado no sería en Normandía. Hay quien afirma que su papel permitió a los aliados ganar la Segunda Guerra Mundial así que imaginaos vaya historia más impresionante.

Por otro lado el artículo que más me sorprendió por las reacciones que generó fue el de Andrés do Barro mítico cantante ferrolano que consiguió situar cuatro canciones en gallego en el número uno de las listas de éxitos convirtiéndose en el primer y único artista de la historia de la música española en conseguir el Número Uno en una lengua oficial que no fuera el Castellano. Tras publicar su historia su hija Andrea escribió un Post en Instagram en el que decía con un pantallazo de la frase que cerraba mi artículo: “Y aquí empecé a llorar”. Esa reacción me emocionó porque me hizo ver que con mis artículos estaba conectando con la gente porque estaba llegando a su corazón.

¿A qué personajes históricos de los que has escrito te gustaría haber conocido? ¿Con quién te irías de cañas con quién irías a la guerra?

Me habría encantado conocer a Enrique Hervada el médico de los pobres de Coruña un hombre que debía de tener un corazón inmenso o a Eduardo Barreiros un empresario que cambió la historia del automóvil que seguro que tendría mucho que enseñarme sobre los negocios. Y a Alfonso I de la Amazonia el gallego que fue Rey de los Jíbaros porque debió de ser un personaje extraordinario.

De cañas me iría con José María Rivera Corral el creador de Estrella Galicia y con Benito Soto Aboal el pontevedrés que fue el último gran pirata del Atlántico. A la guerra iría con Emilia Pardo Bazán porque para mi es una figura legendaria una persona que da la impresión de que nunca caería desfallecida y que nunca te dejaría atrás y con Magno Clemente Máximo el gallego que fue Emperador de Roma e inspiró las leyendas del Rey Arturo. Con este hombre a mi lado ninguna batalla podía perderse.

El primer libro ha vendido tanto en Galicia como fuera de ella. ¿Tienes alguna anécdota al respecto? ¿Hasta dónde ha llegado tu libro en versión digital o física?

No sé si ha podido llegar más lejos pero me contactaron desde Texas en Estados Unidos para saber cómo podían hacerse con un ejemplar. También de Sidney de Sudáfrica y de Rusia. Y en España a pesar de ser historias de gallegos ha llegado a todos los rincones de la Península porque al final son historias de personas.

Iván Fernández firma ejemplares de su primer libro

¿Tienes ya alguna historia que hayas decidido que salga en la segura tercera parte?

Por supuesto. Hay tres historias que me encantaría publicar: La del Gordo de Navidad que le tocó íntegro a un solo gallego Pedro Barrié de la Maza la historia de Antonio Palacios el arquitecto gallego que modeló el Madrid moderno y la historia de Manolo Sánchez el confidente de Richard Nixon. Son tres historias que publicaré seguro si tenemos una tercera parte.

Eres en estos momentos el gallego con más seguidores de LinkedIn ¿te reconoce la gente por la calle?

La verdad es que no lo había pensado. Ahora mismo tengo casi 60.000 seguidores algo que en LinkedIn es una barbaridad y efectivamente es posible que en estos momentos sea el gallego con mayor número de seguidores aunque lo importante no es ese número sino la capacidad de usar ese número para que lo que publico llegue a la mayor gente posible. Porque yo no gano dinero por tener tantos seguidores ni LinkedIn me paga por mis publicaciones. Todo lo que publico lo hago porque quiero y porque considero que una de las mejores maneras de alcanzar el éxito es ayudando a los demás. Hay quien me llama “influencer” y siempre digo lo mismo. No soy un “influencer” soy tan solo un “Creador de Contenido”.

Y no nadie me reconoce por la calle afortunadamente ¡y menos con mascarilla!

Hay gente que piensa que LinkedIn es una red para buscar trabajo pero en los últimos años se ha convertido en una comunidad donde compartir contenidos con un ambiente mucho más sano que otras redes sociales. ¿Qué nos puedes contar de LinkedIn como lugar de encuentro?

LinkedIn es una red de Ventas de Compras de búsqueda de empleo… pero sobre todo es una red llena de conocimiento gratuito al alcance de todos. ¿En qué otra Red Social puedes leer al Presidente de Pascual dando consejos sobre negocios o cultura empresarial o al de HM Hospitales hablando todos los días sobre los datos de la COVID y las vacunas o a CEOs y Presidentes de las mayores empresas no solo del Ibex sino del Nasdaq o de Londres hablando sobre emprendimiento éxito Marca Personal o Recursos Humanos? Eso solo pasa en LinkedIn. Pero además puedes leer a gente como yo hablando sobre nuestra experiencia cuando me despidieron o sobre los fracasos que llevaron a Stephen King J.K. Rowling o Steven Spielberg a alcanzar el éxito. Esa es la magia de LinkedIn. Además te puedo decir que todos mis clientes han llegado a mi a través de LinkedIn así que imagínate si esta red me parece importante.

Tendrás seguidores de todo el mundo hispano y te habrás llevado alguna que otra sorpresa por lo remoto de su procedencia o las historias que te cuentan. ¿Cuál es la anécdota que más te ha llamado la atención?

En una ocasión publiqué un post sobre el acoso laboral un problema que he sufrido en mis carnes. En él contaba cómo me enfrenté a él y cómo logré vencerlo. Tras publicar el post recibí literalmente cientos de mensajes de personas de todo el mundo contándome su propia historia y pidiéndome consejo e ideas para hacer lo mismo que yo hice.

Otra anécdota que aún me sigue sorprendiendo ocurrió hace tan solo unas semanas. Sin pretenderlo publiqué el post más visto que jamás haya escrito. Es un Post de apoyo a Marta Ortega tras su nombramiento en Inditex. Por todas partes solo leía ataques contra ella así que decidí hacer un poco de ruido apoyándola. Ese post aún está activo lleva casi 1.500.000 visualizaciones 20.000 “me gusta” y 1.000 comentarios. Son unas cifras que nunca había alcanzado y que incluso a mí me dan vértigo solo de pensar en que me han leído millón y medio de personas en todo el mundo.

Iván Fernández Amil en la radio

En los últimos meses has comenzado a colaborar en la radio ¿Qué nos puedes contar de esa experiencia?

La colaboración con la Cadena Ser surgió a raíz de la historia que contamos en Quincemil de Rafaela Hervada la coruñesa que fue la primera directora de una radio en España. Tras leerla me llamaron y me propusieron tener una sección semanal en la que contar algunas de mis historias. Por supuesto acepté y estoy encantado. Es un medio que nada tiene que ver con el resto es muy dinámico divertido y muy adictivo. Además es radio en directo así que imagínate encajar todo para contarlo en menos de 5 minutos de una manera amena y divertida para los oyentes y además ¡en directo! Y aún encima he conocido a la gran Mayte González una periodista a la que admiro y a la que tengo el gusto de acompañar en La Ventana de Radio Coruña todos los martes desde la Plaza de Orense.

¿Cuáles son tus próximos retos?

Desde hace unos meses he comenzado a dar servicios de storytelling ayudando a las empresas a ganar más gracias al poder de sus historias. Y está funcionando muy bien. Hay mucha demanda y es un servicio esencial porque todo comienza con una historia. Pero una gran historia es un simple cuento si no sabemos cómo contarla. Todos tenemos una cada empresa cada persona cada producto cada marca. Por eso es tan importante saber contarla porque los productos no se venden solos son las historias que contamos sobre ellos las que hacen que ocurra. Para ello las marcas tienen que recurrir a expertos y profesionales no pueden dejar su historia en manos de cualquiera como tampoco dejarían sus finanzas sus Ventas o sus Compras. Creo que el storytelling va camino de convertirse si no lo es ya en un nuevo rol en las empresas tan importante como el resto de funciones y roles tradicionales. Yo me enfoco en convertir en inspiradoras las historias de las empresas y están dando muy buenos resultados.

Además doy charlas y ponencias a empresas hablando sobre el fracaso como una herramienta necesaria e imprescindible para alcanzar el éxito y la verdad es que están teniendo muy buena acogida y son realmente motivadoras porque nombres muy famosos que todos conocemos han fracasado antes de alcanzar el éxito pero no conocemos esas historias de fracaso sino las de sus éxitos. Yo cuento en que fallaron para poder triunfar.

Todos y cada uno de nosotros tenemos “algo” con lo que podemos ayudar a los demás. Lo difícil es descubrir ese “algo” y saber cómo utilizarlo para llegar a quien lo necesita. IVán Fernández AMIL

¿Cómo crees que las personas podemos dejar huella?

Muchos dicen que para dejar huella hay que ser famoso o tener muchos seguidores o llamar la atención sea como sea. Yo creo que para dejar huella para trascender tenemos que ayudar a los demás aportarles valor y hacer que sean mejores. Todos y cada uno de nosotros tenemos “algo” con lo que podemos ayudar a los demás. Lo difícil es descubrir ese “algo” y saber cómo utilizarlo para llegar a quien lo necesita. La legendaria Maya Angelou decía que ""la gente olvidará lo que hiciste y lo que dijiste pero nunca olvidarán cómo las hiciste sentir"". Eso es dejar huella.

Te han concedido la Medalla de Oro de La Batalla de La Coruña 1809-2022 que se te impondrá en el Ayuntamiento de A Coruña el 14 de Enero. ¿Qué significa para ti este galardón?

Buf imagínate aún me cuesta creerlo. Esta distinción ha sido concedida a figuras de la talla de Arturo Pérez-Reverte el Príncipe Carlos de Inglaterra Embajadores Alcaldes Ministros y personajes y entidades que han contribuido a dar visibilidad a la cultura o han ayudado de manera vital a la sociedad tanto gallega como española. El galardonado del año pasado fue el CHUAC y la Gerencia del Área Sanitaria de A Coruña y Cee por su heroica labor contra la COVID. Lo pienso y digo yo no estoy a su altura no soy ningún héroe pero me gusta pensar que mis historias tratan sobre héroes de los que nadie ya se acordaba y que gracias a mi labor han vuelto a serlo de nuevo.

Iván Fernández Amil acompañado del presidente de la Xunta de Galicia Alberto Núñez Feijóo el presentador de la TVG Xosé Ramón Gayoso y el director de Quincemil Pablo Grandío presentará sus dos libros en A Coruña en el salón de actos de la Fundación ONCE Cantón Grande nº3 el lunes 20 de diciembre a las 20:00 horas. El acto estará presentado por la locutora Mayte González.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY3JvbmljYS5jb20uZWMvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9zYXJhLW1vbnRhbm8tbGEtcG9lc2lhLWVzLXVuLWFydGUtcXVlLW1lLWF0cmFlLWRlbWFzaWFkby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sara Montaño: 'La poesía es un arte que me atrae demasiado',"Sara Montaño poeta lojana.

Sara Montaño Escobar es una poeta lojana. Pues desde que era niña siempre tuvo inclinación por la literatura y mientras su papá le leía poesía su mamá inventaba cuentos para ella y su hermana. Durante su formación secundaria algunos de sus docentes solían elogiarla por ensayos trabajos y cuentos que realizaba. Años más tarde mientras cursaba sus estudios universitarios se encontraba atravesando por momentos difíciles lo cual hizo que empezara a escribir poesía.

Pese a que hace 10 años empezó de forma constante con la poesía desde hace 5 años la ejerce como oficio. El género literario por el cual se inclina es la poesía porque le permite expresar sus pensamientos y emociones. Dependiendo de los poemarios que haya escrito generalmente estos pueden ser leídos por adolescentes esto se debe a que son más simbólicos llenos de imágenes y metáforas lo cual de cierta forma a un niño le resultaría difícil de entender.

‘La poesía es un arte que me atrae demasiado y además me gustaría que me recuerden como una persona que contribuyó de manera colectiva con la cultura’ manifestó Sara.

El pasado 9 de diciembre en la Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana Benjamín Carrión Núcleo de Loja se llevó a cabo la presentación de la colección de libros denominada ‘Pájaros de Arena’ misma que consta de las siguientes 4 obras de género poético: ‘La impúdica humanidad de los sagrado’ de Sara Montaño Escobar; ‘Filos dibujan cortes piel adentro’ de Patricio Vega Arrobo; ‘Letargo’ de Johanna Jiménez; y ‘Llévame a casa por favor’ de Andrea Rojas Vásquez.

El proyecto que actualmente tiene sobre el libro ‘La impúdica humanidad de lo sagrado’ es poder difundirlo y hacer que la gente se interese en leerlo. ‘Mi perro no lee mis poemas’ es otro poemario que ganó un premio de poesía con la Casa Editorial del Municipio de Cuenca del cual también espera que tenga la debida acogida.

Entre sus proyectos para el 2022 realizará un taller denominado ‘Crónicas de poesía’ dando uno de los incentivos de la escuela del Festival de las Artes Vivas de Loja. Además en enero posiblemente se realice un performance de la colección ‘Pájaros de Arena’.

Sara menciona que para ella todos los premios son meritorios pues quiere decir que de alguna forma los jurados ven poesía y reconocen su trabajo poético. También considera que los premios son subjetivos porque también depende de los gustos del jurado pero reconoce que al ganar siente emoción y alegría porque eso significa que reconocen su trabajo literario.

Actualmente tiene 3 poemarios publicados; 2 en Argentina; ‘Enseñanzas’ con la editorial Iberoamericana y ‘Conversaciones nocturnas con la sombra de mi madre’ publicado por editorial Perniciosa y 2 en Ecuador; ‘La impúdica humanidad de lo sagrado’ editado por la Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana Benjamín Carrión Núcleo de Loja así mismo ‘Mi perro no lee mis poemas’ será publicado el presente mes del año en curso.

Sara extiende la invitación a que la ciudadanía consuma el arte local y apoye a los artistas porque hacen mucho esfuerzo de manera autogestiva pues casi nunca obtienen dinero por un recital obra de teatro e incluso cuando publican un libro les resulta difícil hacer que la gente se interese en ellos.

Los meses anteriores lo preanunciaban pero los signos que estaban en el aire no eran leídos por la mayoría. En parte explica muy bien ese aturdimiento Naomi Klein en La doctrina del shock.



(Es un libro a propósito que se puede revisitar sobre todo y precisamente porque captó ya en aquella anterior arremetida feroz del neoliberalismo la idea del aturdimiento colectivo que la fase que atravesamos ahora no hizo más que refinar hasta el extremo y por otros medios: la concentración de medios y su alianza con los nuevos actores financieros entre ellos los poderosos dueños del mundo digital trabajan frenéticamente para aturdir y alienar sobre todo a los sectores que en todo el mundo hoy sostienen a la extrema derecha.

El aturdimiento tiene muchos usos. Entre ellos es una herramienta clave para volver al ataque ya decididos a la desinhibición que dos décadas más tarde le permite al proyecto neoliberal ahora vuelto trumpista en diversas variantes y desparramado en muchos países bajo el equívoco de todas las palabras-gancho que usan desembarcar como “algo nuevo”. Era ya evidente cuando Esteban Bullrich entonces ministro de Educación explicaba en pleno proceso macrista relajado ante periodistas amigos que su táctica para pelear contra los gremios docentes era dar a conocer no una sino muchas iniciativas achicadoras juntas: “Mientras pelean por una sale la otra”. Es un buen ejemplo de cómo y para qué la derecha neoliberal contiene al aturdimiento colectivo como factor necesario).

En 2002 publiqué un libro Crónicas del Naufragio en el que recopilaba las notas escritas desde enero de 2001 hasta un año después cuando pasado el estallido las asambleas barriales iban decayendo bajo la fragmentación en la que con las mejores intenciones se especializan algunas corrientes de izquierda.

Mientras iba escribiendo cada nota no tenía idea de que más y tarde y leídas y fechadas en el crescendo de furia de ese año constituirían un fresco sencillo y de registro de señales de la vida cotidiana que eran también avisos de que este país que había creído que un peso era un dólar –esa ilusión esa prestidigitación esa mentira que sirvió como un corpiño con push up: en el momento de la desnudez el efecto cesó–.

De la fiebre por los viajes a Miami y gente regresando con exceso de equipaje y enormes cajas de televisores de 1000 pulgadas y pieles bronceadas que daban efecto de placer del dólar asimilado como moneda propia hasta para pagar golosinas en un kiosco y la increíble sensación de bienestar que le daba a mucha gente tener vender comprar dólares hasta en la farmacia en unos meses pasamos a esa noticia que nadie entendía porque era de locos. Así lo dijo Susana Giménez cuando salió al aire después de que Cavallo anunciara que a partir de ese momento sólo de podrían retirar de los cajeros 250 pesos semanales. “Es de locos” dijo la sacerdotisa del dólar no pensando obviamente en el perjuicio colectivo sino en ella misma porque apenas fue anunciada la medida no había excepciones que después hubo. Los castigados serían los pequeños ahorristas. Los grandes no.

Esa medida que fue tomada para pagar la mentira de un peso un dólar terminó en el sonido ambiente de los que hoy son macristas –que también es una forma de cavallismo – eligen olvidar: fue un brutal recorte de libertad financiera para toda la población. Y fue una fiesta para los timberos bancos y buitres. Nadie podía disponer libremente de su propio dinero. Sus ahorros habían sido tomados por el Estado para cubrir las estafas a la población que fueron el megacanje y el blindaje delitos que el poder judicial argentino dejó prescribir claro.

Pero esto pasaba con los que tenían ahorros. Millones no tenían ni ahorros ni un peso ni un dólar ni comida ni trabajo ni futuro ni dónde curarse ni dónde educarse ni dónde caerse muertos. Era el pueblo raso oscuro no entrevistado no relevado no visitado por la televisión. Mientras los ahorristas se volvían locos de ira golpeando las vallas que rodeaban los bancos otros comenzaron a ver en la basura una vía de supervivencia y el hambre era tanta y la desesperación era tan grande y el Estado estaba tan presente en el saqueo y tan ausente en daños provocados que hubo unos meses que muchos vecinos de esta ciudad que después se puso facha sacaban la basura y dejaban al lado una bolsita limpia con un par de huevos duros. Los pibes se morían de hambre.

Aquellos dos días de diciembre de 2001 empezaron con noticias de saqueos y víctimas pobres como el chino del que nos acordamos llorando porque le habían robado todo. El pobre contra pobre estaba incrustado en esta sociedad. Pero la confluencia del malestar de los ahorristas con el hambre en los barrios se juntó una noche y siguió la siguiente hasta que vimos el helicóptero alejarse con rumbo a la impunidad.

Fue un vómito social un estallido que ahora quieren minimizar para volver a esas políticas entre ridículas y perversas. Lo de piquete y cacerola y una lucha en común duró un suspiro. De eso sí los delincuentes económicos se ocuparon con ahínco: la cacerola abandonó al piquete a su suerte cuando pudo volver a Miami. Esa ciudad tiene ese hechizo: convence a los pelagatos que son superiores a muchos otros. Siempre tendrán Miami o un narcótico de efectos similares para pegar ahí porque saben que el día que los pequeños ahorristas hagan carne que su bienestar está totalmente desenganchado del de la gente que vota se les termina el curro y pueden pasarla mal."

Officers from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) responded to the scene. The victim was transported to a local area hospital where he succumbed to his injuries” CHP said in a statement.

Concert promoter Live Nation which along with Snoop Dogg organized the event decided to end the concert early following the incident.

“There was an altercation in the roadway backstage. Out of respect for those involved and in coordination with local authorities artists and organizers decided not to move forward with remaining sets so the festival was ended an hour early” a statement from Live Nation said.

The festival’s Instagram profile also announced the premature end to the event but did not provide a reason.

“The Once Upon a Time in LA Fest is ending early. All performances are now over. Please head to the closest exit and head Eastbound on MLK” the post said of the festival.

In a tweet Jawson said Drakeo’s loss was “monumental.”

“No words can explain what Drakeo meant to me. Drakeo was the most original and innovative artist of his generation” Jawson said adding Drakeo was “a king without a crown or throne.”

Jawson also compared Drakeo’s loss to that of two other slain rap icons Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur.

CHP Public Information Officer Shanelle Gonzalez said investigative services were working on the incident reviewing tapes and speaking to witnesses. She also said authorities do not know what type of weapon was involved in the fight and that no arrests have been made.

Drakeo got his start in Los Angeles

Drakeo the Ruler came onto the LA rap scene in 2015 with “I am Mr. Mosely” and released a series of mixtapes. He became known for his laid-back rapping style and distinctive slang such as in his song “Flu Flamming.”

His budding career was repeatedly limited by legal troubles. He was arrested in 2017 on a weapons charge and in 2018 for murder related to the shooting of a 24-year-old man and he was held at Men’s Central Jail in Los Angeles County for several years.

As the journalist Jeff Weiss has reported prosecutors in the murder trial attempted to use Drakeo’s lyrics and music videos as evidence against him arguing his rap group constituted a criminal gang. A jury acquitted him of the murder charge in 2019 but prosecutors refiled charges of criminal gang conspiracy and he agreed to a plea deal so he could be released from jail last year he said in an interview with Weiss published at The Ringer.

“I’m a prime example of what happens to 90 percent of Black people in the system” Drakeo said in the interview. “I was acquitted of damn near every single charge and I still had to plead to a gang enhancement to go home.”

Those legal troubles also played a central role in his music. Last year while still behind bars he and his producer JoogSZN released the album “Thank You for Using GTL” – a reference to Global Tel Link the company that controls phone services for imprisoned people – in which he rapped his verses on a crackly jail phone line. The music review site Pitchfork said the album was a “remarkable feat: a stark rebuke of the justice system and an unparalleled achievement for a rapper and his producer.”

Since leaving jail he released several more mixtapes as well as his first studio album “The Truth Hurts” in February.

Rappers mourn Drakeo’s death

The rapper Drake who collaborated with Drakeo the Ruler earlier this year on the track “Talk To Me” posted a remembrance to his Instagram story. “Nah man this s*** isn’t right for real wtf are we doing” he wrote adding Drakeo “always picked my spirit up with your energy. RIP Drakeo.”

Rapper Snoop Dogg also wrote a tribute for the rapper on Twitter.

Snoop Dogg expressed his condolences for Drakeo’s family and loved ones and called for an end to violence in the hip-hop world.

“I’m not with anything negative and as one of the many performers I was there to spread positive vibes only to my city of L.A. Last night I was in my dressing room when I was informed about the incident and chose to immediately leave the festival grounds. My prayers go out to everyone affected by tragedy. Please take care love one another and stay safe ya’ll. IM PRAYING FOR PEACE IN HIP HOP” Snoop Dogg’s tweet read.

Commander Dottie Packer (N.C. USN Retired). Packer a supporter of WAA for many years including riding in the convoy from Maine to Arlington Cemetery has long been a proud supporter Hally’s efforts on behalf of WAA in Branford which began in 2019.Pam Johnson/The Sound

A tremendous volunteer effort capped by a remarkable single donation of $9000 has helped add up to a successful third year for Branford teen Mark Hally's effort to honor those in military graves in town on National Wreaths Across America (WAA) Day Dec. 18.

This year a total of 1658 wreaths were sponsored; with each wreath equaling a donation of $15. During a cold rainy but heartwarming ceremony on Dec. 18 at St. Agnes Cemetery a large crowd of volunteers and supporters gathered at noon for remarks remembrance and to honor those who served.

""I would like to thank everyone for coming out and volunteering for this event even though the weather is not the greatest"" said Hally. ""This is the third year and the program has grown. I want to thank everyone for contributing for their support and especially Lockheed Martin who donated $9000 to Wreaths Across America Branford.""

Hally said this year's program is deeply grateful for the $9000 donation from Lockheed Martin owner of Sikorsky Aircraft. On Dec. 18 he was also glad to meet Dan Woermer of Naugatuck a quality supervisor from the company who came to Branford for the ceremony and to assist as a volunteer laying wreaths.

The son of a military veteran Woermer applied to volunteer with WAA through the company website and said he was glad he was given the Branford location for his volunteer effort.

""I figured I would do my share. My father's a veteran too"" said Woermer.

In 2019 Hally placed 1600 wreaths on Branford veterans' graves on national WAA Day marking the first time Branford military places of rest received the honor of WAA wreaths. In December 2020 Hally and small cadre of dedicated volunteers put on their face masks grabbed their snow shovels and helped place 1300 WAA wreaths on Branford military graves.

Hally instituted Branford's WAA program in 2019 as part of his Eagle Scout project.

""I wanted every veteran in Branford to have a wreath just like they do in Arlington"" he said.

He also pledged that year to continue the program. Hally also continues to receive volunteer assistance from Branford Boy Scout Troop 604. Hally now a cadet under the Branford Fire Department (BFD) also thanked BFD which has again provided pivotal support to the program for a third year.

On Dec 18 the brief ceremony opened with patriotic music by Stony Creek Fife & Drum Corps as the BFD Honor Guard marched the colors to stand with a display of specially decorated wreaths one for each branch of the military beside Engine 1. Vietnam veteran Brian Minter discussed the history and importance of honoring military graves through the WAA. Each year on National WAA Day wreaths like those now at Branford military graves are placed on military graves at Arlington National Cemetery and at tens of thousands of other military graves across the country at over 1200 locations.

The Branford event also included a blessing of the wreaths by St. Therese Church (St. John Bosco Parish) Rev. Monsignor David Walker; as well as a military gun salute and the playing of Taps in a bugle call and response by Branford High School musicians.

BFD and cemetery captains also assisted Hally in coordinating simultaneously laying wreaths at the town's seven cemeteries on Dec. 18. In addition to Engine 1 and the career staff assisting with traffic and the laying of wreaths at St. Agnes other areas were covered with assistance from Volunteer Company 2 - MP Rice Stony Creek Company 5 and Indian Neck Company 9.

Special assistance at the town's various cemeteries was provided by key volunteers including Branford Lions Club president Marci Ward at Tabor Lutheran Cemetery; as part of the second year of the Lions' commitment to lay wreaths at Tabor; Brian Dougherty captain for the Stony Creek Cemetery and one who has been involved since the start of WAA in Branford; Alex Palluzzi Jr. assisting with laying the wreaths for Damacus Cemetery; Kris Klarman Center Cemetery captain and Lexi and Jeff Klarman of W. Clancy Funeral home captains for St. Agnes Cemetery; and assistance from Jerry and Nicole Staunton in laying wreaths at St. Mary Cemetery and the Mill Plain Cemetery. In addition Hally thanked Bill O'Brien for providing his photography services including gathering a group shot of all of the volunteers at the ceremony that morning.

In all wreaths laid by volunteers in Branford cemeteries visiting military graves on Dec. 18 included 1004 wreaths in St. Agnes 330 in Center Cemetery 145 in Tabor 125 in Stony Creek 27 in St. Mary 5 in Mill Road and 4 in Damascus. In addition 18 wreaths honoring the town's deceased military were placed at schools and parks in town.

With this the fifth-generation stealth fighter will be able to quickly detect and combat changing electromagnetic threats in contested battle spaces the aerospace giant says.

BAE Systems will deliver improved hardware for the F-35’s high-performance EW mission system known as AN/ASQ-239 as well as engineering support and test infrastructure under the terms of the contract.

The EW upgrade which was made possible by new processors placed under the Tech Refresh 3 program has been regarded as the centerpiece of the F-35 Block 4 improvements.

With more sensors and more sophisticated signal processing the enhanced system will provide greater situational awareness and electromagnetic attack and countermeasure capabilities.

“The capabilities we’ll deliver under this contract are foundational and they’ll be leveraged across platforms to guarantee that all warfighters have the most advanced EW capability at their fingertips” said Lisa Aucoin vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems.

“Our warfighters will be able to outpace evolving threats and protect democracy around the world owing to the highly adaptive mission system.”

The AN/ASQ-239 “collects and processes electromagnetic energy in signal-dense and contested environments” Aucoin stated. “It provides situational awareness and self-protection by combining offensive and defensive EW capabilities such as broadband radar warning and suppression targeting support and multi-spectral countermeasures.”

The robust design of the upgraded electronic warfare system will allow for rapid future upgrades consistent with the US Department of Defense’s strategy for continuous capability development. The modular architecture of the system will also enable efficient hardware upgrades lowering lifetime and retrofit costs as well as faster software updates throughout the whole F-35 fleet.

The system features the Non-Intrusive Electronic Warfare Test Solution (NIEWTS) fault isolation and diagnostics capability which allows for more precise troubleshooting and lowers maintenance costs even more.

Apart from the EW system BAE also builds the jet’s aft fuselage “active interceptor control system” and vehicle management computer at sites in Australia the United Kingdom and the United States. To keep the F-35s mission-ready the business also provides sustainability technical support and training services.

The Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) which will defend the F-15C F-15E and new F-15EX is also being manufactured by the company. BAE Systems is a global leader in integrated full-spectrum multi-domain electronic warfare (EW) systems for defensive and offensive applications across domains.

The company’s Extreme EW 2.0 (EWX) strategy combines world-class agile engineering next-generation manufacturing and reinvented sustainment solutions to provide systems that keep warfighters safe from future threats.

F-35 Block 4 Upgrades

According to Lockheed Martin the F-35 Block 4 upgrade is a “continuous capability development and delivery” program that will give more computing capacity processing power and memory than current F-35 computers.

The F-35’s Block 4 software upgrades also provide the jet with more missiles and greater ranges enabling it to operate AI-driven loyal wingmen (such as the XQ-58A ‘Valkyrie’ drone) through the US Air Force’s Skyborg program.

The F-35 fighter plane can now launch the Sidewinder missile “off boresight” as well as an increasing number of other armaments thanks to recent software improvements. The Block IV modification will allow the stealth fighter plane to deliver the Small Diameter Bomb Increment II also known as the Stormbreaker in the coming years.

According to a report published by The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies “Block 4” is a “suite of mostly classified hardware upgrades technologies and software drops that substantially improves F-35 combat effectiveness”. “The F-35 was designed and built with the goal of spiraling more capabilities into production aircraft” it says.

The F-35 will receive 53 enhancements as part of Block 4 upgrades. The Technology Refresh 3 package includes new hardware that will lead to more powerful core processing and computer capability as well as improved cockpit displays and memory system capacity.

This will also increase the performance of the DAS (Distributed Aperture System) which consists of six cameras positioned around the F-35 to create a “Sensor Fusion” picture. The F-35’s Sensor Fusion tells the pilot what the radar detects and then displays the data either in the helmet visor or on the instrument panel’s “glass touchscreen”.

It reduces the pilot’s workload in the cockpit by deciphering and identifying data and targets. Moreover Sensor Fusion and data sharing aboard the F-35 allow wingmen to see the same picture battlefield condition and threats without having to communicate over the radio.

DAS monitors data temperature differences to identify and track missile launches according to Lockheed. DAS projects a live “real-time” feed onto the pilot’s helmet visor at all times of the day and night and even allows the pilot to “see” through the jet’s floor below him using cameras embedded in the fuselage.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: The most recent missile test at Vandenberg Air Force Base shows that the missile can hit ranges farther than four hundred kilometers according to a Lockheed Martin press statement. In fact the Army has configured the weapon so that two missiles can fly from the same launch-pod container a circumstance that could increase tactical mobility and the rapid rate of fire.

The Army’s fast-emerging Precision Strike Missile is being developed as a major long-range and precise land-attack weapon. But it appears that the military service has bigger plans for it. The Army is clearly evolving the weapon so that it is capable of attacking enemy ships air defenses and other maritime targets.

The multi-domain concept is consistent with the Army’s cross-domain networked combat approach which is now being fast-tracked at events such as the service’s Project Convergence exercise.

Earlier this year key PrSM developers told the National Interest that the Army is already making plans beyond acquiring a mere land-attack weapon.

“We are thinking past 2023 and thinking about how we’re going to use the Precision Strike Missile to hit ships and air defenses” Brig. Gen. John Rafferty the director of the Long Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team for Army Futures Command told the National Interest.

The military service has conducted tests at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. “We are continuing to increase the complexity of the challenges of each test event as we go along” Rafferty said earlier this year.

The most recent missile test at Vandenberg Air Force Base shows that the missile can hit ranges farther than four hundred kilometers according to a Lockheed Martin press statement. In fact the Army has configured the weapon so that two missiles can fly from the same launch-pod container a circumstance that could increase tactical mobility and the rapid rate of fire.

Later this year the Army plans to fire PrSMs during its Project Convergence 2021 an exercise where cutting-edge innovations will be tested. The exercise prioritizes experiments. Some of them will be aimed at using artificial intelligence-enabled computing to instantly analyze information share target data or pair sensors with shooters. This concept was demonstrated last fall at the Army’s Project Convergence 2020. In a discussion with the National Interest Army Futures Command Commander Gen. John Murray explained that the PrSM will figure prominently in networking sensing and artificial-intelligence-targeting scenarios envisioned for Project Convergence 2021.

Project Convergence is intended to be an “experiment” or “learning exercise” to push the envelope of technological possibility and ultimately change the paradigm for modern warfare and the Army’s combined arms maneuver strategy according to Murray. The objective which was accomplished in many respects during Project Convergence 2020 was to reduce the sensor-to-shooter targeting decision cycle from twenty minutes down to seconds. Despite the success of Project Convergence Murray made describes the effort as an “ongoing experiment” and “learning process.”

“In the future we want to bring in more shooters and kind of expand” Murray said. “And it’s about scaling right? So you know how how far can we expand the network? How far can we expand their scale in the number of shooters we bring? And how far can we scale the number of sensors? Because you’re gonna reach an upper boundary at some point. And so what is that upper boundary? And you know how does that work in a contested environment?”

When coupled with the kind of multi-node sensor-to-shooter pairing described by Murray the PrSM brings first-of-its-kind multi-domain attack possibilities to dispersed areas like the Pacific region Rafferty said.

“The long-term missile solution for the Army is to attack all domains including maritime and land is PrSM” Rafferty said.

This is the third consecutive test and again it failed.

Photo credit: Wikipedia

The reasons for the failed test are currently unknown as confirmed in response to an inquiry sent by The Drive. Air Force Brig. Gen. Heath Collins the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons said telemetry and missile data were to be analyzed. “On Dec. 15 2021 the Air Force Department attempted a booster test flight of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon [ARRW] from a B-52 Stratofortress” the general said.

The United States had hoped that in 2021 the Air Force would conduct at least three successful tests of the missile and its accelerator but this did not happen. The Drive described the “partial success” of the second test of the AGM-183A which took place in July when the prototype missile was successfully detached from the bomber but never ignited or accelerated.

The purpose of these tests is to see and analyze the operation of the hypersonic missile booster AGM-183A as it is the basis of the principle of operation of the hypersonic missile. According to the developments the booster must accelerate the missile until it is released after which the missile must fly at a hypersonic speed of at least Mach 5 according to the characteristics. This missile will fly in low orbit and will be highly maneuverable to avoid enemy air defense systems.

The Drive noted that the third consecutive failed test was an alarm. Many experts believe that developing and owning a hypersonic missile whether launched from the air or a ground system is a major advantage over the opponent. Hypersonic missiles are outlining the future of security and as the authors of The Drive note they are “the key to future military action” in the event of a conflict with Russia or China.

“What you need to be worried about is that in the last five years or maybe longer the United States has done nine hypersonic missile tests and in the same time the Chinese have done hundreds” the now-retired Air Force Gen. John Hyten who was Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said at a Defense Writers Group event in October. “Single digits vs hundreds is not a good place.”

Russia and China already have working hypersonic missiles and are currently developing new ones. What worries the United States is that China has recently introduced hypersonic orbital weapon something neither Russia nor the United States has achieved so far. On November 30 a new version of the capabilities emerged from a statement by Space Force Lieutenant General Chance Saltzman the Deputy Chief of Space Operations for Operations Cyber and Nuclear.

According to Saltzman the Chinese hypersonic weapon has an orbital character ie. may remain in orbit indefinitely until the client [or its user – ed.] decides otherwise. As we reported earlier the mysterious thing about Chinese hypersonic weapons is the fact that during its test flight which traveled the world at one point it released another body that hit a target located in China. Ie Saltzman believes that China’s hypersonic glider can launch its projectiles.

“This is a categorically different system because a fractional orbit is different than suborbital” Saltzman continued. “A fractional orbit means it can stay on orbit as long as the user determines and then it de-orbits it as a part of the flight path.”

That’s why the United States needs a successful test of the AGM-183A hypersonic missile. It will allow Lockheed Martin engineers to build on this foundation and continue more successfully to develop hypersonic missiles. We remind you that this year the company opened a special plant in Alabama which will have to produce only this type of weapon.

However so far Washington has lagged far behind in developing hypersonic weapons compared to Moscow and Beijing.

While teasing her new CBS holiday film Christmas Takes Flight to PEOPLE the 40-year-old actress reflected on her time playing Quinn Perkins on Scandal.

The Shonda Rhimes-created series which ended in 2018 after seven seasons followed Kerry Washington's Olivia Pope a former media consultant to the president (Tony Goldwyn) who leaves her post to start her own crisis-management firm. Despite attempting to put her former White House ties behind her she still finds herself getting continuously entangled in the political world.

Scott Foley Bellamy Young Guillermo Díaz Darby Stanchfield Jeff Perry Joshua Malina Joe Morton and George Newbern also starred in the ABC drama.

Looking back on the acclaimed series Lowes tells PEOPLE about which of Quinn's storylines she considers to be the most shocking.

""Everything. I mean oh gosh. When I got my teeth ripped out by Huck (Díaz). Becoming a trained spy and killer. When I got kidnapped by Papa Pope and got put under and had a baby. When I got married to Charlie (Newbern)"" says Lowes. ""I mean there were so many times at table reads where I was like 'What?' ""

And while she deems many of Quinn's storylines as ""crazy"" Lowes has nothing but fond memories from her time working on the series.

""There's too many incredible memories"" she shares. ""The first time I brought my son to set he was 8 weeks old and Kerry Washington was directing the episode. I had to do a little dance scene with a baby [and] with Joe Morton because Papa Pope had kidnapped Quinn. Debbie Allen was choreographing the little dance stuff. And I'm like 'Oh my gosh. I'm here with my baby and Kerry Washington and Joe Morton and Debbie Allen on the set of Scandal. Somebody pinch me.' ""

Lowes says the cast of Scandal is still the closest of pals. ""They're some of my best friends in the entire world"" she says.

The mom of two adds ""We have something called Scandal fam and it's really true. We are a hardcore family. We're on a WhatsApp chain with all of us [and] our significant others. We text each other daily birthdays congratulations and hanging out. And we have reunions. We're just really close.""

Fortunately for Lowes she recently got another chance to work with series creator Rhimes 51 in Inventing Anna. The upcoming Netflix miniseries follows the real-life case of Anna Delvey (a.k.a. Anna Sorokin) a woman who posed as a wealthy German heiress and was eventually convicted after conning many out of money.

""This is an amazing story. So just imagine what you do when you have an amazing true story met with the greatest writer ever"" says Lowes who plays Rachel on the series. ""It is so freaking juicy. When I first read the scripts it's like you can't watch it ingest it binge it fast enough. You guys are in for a freaking ride.""

Even though fans will have to wait until next year to stream Inventing Anna they can watch Lowes star in Christmas Takes Flight on Sunday.

The televised film follows pilot Jenny Beckett (Lowes) a woman who is determined to save her family-owned airline's annual holiday benefit for underserved children from being cancelled. The charitable event's legacy is threatened after CEO Matt Connor (Evan Williams) purchases the airline but Jenny starts to fall for Matt despite his conflicting motives.

Lowes says she was largely intrigued by the film due to her ""badass"" character Jenny.

""She's strong. She's a single mom. She runs a business. She's a pilot. I read that only 1 percent of pilots are women"" says the Katie's Crib podcast host who is also gearing up to star alongside Pete Holmes in the sitcom How We Roll.

""I felt connected to her as a mom. I felt connected to her in running a business because I run a business. And I just felt like she is very loyal to her family to her dad her younger brother and to her family legacy. I just felt like she was cool as hell"" Lowes adds.

Reminder About Open Stores

Each year when I post this list I hear from readers who are upset that every single place of business is not closed on this holiday. I encourage you to remember that for some of our neighbors it is very beneficial that these businesses are open.

* They allow our essential workers to gas up on the way to and from work.

* They give folks a place to grab a bite to eat after a long shift at the hospital or fire station for instance.

* They offer a place to purchase over-the-counter medications for a sick family member or friend.

* Finally as more than one reader has pointed out not everyone celebrates Christmas including some of the store owners who chose to keep their businesses open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8va2VwcnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3N1c3BlY3RlZC10aGllZi1yYW1zLWludG8tcG9saWNlLXZlaGljbGVzLWluLWNvbHVtYmlhLWNlbnRlci1wYXJraW5nLWxvdNIBamh0dHBzOi8va2VwcnR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdXNwZWN0ZWQtdGhpZWYtcmFtcy1pbnRvLXBvbGljZS12ZWhpY2xlcy1pbi1jb2x1bWJpYS1jZW50ZXItcGFya2luZy1sb3Q?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suspected thief rams into police vehicles in Columbia Center parking lot,"Around 11:30 this morning the Benton County Sheriff's Office arrested a woman at the Columbia Center who they say has an out-of-state warrant for theft in La Grande Oregon.

The Sheriff's office says that 26-year-old Morgan Childers is tied to multiple local burglaries and they believe she is linked to a Lowes theft in Pasco.

Deputies were on the lookout for her vehicle because they believed that she would strike again. They described her thefts as a spree.

Her vehicle was recognized in the Columbia Center parking lot and deputies attempted to box her vehicle in. She ran from inside the mall to her vehicle where she then started ramming police cars before she was put under arrest.



There were no major injuries and the investigation is still ongoing.

Separately the Kennewick Police Department tells Action News that they responded to the Columbia Center this morning for a reported theft from at least one clothing store. Childers is suspected to be involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxMTIxOC91bmZvcnR1bmF0ZS1sb2NhbC1jb2FjaGVzLXJlYWN0LWF0a2luc29ucy1kaXNxdWFsaWZpY2F0aW9uLWFidS1kaGFiadIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UNFORTUNATE: Local coaches react to Atkinson's disqualification in Abu Dhabi,"Veteran national swim coach Lynval Lowe described the circumstances surrounding Alia Atkinson’s disqualification from the women’s 50m breaststroke at the World Swimming Short Course (25m pool) Championships as concerning as other athletes fell...

Veteran national swim coach Lynval Lowe described the circumstances surrounding Alia Atkinson’s disqualification from the women’s 50m breaststroke at the World Swimming Short Course (25m pool) Championships as concerning as other athletes fell victim to similar incidents.

Atkinson was disqualified in her semi-final heat on Thursday’s opening day in Abu Dhabi because of an alleged downward dolphin kick before she touched the wall initially finishing first in 29.55 seconds. Her infraction was reportedly spotted by the underwater cameras and not by any judge in a specific lane. The decision meant that she did not get a chance to defend the title she won in China three years ago.

However her disqualification (DQ) was not an anomaly. According to Swimswan.com she became the eighth swimmer to be ruled out of the event on Thursday and the 14th swimmer overall combining the women’s 50m and men’s 100m breaststroke events. Additionally six of those DQs came in lane four where Atkinson was lined up. Lowe who helped to nurture Atkinson’s talent said that it was concerning that such a high number of infractions would have occurred in one lane.

SIX DISQUALIFICATIONS IN SAME LANE

“That to me seems kind of puzzling. If the disqualifications were spread across different lanes then I would have understood” Lowe told The Gleaner. “If you have (a certain) number of disqualifications in lane four then the judges should have come to a decision to take a close watch on lane four to see what is going on because something must have been going on to get (six) disqualifications in lane four.”

While not saying that Atkinson was guilty of the infringement Lowe noted that it could be possible for the cameras to misinterpret the incident in question because of the nature of the discipline.

“Breaststroke is a fast kick. When you kick out you kick a small kick and then based upon the hip movement and based upon the kicking back if one is not careful it might seem like it is a butterfly kick. But it is done so quickly the camera can say that it is a butterfly kick when it is not. I am not sure what they are using is the ideal thing” Lowe said.

It is a situation that both Lowe and national coach Rory Alvaranga have described as unfortunate given that the two-time Olympian was competing in what could be the last international competition of her career.

“As an official myself the thing is if you are 99 per cent sure of a situation you give the one per cent benefit to the swimmer. I can’t say whether Alia did or did not (commit the infringement). But I am really disappointed with the call. I really wanted to see Alia win this one in what could be her last hurrah” Alvaranga said.

“Everybody is looking forward to her winning that 50m breaststroke. That is her pet event. That is what you go down there for and (getting disqualified like that) that is rough” Lowe said.

Atkinson will have to concentrate on the women’s 100m breaststroke which starts early Sunday morning and Alvaranga believes that she will be in the proper frame of mind to perform.

“Alia is a seasoned veteran. If the call is upheld Alia has already put that behind her and she will go to the next one. I don’t think that this will affect her going forward” Alvaranga said.

The appointment was announced in Rome at midnight New Zealand time.

Bishop Lowe replaces Bishop Patrick Dunn who has served since 1994 and is retiring.

The Diocese of Auckland has almost 40 per cent of New Zealand’s 471000 Catholics.

“I am humbled at being asked by the Holy Father to be the Bishop of Auckland and the successor of Bishop Pat Dunn a much loved Bishop” says Bishop Lowe.

“Auckland is our largest Diocese and our first Diocese. When I look at the bishops who have served Auckland starting with Bishop Pompallier they all had the challenges of their time and circumstances. But they also had their own unique gifts and talents and the gifts and talents of the people of God. So I’m looking forward to becoming part of the Diocese of Auckland as we work together for the building of God’s kingdom.”

Bishop Lowe was ordained as Bishop of Hamilton in February 2015. Born in Hokitika he was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Christchurch in his home town at Hokitika in 1996.

He served as the assistant priest in the Mairehau Ashburton and Greymouth parishes before being appointed parish priest of Timaru North and Chaplain of Roncalli College in 2000. From 2005-2007 he completed a Licence in Spiritual Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.

He was appointed to Holy Cross Seminary in Auckland in 2008 where he served as Formation Director until the end of 2014. While based there he served for a time as Parish Priest of Ponsonby.

Bishop Lowe is the Vice President and Secretary of the NZ Catholic Bishops Conference and the bishops’ representative on Te Rūnanga o te Hāhi Katorika ō Aotearoa the Church’s national Māori advisory group. He is also a member of several other bodies including the National Safeguarding and Professional Standards Committee.

Bishop Lowe’s appointment to Auckland means the dioceses of Hamilton Palmerston North and Christchurch are without bishops pending Pope Francis announcing new appointments."

Group (M) Berhad (KLSE:MRDIY) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of MYR0.01,"Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad (KLSE:MRDIY) will pay a dividend of MYR0.01 on the 21st of June. The dividend yield is 1.8% based on this payment which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.

View our latest analysis for Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad

Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

While yield is important another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Prior to this announcement Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.

The next year is set to see EPS grow by 36.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends we estimate the payout ratio will be 22% which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency

The track record isn't the longest but we are already seeing a bit of instability in the payments. The dividend has gone from an annual total of MYR0.0195 in 2020 to the most recent total annual payment of MYR0.032. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.

The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential

Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's earnings per share has shrunk at 80% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. It's not all bad news though as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.

Our Thoughts On Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend

Overall it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment but we think that longer term the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past the payments have been unstable but over the short term the dividend could be reliable with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example we've picked out 1 warning sign for Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Still Reigning With $52M-$55M Opening – Saturday Box Office Update,"SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/florida-a-m-backs-away-from-dubious-237m-donation-00157234 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

For this cover option all three of the chosen cover models posed together. According to Sports Illustrated it’s the first time the magazine has ever done something like this. “Not only are we giving you one cover showcasing these extraordinary and empowering women together but we also have three additional covers one of each model individually. This marks a first for the brand: three powerful women. Four incredible covers. One groundbreaking issue.”

During this time Mastercard has been at the forefront of digital transformation and payment technology innovation. From its regional headquarters the company has introduced hundreds of product capabilities through its multi-rail network including a number of global-firsts that have been exported to Mastercard’s global network.

From January 1 2022 Mastercard’s EEMEA (Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa) region will include 81 of the 210 markets where Mastercard operates globally. In line with Mastercard’s ambition to enhance local presence in the markets it operates in the company now has presence in 22 countries across the region with established geo hubs in the UAE Saudi Arabia South Africa Turkey Ukraine Kenya and other markets.

Raghu Malhotra currently President for the Middle East and Africa will take on a new role leading Mastercard’s International Markets as Co-President.

For the last six years Malhotra drove the company’s global strategy across the Middle East and Africa delivering many global-firsts that empower millions of people and businesses through interoperable mobile ecosystems and advance the region’s digital ambitions.

Such initiatives have seen the development of multiple country-wide payment ecosystems including in the UAE Saudi Arabia and Egypt the establishment of Mastercard Labs to drive innovative solutions for financial inclusion and the launch of unique micro lending programs alongside cutting edge QR technology and security solutions. These efforts fuelled by strategic public and private sector partnerships have played a key role in achieving the region’s digital ambitions.

Dimitrios Dosis will serve as President of the newly realigned Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) region. This expanded region brings together 12 additional markets with agile high-potential growth opportunities. In his new role Dosis will continue to serve on the Mastercard Global Management Committee.

A focal point for innovation

Malhotra said “Over the recent years Eastern Europe the Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) has emerged as a focal point for Mastercard’s global innovation digital transformation and financial inclusion efforts. Today this region serves as a global centre of excellence and a launch pad for deploying strategic partnerships and new business models across our global network.

“Over the years it has shown how progress can be achieved when multiple partners come together to contribute expertise share experiences and tap into technology to bring positive change. As an example the UAE has committed to doubling the size of its digital economy in the next 10 years fuelled by advances in AI blockchain 5G and a range of other digital technologies.

“Mastercard has been supporting the Middle East and Africa region on this journey for the past 35 years through smart technology innovation strategic public and private sector partnerships and smart city initiatives. During recent years we have continued to build close partnerships with public and private sector organisations working towards the shared goal of creating an inclusive digital economy. Here in the UAE some of the landmark initiatives have included the launch of Klip the digital cash platform of Emirates Digital Wallet our ongoing partnership with Expo 2020 Dubai and Dubai’s smart cities initiatives.”

A strong position for future

Looking ahead Dosis says that the success of Mastercard – and the whole region – is fuelled by convergence of technology strategic partnerships and young populations of tomorrow.

“The EEMEA region is already a global example of creativity innovation and delivery of new technologies and a launch pad for enabling like-minded global organisations to realise their business corporate responsibility and sustainability goals” said Dosis.

“Looking ahead the convergence of digital technologies and the positive impact of public and private partnerships on the development of the digital economy mean that Mastercard is in a very strong position to further elevate this progress.”

Dosis says that Mastercard is focused on meeting – as well as shaping – the evolving expectations of today’s and tomorrow’s consumer.

“The future is young and that is particularly true for this region. In the UAE more than one third of the whole population is under the age of 25 and the median age across the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is 26.8 years old.

“This clearly shows the importance of listening and activating the contributions of youth in creating a more prosperous society.

“From a business perspective we know that today’s young consumer takes the convenience which comes with technology for granted. Our technology must offer ease-of-use speed and seamless experience all available from a smart and/or wearable device – these are the prevailing market trends of tomorrow. This concerns shopping payments finance and all other kinds of services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXdhcmRzL2JyaXQtYXdhcmRzLW5vbWluYXRpb25zLWJ1cm5pbmctcXVlc3Rpb25zLWJ0cy1lbHRvbi1qb2huLTEyMzUwMTI1OTUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlsbGJvYXJkLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hd2FyZHMvYnJpdC1hd2FyZHMtbm9taW5hdGlvbnMtYnVybmluZy1xdWVzdGlvbnMtYnRzLWVsdG9uLWpvaG4tMTIzNTAxMjU5NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will BTS Finally Win a Brit Award? (And More Burning Questions About the 2022 Brits),"Will 2022 be the year BTS finally wins a Brit Award? The K-pop superstars were nominated on Saturday (Dec. 18) for international group. They were nominated in the same category last year but lost in a surprise to American sister trio HAIM.

Or might Silk Sonic win for international group? The duo comprising Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak would be the second collaboration of solo artists to win in the category. The Carters consisting of Beyoncé and Jay-Z won three years ago.

We’ll find out on Feb. 8 when the 2022 Brit Awards are presented at The 02 in London.

Here are eight more burning questions prompted by this year’s Brit Awards nominations.

1. Will Adele tie Robbie Williams as the artist with the most Brit Awards (13) in the show’s history?

Trending on Billboard

The British superstar will if she wins in all four categories in which she is nominated. Adele is currently tied with Coldplay for second place on the all-time leaderboard with nine wins each.

2. Will Adele win her third award for Mastercard album of the year?

She’s nominated for her global blockbuster 30. She won for her two most recent albums 21 (2012) and 25 (2016). Should she win again she would tie Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay as the only three-time winners in the category’s history. (Moreover she would tie Coldplay as the only act to win in this category with three consecutive studio albums.)

3. Will Adele win her third award for song of the year with Mastercard (formerly known as British single)?

She’s nominated for her warm piano ballad “Easy on Me.” She won with “Skyfall” (2013) and “Hello” (2016). Should she win again she’ll tie Williams as the solo artist with the most wins in the category (three). Take That leads all artists with five wins in the category.

4. Will Elton John win his first Brit Award in competition in 31 years?

John is nominated for song of the year with Mastercard for “Cold Heart (Pnau Mix)” his hit collab with Dua Lipa. This would be the legendary singer’s first win in a competitive category since he took best British male in 1991. It would be his first win ever in this category; Lipa’s second. She won three years ago for “One Kiss” her hit collab with Calvin Harris. A second win would make Lipa only the second female artist (following Adele) to win twice in the category’s history. Lipa would also be the first artist to win in this category twice as part of a collaboration.

5. Will Ed Sheeran or Dave become the first male solo artist to win Mastercard album of the year more than once?

Sheeran who won seven years ago for x is nominated for =. Dave who won two years ago for Psychodrama is nominated for We’re All Alone in This Together. Should Dave win he’d set a second record — becoming the first artist of color to win in the category more than once.

6. Will Little Mix which last year became the first all-female group to win group win again this year?

The female trio (formerly a quartet) would be the first group of any gender to win two years running since Arctic Monkeys in 2007-08.

7. Will Coldplay win group for a record-extending fifth time?

The veteran band won in the category in 2001 2003 2012 and 2016.

8. Will Little Simz win best new artist? Or might Griff win in the category?



Little Simz is probably the front-runner for best new artist. She’s the only new artist who is also nominated for artist of the year. But Griff who won the rising star award (formerly the critic’s choice award) last year is a proven favorite with Brit voters. She would be just the third artist in the show’s history to win in both categories. Sam Smith took rising star in 2014 and best new artist the following year. Rag’n’Bone Man won both awards in 2017.

The winners in most categories are selected by a voting academy. The winners in four newly-added genre categories – rock/alternative act hip hop/grime/rap act dance act and pop/R&B act – will be determined by a public vote via TikTok which will open on Jan. 21.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdheXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL211c2ljL2JyaXQtYXdhcmRzLTIwMjItbGlsLW5hcy14LWxpdHRsZS1taXgtYW5kLWFkZWxlLXNjb3JlLW5vbWluYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BRIT Awards 2022: Lil Nas X Little Mix and Adele score nominations,"Attention!

ALL THE NOMINEES

The 2022 BRIT Award nominations have been announced with Adele Ed Sheeran Little Simz and Dave up for four trophies each. UMG leads with 29 entries (some of which are shared). Others up for multiple awards include Sam Fender Central Cee and David Guetta each of whom is nominated for three. Doja Cat Olivia Rodrigo Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X are up for two apiece.

Universal already counts a winner in Holly Humberstone who was recently named BRITs Rising Star adding to its tally of 29 which rises to 32 total when you count her alongside Rising Star nominees Bree Runway and Lola Young.

Humberstone’s label Polydor enjoys 15 noms Warner has 25 and Sony 22. There are nine purely independent releases/artists on the list.

The sizable tally spans four new genre awards (which will be decided via a public vote) as well as a rule change that allows featured artists on tracks eligible for Song of the Year and the new International Song of the Year category to be counted as nominees in their own right. As a result more female artists than in any previous year have gotten the nod.

2022 BRITs Chair and Polydor Co-President Tom March said ""The list is a true testament to the power and vibrancy of British and international music right now. It's great to see so many of the artists that have defined this year being recognized all displaying enormous talent and creativity.”

The winners will be announced at the BRIT Awards show in London on 2/8 at The O2 Arena at which time additional statuettes will be handed out for Producer and Songwriter of the Year (the nominations in those categories will be revealed in January).

Even as the Thais made 11 changes and rested several of their key players the Lions could not turn their possession advantage into goals and were punished by their more clinical opponents as they lost for the first time in the tournament after victories against Myanmar the Philippines and Timor-Leste.

It was just as well that this was not a win-or-go-home match as both sides have already booked their semi-final spots after victories in their prior matches. The Thais thus advanced as Group A winners while the Lions settled for second spot.

Both teams will find out their semi-final opponents on Sunday after the completion of the Group B matches. Group leaders Indonesia face a tough assignment with Malaysia who must win to book their last-four spot while defending Suzuki Cup champions Vietnam - who are in second spot but level on points with Indonesia - play minnows Cambodia.

Lions head coach Tatsuma Yoshida became agitated during the post-match media conference when asked about the poor result and the fact some of the fans were booing his team.

""We are always on the way to improvement and we need the fans to be on our side. We haven't qualified for the semi-finals for nine years and this is good progress for the team. I am always proud of this team's efforts"" he said before abruptly ending the conference.

Not beaten Thailand since 2012 final

Singapore had not beaten Thailand since the 2012 Suzuki Cup final first leg when they snatched a 3-1 win at Jalan Besar Stadium before holding on to win the Cup for the fourth time despite a 0-1 defeat in the second leg in Bangkok.

In the nine years since the final the Lions had not beaten the War Elephants in four encounters scoring only once while letting in eight goals against their regional rivals.

Head coach Tatsuma Yoshida fielded a strong starting line-up to try and end that losing streak reinstating veterans Faris Ramli and Shahdan Sulaiman while benching Song Ui-young and Adam Swandi.

However his Thai counterpart Alexandre Polking opted to rest a slew of stalwarts including captain Chanathip Sonkrasin and left-back Teerathon Bunmathan while striker Teerasil Dangda - who broke the all-time scoring record when he notched his 18th and 19th goal of the tournament in their 2-1 win against Philippines on Tuesday - could only make the bench.

Setback with Shakir Hamzah injury

The match started with both sides flying in with crunching tackles and it was the Lions who came off worse as defence mainstay Shakir Hamzah had to go off injured being replaced by Zulfahmi Arifin.

Despite the setback the Lions looked lively early on as they pressed the Thai defence hard with Shawal Anuar a menacing presence down the right flank and striker Ikhsan Fandi testing goalkeeper Siwarak Tedsungnoen with a couple of half-chances.

Yet the Thais took the lead against the run of play in the 31st minute. Bordin Phala's swerving free-kick from the right side of the box was well-saved by Hassan Sunny but defender Yusef Elias Dolan was on hand to slam home the rebound.

The goal silenced the 9540-strong crowd as the Lions also looked stunned by the Thais' smash-and-grab success. Just as they began to pick themselves back up to threaten the Thai defence again their opponents struck again in first-half stoppage time.

After Faris lost possession near the right flank midfielder Worachit Kanitsribumphen received the ball and laid a superb through pass for an onrushing Supachai Chaided who made no mistake with a fierce low drive.

With the two-goal advantage the Thais sat back and soaked up the pressure as the Lions huffed and puffed to no avail with their ponderous build-ups causing little trouble.

While Singapore ultimately achieved their goal of making the semi-finals for the first time since 2012 Yoshida will have his hands full trying to come up with a game plan for success in the knockout stages for the limited Lions.

The Philippines who were already eliminated after losing 1-2 to Thailand on Tuesday completed their Group A games with a 3-2 win over Myanmar in a match played concurrently at the Bishan Stadium. Striker Bienvenido Maranon scored a hat-trick for the Azkals while Htet Pyo Wai replied for Myanmar with a brace.

City of Birmingham topped the Group D Team finishing with four points ahead of the play-off stages.

Play-offs

In the next stage of the competition City of Manchester and Warrington went head to head in one pool while Worthing and City of Birmigham battled in the other.

In the first pairing City of Manchester secured the win over Warrington by scoring seven goals to their competitors one.

The second match-up saw Worthing dominating the game from start to finish scoring 17 goals to City of Birmingham’s two.

This decisive match will bring together the Garuda squad with Malaysia on Sunday 19 December 2021.

Ahead of the final match which also became a prestige gamble Malaysian fans looked worried. They are worried that their proud team will not be able to achieve maximum results.

Quoted by VOI on Friday December 17 the anxiety of Malaysian fans was seen in uploads on the official Twitter account of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM). The @FAM_Malaysia account uploaded the results of the Group B standings after the match between Indonesia and Vietnam ended in a 0-0 draw.

""Group B Position Chart AFF Suzuki Cup 2020. After Match Day 4 | Wednesday December 15 2021"" the account wrote as a statement.

It was through the comments column that the Malaysian fans' concerns began to appear. Not a few of them were worried about the national team's defense against Vietnam they also suspected that the Garuda squad could appear even more terrible after that match.

""Perhaps Indonesia will play defensively like this against Malaysia later"" wrote Malaysian fans in the comments column.

""Indonesia has proven that Vietnam is not a giant in Asean. It only needs good tactics when fighting. Indonesia defended well in last night's match. Malaysia can learn a little from last night's match. Malaysian troops need to strengthen their defense"" wrote another fan.

""Coach Indo's tactics have become if I'm not mistaken he uses a 5-4-1 formation.. Playing against Vietnam is really forced to focus on defending try counter attacks & find goal set pieces.. If there are 2 ways to find goals to become Indo there is a chance to win.. Lucky Indo doesn't win if x is dangerous for Malaysia"" replied another netizen trying to analyze.

In the counter match on Wednesday Vietnam coached by Park Hang-seo dominated the match. Statistical records state that the Garuda squad is only able to control the ball with a percentage of 30.9 percent the rest is controlled by Vietnam.

Garuda troops also lost in shooting. Evan Dimas et al only fired a shot at the goal of Vietnam. While the opponent was able to launch 21 shots with 1 shot that led right to the Indonesian goal.

Despite being attacked by Vietnam the Indonesian national team's defense in that match remained solid. The efforts of the Vietnamese players to score goals have always been thwarted by the national defense this is what Malaysian fans are afraid of.

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,

Out of about 2000 candidates Mortellaro was one of 20 that won. The award honors the owner/operators “who have made outstanding contributions to strengthening McDonalds's brand image and serving their customers and local communities.”

Mortellaro heads 16 McDonald’s in five counties including seven in Licking County. He was one of two Ronald Award winners from the vast Columbus Region which includes five states: all of Ohio and West Virginia most of Kentucky eastern Indiana and western Pennsylvania.

It was Mortellaro’s community involvement that primarily led to the honor. He is heavily involved in the community in a number of ways.

A father of three Mortellaro is a board member at John Carroll University and Licking County Memorial Health Systems. He’s also a board member at the Ronald McDonald House and partners with local nonprofits.

“If other nonprofits and local businesses are successful in our community then it will help out everybody” he said. He uses his 25 years of business experience to help make decisions.

Additionally Mortellaro has helped set up a scholarship to John Carroll that is now endowed to over $130000. He also helped set up a scholarship at Central Ohio Technical College in honor of a plant supervisor who unexpectedly passed away in 2015. Education is a priority for Mortellaro.

“Our first thought is education” he said “so whenever we’re giving money and we’re trying to help the community it always goes back to education.”

Mortellaro's McDonald’s were able to open their lobbies much earlier during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic than other locations. Through thorough sanitation procedures that met both McDonald’s and state guidelines Mortellaro’s locations opened their lobbies only a couple of months into the pandemic.

The result was that many people who were starved for in-person interaction found it through their daily coffee trips to McDonald’s Mortellaro explained.

“We have these older couples that come in a coffee crew and (when) the pandemic was harming a lot of people they would come through and get their coffees like they normally do and then sit in the Texas Roadhouse parking lot so they could see each other because they missed contact with others so much. So they were very excited when we were able to open those lobbies.”

There is also the consideration of highway locations where people like to stop and go to the bathroom. Mortellaro himself relates to the struggle of pulling off an exit to take a break and use the restroom during a road trip only to find that lobbies were closed.

The trophy is a silver portrayal of a smiling Ronald McDonald. Mortellaro says that he’s happy giving back to his community.

“Rising tide raises all boats” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZvbHQudHYvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIxLTEyLTE4LzE0NDk0MC9tY2RvbmFsZHMtdG8tcGF5LWJsYWNrLWZyYW5jaGlzZWUtMzMtNS1taWxsaW9uLXRvLXNldHRsZS1yYWNpYWwtZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tbGF3c3VpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's pays Herb Washington to settle lawsuit,"Image Image Credit Getty Images Image Alt McDonald’s

McDonald’s Corporation is paying a hefty Mcprice to settle a recent lawsuit. The fast food giant has agreed to shell out $33.5 million to Herb Washington a Black franchisee who once owned 27 McDonald’s restaurants according to Cleveland.com.

The outlet reports that McDonalds Corp. has asked Washington to leave his 13 McDonald’s businesses behind and drop his racial discrimination lawsuit. Within a statement the fast food restaurant stated that “discrimination has no place at McDonalds” and the $33.5 million was “a fair price for the value of the restaurants.”

“While we were confident in the strength of our case this resolution aligns with McDonald’s values and enables us to continue focusing on our commitments to the communities that we serve” McDonald’s Corp. said.

Washington a former Major League Baseball player for the Oakland A’s initially filed his lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Youngstown Ohio in February. At the time he alleged that the fast food burger chain was treating white owners more favorably and denying him and other Black franchisees the opportunity to buy restaurants in affluent areas.

Washington’s lawsuit stated discriminatory practices led to a $700000 sales gap between Black-owned franchises and McDonald’s restaurants owned by white people. He cited high employee turnover and high operation costs in low-income neighborhoods as two of the reasons why the difference in sales is so significant.

“By relegating Black owners to the oldest stores in the toughest neighborhoods McDonald’s ensured that Black franchisees would never achieve the levels of success that White franchisees could expect” the lawsuit said. “Black franchisees must spend more to operate their stores while white franchisees get to realize the full benefit of their labors.”

McDonalds would push back by pointing the blame at Washington for his own misfortunes. “This situation is the result of years of mismanagement by Mr. Washington whose organization has failed to meet many of our standards on people operations guest satisfaction and reinvestment” the corporation said in a February statement.

In addition to having to deal with Washington’s claims — in September 2020 REVOLT reported that over 50 former Black McDonald’s franchise owners — who were forced to sell close to 200 stores — made similar claims to Washington’s in their own lawsuit filed against McDonald’s.

Washington’s settlement arrives nearly one week after McDonald’s said it plans to launch an initiative to recruit new franchise owners from underrepresented communities and will devote $250 million over five years to help them buy a McDonald’s restaurant.

The fast food giant says it will dedicate $250 million over five years to help potential franchisees in the U.S. who have difficulty getting funding from other sources to buy a McDonald’s restaurant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudGhlZHAuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS8xMi9wZW5uLXdhbG51dC1zdHJlZXQtbWNkb25hbGRzLXB1cmNoYXNlLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Penn enters agreement to purchase McDonald's on 40th and Walnut streets,"Please support us by disabling your ad blocker on our site.

Penn enters agreement to purchase McDonald's on 40th and Walnut streets

Penn is under agreement to purchase the McDonald's located on 40th and Walnut streets at an unspecified future date.

The location will be renovated into a mixed-use office building Executive Director of Real Estate Ed Datz wrote in an emailed statement to The Daily Pennsylvanian on Dec. 16. The McDonald's will be relocated into the new building.

The McDonald's located at 3935 Walnut St. has been the subject of scrutiny by some Penn community members who believe the building's presence attracts crime. In a 2011 interview with the DP Vice President for Public Safety and Penn Police Superintendent Maureen Rush said the McDonald's presence is a ""safety concern"" due its ability to generate ""unruly crowds.""

Other community members believe concerns about the McDonald's are linked to anti-Black racism. In a 2011 interview with the DP West Philadelphia resident Larry Falcon said safety concerns are a ""veil"" for racism targeting young Black West Philadelphia residents.

Some comments on a 2011 article published in West Philly Local also criticized Penn officials for characterizing the McDonald's as a ""scourge"" on campus and condemned the University's redevelopment of West Philadelphia neighborhoods as gentrification.

In the past Penn officials have expressed interest in purchasing and redeveloping the McDonald's building. In 2011 then-Director of Real Estate Paul Sehnert told the DP that he wanted to transform the building into a residential space with restaurants and retail.

The McDonald's had previously planned to relocate in 2001 to 43rd and Market streets but construction was canceled following petitions by Falcon and the activist group he founded Neighbors Against McPenntrification who were concerned about how construction disturbed their neighborhoods.

""McDonald's has operated at this vibrant Walnut Street location since 1970 providing a gathering place for community members and students alike"" a representative from McDonald's wrote in an emailed statement on Dec. 16. ""We remain committed to serving at this location years ahead.""

EDEN PRAIRIE Minn. — A 15-year-old from Edina is being hailed by law enforcement as a hero for rushing to the aid of one of her customers at the McDonald's in Eden Prairie.

Sydney Raley who has worked at the fast food chain since the summer said her Saturday shift started out normally. But with a careful eye while presenting food to guests at the drive-through window she noticed a woman she was serving didn't look okay.

""I noticed that she was coughing profusely and her daughter just had this look on her face like sheer terror"" said Raley. ""I could tell oh crap she’s choking! Just seeing that visceral reaction I knew we need to act fast.""

Raley had taken Red Cross first aid training when she was 11 years old to become a babysitter. She put the training to use and acted fast.

""I jumped out the window of the drive-through and I got her out of the car and I told her daughter to call 911. I started doing the Heimlich maneuver but I’m not really strong so it didn’t work the first couple times.""

She says that's when she called over a bystander who was parked in the lot while waiting for his food. The bystander successfully dislodged a chicken nugget the woman was choking on according to Raley and police who responded to the scene.

""It could’ve ended a lot worse but I am super thankful for that bystander who helped so much"" said Raley. ""Because I am decent at first aid but if it weren’t for him and our efforts together it could’ve ended so much worse.""

Guys. You will WANT to tune into @kare11 for a very amazing story!!!! This is Sydney Raley. She is a ray of sunshine a brilliant young woman who also happens to have autism. Yesterday she noticed one of her customers choking at the @McDonalds drive-thru window and she 1/ pic.twitter.com/TVBVtLcyG1 — Eva Andersen - KARE 11 News (@EvaKare11) December 19 2021

The two Eden Prairie Police officers who responded to the scene each gave Raley a $50 bill. Sergeant Scott Mittelstadt says it's part of money that each offer is given to recognize or help out citizens around the holiday season.

""Our crime fund gave every officer fifty dollars to hand out to wherever we feel the need [including] if somebody did outstanding work above and beyond"" said Sergeant Scott Mittelstadt. ""She is well-deserving of that money.""

Raley's parents Tom and Stephanie say they're super proud of their daughter who they refer to as ""Sydney Sunshine."" They say she has autism and is gifted with a brilliant mind.

""I always tell her she has a gift because she's autistic"" said Tom. ""She can remember anything – do anything. It's crazy.""

Stephanie adds that her daughter remembers everything as a script which no doubt helped her recall the training with the Heimlich maneuver.

""She remembered all of the training as a script in her head and was able to jump into action right away just because it was stored up there and she can recall anything she reads and hears"" Stephanie said.

Raley who turns 16 in a few weeks was humbled by the recognition from police and says it's ""insane"" that they gave her 100 dollars. She says the whole experience helped her learn about herself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbWlkbWljaGlnYW5ub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWhvbGRzLWdyYWR1YXRpb24tY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tZm9yLWVtcGxveWVl0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9taWRtaWNoaWdhbm5vdy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWhvbGRzLWdyYWR1YXRpb24tY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tZm9yLWVtcGxveWVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's holds graduation celebration for employee,"SAGINAW Mich. - The McDonald’s restaurant at 510 S.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

San Francisco-based METAGEO has announced the launch of its eponymously named GIS platform that was designed to enable organizations to host analyze and share 3D map datasets between any internet-capable device. The platform takes location-based data from the physical world and streams it to Internet-based devices or metaverse platforms.



According to the company the new technology addresses a common GIS problem: most GIS platforms are costly and complex to use. In addition most utilize files that are too large for viewing on mobile devices or rendering in VR environments. In contrast MATEGO is an affordable user-friendly platform that can download data from multiple sources. These include mobile devices satellites drones IoT sensors 3D models and topographic maps.



The company intends for its innovative platform to be used in a range of industries such as architecture academia construction engineering environmental monitoring public safety and more.

When the founder of Facebook announced in October that he was changing the name of the social-media network’s parent company to Meta Platforms in order to help create an alternative digital reality known as the metaverse he was mercilessly mocked. To some he was generating a smokescreen to distract attention from a political furore. To others he was merely the latest middle-aged tech billionaire to chase a childhood fantasy much as Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk were doing with space rockets.

And yet his timing was impeccable. Since October searches on Google for “metaverse” have soared. Wall Street is fanning the hype. According to Bernstein a broker the term cropped up 449 times in third-quarter earnings calls up from 100 in the second quarter. It says markets with potential annual revenue of at least $2trn could be disrupted by the metaverse.

Facebook Pay lets you send or receive money on Instagram Facebook and Messenger. Now that Meta offers a new gadget called Portal this device also allows Facebook Pay. Should you try this new payment experience?

Looking back on the many other online payment apps you might not be as excited to try this one. In that case you may look at it as yet another proof of the world’s ongoing digital transformation. Even tech-centric companies like Meta are still trying to improve. Perhaps Facebook Pay could be a wake-up call for you to improve as well.



I’ll kick things off by talking more about Facebook Pay and how it works for each of Meta’s platforms and devices. Then I’ll show you how you can start using this service but this will depend on where you live. We will also discuss whether you should use Facebook Pay or not then we will look into the insights it provides about our modern times.

What is Facebook Pay?

The description I provided earlier was a straightforward summary of how FB Pay works. Still we should talk about how it functions for each platform starting with Facebook:

It lets you spend a lot easier when shopping in the Facebook Marketplace.

Facebook Pay will show your saved shipping contact and payment information after completing the login verification.

You could add layers of security by setting up a PIN code face ID or fingerprint that must be provided to confirm payments.

Open the settings to manage your payment systems see your transaction and payment history and reach customer support.

Next we have to talk about how Messenger’s FB payment app works. Somehow it has made money transfers faster and easier than ever:

Send money to friends and family as if you’re sending an instant message. Tap the “+” button then the “$” button and enter the amount you want to send. The app will send funds from your payment method.

If you’re the one receiving money on Messenger just wait for up to three business days for the money to show up.

Secure each Messenger payment with a PIN code.

Now we can talk about how FB pay works with Instagram. Similar to its functions on the other platforms it’s an “insta” way to send and receive money:

Purchase from your favorite brands and influencers. Just hit the Buy on Instagram button tap Add to Bag and use “ > > “ for direct checkout on Instagram.

Help in times of need by sending FB Pay funds. Choose the page that you want to donate to then select Facebook Pay as the payment method.

You may also add a layer of protection by setting a PIN code for transactions.

Last year Meta released its smart calling device called Portal. It’s like a tablet for video conferencing and it lets you use FB Pay to buy one.

How to start using Facebook Pay

Head to your Facebook profile. Select the downward arrow button at the upper right-hand corner. Then choose Settings and Privacy. After that choose the Settings button. Go to the left-hand menu scroll down to Facebook Pay and choose it. Click or tap Add Payment Method then choose whether you’ll link a PayPal account Visa or Mastercard debit card to it.

Meta spread out initial access to the FB Pay features in various countries. If you’re from the United States the Facebook and Messenger features are available.

At the time of writing people in Estonia may use the Facebook and Instagram functions. People in the Philippines may only use the Facebook features.

Should I try Facebook Pay?

You might be wondering why you would use FB Pay over the other money transfer apps right now. After all those also let you send receive and request money using the internet.

Like Facebook Pay other apps offer anti-fraud protection and other security measures. If you often use Facebook and Instagram it makes sense to have FB Pay.

It lets you do so much more with these social media sites. Now people selling on the Facebook Marketplace have a faster way of receiving payments.

Many nonprofit organizations have been using social media for years to request donations. This app will allow them to get that help much quicker than before.

If you’re not interested don’t worry because FB Pay could give you a glimpse into the future. Do you remember why Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of his company Facebook into Meta?

He wanted it to reflect better its new goal of expanding into the Metaverse. It’s the concept of bridging virtual worlds and our real world to benefit more from each other.

Following Zuckerberg’s statement we could see that he plans to merge his social media networks into the Metaverse. This means he must make his products and services more connected.

In other words they must become a means of fostering a community within that new platform. That would mean having a medium of exchange for Meta services and apps.

The Metaverse is supposed to be where people could enter like a regular place. Folks should have a way of working together in that new area.

FB Pay is one of the ways he will achieve this. Of course that’s just the beginning! Users will be able to use the Metaverse much easier if they use this app.



Final thoughts

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said that most office meetings would occur in the Metaverse within three years. This idea is no fantasy as it may soon become our reality!

In response you must learn more about it to use it to your benefit. As I said learning about tech tools like FB Pay could be a start but you should eventually go beyond that.

Fortunately Inquirer USA can help with that. Read other articles on the site to learn more about these trends. They will also give you tips on using them in your everyday life.

More than 48000 people believed to have been targeted by the surveillance companies were alerted by Meta. “The goal of today’s enforcement is not just to take down their accounts but to disrupt their activity in the most costly way possible to blow the cover on their operations and bring transparency to the industry” said David Agranovich Meta’s director of threat disruption.The revelations come amid increasing scrutiny of companies that provide governments with surveillance technologies. The firms such as Israel’s NSO Group Ltd contend that they provide the tools to help intelligence and law enforcement agencies fight serious crime and terrorism. But there have been repeated examples in recent years in which governments have allegedly used the technology to spy on dissidents human rights activists and journalists.On Tuesday a group of 18 US lawmakers wrote to the US Department of the Treasury and the State Department urging them to use Global Magnitsky sanctions to punish NSO Group and other surveillance companies they accused of enabling human rights abuses. The embattled NSO Group is now said to be exploring options that include shutting its controversial Pegasus spyware unit and selling the entire company Bloomberg News reported.Meta says its report aims to show “that NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary ecosystem.” It names four other Israeli firms as having been involved in providing the “surveillance-for-hire” services—Cobwebs Technologies Cognyte Black Cube and Bluehawk CI – in addition to India’s BellTrox North Macedonia’s Cytrox and an unknown entity in China. Most of the companies didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Black Cube said the company operates in compliance with local laws and “does not undertake any phishing or hacking and does not operate in the cyber world.” The company “works with the world’s leading law firms in proving bribery uncovering corruption and recovering hundreds of millions in stolen assets” the spokesperson added.Meital Levi Tal spokeswoman for Cobwebs Technologies said the company hasn’t “been contacted by Facebook (Meta) and are unaware of any claims it has allegedly made about our services. Cobwebs operates only according to the law and adheres to strict standards in respect of privacy protection.”John Scott-Railton a senior researcher at Citizen Lab a research group at the University of Toronto that focuses on abuses of surveillance technology said that Meta’s “broad stroke enforcement action” would send “a really clear signal of the way it's going to treat other offensive players going forward.”“It's significant because it shows this is not the problem of a single company or a handful of companies. It's an industry-wide problem.”Meta accused Cobwebs of operating hundreds of fake accounts used to collect information on their targets who included activists politicians and government officials in Hong Kong and Mexico. Bluehawk CI was said to use fake accounts posing as journalists to trick people into installing malicious software on their computers targeting politicians and businessmen in the Middle East. Black Cube was accused of operating fake personas to gather information on people in medical mining minerals and energy industries as well as Palestinian activists and people in Russia involved in finance and real estate development.India’s BellTroX allegedly operated fake accounts used in suspected efforts to hack people’s phones or computers; the company targeted lawyers doctors activists and members of the clergy in countries including Australia Angola Saudi Arabia and Iceland. Meta found a “vast domain infrastructure” associated with Cytrox which it said was likely used in hacking campaigns that targeted politicians and journalists including in Egypt and Armenia. Moreover Meta linked the unknown entity in China to domestic law enforcement in the country and observed it had been supporting surveillance campaigns focused on minority groups in the Asia-Pacific including the Xinjiang region of China Myanmar and Hong Kong.Separately on Thursday Citizen Lab published a report linking Cytrox to hacks that targeted two prominent critics of the Egyptian government.The company has developed spyware called Predator that can penetrate iOS and Android mobile devices to secretly record conversations and steal data Citizen Lab found.In June Cytrox’s spy technology compromised a phone belonging to Ayman Nour the exiled president of the Union of the Egyptian National Forces an opposition political group. The spyware was also found on the phone of an Egyptian journalist in exile who is the host of a popular news program according to Citizen Lab’s report which does not name the journalist.Citizen Lab’s digital analysis identified multiple servers associated with the delivery of Cytrox’s spyware in countries including Armenia Egypt Greece Indonesia Madagascar Oman Saudi Arabia and Serbia. Governments in those countries are likely among Cytrox’s customers according to Citizen Lab.“What the public is learning this year is that there is large cyber insecurity industry that sells these offensive tools” said Scott-Railton the senior researcher at Citizen Lab. “And as long as there is no serious oversight the offensive tools will be used in the same way: to target dissidents journalists and others. Until there are serious systematic efforts to address this problem the horrors will keep happening.”Cytrox has a limited online footprint and has received little media coverage. The company originated as a startup in Macedonia but was later acquired by Tal Dilian an Israeli intelligence agency veteran in a deal worth about $5 million Forbes reported in 2019. A representative for Dilian didn’t respond to a request for comment.According to Citizen Lab Cytrox is involved in a surveillance industry alliance called Intellexa which was founded by Dilian and says it offers law enforcement and intelligence agencies “cutting-edge technological platforms” that protect communities from criminal activities.Cytrox has impersonated popular companies and websites—including Apple Fox News Instagram LinkedIn Tesla Twitter and YouTube—in order to dupe hacking targets into clicking on malicious links Citizen Lab’s researchers found.The two Egyptians who were hacked earlier this year received messages on WhatsApp that tried to trick them into clicking on what appeared to be legitimate news websites but were in fact malicious domains set up to deliver Cytrox’s spyware Citizen Lab reported.In Nour’s case he became suspicious that his phone had been infected after it began overheating. Citizen Lab’s researchers forensically examined it finding that it had been successfully infected by two variants of spyware: Cytrox’s Predator and NSO Group’s Pegasus.Citizen Lab notified WhatsApp parent Meta about its findings which prompted the company to initiate its own investigation. According to Meta’s report published on Thursday it identified and removed approximately 300 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to Cytrox’s spying efforts.Companies such as Cytrox are “democratizing access” to spying techniques said Nathaniel Gleicher Meta's head of security policy. “They are building tools to manage fake accounts to target and surveil people to enable the delivery of malware. And they are providing them to any clients most interested – the clients who are willing to pay.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L2J1c2luZXNzL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1idXNpbmVzcy9yZWRkaXQtaXBvLW1lbWUtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reddit IPO to test social media platform's 'meme' stock hype,"Reddit users have helped fuel dozens of ""meme"" stock rallies this year from retailer GameStop Corp. to movie operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

With decades-old rival Dallas in town and the Cowboys riding high in first place in the NFC East it seemed as if Giants fans were outnumbered inside their own building. So much so that Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory asked the crowd to pump up the noise level even more as the Giants prepared for a last-gasp fourth-down attempt in the fourth quarter.

Those fans many of them decked out in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott jerseys obliged and it was the Giants who wilted in the moment. Faced with a fourth-and-1 from their own 28 right tackle Matt Peart moved just before the snap and was called for a false start and the Giants were forced to punt. They never got into the end zone for the second time in three weeks and their 21-6 loss left them at 4-10 and the Cowboys at 10-4.

An ebullient Cowboys owner Jerry Jones walked through the press box more than an hour after the game attended by a raucous entourage of friends and family and expressed gratitude at how much support there was inside the place one of his fiercest rivals calls home.

""A lot of [the fans] were near where I was [in the luxury box] and I saw them when I was on the field pregame"" Jones said.

He was glad to see them all and their moral support — as well as their high-decibel appeals — were much appreciated.

""It’s really with respect that I say I was glad to see those Cowboys fans because of the respect I have for the Giants and just what they are to this league"" Jones said. ""I was very concerned about this game. As you know any of us can get the other one on any given day but I was proud of our team and proud to get to 10 wins.""

It’s the fifth straight year that the Giants have had at least 10 defeats and the seventh time in the last eight years that they have sustained double-digit losses. Yes this era of awfulness has gone on for nearly a decade with no quick end in sight. The Giants aren’t likely to be favored in any of their three remaining games against the Eagles Bears and Washington so a 4-13 finish to this 2021 debacle seems likely.

While Jones prepares to celebrate another NFC East title his counterpart John Mara who watched the game just a few yards away from Jones in the Giants’ owner’s suitehas some major decisions to make. He is almost sure to move on from general manager Dave Gettleman whose ill-fated personnel decisions have left this team woefully overmatched. And while speculation persists that Mara prefers to retain Joe Judge and avoid firing a coach after two seasons for the third consecutive time a 4-13 finish would be a hard sell to fans ever more frustrated by this team’s pathetic wheel-spinning in recent years.

Jones has had his share of adversity during his run as the Cowboys’ owner especially early in his tenure. But Jimmy Johnson set the stage for Jones’ only three Super Bowl wins and this year’s team certainly is in the Super Bowl conversation.

""I know how [Mara] feels"" Jones said. ""You just take this stuff and should take it completely personal and I did. He puts it out there like that and we do too.""

Mara has not spoken publicly since telling reporters in August that he felt good about this year’s team and that it would at least be pointing in the direction of a Super Bowl.

""We’re all on the hot seat with our fans in particular"" he said during the summer. ""We’ve given them too many losing seasons. It’s time for us to start winning.""

That time is not now. Even with an injury-depleted team — starting quarterback Daniel Jones has missed the last three games with a neck injury — the Giants simply aren’t competitive. Judge has maintained locker-room harmony despite the poor record but he ultimately is responsible for the poor product and he didn’t help himself with a highly questionable decision.

Down 15-6 and faced with a fourth-and-1 from his own 29 Judge had Mike Glennon attempt a quarterback sneak. He was stopped for no gain and Dallas made it 21-6 on the ensuing possession with Prescott hitting tight end Dalton Schultz with a 1-yard touchdown pass.

Game over.

But not the season from hell.

Jones offered Mara some consolation afterward. ""It’s no fun to wear a season like this"" he said. ""But as we all know every dog has his day in this business.""

Maybe so. But it sure is tough to see just when that might happen for Mara’s team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvbmV3LXByb3RvY29scy1pbnRyb2R1Y2VkLWN1cmItc3ByZWFkLWNvdmlkLTE5LTIwMjEtMTItMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New NFL protocols introduced to curb spread of COVID-19,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/new-protocols-introduced-curb-spread-covid-19-2021-12-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvbmV3LXByb3RvY29scy1pbnRyb2R1Y2VkLWN1cmItc3ByZWFkLWNvdmlkLTE5LTIwMjEtMTItMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY293Ym95cy8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L3RyYXZlbGluZy1jb3dib3lzLWZhbnMtbWFrZS1zdXJlLXRoZXktYXJlLWhlYXJkLWNyZWF0ZS1ncmVhdC1hdG1vc3BoZXJlLWF0LW1ldGxpZmUtc3RhZGl1bS_SAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Nvd2JveXMvMjAyMS8xMi8xOS90cmF2ZWxpbmctY293Ym95cy1mYW5zLW1ha2Utc3VyZS10aGV5LWFyZS1oZWFyZC1jcmVhdGUtZ3JlYXQtYXRtb3NwaGVyZS1hdC1tZXRsaWZlLXN0YWRpdW0vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traveling Cowboys fans make sure they are heard create ‘great atmosphere’ at MetLife Stadium,"The Cowboys and Giants are bitter rivals as you could tell by the number of skirmishes that broke out during Sunday’s game. There is no love lost here for Dallas among true blue fans.

But there was a significant portion of Cowboys fans in the stands for this game. What did defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence think of the atmosphere?

“It’s football’’ he said. “It’s the Dallas Cowboys. When we’re winning that’s what’s going to happen.

He wouldn’t admit that Sunday is an opportunity for payback on Jayron Kearse the Cowboys safety who punched Engram in the face after Dallas’ 44-20 win in October.

“I’m not looking at it like that” Engram said this week with a smile. “We’re gonna go out there and play football.”

There is most definitely bad blood here that could spill over however dating two months back to what Engram mocked as Kearse’s “baby punch” in an interview with the Daily News.

The last-place Giants (4-9) obviously are overmatched by the first-place Cowboys (9-4) in the talent department.

All the flu and COVID-19 sweeping through the Giants’ East Rutherford N.J. facility puts them even more squarely behind the eight ball on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.

But Joe Judge’s team intends to put up a fight and they have first-hand experience with one of Dallas’ biggest weaknesses: a lack of composure.

Cowboys defensive tackle Trysten Hill got suspended two games for punching Raiders guard John Simpson in the face following Las Vegas’ win on Thanksgiving Day.

Then Dallas right tackle La’el Collins was ejected from last week’s win over Washington for throwing a punch at defensive end William Bradley-King after a hit on Dak Prescott on the sideline.

Kearse wasn’t fined for his punch of Engram which FOX and NFL Films said they did not have on camera. Video of Hill’s punch on the other hand went viral and cost him checks.

The Giants get another shot to line up and try to beat the Cowboys on Sunday.

The Giants haven’t forgotten though. There’s a good chance Dallas’ early-season disrespect came up in meetings this week and the Giants’ feelings certainly have changed since October.

Right guard Will Hernandez told The News the week after Kearse punched Engram: “I wish I would have been there. You know what? It’s great because we play them again.”

Judge said that week: “We’ll see these guys again.”

Safety Jabrill Peppers now sidelined for the season was more to the point.

“I mean it’s Cowboys-Giants. F–k ’em. They hate us we hate them” Peppers said.

Judge also signed former Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith on Friday adding an emotional player with an ax to grind against Dallas for cutting him earlier this season.

The Giants by no means intend to lose their own composure like rookie receiver Kadarius Toney did in the mid-game Week 5 melee down in Arlington Texas.

But let’s face it: this rivalry needs some sort of juice from the Giants to be a rivalry again.

There is no rivalry anymore even though Judge snapped a 7-game skid in the head-to-head series with a Week 17 win last January.

The Giants have lost eight of their last nine to Dallas from 2017 through this fall. Their only win late last season came with Andy Dalton at quarterback for the Cowboys.

Dallas QB Dak Prescott has an 8-2-0 record 20 touchdown passes and five interceptions in 10 career meetings with the Giants including eight straight wins.

Jason Garrett oddly was the head coach of those Dallas teams decimating the Giants in recent years but once he joined the Giants he faced his former team only three times (1-2) before getting fired by the Giants in November.

Interestingly Sunday will be the first Giants-Cowboys game without Garrett involved since 2006. He took the Dallas offensive coordinator job in 2007 and quickly rose up the ranks to head coach by midseason 2010.

The Giants have won two Super Bowls in that span to Dallas’ zero of course but those championships feel like a lifetime ago given the franchise’s failings in recent years.

Corner James Bradberry admitted on Thursday that it’s difficult for the Giants not to hang their heads coming off two straight losses knowing their official playoff elimination could come as soon as this weekend.

“I would definitely say it’s hard but you’ve got to just wake up and put one foot in front of the other and attack the day” Bradberry said. “I just try to win the day try to get a little bit better every day and whatever cards you’re dealt with on Sunday play with them.”

The cards the Giants have been dealt on Sunday is a Cowboys team that isn’t playing its best but still walks tall when they face this NFC East foe.

Back in October Engram told The News about how Kearse’s punch happened.

“I walked up on him. He walked up on me kinda saying some stuff. He threw the punch” Engram said. “We had some guys there that separated us so it was kind of boom boom.”

“He stole one off and everybody was there to separate us. So I kinda just let it go” he added. “I dapped up some of my old coaches and friends on the other side [afterward] and went into the locker room.”

Engram didn’t retaliate because he didn’t want to get fined. He also knew they had another game on the schedule. That game is Sunday the Giants’ final chance this season to take pride in dethroning a Dallas team that loves to look down upon them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZ2lhbnRzd2lyZS51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS9uZXcteW9yay1naWFudHMtZnJlZS1tZWRpdW0tcGVwc2ktZ2l2ZWF3YXktc29tZWhvdy1nZXRzLXdvcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants' free medium Pepsi giveaway somehow gets worse,"Earlier this week the New York Giants announced that Sunday would be deemed “Fan Appreciation Day” at MetLife Stadium. As a part of the festivities season ticket holders would be given one free medium Pepsi.

An offer for Giants fans For the best local North Jersey news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to NorthJersey.com. $1 for 6 months

That’s right. Not a large but a medium soda in a cup full of ice.

The tone-deaf giveaway was immediately panned by fans and media pundits alike. Some of the commentary was wicked and perhaps rightfully so.

Despite the heavy criticism the Giants did not adjust their giveaway nor did they offer any public comment. And when fans arrived in East Rutherford to procure their free medium Pepsi on Sunday they were greeted with an unexpected caveat.

As it turns out the giveaway is not for all season ticket holders. Rather the single soda can only be obtained by the season ticket account holder. That means no matter how many season tickets a person has purchased they are entitled to just a single soda.

Family of seven? One soda. Family of four? One soda. A new couple on their first date? One soda.

Someone just told me that the free Pepsi at MetLife today is not one drink per ticket. It’s only for the person whose name is on the account — Pat Leonard (@PLeonardNYDN) December 19 2021

Fan who aimed to take advantage of the free medium Pepsi giveaway were quick to confirm the shenanigans on Twitter.

Hard Rock International plans to build a guitar-shaped hotel along the Las Vegas Strip a rendering of which is seen here. (Hard Rock International)

In the spring of 1999 more than a year after “Titanic” made its big-screen debut flamboyant casino figure Bob Stupak unveiled a big idea for Las Vegas.

His vision: build a Titanic-replica resort with 1200 “cabins” and an “iceberg” retail area.

The plan like the actual Titanic sank. But it wouldn’t have been the first themed hotel structure proposed along Las Vegas Boulevard and certainly was not the last. The latest such proposal was unveiled this week.

Hard Rock International announced Monday that it is buying The Mirage’s operations side from MGM Resorts International for more than $1 billion in cash. Through the deal it said it plans to build a guitar-shaped hotel tower on the Strip.

The purple-hued tower would feature six light beams shooting into the sky as if they were strings on a guitar neck with the former Mirage rebranded and remodeled as the Hard Rock next to it according to a rendering.

Themed resorts are nothing new to Las Vegas. But only in some cases are hotel buildings wholesale constructed to a theme such as the pyramid-shaped Luxor and the skyline-designed New York-New York.

Details to come later

As for the guitar hotel tower Hard Rock hasn’t announced details of the plans.

“I wish we had more to share but at this stage we are not ready to discuss details on the design development and timeline of the Las Vegas construction project” Hard Rock spokeswoman Gina Morales told me.

The company’s “first order of priority is to be respectful of the process of gaming regulatory approvals and the closing” which is slated for the second half of 2022 she added.

Some resorts incorporate their themes in other visible ways along the Strip such as the replica Eiffel Tower at Paris Las Vegas and The Mirage’s volcano which would likely be demolished to clear space for the guitar tower after Hard Rock takes over the Polynesian-themed property.

Still Las Vegas’ real estate market boasts a long history of developers pitching big plans and never following through.

Themed ideas that never left the drawing board include a project designed to look like the U.S.S. Enterprise from “Star Trek” a London-themed casino-resort with Big Ben a San Francisco-themed project with a replica Golden Gate Bridge and a Harley-Davidson-themed project with exhaust pipe-styled hotel towers according to reports.

Hard Rock’s first guitar hotel tower

Hard Rock International owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida operates restaurants casinos hotels and other venues around the world and says it owns the world’s largest and most valuable collection of authentic music memorabilia at 86000-plus pieces.

It is known for having giant decorative guitars outside Hard Rock locations and it even has a 450-foot-tall guitar-shaped hotel tower in Florida that looks like the one planned for Las Vegas.

When the guitar hotel opened in fall 2019 as part of a $1.5 billion expansion at the Seminole Hard Rock casino-resort the company said the new building’s six high-powered light beams project at least 20000 feet into the sky mimicking the strings of an imaginary guitar neck.

In Las Vegas some locals might wonder if the guitar-shaped hotel will ever get built given the seemingly never-ending parade of big real estate plans that come and go through Southern Nevada.

But Hard Rock has built one before and that’s more than some developers can say.

Aside from last year America's Party' has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years said Pat Christenson president of Las Vegas Events a non-profit agency created to produce and support big events.

Thousands of revellers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the cancelled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year's event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of COVID-19.

Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year's Eve one of Las Vegas' biggest events drawing more than 300000 revellers according to tourism officials and filling the tourism-dependent city's more than 250000 hotel rooms.

Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement.

Fireworks by Grucci designs and choreographs the eight-minute pyrotechnic display from atop resort properties that last year included MGM Grand Aria Planet Hollywood Caesars Palace Treasure Island Venetian and The STRAT tower. It is accompanied by a soundtrack airing on two on FM radio stations in Las Vegas.

This year the show will add Resorts World Las Vegas which opened last June.

(Shuhei Yamashita)

GERO Gifu Prefecture—Complaints about naked and unruly visitors have led to a ban on bathing except for feet at a popular open-air riverside hot spring facility here.

Gero city imposed the feet-only rule in December at the Funsenchi outdoor hot spring part of the Gero resort one of Japan’s three prominent spa zones.

“We will never abolish it (Funsenchi) as it is our traditional symbol” said Gero Mayor Noboru Yamauchi. “We are going back to its initial purpose of catering to sightseers.”

In 2010 the rule of donning swimsuits was introduced for security and privacy reasons given that there are no fences around the bath to block views from the outside.

However some visitors continued taking baths naked according to the city’s accounts.

Others reportedly started quarrels and other problems over the “kakeyu” practice of dousing oneself with a bucket of hot water to cleanse the body before entering bathtubs.

Seeing no end to the complaints the city limited the Funsenchi onsen only to clothed people who want to soak their feet in hot water.

Funsenchi measuring 6.5 meters by 5 meters sits along the Hidagawa river running through the Gero spa area. It uses spring water from the same source as nearby hotels and inns.

Gero city installed Funsenchi in 1983 to allow sightseers to bathe free of charge in the renowned resort.

Funsenchi has been inundated by many floods but has always been rebuilt for tourists and residents.

Although a countermeasure was once taken to shield bathers in Funsenchi from outside views the city decided against erecting fences so that users could fully enjoy the open-air environment.

On the afternoon of Nov. 25 local residents and families packed Funsenchi. A 63-year-old visitor from Nagoya who travels to the onsen every year said the decision to restrict the use of the picturesque site was “really regrettable.”

Hideo Koike 84 who lives in Gero said he was involved in construction work at the onsen around 30 years ago and voluntarily cleaned the facility with acquaintances from outside Gifu Prefecture he got to know in Funsenchi.

He drops by Funsenchi four times a week to bathe for 30 minutes or so to rejuvenate from fatigue deriving from farming and other daily tasks.

He also said the new restrictions are regrettable but understands the city’s decision.

“I could live so long thanks to this hot spring water” Koike said. “That (the bathing prohibition) is unavoidable in some respects because there are people who do not abide by the regulations.”

A sign erected by Gero city at the site calls for visitors to stick to the new rule."

The Turkish software developer and ""YouTuber"" who made the headlines with a semi-functioning bodysuit a few years ago has come a long way since then. The Istanbul-based inventor recently showcased an arm similar to Iron Man's that is controlled via a microchip planted under his skin.

The implant allows him to “fire” when he stretches his arm in firing position though he does not plan to actually fire for now. Instead Özuygur aims to inspire the youth to develop new technologies in a country seeking to cut off its dependence on imports for varied technologies.

The chip uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) technologies and is entirely programmable for more mundane tasks like remotely opening a door or to verify identification.

“I just try to make the stuff we see in science fiction films real. It is some kind of experimental engineering for me. I want to inspire people from youth to adults to work on scientific projects” he told Ihlas News Agency (IHA) on Sunday. Özuygur says chip implants beneath the skin are common around the world though not in Turkey even though they use the same ID verification technology “like those used in electronic bus passes” he said.

“This is not something for mind control or to track others as you are led to believe. This is a simple chip” he added. “Still it is up to your imagination whatever you want to do with the chip.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2Rvcm5hZHVsYS1jL2h1bWJsZS1taW5lcmFsLXRoYXQtdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXF1YXJ0ei8_ZnJtYXBwPXllc9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2Rvcm5hZHVsYS1jL2h1bWJsZS1taW5lcmFsLXRoYXQtdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXF1YXJ0ei8_ZnJtYXBwPXllcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Humble mineral that transformed the world- Quartz,"There is a huge cry in the automobile industry that their profit is plummeting like never seen ever before. One of the reputed new channels in India talks tall about the economics but never cared to analyze the reasons for such a profit drop due to shortage of “chips” for the automobile industries. Well I don’t blame them because hat their level of understanding. Let us analyze why there is a hue and cry about the chip. What is this chip and do we need to build this chip? What is the raw material to manufacture this chip? If you could understand these “small print” truths then we can answer what is happening with the automobile industry………for that matter why automobile industry tomorrow will be the same fate for any industry that depends on this “chip”.

Quartz/silica sand is the humble mineral that transformed the world…….from cities to rural villages. Not only quartz but various other minerals are widely talked about in the business community. A few years ago no one knows that such material exists on earth and it is a part of the rocks and soil on which we like. Now these precious minerals (never recognized before) are given various names…….energy transition metals and minerals technology transition minerals and so on. Except for a few countries the value of the earth’s resources is never even realized by the countries…..even modern India (I say modern India because our ancestors realized the importance and gave the true value to these minerals).

Quartz is the raw material for our “chip” It is changing our lives smartphones internet electric cars scooters rockets to space stations pacemakers to super-computers pancake making machines…..name any gadget in the world today……….the god is quartz- “Silicon Dioxide” ingredient of the semiconductor that supports all these gadgets. “Manufacturing transistors out of silicon allowed them to be made small enough to fit on a microchip opening the gates to a rush of gadgets that have become smaller and smarter by the year. Being able to miniaturize these transistors allows us to do things we couldn’t have imagined in previous generations All because we can put a massive computer onto a tiny chip.” says John Neuffer chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association.”

Si a product of SiO2 is found abundantly in the Earth’s crust. Nearly 90% of the crust is made up of SiO2. It is found as SiO2 or found in association with other silicate minerals. How is Si (silicon) manufactured?? This is an energy-intense process. The quartz or quartzite or silica sand ( SiO2) is mixed with coke and heated in a submerged electrode arc furnace. The SiO2 is reduced to SiC ( SiO2 + 3C = SiC + 2 CO + Mg) at temperatures between 1600 to 2000 °C. The SiC thus produced reacts further with SiO2 at higher temperatures to produce Si + SiO (gas) + CO (gas). The Si here is metallurgical grade silicon. This metallurgical grade Si is the raw material for electrical grade Si that is used in all the “chip” making industries. Well that is the story of the ‘chip”. Chip industry is a “blockchain”. It is interlinked between the countries and economies. Now when industries talk about raw material they mean Si and not SiO2. It is a misnomer. But these economists don’t understand that if SiO2 is not available or hoarded by a country then the economy plummets. SiO2 is available for generations. The Si refined from quartz and allied minerals support the $500bn chip industry that runs the global economy worth US$ 3tn. The top 5 major quartz exporting countries in terms of value (in US$) are China (72289000) Turkey (68161000) India (43827000) Spain ( 27107000) and the USA (21351000). Traditionally Mexico and Japan are major Si suppliers to the chip industry while China and USA make the chips. So these countries can take us for a ride as they are doing now. China is also making chips. They are not lagging behind. Around 5.4 million metric tons of silicon was produced in China in 2020 which accounted for about two-thirds of the global silicon production that year. There is absolutely no shortage of raw material. This is how the big brothers control the world economy. The common man should understand this- which the news reporters never even mention about it. India has over 4 billion tons of quartz and related minerals in reserves manly mined from Haryana Rajasthan Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. So when so much quartz is available with us it is our shortsighted policy not to have focused on this industry. What is point of shouting now that the automobile industry profits are plummeting? India has rich natural resources….you name it we have. REE (Rare Earth Element minerals) atomic minerals (Th and U) and energy transition minerals (not Li). The west looted the beach sands rich in atomic minerals and titanium zirconium silica garnet minerals worth millions of dollars in the current economy.

The technology to miniaturize the chip has grown like a virus. Gordon Moore co-founder of microchip giant Intel 50 years ago predicted that the number of transistors that you could fit on a chip would double every two years. Absolutely correct. Now the chip industry has to look into the structure of the body cells and neurons to further miniaturize the chip and multiply its efficiency. I am sure someone should be doing it now. Billions of transistors are now embedded into a tiny chip that the naked eye cannot see. All the developments are achieved by humans like you and me. Institutes of higher learning in the countries played an important role in developing the technology. In the case of India IITs and other similar institutes played an important role globally in developing the chip. I keep wondering now why no one in these institutes or the technocrats in the country have foreseen this crisis of chip shortage for the automobile industry. What we don’t have? We have quartz we have metallurgical technocrats both from automobile sectors and other supporting industries. We have huge funding agencies and national laboratories. What we lack is vision and visionaries. Whether it is medicine industries sciences sports…..we should have a healthy national debate as to what India should be doing for the next 10 years. If we have one then we failed to foresee these issues or the visionaries are shortsighted. Whatever we say China has for ahead of other countries in the world. Take for example any technology business material education…….the country is at the top. Some of my friends argue that they copy…..I cannot understand what is meant by “copy”. Now for the automobile crisis in India who is holding the stick….China and the US. The news reporters as I said should focus on this primary issue rather than reporting that India’s automobile industry is in the doldrums. The basic issue is the lack of collaboration understanding and dialogue between the industries and the institutes of higher learning. With so much raw material (for me raw material is quartz and not silicon) available in the country and state-of-art metallurgical institutes in the country why India should have a shortage of chips for the auto industry? It is a shame. When I hear the news about this shortage my mind spins. NEP tried to change this mindset. Still our textbook fights over mundane issues rather than focusing and tuning the younger generations to future problem-solving equations. IITs have started with incubators/start-ups. It is a good initiative but over the last 12 years the status is not encouraging. The start-ups should be headed by an able technocrat who can get the things done rather than people with poor efficiency and track record. Now it is not too late. The country can transform Indian industry into a global industry in all fields……..as long as we don’t always borrow material from other countries. The news reporters should focus on the root cause analyze and open the debate and tell public where we fault rather than sensationalize the issues. Today it is automobile industry and tomorrow it could be mobile phone you are using. The shortage as I said is artificial. Read what the news papers say:- According to “Nikkei Asia” “the world’s nine leading chipmakers hit a record high of $64.7 million worth of raw materials inventory in June as they continue to ramp up production. The total inventory for these chipmakers including TSMC Intel Samsung Micron SK Hynix Western Digital and more is now at historic highs. The amount of raw materials in total inventory has been steadily increasing since March of 2019 to the point where all these companies have at least 24% more inventory than ever before. Despite the large stockpiling of raw materials demand for semiconductor chips has remained incredibly high negating the increased output. This is largely thanks to the automotive industry which is believed to be purchasing far more chips than it needs for building cars. Traditionally automakers order chips as they are needed. But now many automotive companies plan to switch gears by holding years worth of stock to ensure there’s enough of a buffer to hold out in case of another shortage. However “there are ways to ensure that does not happen. For example Toyota wants to create a new centralized inventory that monitors both chip manufacturing output and how many chips are headed to its storage sites. This solution could potentially be great for chipmakers allowing automakers to not overbuy chips and preventing a massive demand drought.” Reports the newspaper. The automobile industry is not the largest consumer of the “chip” This shortage is driven by smartphone and computer sales. Then why blame the auto industry for the shortage of chips? Says “Nikkei Asia”. This is a lesson for the country with huge amount of raw material. What is the shortage……raw material or visionaries?

Crunched up space-time explained,"Jumping from star system to star system with the push of a spacecraft’s warp drive throttle is a kind of Star Trek-inspired future tech that has very little in common with space travel of today. Achieving this sci-fi future would require not only new technology but breaking one of nature’s most fundamental rules: the speed of light. It’s very very unlikely — but there may be new hope on the horizon.

In a recent paper published in The European Physical Journal C a team of engineers and physicists led by former NASA engineer Harold “Sonny” White say they have discovered the right conditions to — theoretically — create a small warp bubble in a lab. A warp bubble is like a car traveling along a warp drive highway.

While White and colleagues have experimentally evaluated part of the science behind this discovery the warp bubble itself currently exists only in theory as computations — White and colleagues haven’t proven that experimentally. But if they do White says it could completely revolutionize the study of warp-speed space travel.

“This has not been done before in the literature and hence is significant” White tells Inverse. “It is a matter of precedence for the idea of a space warp analogous to the Chicago pile for nuclear reactors.”

What is warp drive?

Before we dive further into what this warp bubble could mean for space travel let’s back up to understand a warp drive first. The key here lies in two of Einstein’s pivotal papers published in 1905 and 1915 respectively on special and general relativity.

Among other things these papers lay down three fundamental theories of physics:

The universe has a speed limit and it is the speed that light travels — 299792458 meters per second or just 3x10^8 meters per second among friends At velocities approaching the speed of light the passage of time will change relative to an observer. In other words space travelers moving faster age slower relative to their less speedy counterparts — like in Interstellar when they visit the water-world planet. Space and time are knitted together in a fabric creatively called space-time that ebbs flows and bends around mass. This curvature is gravity.

White explains that “space warp” is one of two loopholes within the theory of general relativity and noted in a 1994 paper by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre.

“[It] allow[s] one to cover arbitrarily long distances in arbitrarily short times without ever locally breaking the speed of light — e.g. get to Proxima Centauri in say a month as measured by clocks on the spacecraft and clocks in mission control.”

A warp bubble is a kind of loophole that could theoretically help spacecraft travel faster than light. Shutterstock

Similar to a wormhole — which theoretically lets you skip across space-time by “walking” through a region where the fabric is folded together like a fan —warping space-time would look like the fabric bunching up in front of the bubble and then stretching out behind it in a train.

In a 2017 lecture Alcubierre compares the phenomenon to the experience of being on a moving walkway at the airport.

“You can imagine that the floor behind you is being created out of nothing and in front of you it is being destroyed so you move along.”

In theory and science fiction a warp bubble could move along this walkway and ride the bunching space-time fabric in such a way that its relative time remained slow (meaning Kirk wouldn’t be an old man when he arrived) while simultaneously moving great distances faster than the speed of light.

But there’s a catch: The bubble must be enrobed in negative energy the kind that might come from anti-gravity. Sadly that’s not something you can easily whip up in a lab.

How to discover a warp bubble

The negative energy constraint might seem like a fatal blow to the notion of warp drive but a few glimmers of hope remain. For one we may be able to do away with this requirement altogether according to 2021 research by physicist Erik Lentz who pored over the problem during the lockdown.

Though much more complex than a bar magnet the Casimir effect works on similar base principles of attraction. Shutterstock

In the case of White and colleagues the solution could come from a fluctuating of magnetic fields in something called the Casimir effect. Put succinctly the Casimir effect refers to the attractive force of fluctuating magnetic fields that “pull” two objects — like plates or mirrors — together when inside a vacuum.

The idea is that electromagnetic waves flow continuously even through a vacuum but only some small waves can fit between the two objects. As a result the total vacuum energy between the objects becomes less than the outside energy and they are attracted to one another. During such interactions negative energy can be created on very small scales.

It was something called “Casimir cavities” that White and colleagues were investigating for DARPA when they noticed in their calculations something that looked suspiciously like a warp bubble.

“The detailed numerical analysis of our custom Casimir cavities helped us identify a real and manufacturable nano/micro-structure that is predicted to generate a negative vacuum energy density such that it would manifest a real nanoscale warp bubble — however humble it may be” White says.

White and colleagues write that “a toy model consisting of a 1-micron diameter sphere centrally located in a 4-micron diameter cylinder” could be used to explore the Casimir effect energy density experimentally.

Is the DARPA warp bubble fake?

So is this a real warp bubble? It seems like it has the potential to be — if experimentally validated. However not all scientists are convinced.

But regardless of how this latest finding ultimately shakes out White says we are still a long way off scientists and aerospace engineers coming anywhere close to building genuine warp drive — and that’s not a problem he’s looking to solve right now.

“Currently we are laser-focused on exploring the characteristics of our custom Casimir cavities for” White says. “It is too early to ask questions about some type of actual flight experiment. In my mind step one is to just explore the underlying science at the nano/micro-scale.”",,,,,,,,,

Microsoft included a few Mac-like features and the ability to run Android apps on Windows 11.

Watch this: Windows 11: Will your computer be able to run it? What to know 03:43

But there are a few catches to downloading the new operating system. For starters Microsoft is using a phased rollout for Windows 11. And before you download you'll need a Wi-Fi connection and a Windows 11 Home account. However Windows 10 users can upgrade for free (here's how to get Windows 10 first so you can download Windows 11). But if you're setting up a Windows 11 Home account -- which most people using it on a personal device will be -- there are a few extra steps you'll have to take before accessing the new features.

Read more: Windows 11 review: Familiar but fresh

We'll break down everything you need to know before downloading Windows 11 including how to check if your computer is compatible to make sure you meet the new requirements. And here's what to know if you're thinking of upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 Home. This story was recently updated.

Create a Microsoft account (or sign in to yours)

You'll need to create a free Microsoft account before you download Windows 11. Microsoft

To set up Windows 11 Home you'll need a Microsoft account which gives you access to Microsoft products and services. Don't worry -- it's free to create one.

In the past it was possible to opt out of creating a Microsoft account and use a local one instead (though the process wasn't intuitive). It appears that with Windows 11 you will need to create a Microsoft account to get started. After that point you can delete your Microsoft account and sign in with a local account if you'd like and this won't impact how you use the OS -- but you won't be able to sync content across multiple devices. A Microsoft account also allows easier transferring from your old PC to a new one and more options for signing in.

Windows 11 Pro and the version built for enterprise use will not require people to sign in to Microsoft accounts.

Connect to the internet

You need to have an internet connection to set up Windows 11. Sarah Tew/CNET

To download Windows 11 Home (and to create a Microsoft account) you'll also need to be connected to the internet. The reason for this is that Windows 11 will primarily be delivered as a Windows Update much like newer versions of Windows 10 have been.

You'll also need the internet to perform future updates and to take advantage of some of the new Windows 11 features according to Microsoft.

This requirement may pose a problem for those who lack easy internet access. However after you connect for the initial setup you don't have to connect again if you don't want to (though you should to get important security updates that prevent vulnerabilities).

If you're downloading Windows 11 on your current computer just make sure you're connected to the internet before you start the process. If you buy a new Windows 11 computer after the OS is generally released you should be prompted to connect to the internet when you're setting it up.

ADVERTISEMENT

The company moved some applets from the Control Panel to the Settings application but left most applets untouched at the time. It did announce that the Control Panel was going away and that the Settings application would become the main control hub for preferences on Windows 10. Some options to access the Control Panel were removed in the Creators Update and a few applets were migrated to the Settings application in the six years since the release of Windows 10.

It is now the end of 2021 six years after the release of Windows 10. Windows 11 has been released in the year even though Microsoft stated earlier that Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows.

The Control Panel is still available as only some applets have been migrated so far. Now with the last build of Windows 11 in 2021 comes the migration of two Control Panel applets. Both applets have been disabled by Microsoft in the Control Panel; they are now placeholders that point to the relevant section in the operating system's Settings application.

The two applets in question are Installed Apps and Update History. Both won't open anymore when opened in the Control Panel.

Links to Programs & Features in Control Panel will now open to Settings > Apps > Installed Apps. EDIT: In other words links to the page to uninstall or change programs on your PC.

We're moving Uninstall Updates (for cumulative updates etc.) from Control Panel to a new page in Settings under Settings > Windows Update > Update History.

The Settings pages to control installed apps and manage the update history are not new as they have been present in previous versions of Windows 10 and 11. Administrators who used one or both of the applets of the Control Panel can't do so anymore.

The Settings applications often lack functionality that the Control Panel applets offered. The software uninstallation applet displayed installed programs in a table which users could sort and add information such as the installation location.

The uninstall an update applet displayed a table of installed updates as well and users could sort it and add information to it.

The installed apps page of the Settings application lacks these options. You can search installed apps sort by date name or size or filter by drive. Information such as the installed path can't be added.

Closing Words

If Microsoft keeps up the pace the Control Panel will still be present when Windows 12 is released in 2027. It is clear that the change removes functionality. While the core functionality is still there helpful features such as the option to add information to the listings or sort listings using other parameters are no longer available.

Administrators may resort to using third-party programs to uninstall software or the Windows Package Manager for that purpose.

Now You: how do you uninstall programs or updates?

Moderna (MRNA) has halted a rancorous patent dispute with the U.S. government over assigning credit for its Covid-19 vaccine saying the ongoing quarrel “could interfere with further discussions aimed at an amicable resolution” with the National Institutes of Health.

The move comes amid intensifying complaints that many vaccine makers are failing to make their intellectual property available so that still other companies can produce vaccines needed for a global eradication campaign. Moderna which recently projected $18 billion in vaccine sales this year has been a particular focus of criticism because U.S. taxpayers provided $2.5 billion to help develop the shot.

For the past month though Moderna has faced condemnation over its refusal to acknowledge the contributions from NIH scientists who worked with Moderna on key features of the vaccine that produce an immune response. Specifically the company last July refused to list the government scientists on a patent application prompting anger from the NIH.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhvc2VuZXJkeWdpcmxzLm9yZy9zaW5vdmFjLXNpbm9waGFybS1tcm5hLWJvb3N0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can I boost with an mRNA vaccine if I got Sinovac or Sinopharm originally?,"A: Yes you can. If you got Sinovac or Sinopharm originally it won’t hurt to boost with an mRNA vaccine–and it might help.

No one really knows what the BEST combination is at this point but overall protection is higher for those who do opt for a different brand booster shot. And most important there have been no safety issues among those who opt for a different brand booster.

If you got the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine when it became available you’re probably wondering: which booster should I get? Is it safe to get a Pfizer or Moderna booster if I got Sinovac originally? Is it as effective (or perhaps even more effective) than sticking with the original vaccine brand?

“Mix-and-match” refers to whenever we get one vaccine type for the primary series and then another type for the booster. There are a lot of COVID-19 vaccines out there at this point but all of them do the same thing: they train our immune system to recognize a threat by showing something similar to our immune cells. Some vaccines (like Sinovac and Sinopharm) contain copies of the whole virus that have been killed. Others (like the vaccines from Pfizer Moderna J&J and AstraZeneca) just show our immune cells a key part of the virus.

Mixing two different vaccines can produce better immunity than using just one because the immune cells become familiar with slightly different versions of the threat and can therefore recognize it even better. Mixing one dose of AstraZeneca and one of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) can offer better protection than AstraZeneca alone. We also know that after two doses of Pfizer a Moderna booster can produce better protection; and after two doses of Moderna a Pfizer booster can produce better protection.

Not much is known at this point about the effectiveness of getting one of the mRNA shots if you had Sinovac or Sinopharm first. But it’s unlikely to be WORSE than boosting with the same vaccine you had originally. And some preliminary results out of Chile show that boosting Sinovac with Pfizer was safe and more effective compared to a booster of Sinovac.

In Singapore people who originally got Sinopharm are being steered toward either Pfizer or Moderna as a third dose though they can also get a third dose of Sinopharm if they choose. In a few months we’ll get a better picture of any “boost” in effectiveness from studies coming out of this policy.

Most important no safety issues have been raised for any of the COVID-19 vaccine combinations so far.

If I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can I get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine if a booster shot is needed?

The beverage company admitted it tried to manipulate people’s dreams so they could collectively see visions of beer. The company even got pop star Zayn Malik to sleep on Instagram Live while having an incubated Coors beer dream to reach out to more people.

The company said “It’s no surprise the stress of the pandemic has caused many of us to have difficulties sleeping and in turn experience weird bizarre dreams called ‘quarandreams.’ Typically we can’t control what we dream about but what if we could? Coors Light and Coors Seltzer want to ensure you’ll have a refreshing dream using the science of guiding dreams .”

This wasn’t the first time a company tried hacking into dreams to advertise its products. Earlier Burger King and Microsoft’s Xbox have made similar attempts.

Concerned over this trend researchers have said this is not just a marketing gimmick  but this trend can have real-life consequences as companies can use such a technique to convince a person to take non-healthy products and even drugs.

Scientists decried the concept of dream advertising—process companies use to engineer ads into your subconscious through audio and video clips—in an open letter published on the op-ed website DXE. They said it is better to have a naturally occurring stress dream than a company planting an advertisement in someone’s head.

How is dream hacking done?

While the concept may remind you of high-tech sleep labs like the ones shown in the Hollywood blockbuster ‘Inception’ dream incubation is an ancient trick. There are records that Egyptians over 4000 years ago people lay in sacred beds to receive divine dreams.

Similarly ailing people were made to sleep in oracular temples in Greece to heal them. Even today dream incubation is used in healing therapeutic and spiritual practices such as “Yoga Nidra” or “Mohave Shamanism.”

Today marketers are working with scientists to achieve “targeted dream implantation.” They encourage people to watch some video clip right before hitting the bed and listen to soundscapes during sleep so that when people wake up they have a subconscious urge to use the product or service.

Repercussions of dream hacking

A recent study New York’s 2021 Future of Marketing by The American Marketing Association has revealed 77 percent of marketers in the United States aim to deploy dream-tech for advertising in the next three years. The reason – humans are highly susceptible to thoughts or ideas introduced while in sleep.

Scientists say dream hacking is very intrusive. They add that implanting dreams into people can change real-world outcomes either for good or bad. Besides once marketers fully understand the trick to hack into dreams they wouldn’t even need sleep scientists to develop such advertising campaigns without any expert supervision.

However there is an upside too. Over the past decade several studies have proved that dream alteration or dream incubation can help a person become more creative treat psychiatric conditions such as depression and PTSD and alleviate addiction.

Nonetheless the implications of the for-profit use of dreams for product placement can be damning. Also with advancing technology it has become easier to gauge the sleep stage of a person and plant an idea in the form of a dream. So while your sleep may be safe at present there is a threat that advertisements won’t leave you alone there as well in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,
MDLZ,Mondelez International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvY29jb2EtcHJpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cocoa Prices Impact West African Farmers,"

From cocoa comes chocolate a confection that needs no introduction. Approximately “70% of the world’s cocoa comes from” West African countries namely the “Ivory Coast Ghana Nigeria and Cameroon.” Of these countries Ghana and the Ivory Coast produce the most cocoa together accounting for more than 50% of the global cocoa output. However projections indicate that an unstable cocoa market can cause a loss of roughly 20% of income for these West African farmers. These impacts of fluctuating cocoa prices require prompt action from companies within the cocoa industry to prevent farmers from falling into poverty.

Reasons for Unstable Cocoa Prices

According to a report by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) in February 2021 “anticipations of a production surplus compounded with low levels of demand” drove down cocoa prices “on the London and New York futures markets.” To take New York’s statistics predictions determined that cocoa purchases in the form of future contracts would close at $2438 per ton by the end of 2021 in comparison to the $2587 price tag per ton on February 5 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic has a role in this outcome with waning demand a byproduct of sudden ruptures in the hospitality sector. This along with the decline in “out-of-home consumption” that arose from COVID-19 restrictions and the closure of businesses led to a 10% decrease in cocoa output compared to the previous year. Even as the economy saw some restimulation excess cocoa stocks due to the economic stall brought on by COVID-19 are not reducing dramatically according to 12 experts that Reuters polled. Supply continues to exceed demand impacting cocoa prices and therefore the income of West African farmers.

Attempting to Offset Decreases in Cocoa Prices

Lower cocoa prices exacerbate poverty perpetuate illegal child labor and encourage a lack of proper compensation for labor that hinges on modern slavery. Deforestation also plays a hand where a bid to sell more cocoa produce drives people to expand their land. To avoid these sorts of conditions the Ivory Coast and Ghana introduced a $400 per ton Living Income Differential (LID) in 2019 to protect farmers from price decreases and secure a higher income for farmers. As a result consumers became “more conservative in their buying helping to boost stocks at origins.”

Companies such as Hershey’s and Mondelez International are accused of attempting to circumnavigate the LID the former through as many futures exchanges as possible before contract expiration. The latter denied the allegations entirely. Mondelez International to its credit however told CNBC about its commitment to investing “$400 million in sustainable cocoa sourcing program Cocoa Life.”

Other companies such as Tony’s Chocolonely notes that it pays a premium in addition to “farmgate price” when buying cocoa. To continue alleviating the impacts of fluctuating cocoa prices on farmers in November 2021 the company vowed to increase its cocoa premium payment even further from the initial “$462 per metric ton” (26% higher than farmgate price) “to $793 per metric ton” — a staggering 54% higher than farmgate price for the 2021-2022 period.

Head of impact at Tony’s Chocolonely Paul Schoenmakers accuses major chocolate companies of “turning a blind eye” to the circumstances of cocoa farmers in developing countries. Because the sector derives massive amounts of wealth from cocoa “they’d still make massive profits every year” Schoenmakers told CNBC elaborating on the insignificance of the sum of premium payments in comparison to the massive profit generation.

Putting Cocoa Farmers First

Chocolate giant Mars Wrigley the parent company of household chocolate delights such as Snickers and Twix established the Cocoa for Generations program. The initiative actively works toward sustainability by focusing on the well-being of individuals across its entire supply chain especially those at the grassroots while alleviating environmental burden.

Launched in 2018 Cocoa for Generations has the support of $1 billion worth of funding from its start year of 2018 to its close in 2028. Highlights of the initiative according to a 2020 report include a $5 million collaborative donation with the CARE organization to help farmers facing the impacts of COVID-19.

Cocoa for Generations also helped more than 153000 farms map their boundaries to prevent land ownership conflicts. Mars also sourced more than 50% of its cocoa from farmer groups that have Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation Systems in place within at-risk regions in Ghana and Ivory Coast. Furthermore the program distributed about 2.4 million cocoa seeds to cocoa “farmers in 2019.”

Looking Ahead

The forces of supply and demand will reign supreme in determining cocoa prices however chocolate companies can show their support for impoverished West African cocoa farmers by adhering to the LID and opting to pay higher premiums in exchange for cocoa as is this case with Tony’s Chocolonely. With more companies stepping up to support cocoa farmers amid a fluctuating market cocoa farmers can remain out of the grips of poverty.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Here are companies at the top of the Index earning Trendsetter status:

Is He a Murderer?,"Home > Television > Dateline Is DNA Telling Us That the Wrong Man Is in Prison for the Murder of Mollie Olgin? By Jennifer Tisdale Dec. 18 2021 Published 9:23 a.m. ET Source: Facebook

Content warning: This article mentions instances of sexual assault and violence. In the summer of 2012 two girls were hanging out in Violet Andrews Park in Portland Tex. Mollie Olgin and Mary Kristene Chapa Kristene to most people were more than just friends and they were doing what all teenagers in love do trying to find a bit of space to call their own. Sadly that was the last time anyone would see Mollie alive.

Two birdwatchers discovered their bodies on June 23 both women had been sexually assaulted and shot in the head the night before. As shocking as that was no one could have predicted that Kristene was still alive. Evidence eventually led police to a man named David Strickland who was convicted of capital murder and aggravated sexual assault in Sept. 2016 but in 2018 new DNA evidence pointed the finger at someone else Dylan Spellman. Where is Dylan Spellman now?

Where is Dylan Spellman now?

Because science is constantly advancing new DNA technology that wasn't available at the time of the trial in 2016 was able to identify a hair found on Mollie's body. This hair matched Dylan Spellman's who for a time was a suspect before David Strickland was arrested and convicted. At the time of the attack in 2014 police recovered cigarette butts and a Monster energy drink with DNA that matched Dylan's.

Dylan's ex-girlfriend Alisha Dickey also told the police that she and Dylan had been in Violet Andrews Park the night of the murder. The Portland police soon discovered that Dylan was living in Texas while waiting to be sentenced for an armed robbery charge out of Nevada. What they quickly realized was the Nevada case was similar to the Texas case in a very specific way.

According to the Nevada case file the suspects referred to each other by numbers. Kristene told the Portland police that their attackers referred to Mollie and Kristene as ""Girl One and Girl Two."" Since Kristene survived she was able to answer police questions though she did suffer from a traumatic brain injury which could explain why she said her attacker was only a few inches taller than her. Dylan Spellman is 6 foot 8 inches but his DNA was all over the crime scene.

Eventually Dylan went to prison for the armed robbery in Nevada and was released in 2015. No one has heard from him since. That could be the quietness of someone who just wants to get on with their life or the need to hide from something else. Regardless David Strickland still sits in prison. Why was David arrested and charged despite the overwhelming DNA evidence pointing to Dylan?

David Strickland is still in prison - why?

In 2014 Kristene's father received an anonymous letter that pointed police in the direction of David Strickland. When they searched his home they found part of that letter. A further search revealed a knife flex handcuffs bolt cutters a suppressor two guns ammunition and a backpack containing condoms. Police were also able to use GPS to place David's phone near Kristene's house the day the anonymous letter was delivered.

Perhaps the biggest piece of damning evidence was the fact that bullet casings from the scene of the crime matched one of David's guns. To be perfectly honest compared to the massive amounts of DNA belonging to Dylan found at the crime scene this all seems circumstantial but that was enough to convict.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Market forecasters see activity pulling back from the peaks seen this year but at the same time volume is expected to remain strong in 2022.

To recap institutional loan issuance in 2021 reached $615 billion crushing the prior annual record of $503 billion set in 2017. Activity was broad-based with M&A and opportunistic issuance in the form of dividend recapitalizations in particular standing out setting new highs.



Market prognosticators expect strong issuance again in 2022 yet not at the chart-busting levels with sustained M&A volume at the vanguard. For example analysts at Barclays see new loan supply at $480 billion to $500 billion while Morgan Stanley’s estimate is more robust at $570 billion to $600 billion as is Citi’s estimate of $600 billion. By BofA Global Research’s estimation new-money issuance will drop to $500 billion and repricing volume will add another $250 billion to gross issuance.

According to J.P. Morgan’s 2022 outlook net issuance excluding repricing and refinancing activity will fall by less than 10% to $350 billion. However the firm is calling for a 20% year-over-year rise in gross issuance to $1 trillion fueled by issuers refinancing and repricing loans to transition away from Libor.



Such forecasts are predicated in part on the continuation of a strong technical underpinning of the floating-rate asset class particularly given the expected rising rate environment after the Federal Reserve signaled three rate hikes in 2022 at the Dec. 15 FOMC meeting. The CLO market will also be coming off a spectacular year with a record-setting $185.2 billion of issuance 44% more than the prior high of $129 billion from 2018. Inflows into loan mutual funds and ETFs contributed another $32.4 billion of capital to the market in 2021 through Dec. 15 based on Lipper’s weekly reporters only. Both channels of demand are expected to remain supportive in 2022.



CLO issuance is expected to remain strong in 2022 market watchers say pointing to a healthy deal pipeline. CLOs are the largest investors in leveraged loans taking a roughly 74% share of the new-issue market as of September 2021 the highest rate ever according to LCD. BofA for one projects $155 billion in new-issue CLOs as well as $229 billion in refinancing/reset activity in 2022. That said CLO issuance may be slow to start in the new year as managers and investors work out the transition to Sofr from Libor. As LCD has noted some managers may have pulled some of their new-year business forward into the fourth quarter helping propel the market to another quarterly CLO issuance record of $55 billion.

There are mixed views from bank research desks regarding the amount of refinancing and repricing activity the market might see next year but most agree that solid economic conditions not to mention a mountain of dry powder at private equity funds will lead to continued strength in acquisition-related activity. Favorable market conditions for issuers may also continue the trend of dividend deals.

While the Street consensus seems to be that leveraged loan issuance will remain robust in 2022 there are risks that add some degree of uncertainty including the Libor transition and the impact of coronavirus variants such as omicron.

This analysis was updated on Jan. 3 2022 to reflect full-year 2021 US loan issuance.

Britney Spears is arguably one of the most influential pop stars of our time. The Princess of Pop's power anthems resonate with themes of empowerment under the dance beats. A musical inspired by Britney Spears' hits is long overdue for the singer's dedicated fanbase. Fans finally have their wishes granted with the artistic direction of Keone and Mari Madrid and book by Jon Hartmere. The Princess of Pop meets fairytale princesses in the world premiere of Once Upon a One More Time at Shakespeare Theatre Company's Sidney Harman Hall.

The musical is set in a kingdom ruled by Narrator (Michael McGrath) who controls all fairy tales with the wave of his quill. It's always happily ever after over and over again. While her fellow princesses including her bestie Snow White (Aisha Jackson) are fine with their stories Cinderella (Briga Heelan) wonders if there is more to life than cleaning up after her stepfamily and marrying Prince Charming (Justin Guarini). The Original Fairy Godmother aka the Notorious OFG (Brooke Dillman) gives Cinderella a copy of Betty Friedman's The Feminine Mystique a catalyst for a princess strike. As they say in the show ""Well-behaved princesses seldom make history.""

These storybook characters are by no means cookie cutter - there is wine drinking secret affairs and Scroll Club. The musical's story is a bit more Grimm than Disney as the princesses and other familiar fairytale characters struggle to find their voices against the Narrator and his patriarchal world. The set designed by Anna Fleischle transforms seamlessly into palaces and forests with the assistance of beautifully done projections by Sven Ortel. It is almost reminiscent of old illustrated storybooks. Although there are some elements of Once Upon a One More Time that feel inspired by Disney. The costumes designed by Loren Elstein evoke the bright color palette of beloved Disney classics.

This cast is worthy of Broadway. Heelan shines as a feminist version of Cinderella. Her transformation into a leader of the princess movement doesn't go unnoticed. She clearly channels her inner Britney especially during the song ""Womanizer"" where she teams up with Jackson's passionate vocals as Snow White. Guarini's Prince Charming turns up the charm with his boy band rendition of ""Oops...I Did It Again."" Dillman's OFG is uproariously funny and witty which is refreshing for a fairy godmother a role that isn't traditionally cast in a comical light.

The iconic Britney songs are ever present in Once Upon a One More Time. The best numbers are the high-energy numbers that make you feel like you are in the club. ""Work Bitch"" ""Circus"" Womanizer"" and ""I Wanna Go All the Way"" are full of sharp choreography and powerful vocal performances. You'll want to keep dancing and singing even after these numbers are over.

This modern fairytale is missing something that even the magic of a fantastic cast and high-quality production might not be able to fix. A Cinderella-focused story can only go so far especially as it has been done time and time again. This story calls for more inclusion. A LGBTQ love story shouldn't just briefly take centerstage. All princesses and princes should have their voices woven into this story and have their aha moments with The Feminine Mystique.

Once Upon a One More Time is close to ""happily ever after"" but it has some workshopping to do before it becomes a fairy tale fit for Broadway royalty.

Run Time: 2 hours and 30 minutes with a 20-minute intermission

Once Upon a One More Time runs until January 9 2022 at STC's Sidney Harman Hall - 610 F Street NW Washington DC 20004. Tickets can be purchased here .

Prof Roberts a leading anthropologist author and broadcaster arrived at a site in Rutland for the filming of series 9 of Digging for Britain to take part in the unearthing of the rare mosaic that had been discovered in the remains of a Roman villa beneath a farmer’s field. It is the only UK find of its kind displaying scenes from Homer’s The Iliad and is one of only a handful from across the whole of Europe measuring 11 metres by almost seven metres and depicts part of the story of the Greek hero Achilles.

Prof Roberts arrived a year after the mosaic was originally found but was lucky enough to be right there in the heart of the action during its excavation. She told Express.co.uk ""I arrived at the field in Rutland in September when they were just about to start harvesting the wheat and then opening up the trenches over the part of the mosaic that had been covered up over a layer of sand a membrane and then the earth and a crop of wheat planted over the top of it. “When I turned up the combine harvester had broken down and I thought goodness me I’m not going to be able to see this mosaic any time soon. “But by the next day they had fixed it and it was busy harvesting all the wheat and they were able to get mechanical diggers in to start opening the trenches. “Then you take down the earth to a certain level and then you switch to digging by hand then you peel back the membrane and brush away the sand so that the mosaic from last year was revealed. “When they were excavating the whole mosaic floor I was able to get involved as well which was just such a privilege and it was really exciting.

Alice Roberts

The mosaic find has been called the ""most exciting"" of the century

“I knew that this was big important and well preserved but talking to somebody who had studied pretty much every mosaic in Britain he said it was the most significant Roman mosaic find in 100 years.” This was just one out of a host of other amazing finds made across Britain that Prof Roberts was lucky enough to investigate as part of her new series with the first episode airing on January 4 on BBC Two. But when asked about what her favourite find of the series was she replied “The Roman villa is up there certainly it was absolutely stunning. “I found it emotional to be there when it was being uncovered and to be part of the team doing that as well.” The mosaic was first found by Jim Irvine the landowner’s son who stumbled upon the elaborate villa complex almost by accident.

The Roman mosaic unearthed in Rutland

He said: “A ramble through the fields with the family turned into an incredible discovery. “Finding some unusual pottery amongst the wheat piqued my interest and prompted some further investigative work. Later looking at the satellite imagery I spotted a very clear crop mark as if someone had drawn on my computer screen with a piece of chalk. “This really was the ‘oh wow’ moment and the beginning of the story.” After one initial excavation Prof Roberts joined staff and students from the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History for further examination in September 2021.

Queensland developers were among some of the most active and busy in 2021.

The Gold Coast boomed as much as anywhere in the country with interstate migration still seeing thousands move from the southern states while Brisbane picked up an early burst of sentiment with the news they would be hosting the 2032 Summer Olympics.

Some of Queensland's top developers have been planning for 2022 and acquiring development sites while also happy to leave any official project launch to near Christmas given the border reopening to prospective New South Wales and Victoria buyers.

We've taken a look at who's been busy in the market with site acquisitions and project launches heading in to 2022.

Cube Developments

Cube Developments is one of the most well known developers on the Sunshine Coast. They've built up their pipeline for 2022 with further site acquisitions in the lakeside suburb of Birtinya.

They recently secured a near 9000 sqm site in Cardinal Place which will host up to 245 apartments adding a further $100 million to Cube's Birtinya portfolio.

Cube led by director Scott Juniper recently submitted $75 million plans for Oasis Apartments just 56 residences across three buildings at Bokarina Beach.

Juniper said that he expected the new sites acquired by Cube would relieve the pressure currently experienced in the Sunshine Coast housing market.

“Our commitment to the Sunshine Coast is resolute and has culminated in a site where we can rapidly cater to the strong demand that we’re experiencing” Juniper said.

Currently Cube are selling Seasons Birtinya a two-building development of 146 apartments designed by Cottee Parker Architects.

""The brief was to create a unique and elevated 'Work Rest Play' environment in response to the post COVID lifestyle shift with leading amenity for the Sunshine Coast"" Cottee Parker director Sandra Browne told Urban.

They also have in market Nature by Cube a luxury project at Cotton Tree.

Siera Group

The Brisbane-based Siera Group will be heading in to 2022 ready to launch their first Gold Coast apartment project.

Dubbed Tapestry designed by BDA Architecture to pay homage to the Island's new Home of the Arts precinct will have 83 apartments across its 17 levels.

Offering two and three-bedroom apartments Tapestry will be crowned by an exclusive resident rooftop featuring a resort-style swimming pool with day beds a spa and a pool deck. A barbecue and alfresco area will sit in landscaping as will dining surrounded by an edible garden.

There's set to be a private dining space with a terrace and fire pit a gym with sauna and steam room and a lounging area with a lawn.

The Brisbane-based development and construction firm is headed by managing director and founder Brent Thompson who sits on the board of UDIA QLD and chairs the Brisbane City Council Policy Committee.

Thomson said he wanted to create something that was targeted at a wider net rather than the multi million dollar apartments that are limited to the fortunate few.

""We want the local owner occupier who could be living in a medium-size house in the area to be able to downsize or rightsize or have others who just want to find a new lifestyle and have the opportunity to do so without being priced out.""

Siera is committed to the Gold Coast having also snapped up a further development site on the dress circle Garfield Terrace where they intend to create an owner-occupier driven boutique collection of apartments.

Aria Property Group

""Since the scaffold dropped at Norfolk the building has quickly become an icon"" FORME managing director David Calvisi said with the architecture flooding social media.

Even the popular beach photographer Aquabumps have prints available of the iconic facade.

""Norfolk has been a great success and it was important we carried the key elements of its success mainly via the architecture through the design at 96 The Esplanade"" Calvisi added.

Nonetheless we powered our way through that hurdle and started down the path of thinking more like portfolio managers and less like stoned MBAs. As risk-averse investors we’re always interested in better understanding what risks we’re taking and further refining our tech investing methodology.

A common way to analyze risk for any given portfolio is by grouping the constituents into similar buckets. Some common factors to evaluate include value vs. growth size (big caps medium caps small caps) and industry. Tech investing by definition is all about growth. That’s why our simple valuation ratio focuses on how fast revenues are growing. As for industry and size these are two factors we haven’t evaluated for our own portfolio. First let’s look at size.

Big vs. Mid vs. Small

Many index providers like MSCI (MSCI) define size as a target that moves along with the overall universe. Their size buckets adjust to the ebb and flow of the markets. For our own purposes fixed-size buckets will work just fine.

The film follows two astronomers who attempt to warn humanity about a large comet heading towards earth. After discovering a comet that will end life on earth as we know it junior astronomers Kate Dibiasky and Randall Mindy are not believed. They must embark on a nationwide media campaign to try and avert the destruction of Earth.

The star-studded cast includes many popular names including Academy Award winners Meryl Streep Leonardo DiCaprio Jennifer Lawrence and more.

When director and producer Adam McKay was asked about how he got so many A-list actors to work on this film he said: “Honestly I’m still in complete shock that we got all these megastars to agree to do this in the first place. We initially sent the script around in early 2020. Jen Lawrence was the first one we went out to and was the first to sign on. Then Leo agreed then Jonah and Meryl. At a certain point my casting director said it was getting ridiculous.""

• Jennifer Lawrence plays an astronomy grad student Kate Dibiasky • Leonardo DiCaprio plays Kate Dibiasky’s astronomy professor Dr. Randall Mindy • Meryl Streep plays the US President • Cate Blanchett plays Brie the face of The Daily Rip • Rob Morgan plays Dr. Clayt Oglethorpe • Jonah Hill plays the President's son Jason Orlean • Ron Perlman plays Colonel Drask • Timothée Chalamet plays Nico • and plenty more established actors.

Where will Don’t Look Up be playing in theaters?

The film will hit theater screens on Friday 10 December nationwide.

How did the pandemic impact the filming of the movie?

The film is being released much later than what was initially anticipated because of the pandemic. While filming had initially been planned for April 2020 but did not start until November of that year to begin."

Mr Samuel Osei Communications and External Relations Manager Ahafo South mine and Ahafo North Project announced the payments in an interaction with the media in Sunyani on Thursday

He announced that the company had acquired a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency to commence work on the Ahafo North project to create value for the people and increase government revenue as well.

He gave the assurance to the communities within the Ahafo North mine of excellent compensation packages that would enhance their socio-economic livelihoods.

Mr Osei said the company had engaged and trained 168 local people for construction work saying the project would create temporary job opportunities for 1800 locals and permanent jobs for 500 people.

He said the company had started payment for crop compensation and expressed the hope that it would commence actual mining by 2023.

On the COVID-19 pandemic Mr Osei said the Ahafo mine had zero case count at its plant site saying though some of the employees contracted the disease they had recovered.

He gave the assurance that the company would continue to put in place precautionary measures to protect employees and communities within the mine’s operational area.

Mr Osei said the health safety of employees and residents in and around the mine remained a priority and advised particularly people in the mining communities to adhere to the COVID-19 protocols to prevent the spread of the pandemic in the area.

Credit: Equity Metals

Canadian explorer Equity Metals (TSXV: EQTY; US-OTC: EQMEF) owns precious-base metal and diamond projects in British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.

The Vancouver-headquartered junior is focused on advancing its 100%-owned flagship Silver Queen gold-silver-base metal project in central B.C. about 590 km northwest of Vancouver and 35 km south of the town of Houston.

The 18852-hectare property lies within the heart of the world-renowned Skeena Arch mining district which hosts several current and past-producing mines and numerous advanced exploration projects. These include the Huckleberry copper mine owned and operated by Huckleberry Mines Ltd a wholly-owned subsidiary of Imperial Metals (TSX: III); the past-producing Equity Silver mine owned by Newmont (TSX: NGT; NYSE: NEM); and Surge Copper’s (TSXV: SURG; US-OTC: SRGXF) Berg deposit an advanced exploration-stage copper-molybdenum-silver project.

Robert Macdonald Equity Metals’ vice president of exploration says Silver Queen “has had over a century of exploration on the property and hosts a historical past-producing mine. It benefits from excellent infrastructure including an all-weather road that connects it to Highway 16 providing access to Pacific ports a rail line power lines that run along the western side of the property camp infrastructure and a tailings management facility.”

The mineralisation at Silver Queen occurs in an extensive epithermal vein system covering a six-sq.-km area. While more than 20 veins have been discovered on the property to date with silver-gold-enriched mineralisation identified in the western portion of the property and base metal in the eastern part Macdonald said the property remains largely underexplored.

“Closer inspection of the historical data as well as some of our initial drilling confirmed a fairly strong east-west orientation to some of the mineralisation” he said. “This led to the identification of distinct areas of mineralisation along an east-southeast and west-northwest corridor with our recent drilling focused on confirming this.”

Since the fall of 2020 Equity Metals has drilled 59 holes (18716 metres) over five successive phases of exploration drilling which focused on four vein systems — Camp No.3 about one km to the east of Camp No.5/Switchback between Camp and No.3 and NG-3 about one km southeast of Camp.

Drilling on the Camp vein returned bonanza-grade silver mineralization. Highlights included drillholes SQ20-010 which intersected 4.4 metres grading 4632 grams silver per tonne 0.2 gram gold per tonne 0.12% copper 0.14% lead and 1.2% zinc (4718 grams silver-equivalent per tonne or 62.9 grams gold-equivalent per tonne) from 112.4 metres downhole including a higher grade core of 0.3 metres of 56115 grams silver 0.1 gram gold 1.08% copper 0.6% lead and 1.2% zinc (56291 grams silver-equivalent or 750.5 grams gold-equivalent).

Hole SQ21-031 cut 2.8 metres of 2402 grams silver 0.1 gram gold 0.1% copper 1.3% lead and 2.2% zinc (2543 grams silver-equivalent or 33.9 grams gold-equivalent) from 232.3 metres including 0.3 metres of 14035 grams silver 0.5 gram gold 0.5% copper 1.3% lead and 3.3% zinc (14256 grams silver-equivalent or 190.1 grams gold-equivalent).

The drilling “not only confirmed the exceptionally high-grade potential of the Camp vein but also identified the deepest step-outs drilled to date and demonstrated that the high-grade mineralisation extends to about 175 metres below surface with the mineralisation remaining open at depth and to the east and west” Macdonald said.

“We believe there is huge upside potential for significant additional resources at Camp which could potentially more than double the existing resource base"" he said. ""The current estimate only comprises mineralisation hosted by No. 3 vein and doesn't include any drill results from the Camp or the recently drilled No.5/Switchback.""

A 2019 mineral resource estimate for Silver Queen estimated 815000 indicated tonnes grading 3.2 grams gold per tonne 201 grams silver per tonne 0.3% copper 0.9% lead and 6.4% zinc for 85000 oz. contained gold 5.2 million oz. silver 5 million lb. copper 17 million lb. lead and 114 million lb. zinc (244000 oz. gold-equivalent or 22 million oz. silver-equivalent). Inferred resources add 801000 tonnes of 2.5 grams gold 184 grams silver 0.3% copper 0.9% lead and 5.2% zinc for 64000 oz. gold 4.7 million oz. silver 5 million lb. copper 16 million lb. lead and 92 million lb. zinc (193000 oz. gold-equivalent or 17 million oz. silver-equivalent).

To date Equity Metals has completed approximately two thirds of its 2021/22 drill program. The program consists of 15000 metres of drilling to extend the current 2.5 km strike length of Camp and to test a 1000-metre-long east-southeast trending target that forms the eastern projection of Camp and transitions into the No. 3 Switchback and No. 5 vein systems.

Since September it has completed 36 new drill holes and an extension of an earlier hole totalling 9660 metres with assays from 26 of these holes expected over the coming weeks and into 2022.

“Visual inspection of the core samples from between the No. 5 and Switchback segment has been very encouraging and we continue to target this area with our current drilling campaign” Macdonald said.

The company plans to release an updated resource estimate in the second quarter of next year that will include the drill results from Camp.

Equity Metals also holds interests in two highly prospective diamond properties Monument and WO. Both properties lie within the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories one of Canada’s most prolific diamond-producing regions.

The Health Facilities Regulatory Agency (HeFRA) has served notice that it will close down all unregistered health facilities in Ashanti region by March 2022.

Mr. Seidu Inusah Rashid the Regional Representative of the Registrar of the Agency who announced this said it formed part of efforts to sanitise the health ecosystem in the Region.

He was speaking at a media briefing in Kumasi as part of activities marking the 10th anniversary celebrations of the Agency.

Established in 2011 by the Health Institutions and Facilities Act 829 the Agency is mandated to register licence and monitor activities of all health facilities in the country.

Mr Rashid said his outfit was taking steps to weed out quack medical officers and facilities in the Ashanti Region to ensure facilities in the Region were of high standards and could guarantee the safety of their clients.

“HeFRA has grown from not having concrete data on facilities in the country to now having credible and reliable data of all facilities in all the regions that USAID UNICEF and the MOH can now rely upon for major decision-making “he stated.

He said the Agency as part of efforts to ensure efficiency in its operations had digitalised all its processes to enhance engagements with its clients.

The Agency over the last ten years had raised the awareness of patient’s rights at health facilities thereby making health workers more conscious when handling patients he noted.

He disclosed that his outfit received seven complaints on medical negligence between 2019 and 2021 adding that all the complaints were investigated and those with genuine cases duly compensated.

He called for the support of the media and other stakeholders to sanitise the system to ensure quality services in health facilities across the country.

As part of the 10th anniversary celebrations and awareness creation about the patient’s rights the Regional Office is organising a health walk on Saturday December 18 through the principal streets of Greater Kumasi.

Verso's Board of Directors acting upon the recommendation of a special committee of Verso's Board has unanimously approved and resolved to recommend approval of the merger by Verso's shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.

The consideration corresponds to a premium of approximately 35% compared to closing price of Verso's shares on December 17 2021; a premium of approximately 26% compared to Verso's volume-weighted average share price during the last 30 trading days; and a premium of approximately 57% compared to the unaffected closing price of Verso's shares on July 9 2021 the day prior to Atlas Holdings' submission of an unsolicited non-binding proposal to acquire Verso for $20.00 per share in cash.

The acquisition of Verso is fully in line with BillerudKorsnäs' strategy to drive profitable growth in paperboard and the ambition to expand into North America. BillerudKorsnäs aims to build one of the most cost-efficient and sustainable paperboard platforms in North America by converting several of Verso's assets into paperboard machines while maintaining Verso's position as a quality and cost leader in specialty and coated freesheet paper.

In making this acquisition BillerudKorsnäs recognizes that Verso's strategic assets are positioned in a region with abundant and cost-effective fiber supply suitable for production of premium packaging materials. Verso's location also presents favorable export opportunities to both Asia and Europe. Verso will become the platform for BillerudKorsnäs' future expansion in North America and is expected to provide continuous growth opportunities over the next ten years and beyond. The combined company will be one of the largest providers of virgin fiber paper and packaging with a cost and quality advantage.

Randy Nebel President and Chief Executive Officer of Verso said ""With the support of our talented team Verso has successfully streamlined our operations and reduced costs while strategically investing in projects to enhance our ability to support our customers. This transaction builds upon our considerable progress and better positions the combined company to invest in our North American manufacturing capability provide high-quality paper products to customers and accelerate growth.""

Mr. Nebel continued ""This agreement follows careful consideration and negotiation led by the special committee of our Board which was formed following receipt of the unsolicited proposal earlier this year. Our full Board believes this transaction maximizes value for shareholders who will receive a significant premium and immediate and certain value. In BillerudKorsnäs we found a partner that shares our commitments to safety quality sustainability and innovation and is uniquely positioned to recognize the value of our business. We are grateful for BillerudKorsnäs' partnership over the past several months in reaching this compelling transaction particularly amidst an uncertain and restrictive pandemic-related travel environment. We are excited to join forces with BillerudKorsnäs and benefit from enhanced opportunities as part of a larger stronger organization.""

Christoph Michalski President and CEO of BillerudKorsnäs commented ""The combination of BillerudKorsnäs' expertise in high-quality virgin fiber packaging materials and Verso's attractive assets creates an excellent platform for long-term profitable growth. We will obtain cost-effective production of coated virgin fiber material in the Midwestern United States. We also plan to sequentially transform part of the business into paperboard production while continuing to serve the U.S. customers. Our investments will create new U.S.-based jobs in a growing market and accelerate the transition from plastic-based packaging materials to renewable sources.""

Investing in Verso's Platform

BillerudKorsnäs plans to convert Verso's largest facility its Escanaba Mill into a world-class sustainable fully integrated paperboard production site. One machine is estimated to be converted by 2025 a second machine by 2029 with a total capacity of around 1200000 tons (1100 ktonnes). BillerudKorsnäs estimates that the investment for the conversion project will be up to approximately $1 billion2.

In addition to continued paper production in Escanaba during the conversion BillerudKorsnäs plans to continue operating the Quinnesec Mill a cost and quality leader in graphic paper specifically in coated freesheet and specialty papers. The mill has the capacity to produce about 430000 tons (400 ktonnes) of graphic and specialty papers and 240000 tons (200 ktonnes) of market pulp per year.

BillerudKorsnäs is committed to continuing to serve Verso's existing customers.

Additional Transaction Details

The acquisition will be effected pursuant to a definitive merger agreement under which Verso will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of BillerudKorsnäs. The acquisition will be primarily financed by BillerudKorsnäs through increased debt and operating cash flow. Closing of the transaction is not subject to any financing condition.

A special meeting of Verso's shareholders is expected to be convened following the mailing to Verso's shareholders of a proxy statement for the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022 subject to the approval of Verso's shareholders as well as receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals include U.S. antitrust approval as well as approval from relevant state and federal energy regulatory authorities in the U.S.

But perhaps none quite like the one that's taken hold today.

There are excavators and bulldozers seemingly everywhere pushing dirt into tall piles and leaving everything -- and everyone -- covered in a coat of wind-blown dust. The space they are carving out of the desert floor will house a long list of new factories that were ordered up by anxious CEOs across the world when the pandemic roiled their global supply routes.

Ambu a Danish medical device maker is erecting a facility on the outskirts of the city. Several miles away Keeson Technology Corp. a Chinese furniture maker is building a second plant here just months after opening its first. Boyd Corp. a California-based conglomerate recently inaugurated one factory and plans to build three more. And MGA Entertainment a California-based toymaker began cranking out Little Tikes Cozy Coupes from its plant last month even before construction crews had cleared out debris piles or paved the parking lot.

What's the rush at MGA?

The company has 750 containers of toys stuck in supply-chain hell at ports around Los Angeles. Produced in China those items were supposed to be on U.S. store shelves this holiday season. That won't happen says Isaac Larian MGA's chief executive officer. But the Juarez plant is now shipping two truckloads of toys into the U.S. each day and that number will soon grow to 10. What's more Larian plans to break ground on a second factory in Mexico next year and will begin shifting some of MGA's Chinese production to these plants.

""We have big ambitions and big plans for Mexico"" he says.

This in the lingo of corporate executives is near-shoring one of the biggest economic transformations sparked by the pandemic: Shrink the length of the supply chain to keep production closer to its final destination and reduce the risk of some snag messing things up along the way. A shorter chain is a stronger chain the thinking now goes and there's a growing sense that this new approach will remain in vogue in C-suites long after Covid fades.

For the multinationals that do business in the red-hot U.S. economy near-shoring often means northern Mexico where labor costs are cheap land is plentiful and the border is just a short ride away. El Paso Texas is less than 10 miles to the north of most of the new plants in Juarez.

Other border cities -- Tijuana along the west coast and Reynosa Matamoros and Piedras Negras far to the east -- are undergoing similar industrial booms providing a much-needed lift to a Mexican economy that has been slow to recover from last year's collapse.

For more than half a century now the factories in these cities have been a key cog in the U.S. supply chain. Known in the industry as maquiladoras they take imported parts assemble them into consumer and industrial products and then ship them north.

When NAFTA the free trade deal between the U.S. Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994 multinationals set up maquiladoras at a frenetic pace. Juarez alone is home to plants owned by General Electric Honeywell International Bosch Foxconn Technology Siemens and Electrolux among others.

Years later the region began to stagnate when China entered the World Trade Organization. Many companies pulled out of Mexico and set up shop in China where labor costs were even lower. Flareups of gruesome narco violence along the border only added to the exodus.

China kept stealing U.S. market share from Mexico right up until Donald Trump took office in Washington. When he started slapping tariffs on Chinese-made products Mexico suddenly looked pretty attractive again to executives. Then the pandemic came along and turbocharged the shift. Keeson the furniture maker is Exhibit A for this: It first made plans to open a factory in Juarez shortly after Trump launched his trade war against Beijing and it sped up those plans by a full year when Covid hit.

""Manufacturing is coming back for sure"" says Jason Tolliver a managing director who helps oversee logistics and industrial services in the Americas for real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield PLC. The conversations he's having with corporate leaders he says indicate this wave of investment along the border is just beginning. ""It is structural and it's long term.""

The boom is so intense in Juarez that industrial real estate is suddenly getting tight: 98% of existing space is already leased and the price has jumped more than 20% over the past year to about $5.25 per square foot according to Jesse Melendez a director at industrial real estate company Intermex.

Intermex is rushing to cash in. It's leasing out 5 million square feet more of factory space in the city today than it did a year ago and it's building four additional factory sites. They will be tightly clustered in what is now just a barren field on the city's southwestern edge.

As excited as Melendez is about the boom he's already mentally preparing for the bust that often follows. ""In my career I've typically seen the valleys and peaks seven to 10 years apart"" he says. He figures the slowdown will begin by 2024.

As Melendez drove through the city on a recent weekday afternoon that seemed like a distant thought. ""Hiring"" signs kept popping up all around him -- on the facades of factories on buses in shop windows.

This is what lured Efrain Gonzalez back to Juarez from his native Veracruz in the south.

People associate Mexican migrants with the U.S. labor market but the truth is many of them like Gonzalez end their journeys just miles south of the border especially when the maquiladoras are humming like they are now.

The factory jobs offer pay that while a fraction of typical U.S. wages is markedly higher than what the migrants can earn back home in the impoverished south of Mexico. And they don't have to worry about getting deported.

Gonzalez 49 earns a little over $80 a week plus benefits like free lunch at the Keeson plant which produces the company's Ergomotion adjustable beds. He said he knew he'd find work as soon as he set foot back in Juarez a few months ago. The sight of all the new factories going up made that clear. ""There's a lot of work here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3Rlbm5pcy9iZXJuYXJkLXRvbWljLWxvb2tzLWEtY29tcGxldGVseS1kaWZmZXJlbnQtcGVyc29uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYmU2ZTE4MjhiZTNkOTgzZmIzMDliZGU3YjQ0YTUyMWHSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS90ZW5uaXMvYmVybmFyZC10b21pYy1sb29rcy1hLWNvbXBsZXRlbHktZGlmZmVyZW50LXBlcnNvbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2JlNmUxODI4YmUzZDk4M2ZiMzA5YmRlN2I0NGE1MjFh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tomic looks a completely different person,"Bernard Tomic is back on the training court at a private location on the Gold Coast in preparation for his big comeback.

Bernard Tomic looks a completely different person as he rebuilds his career and his body.

The 29-year-old has made headlines this week after making a series of startling confessions about his career.

The revelations have continued to flow with Tomic now speaking openly about transforming his fitness ahead of the 2022 Australian Open beginning January 17.

Speaking to the Gold Coast Bulletin this week Tomic said his promising run at this year’s Australian Open reignited the “fire” inside him and is hoping to crack the top 10 within a few years.

It has prompted a lifestyle overhaul he insists is the real deal this time.

It includes a new commitment to the vegan lifestyle he has used in recent year — and a promise to avoid all alcohol.

“I’ve stopped partying and drinking. I wake up at 6am every morning. I run and do gym workouts and obviously tennis is involved. It’s not easy but I’ve got to do it. Anything to get He has now told The Daily Telegraphhis transformation includes a promise to avoid dating in order to focus on tennis.

“Next time I am in a relationship I want to find real love” he said.

“I want someone who is honest and has my best interest at heart.

“People often only have their best interests at heart.

“I have had a lot of girlfriends in my life and it has been a rollercoaster.”

Earlier this week Tomic opened up on his complex relationships with Lleyton Hewitt Nick Kyrgios his father John and ex-girlfriend Vanessa Sierra.

The former world No. 17’s on-again off-again romance with former reality TV contestant Sierra included his appearance in sexually-suggestive photos on her Instagram page and adult-content site.

His relationship with Sierra was one of the first things Tomic addressed on Tuesday during a Q+A with fans on his Instagram stories.

“I mean guys how many questions about her? Do you really want to know? I didn’t realise she was that interesting” he said.

When asked about his time on an adult content site with Sierra Tomic responded by posting a photo of him burying his face in his hand.

“BIGGEST. REGRET. OF. MY. LIFE” he wrote on the picture.

Tomic who burst onto the scene by making the quarterfinals of Wimbledon as a fresh-faced 18-year-old says he is serious about his comeback

He is now ranked 254th in the world and played his last match in Kazakhstan in September which he lost due to retirement.

He is recovering from a finger ligament injury and has given himself a five-week preparation to regain his top form and be ready to contest qualifying for the Australian Open in January.

As part of his recent soul-searching Kyrgios has also admitted he wants to patch up his relationship with Aussie tennis legend and current Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt.

Tomic in 2019 accused Hewitt of favouring certain players in his Davis Cup selections as their prickly relationship exploded with a series of heated public swipes during the 2019 Australian Open.

Hewitt responded to Tomic’s claims by saying Tomic had made “physical” threats against his family.

Tomic responded at the time by calling Hewitt a “liar”.

Tomic has not played Davis Cup since.

The Gold Coast-based player now says he is ready to mend their rift.

“Would like to patch things up. He’s done a lot for the sport” Tomic responded to a question about Hewitt.

Tomic has bleached his normally dark hair posting footage of himself at the barber with the caption: “New start. New cut”.

He also says he is hungry and has a goal of reaching top the top 10 on the ATP Tour rankings within a few years.

“No one can stop me now but me. I’m training I’m sweating I’m pushing I’m fired up” he said.

Verso's Board of Directors acting upon the recommendation of a special committee of Verso's Board has unanimously approved and resolved to recommend approval of the merger by Verso's shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.

The consideration corresponds to a premium of approximately 35% compared to closing price of Verso's shares on December 17 2021; a premium of approximately 26% compared to Verso's volume-weighted average share price during the last 30 trading days; and a premium of approximately 57% compared to the unaffected closing price of Verso's shares on July 9 2021 the day prior to Atlas Holdings' submission of an unsolicited non-binding proposal to acquire Verso for $20.00 per share in cash.

The acquisition of Verso is fully in line with BillerudKorsnäs' strategy to drive profitable growth in paperboard and the ambition to expand into North America. BillerudKorsnäs aims to build one of the most cost-efficient and sustainable paperboard platforms in North America by converting several of Verso's assets into paperboard machines while maintaining Verso's position as a quality and cost leader in specialty and coated freesheet paper.

In making this acquisition BillerudKorsnäs recognizes that Verso's strategic assets are positioned in a region with abundant and cost-effective fiber supply suitable for production of premium packaging materials. Verso's location also presents favorable export opportunities to both Asia and Europe. Verso will become the platform for BillerudKorsnäs' future expansion in North America and is expected to provide continuous growth opportunities over the next ten years and beyond. The combined company will be one of the largest providers of virgin fiber paper and packaging with a cost and quality advantage.

Randy Nebel President and Chief Executive Officer of Verso said ""With the support of our talented team Verso has successfully streamlined our operations and reduced costs while strategically investing in projects to enhance our ability to support our customers. This transaction builds upon our considerable progress and better positions the combined company to invest in our North American manufacturing capability provide high-quality paper products to customers and accelerate growth.""

Mr. Nebel continued ""This agreement follows careful consideration and negotiation led by the special committee of our Board which was formed following receipt of the unsolicited proposal earlier this year. Our full Board believes this transaction maximizes value for shareholders who will receive a significant premium and immediate and certain value. In BillerudKorsnäs we found a partner that shares our commitments to safety quality sustainability and innovation and is uniquely positioned to recognize the value of our business. We are grateful for BillerudKorsnäs' partnership over the past several months in reaching this compelling transaction particularly amidst an uncertain and restrictive pandemic-related travel environment. We are excited to join forces with BillerudKorsnäs and benefit from enhanced opportunities as part of a larger stronger organization.""

Christoph Michalski President and CEO of BillerudKorsnäs commented ""The combination of BillerudKorsnäs' expertise in high-quality virgin fiber packaging materials and Verso's attractive assets creates an excellent platform for long-term profitable growth. We will obtain cost-effective production of coated virgin fiber material in the Midwestern United States. We also plan to sequentially transform part of the business into paperboard production while continuing to serve the U.S. customers. Our investments will create new U.S.-based jobs in a growing market and accelerate the transition from plastic-based packaging materials to renewable sources.""

Investing in Verso's Platform

BillerudKorsnäs plans to convert Verso's largest facility its Escanaba Mill into a world-class sustainable fully integrated paperboard production site. One machine is estimated to be converted by 2025 a second machine by 2029 with a total capacity of around 1200000 tons (1100 ktonnes). BillerudKorsnäs estimates that the investment for the conversion project will be up to approximately $1 billion2.

In addition to continued paper production in Escanaba during the conversion BillerudKorsnäs plans to continue operating the Quinnesec Mill a cost and quality leader in graphic paper specifically in coated freesheet and specialty papers. The mill has the capacity to produce about 430000 tons (400 ktonnes) of graphic and specialty papers and 240000 tons (200 ktonnes) of market pulp per year.

BillerudKorsnäs is committed to continuing to serve Verso's existing customers.

Additional Transaction Details

The acquisition will be effected pursuant to a definitive merger agreement under which Verso will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of BillerudKorsnäs. The acquisition will be primarily financed by BillerudKorsnäs through increased debt and operating cash flow. Closing of the transaction is not subject to any financing condition.

A special meeting of Verso's shareholders is expected to be convened following the mailing to Verso's shareholders of a proxy statement for the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022 subject to the approval of Verso's shareholders as well as receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals include U.S. antitrust approval as well as approval from relevant state and federal energy regulatory authorities in the U.S.

But perhaps none quite like the one that's taken hold today.

There are excavators and bulldozers seemingly everywhere pushing dirt into tall piles and leaving everything -- and everyone -- covered in a coat of wind-blown dust. The space they are carving out of the desert floor will house a long list of new factories that were ordered up by anxious CEOs across the world when the pandemic roiled their global supply routes.

Ambu a Danish medical device maker is erecting a facility on the outskirts of the city. Several miles away Keeson Technology Corp. a Chinese furniture maker is building a second plant here just months after opening its first. Boyd Corp. a California-based conglomerate recently inaugurated one factory and plans to build three more. And MGA Entertainment a California-based toymaker began cranking out Little Tikes Cozy Coupes from its plant last month even before construction crews had cleared out debris piles or paved the parking lot.

What's the rush at MGA?

The company has 750 containers of toys stuck in supply-chain hell at ports around Los Angeles. Produced in China those items were supposed to be on U.S. store shelves this holiday season. That won't happen says Isaac Larian MGA's chief executive officer. But the Juarez plant is now shipping two truckloads of toys into the U.S. each day and that number will soon grow to 10. What's more Larian plans to break ground on a second factory in Mexico next year and will begin shifting some of MGA's Chinese production to these plants.

""We have big ambitions and big plans for Mexico"" he says.

This in the lingo of corporate executives is near-shoring one of the biggest economic transformations sparked by the pandemic: Shrink the length of the supply chain to keep production closer to its final destination and reduce the risk of some snag messing things up along the way. A shorter chain is a stronger chain the thinking now goes and there's a growing sense that this new approach will remain in vogue in C-suites long after Covid fades.

For the multinationals that do business in the red-hot U.S. economy near-shoring often means northern Mexico where labor costs are cheap land is plentiful and the border is just a short ride away. El Paso Texas is less than 10 miles to the north of most of the new plants in Juarez.

Other border cities -- Tijuana along the west coast and Reynosa Matamoros and Piedras Negras far to the east -- are undergoing similar industrial booms providing a much-needed lift to a Mexican economy that has been slow to recover from last year's collapse.

For more than half a century now the factories in these cities have been a key cog in the U.S. supply chain. Known in the industry as maquiladoras they take imported parts assemble them into consumer and industrial products and then ship them north.

When NAFTA the free trade deal between the U.S. Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994 multinationals set up maquiladoras at a frenetic pace. Juarez alone is home to plants owned by General Electric Honeywell International Bosch Foxconn Technology Siemens and Electrolux among others.

Years later the region began to stagnate when China entered the World Trade Organization. Many companies pulled out of Mexico and set up shop in China where labor costs were even lower. Flareups of gruesome narco violence along the border only added to the exodus.

China kept stealing U.S. market share from Mexico right up until Donald Trump took office in Washington. When he started slapping tariffs on Chinese-made products Mexico suddenly looked pretty attractive again to executives. Then the pandemic came along and turbocharged the shift. Keeson the furniture maker is Exhibit A for this: It first made plans to open a factory in Juarez shortly after Trump launched his trade war against Beijing and it sped up those plans by a full year when Covid hit.

""Manufacturing is coming back for sure"" says Jason Tolliver a managing director who helps oversee logistics and industrial services in the Americas for real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield PLC. The conversations he's having with corporate leaders he says indicate this wave of investment along the border is just beginning. ""It is structural and it's long term.""

The boom is so intense in Juarez that industrial real estate is suddenly getting tight: 98% of existing space is already leased and the price has jumped more than 20% over the past year to about $5.25 per square foot according to Jesse Melendez a director at industrial real estate company Intermex.

Intermex is rushing to cash in. It's leasing out 5 million square feet more of factory space in the city today than it did a year ago and it's building four additional factory sites. They will be tightly clustered in what is now just a barren field on the city's southwestern edge.

As excited as Melendez is about the boom he's already mentally preparing for the bust that often follows. ""In my career I've typically seen the valleys and peaks seven to 10 years apart"" he says. He figures the slowdown will begin by 2024.

As Melendez drove through the city on a recent weekday afternoon that seemed like a distant thought. ""Hiring"" signs kept popping up all around him -- on the facades of factories on buses in shop windows.

This is what lured Efrain Gonzalez back to Juarez from his native Veracruz in the south.

People associate Mexican migrants with the U.S. labor market but the truth is many of them like Gonzalez end their journeys just miles south of the border especially when the maquiladoras are humming like they are now.

The factory jobs offer pay that while a fraction of typical U.S. wages is markedly higher than what the migrants can earn back home in the impoverished south of Mexico. And they don't have to worry about getting deported.

Gonzalez 49 earns a little over $80 a week plus benefits like free lunch at the Keeson plant which produces the company's Ergomotion adjustable beds. He said he knew he'd find work as soon as he set foot back in Juarez a few months ago. The sight of all the new factories going up made that clear. ""There's a lot of work here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L3Rlbm5pcy9iZXJuYXJkLXRvbWljLWxvb2tzLWEtY29tcGxldGVseS1kaWZmZXJlbnQtcGVyc29uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYmU2ZTE4MjhiZTNkOTgzZmIzMDliZGU3YjQ0YTUyMWHSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS90ZW5uaXMvYmVybmFyZC10b21pYy1sb29rcy1hLWNvbXBsZXRlbHktZGlmZmVyZW50LXBlcnNvbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2JlNmUxODI4YmUzZDk4M2ZiMzA5YmRlN2I0NGE1MjFh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tomic looks a completely different person,"Bernard Tomic is back on the training court at a private location on the Gold Coast in preparation for his big comeback.

Bernard Tomic looks a completely different person as he rebuilds his career and his body.

The 29-year-old has made headlines this week after making a series of startling confessions about his career.

The revelations have continued to flow with Tomic now speaking openly about transforming his fitness ahead of the 2022 Australian Open beginning January 17.

Speaking to the Gold Coast Bulletin this week Tomic said his promising run at this year’s Australian Open reignited the “fire” inside him and is hoping to crack the top 10 within a few years.

It has prompted a lifestyle overhaul he insists is the real deal this time.

It includes a new commitment to the vegan lifestyle he has used in recent year — and a promise to avoid all alcohol.

“I’ve stopped partying and drinking. I wake up at 6am every morning. I run and do gym workouts and obviously tennis is involved. It’s not easy but I’ve got to do it. Anything to get He has now told The Daily Telegraphhis transformation includes a promise to avoid dating in order to focus on tennis.

“Next time I am in a relationship I want to find real love” he said.

“I want someone who is honest and has my best interest at heart.

“People often only have their best interests at heart.

“I have had a lot of girlfriends in my life and it has been a rollercoaster.”

Earlier this week Tomic opened up on his complex relationships with Lleyton Hewitt Nick Kyrgios his father John and ex-girlfriend Vanessa Sierra.

The former world No. 17’s on-again off-again romance with former reality TV contestant Sierra included his appearance in sexually-suggestive photos on her Instagram page and adult-content site.

His relationship with Sierra was one of the first things Tomic addressed on Tuesday during a Q+A with fans on his Instagram stories.

“I mean guys how many questions about her? Do you really want to know? I didn’t realise she was that interesting” he said.

When asked about his time on an adult content site with Sierra Tomic responded by posting a photo of him burying his face in his hand.

“BIGGEST. REGRET. OF. MY. LIFE” he wrote on the picture.

Tomic who burst onto the scene by making the quarterfinals of Wimbledon as a fresh-faced 18-year-old says he is serious about his comeback

He is now ranked 254th in the world and played his last match in Kazakhstan in September which he lost due to retirement.

He is recovering from a finger ligament injury and has given himself a five-week preparation to regain his top form and be ready to contest qualifying for the Australian Open in January.

As part of his recent soul-searching Kyrgios has also admitted he wants to patch up his relationship with Aussie tennis legend and current Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt.

Tomic in 2019 accused Hewitt of favouring certain players in his Davis Cup selections as their prickly relationship exploded with a series of heated public swipes during the 2019 Australian Open.

Hewitt responded to Tomic’s claims by saying Tomic had made “physical” threats against his family.

Tomic responded at the time by calling Hewitt a “liar”.

Tomic has not played Davis Cup since.

The Gold Coast-based player now says he is ready to mend their rift.

“Would like to patch things up. He’s done a lot for the sport” Tomic responded to a question about Hewitt.

Tomic has bleached his normally dark hair posting footage of himself at the barber with the caption: “New start. New cut”.

He also says he is hungry and has a goal of reaching top the top 10 on the ATP Tour rankings within a few years.

Members-only



There’s no denying that the sneaker industry is fuelled by hype and let’s be honest we’ve all bought a pair of shoes because of what they are. But before the millennial generation’s love for all things collaborative was an era of true sneakerheads people who were more inspired by the community and its stories than the shoe’s resale price.

For sneakerheads like Emeric Tchatchoua hype isn’t important. Tchatchoua holds onto the origins of what made sneakerhead communities such a haven for kids looking for a purpose: a combination of meaning and messaging. Back in the 1990s and early 2000s shoes weren’t just collected they were admired.

This very same attitude towards shoes acknowledging and appreciating the message behind the design is what inspires Tchatchoua in both his life and his work. As the founder and creative director of 3.PARADIS his work is in his own words a way “to make the world a better place.” It stemmed from visiting creative hubs such as colette in Paris buying sneakers and becoming a member of sneaker communities as a kid.

But above anything else comes his love for the Nike Air Force 1 specifically the colette x Busy P collaboration from Nike’s 2008 1WORLD collection. It spawned an understanding of knowing how to have fun and an appreciation for authenticity two things that dictate Tchatchoua’s life and this week’s installment of Sole Mates.

HYPEBEAST: How did you get into the fashion industry?

Emeric Tchatchoua: When I was 17 I came across Japanese fashion [on the Internet]; there was a photo of Pharrell Williams and Mariah Carey outside of a hotel in Paris and Pharrell was wearing BAPE and I was like “What the hell is this?” You know he had the BBC pants from his first “Running Dog” collection I just thought it was crazy.

I started to like fashion and I came across UNDERCOVER Takashi Murakami NEIGHBORHOOD MASTERMIND JAPAN Hiroshi Fujiwara’s fragment design all those golden-era Japanese brands. The first time I could really understand and relate to a language was with Japanese design it opened my mind to culture art and everything.

I was into sneakers because I used to play basketball. When you’re a basketball player and you’re on the court at the beginning everyone is looking at your shoes. [If you’ve got] serious shoes it meant you were a serious basketball player. That’s how I got into it but after that when I was 17 I started to collect sneakers. I had over 150 pairs of sneakers I was a real sneakerhead and that was because of that Japanese culture — I was in NikeTalk BAPETalk and I was meeting people all over the world.

It was enjoyable and I had lots of fun with this community — we had people from the U.K and New York Canada Paris all over the world and these people I’m still really good friends with because of these forums we were in.

Obviously you were a big sneakerhead but what was it about shoes that fascinated you as a kid?

It started with basketball shoes — Jordans Uptempos Barkleys — but I think the fact that shoes are a canvas and that you can put your ideas on it. I was collecting toys Be@rbricks so I felt like it’s the same world the same aesthetic.

I love the design aspect of shoes it was something I was really interested in — my fashion career started because of shoes and being a sneakerhead. Shoes did a lot for me. When I look at someone’s style shoes were the most important aspect.

Was there a pivotal moment for you in your sneaker love story?

[Me and my friends] were heavy shoppers we used to shop a lot and buy sneakers. It was around the time Riccardo Tisci was at Givenchy. We were at the Louvre and looking at all the beautiful art and it [inspired] an urge to create. We were shopping so much that I realized “What if I could do the shoes like this or the jacket like that?”

I remember I was talking to my boys and I was like “Let’s just do a sweater.” We did a sweater and it trickled down to a clothing line.

A lot of people especially our Sole Mates participants love and have chosen the Air Force 1. What does the shoe mean to you?

My big brother used to play basketball as well and he’d play in the AF1. White AF1s a 3D iridescent metal-like Swoosh — I loved these shoes and at the time I really wanted them. We lived in a working-class neighborhood and we couldn’t afford them but my brother bought himself a new pair to play in so I took his old pair. They were my first basketball shoes and I cherished them because they meant so much to me.

Since that day I have loved the AF1. I used to sleep at night and gaze at them on the shelf; every time after a game I’d put it right back on the shelf. There is a very very deep relationship between me and that shoe that stems from my brother.

You’ve decided to spotlight an incredibly rare and relatively unspoken-of pair: the colette x Busy P x Nike Air Force 1 that came as part of 2008’s 1WORLD collection. Why?

I got them at colette a friend of mine got them [on my behalf] as I wasn’t in Paris at the time I was in Canada.

But colette represents so much for me. As a kid it was a place for me to escape it was a dream or a kid going to Disneyland. It was an amazing feeling of escaping from the harsh realities. But I could never buy anything — maybe just the small things they had at the counter — so at the time if I could afford to buy something and the shoes were available [I’d buy them] but keep them in good condition. I like shoes but these… I hold them like a trophy. I could never afford anything from colette but these were my first purchase from there it was a dream to me.

Recently I met the people behind this shoe like Busy P and his people and I was wearing the shoe when I met them. It was a good moment.

1 of 2 2 of 2

So was this your first shoe that really got you hooked on buying sneakers?

No the first “sneaker” that I actually had was a pair of BAPESTAs. I traded a pair of Jordan 6 OGs that were my sisters and she never wore them because she didn’t do so much basketball and then got the BAPESTA. From there it spiralled.

What particularly stands out about the colette pair?

I like the playfulness of it the sole and the fact it’s a rainbow. I like the message of unity behind it and if I’m not mistaken Pharrell was involved here too — he’s one of my all-time favorites.

I like these because they’re unique — the rainbow the sole is covered in fabric and the idea of colors and messaging it’s my favorite shoe.

colette had many massive moments in its lifetime do you have any notable memories with colette?

I used to go there and see people that I admired: athletes musicians. It was weird for me to see those people but that’s also why I loved going there a place where you can meet your heroes. It’s more of an idea of colette rather than a specific moment. Seeing the window changing it was always new and fresh there was always something today that wasn’t there yesterday the energy was amazing the smell is still in my mind.

Do you think these memories and the shoe inspire you?

Of course! When I talk about 3.PARADIS it’s a brand that to me brings you back to your childhood without being childish. That playfulness is there: I’m not talking to the adult but to the kid that’s within the adult.

This is the idea of what we do; there’s a reference to childhood moments and every collection has the purity of a child. The same thing is going on with the shoes and colette was like that to me.

Would you ever do a 3.PARADIS sneaker collaboration?

Definitely why not? We would start when the time’s right when we feel like we have something to say. We don’t just want to collaborate with a sportswear brand because everyone’s doing it — we’ve had offers before that we’ve declined because we want to collaborate when it makes sense for us. If we have nothing to say about a shoe at that moment we’re not going to do it.

We’re working right now on a project with a sports team just so we can give back. This is something that’s meaningful for us and this might be a way that we could collaborate with a sportswear brand.

There are too many collaborations today and there’s not a lot of meaning so to do it there needs to be a deeper meaning something real that touches people so they can emulate what we do and do the same for others when they find their passion.

What excites you today?

The power of fashion to translate a message and an idea. It’s a power that we don’t realize yet. Fashion can be a factor of change through fashion I’m able to speak about subjects and make the world a better place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2Uta2QtMy1hbGwtc3Rhci00NDg2OTUtMDAxLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike KD 3 All-Star 448695-001 Release Date - SBD,"The Nike KD 3 “All-Star” was released in February 2011 which was worn by Kevin Durant during the 2011 NBA All-Star Game.

As part of the ongoing 75th Anniversary celebration of the NBA Nike has introduced the “Embedded” series of footwear that features its classic icons (Dunks Air Force 1s Blazers) in NBA-themed colorways. We’ve see the colors of the Lakers Nets and Knicks get transformed into those respective silhouettes while other larger league-centric concepts like the Blazer Mid ’77 are created to give props to the NBA and WNBA as a whole.

These golden lace-locks of the WNBA and NBA logo silhouettes might look familiar to you because these were first seen on an Air Force 1 Low we showed you back in October. They’re returning once more on this Blazer covered in basketball-textured leather in red orange yellow and blue. The Swoosh colors also alternate perhaps nodding to the original franchises of the NBA.

It is likely that these EMB drops will be available sometime around All-Star Weekend in February 2022 as part of a larger collection of tributary footwear/apparel for the milestone.

On Thursday morning a semi-trailer out of Canada that was making a local pickup in Ironton got stuck on the train tracks.

Ironton Fire Department Captain Jeff Joseph said a call came in around 9:30 a.m. about the truck being stuck on the tracks on Pine Street.

“The driver was able to get it off himself” he said.

The driver used a couple of large pieces of rubber to get traction with the truck’s rear wheels and adjusted the hydraulic shocks on the trailer to get enough height so he was able to back off the train track and was rerouted to a different crossing.

A crew from Norfolk Southern Railway was also called to the scene. An approaching train was told about the situation and slowed down until given the all-clear to proceed. The train came through just after 10 a.m. about four minutes after the truck left.

Joseph said a truck getting stuck on the railway doesn’t happen often.

“You might have that happen once every three or four years” he said. “Somebody will pull up on it and misjudge it generally it happens when they have the trailer set too low for this steep grade.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvcmVjYWxsLWFsZXJ0LW1hcmdoZXJpdGEtcGVwcGVyb25pLXJlY2FsbGVkLW92ZXItcG9zc2libGUtYmFjdGVyaWFsLWNvbnRhbWluYXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV9kMTM1OTk2My04Mjk5LTVjOWQtYjQ0My0zZTkzYTAxZWE3MTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recall alert: Margherita Pepperoni recalled over possible bacterial contamination,"Memphis TN (38111)

Who tells your story?

That musical played to packed houses in Southwest Florida barely a month before the first storm clouds of COVID-19 rolled in. And as the unthinkable happened to friends and family during the year of pandemic the reality of death made people ask themselves a similar question:

Who will tell my story?

For Naples-based memoir writer Mary Jane Robinson that same question came as a growing flood of inquiries. One potential client laid it bare in the contact form with a single sentence:

I want to tell my story.

This has been a laser-focus year for Robinson whose work re-creating other people's lives in their own voices has jumped by roughly 40 percent. An article on her memoir writing business even surfaced in a Naples Daily News reporter's top 10 most read stories despite the fact it had been published more than four years ago.

Artitude:Ghost writer serves as an articulate avatar

""Because of COVID people thought 'I've got to get my story told'"" Robinson acknowledged. She is working on several books now and has interviewing done for several more ""so those people know their words are ready to be written but they don't feel the need to have it done right now.""

The pandemic has created an urgency she said. The simple request to tell his story came from a man in his early 60s who had watched two healthy friends contract the virus and go rapidly downhill. They were hospitalized and eventually put on ventilators. Unsuccessfully.

""'For the first time in my life' he told me 'I realized you can go without warning. You don't know who's going to sneeze on you and it might be your time.'""

A life story serves many purposes

A primary question in beginning any autobiography is ""why"" Robinson said. ""Why is it people want to leave their stories behind? Who is your audience in this effort?""

The common answer is: I want to leave it for my family so they know where we came from how we happen to be where we are and why.

She has spoken on that value by invitation at Northern Trust estate planning events.

""They saw the point that these clients spend thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars planning for death and estates and taxes"" she explained.

""And they leave fortunes to families who may not know who was the wealth creator or the founder of the company who may have been sitting on a street corner selling apples for a nickel but built a company went to war came back and built it some more.

""By the third generation the kids are getting a Porsche Cayenne for graduation and they have no idea of the money that went into it and how the person had the idea in the first place to start a manufacturing business.""

Telling his story:Naples man writes about his 9/11 experience

Robinson wants their descendants to come away with more than chronology.

""I'm always trying to push in my interviewing questioning that will bring out the person's values beliefs ethics the golden nuggets of wisdom they've learned as they've connected the dots in their lives.

""There's a chance for us to leave something behind in terms of legacy to pass on that personal wisdom.""

Posterity is not the only validation for a life story. Robinson recalled a client interrupting her during the interview saying ""Why am I doing this? Who really cares?""

""I say to people now first it's for you. It's its own reward"" she said. ""Try to see it as a process that is its own reward. Do it for yourself.""

An autobiography can becomes a mile marker a point from which to assess things they yet want to do or want to change. It can be the celebration of a life they had not allowed themselves before. Robinson has seen both.

For others memoirs can connect our historical dots telling us why we are what we are.

""We are so distracted and busy living our lives that we don't take time to figure out why we make some of the decisions we make"" she said.

People ""begin to understand by telling it and seeing it in print"" she said.

Local author:Naples writer pens children's Christmas book

She recalled the words of a client: ""I never went into this project thinking it was going to help me. I went into it because the kids have been saying 'Dad you've got to tell your story.'""

Putting together his autobiography ""made him understand some things. One of them without giving away too much was growing up with a troubled father in the home never understanding the father's behavior toward him seeing how that influenced him as a boy and a father himself.""

Experience was her calling card

Robinson has made a career of taking on the minds of other people to create their autobiographies or memoirs. Her first subjects may have been her hardest: Aging World War II veterans whose spouses or children were pushing them to put their stories in writing

""Most of our veterans come home with silence on their lips. There's a terseness that war teaches"" she reflected.

To persuade them they would be working with someone familiar with pain she shares some of her own life story on her website (maryjanerobinson.com): At age 33 Robinson lost her husband in horrible snowstorm accident when a snow plow hit his car head-on.

It was Christmas Eve. Gifts for their two young sons were in the trunk wrapped.

""My father had to go retrieve them"" she said.

From that horrible experience came a determination to help others tell their life stories while they could. And since then Robinson has quietly written the lives of Emmy-winning actors the families behind charity foundations CEOs of Fortune 500 companies U.S. Cabinet members a member of the Gambino crime family — and her mother's. Her mother later slipped into the forgetful state of Alzheimer's disease and only knew her past by rereading her own autobiography.

Everyone has a story

""I call myself a memoir writer now because that's what people are (familiar with)"" Robinson said. ""I'm a memoirist. Or a ghostwriter.""

Memoirs and autobiographies are trains on parallel not identical tracks she continued.

""An autobiography is more a comprehensive full life story told chronologically but as interestingly as possible without reading like a litany of events"" she explained.

""A memoir can be more individual stories within a book. You could have a 30-chapter book and it doesn't have to flow from one chapter to another. It can be just individual slices of life highlights of life primary memories.""

She writes both: ""If you have the right interviewer — and the book is only going to be as good as the interviewer — your story just pours out of you.""

People can certainly write their own. ""But it makes a major difference when someone is listening"" she observed. Further good memoirists check facts: What year did they actually graduate? Was the Vietnam War still going on when they wed?

There's a common denominator of her subjects: No one feels their story justifies a book.

""I find everyone from a woman who was raising eight children in Appalachia and thought she had nothing to tell to somebody who was the chairman of a Fortune 500 company — everyone — starts with an apology. 'Mary Jane I don't know that you're going to find this all that interesting.'""

But as a writer Mary Jane Robinson knows better. Everyone has a story. She recalls one of her favorite projects a woman whose son paid for and insisted she write her autobiography.

""She was very reluctant to begin very reticent very apologetic. Her posture was almost slumped as she was trying to apologize for her life and excuse her son for thinking she had anything to tell"" she recalled.

Wrap it up: Art nature centers have creative gifts for you

Usually Robinson said she ends each interview after two hours to give the subjects and herself time to recharge.

""But at the end of the two hours she wanted to keep going. I thought OK she's on a roll"" Robinson recalled.

""She kept talking and talking as she started to lose her embarrassment about the fuss she thought was being made about her life story. At the end of the third hour she sat erect in her chair leaned forward and said 'I was some kind of woman wasn't I?'""

""When I arrived the next day she was in a different chair sitting erect. And she had bright red lipstick on.

""I will never forget that woman. It was the reward of my career.""

And now she has dedicated a beautiful piece called 'per sempre' meaning 'for always' to be sold in a very special auction one dedicated to helping a Northern Ireland pet charity close to her heart.

Her framed charcoal sketch is raising funds for Rosie's Trust a charity which steps in to help people and their pets together in some of the most challenging circumstances.

Rosie's Trust is a unique NI charity helping terminally ill patients undergoing cancer treatment older people with a disability and their pets. Their mission is to preserve and protect the special relationship between people and their companion pets.

Anne 59 from Millisle but now living in Sussex said: ""My sister Laureen was given incredible help by Rosie's Trust who not only ensured her rescue dogs where looked after then fostered and finally rehomed after she become gravely ill. In the days before Laureen passed away her only real concern was not for herself but her dogs the little beings she had rescued and who kept her life worth living.

""And even though Laureen was in an out of consciousness towards the end I know she had comfort in the knowledge her precious dogs would be loved and looked after and this would not have been feasible without the compassion of Rosie's Trust and the remarkable lengths they went while Laureen was alive and even after she died. They kept in touch with me and made sure I had videos of the dogs in their new homes.

""I have no real way to say thank you there is no real thank you that could match how I feel about what they did for Laureen and the dogs. So I thought I would try to help fund raise because they are solely funding by public donations.

""So I set about trying to capture what I felt about them and I think what I have captured is peace. The peace of knowing your dogs are safe and will be very well looked after and loved. The person in the piece could be Laureen sitting calmly as her dogs bound about the woods but it could be anyone waiting for their dogs to enjoy their sniffs.

""It is a peaceful piece of art because that's what Rosie's trust gave my sister and that's what they have given me.

""I am auctioning it to the highest bidder and to date the highest bid is £3200 which I am delighted with. But there's still time to bid and anyone who is interested can email me at studio@annemagill. Every penny of the winning bid will go directly to Rosie's Trust.""

The charity helps and supports in all aspects of pet care so the owner and the pet can stay together for as long as possible. Volunteers make daily visits and fosterers are look after animal when a beneficiary needs to go into hospital or hospice care and the charity also ensures beloved pet finds a wonderful forever home if the need arises.

Young men in states across Nigeria’s northern region are migrating to other states in search of greener pastures. The economic hardship in the country coupled with lack of jobs insecurity and low business income is forcing these men to leave their families in the villages and migrate to other states in search of a better life.

Our correspondent reports that in Niger State the recent ban on commercial motorcycles in Minna the state capital has further pushed many youths to go as far as Kogi Lagos and Zuba in the Federal Capital Territory for motorcycle business.

Daily Trust Saturday gathered that the scenario has placed more responsibilities on wives who have now taken up the burden of raising and caring for their children alone. Some of the wives our correspondent gathered have gone as far as seeking divorce against men who stay away for too long.

One of the women who spoke to our correspondent in confidence said “Nothing disturbs me more than my husband staying far away from his family. There was a time my son was ill and his condition worsened at night.

“At 12 midnight I didn’t know what to do I lost control and my husband was in Kaduna. Eventually it was a neighbour who assisted in taking us on his motorcycle to the hospital.”

Another housewife whose husband works in Abuja as a taxi driver said “It is not easy being far from my husband especially for my children. The children miss their father.

“I stay in a family house where other women are always with their husbands and sometimes if my daughter sees other children with their fathers she will ask: ‘Mummy where is our daddy?”

Malam Lawali who left his family in Kebbi State to open a provision shop in Minna said he went home to see his two wives once a year especially during the month of Ramadan.

“They complain bitterly but they don’t have a choice because I am out to provide for the family. I call them every day. They want me to always visit them but I won’t be able to do that” he said.

Another husband Mohammed who is currently in Kano in search of a better life for his family said his wife had threatened him with divorce arguing that he could find something good to do at home.

“Eventually she came to understand the situation. However I visit home regularly” he said.

Also Abubakar Mohammed Galbu who hails from Rugar Bade in Bindawa Local Government Area of Katsina State migrated to Kaduna in search of a greener pasture.

With his wife and children left in the village Galbu returns home after every two months to ensure that whatever financial gains he makes is properly utilised.

According to him there are many reasons men leave home in search of greener pastures including poverty lack of employment debt and even family quarrels. He however said the coming of telecommunication made life easier as he is able to communicate with his family even from afar.

“I came to Kaduna to earn a living so as to take care of my family but I never exceed 40 days without returning home. There are some men that left home at a very young age and have not returned home. Some of them have married in the city leaving their wives in the village” he said.

He said sometimes women seek divorce from men who left home for many years.

Similarly Musa Dallaji who claims to return home in Katsina State after every month said that sometimes men who left their homes in search of greener pastures become ashamed to return home especially when they are unable to make the expected financial progress that could change their statuses.

“Majority of such men are based in Lagos Port Harcourt and other states in the South. There are men in my village in Katsina State who migrated to different cities for menial jobs but a majority of them ensure that they return home after a month or two to visit their kids and other family members” he said.

Narrating her experience 43-year-old Mrs Luisy Sunday an indigene of Benue State but resident in Lafia the Nasarawa State capital said she engaged in a local drink business popularly called kunu dawa to help sustain the family since her husband is away in search of a greener pasture.

She said life became challenging after her husband lost his job in 2018 and is now in Benue doing menial jobs. She told our correspondent that she also sold vegetables and other food items to help sustain the family even though her husband sends a monthly stipend of N15000.

“Sometimes he doesn’t even come to see us in Lafia due to the nature of what he is doing to cater for the family. And each time he comes around he always looks worried thinking of how he would survive the economic hardship” she said.

Families must find means of living together – University don

Speaking on the economic hardship that pushes young men to abandon their families in search of greener pastures elsewhere an expert and lecturer in the Federal University Lafia Dr Job Pristine-Magip said the situation was not encouraging.

Pristine-Magip urged spouses to always think outside the box and find different means of survival adding that families are expected to always enjoy quality time together.

He said “There is massive unemployment everywhere so if a wife or husband gets a job in another state you don’t expect him or her to turn it down simply because they want to be together.”

He said most government policies such as high electricity tariffs and lack of transparency in the fuel subsidy regime were the major factors responsible for the breakup of many families in the country.

That’s what real estate companies firms believe as giants like Northrop Grumman Virgin Galactic and Relativity Space have expanded their local footprints. As demands for satellites increase so does the need for warehouses to build them.

“There’s this massive rush for space” said Jason Fine a managing director with commercial real estate firm JLL.

What You Need To Know The aerospace industry has grown in recent years as satellite sales increase



Internet connectivity has been a major driver with the SpaceX Starlink network



Space launch companies like Relativity Space have been buying up real estate to help meet demand



Real estate brokers see continued growth in southern California as the Space Force comes into focus and satellite demand continues

Aerospace companies favor flex space or low-rise office buildings that can accommodate a combination of warehouse and office facilities. Fine said the available occupancy is about 5.3% in the El Segundo area. That means it’s competitive as companies look to southern California for space a traditional stronghold for defense and rocket launch companies.

Coastal cities like El Segundo and Long Beach which both have lengthy histories in the industry have economic development staff and city councils that are familiar with the zoning needs of these companies.

Buildings can even be zoned before companies even inquire about availability quickening the pace at which they can be leased.

“We’ve seen a lot of these new companies backfilling these warehouses left by the old guard” Fine said.

That includes the old C-17 plant in Long Beach which once produced the Boeing cargo plane. That space has since been taken over by Relativity Space one of several recent space launch entrants.

While California companies do have to contend with the rising rental prices – commercial real estate has in some cases doubled – state schools produce an annual crop of engineers ready to work. Rental prices for residential housing have also shot up aerospace companies may just see it as a cost of business.

Competing states like Texas have managed to wrest some jobs from California including some SpaceX additions which were built in the rival state instead.

But it still has advantages.

Southern California is just a short trip to Vandenburg Space Force Base. The state has ports that can offer straightforward transport of rocket engines but other parts of the state have visions of taking some of the high-paying jobs El Segundo already has and wants more of. County city and local officials on the Central Coast have hopes of building out large tracts of space on Vandenburg.

Whether those ambitions materialize or not counties outside southern California understand the value of luring new developments from companies like Northrop Grumman and the big-money jobs they can bring.

According to a recent JLL report 57% percent of 2020 NASA contracts were awarded to 10 companies nine with presences in Los Angeles.

Fine expects the market to stay hot as companies like SpaceX continue regular small satellite launches. That program Starlink launches new satellites out of Cape Canaveral Fla. on an almost monthly basis.

Space Force leaders have regularly advertised interest in faster launch capabilities leading to ongoing investment in rocket companies.

During the great recession industry growth slowed down. In 2017 it saw another dip when companies like Honda relocated. However since then the need for office space over the past four years has risen steadily.

“In aerospace the market is hot. The real estate market is El Segundo is hot but it’s not white-hot. I’d say it’s one of the hotter markets in Los Angeles” Fine said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9qYW1lcy13ZWJiLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVzY29wZS1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1jb25maXJtZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA's James Webb Space Telescope officially set to launch Dec. 24,"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is seen during payload fairing encapsulation ahead of its installation atop its Ariane 5 rocket for a Dec. 24 2021 launch from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou French Guiana.

NASA's newest flagship observatory is about to begin an incredible journey and now has an official launch date.

The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to launch in a week on Dec. 24 at 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT or 9:20 a.m. local time in French Guiana) and has been packed up inside the nose cone of its Ariane 5 rocket for the trip.

""Late yesterday teams at the launch site successfully completed encapsulation of the observatory inside the Ariane 5 rocket that will launch it to space"" NASA officials wrote in an update today (Dec. 18). The news comes as NASA and Arianespace builder of the Ariane 5 worked to fix a data cable issue that delayed the mission from a Dec. 22 launch target.

A final launch readiness review will be held Tuesday (Dec. 21) to make sure the Webb space telescope is ready for launch. If so its Ariane 5 rocket will roll out to the launch pad at the Guiana Space Center in Kourou French Guiana on Wednesday.

Live Updates: NASA's James Webb Space Telescope launch

Agency officials are framing Webb as a successor to the venerable Hubble Space Telescope which means Webb has a big mandate to fill. Hubble's topline science includes showing the universe is accelerating in its expansion finding new moons around Pluto and helping to construct 3-D maps of dark matter.

With the $9.8 billion Webb ready to pick up the baton after years of developmental delays scientists expect the telescope will push even further back in time. The telescope will journey to an isolated spot about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth known as a Lagrange point a gravitationally stable spot between two celestial bodies.

There far from light interference from Earth Webb will turn its attention to the early universe to exoplanet atmospheres and other science using a fold-out telescope almost 22 feet (21.6 meters) across roughly three times the aperture of the 1990s-era Hubble (8 feet or 2.4 meters). With more aperture available Webb will gather more light and more detail on celestial destinations.

Webb has overcome numerous technical challenges budgetary inflations and threats of cancellation over its complex development — including a last-minute unexpected release of a clamp band that pushed the launch by a few more days.

The Atlantic notes the original project scope called for Webb to fly in 2007 with a budget of $500 million (roughly $667 million in 2021 dollars) but technology advances and unforeseen difficulties contributed to delays. (The pandemic also hurt the schedule in 2020.)

This means Webb's budgetary trajectory also followed in the footsteps of Hubble which launched over-budget and later than expected. Hubble is also famous for accidentally going to space with a flawed mirror which required a crew of astronauts to repair. Webb will be too far for such help but NASA has said prime contractor Northrop Grumman tested all systems thoroughly ahead of launch.

The naming of the Webb telescope has also been criticized reports indicate. The moniker is meant to honor James Webb NASA's second-ever administrator who led the agency from 1961 to 1968 while it was preparing for human landing missions. Critics of the administrator claim that he was complicit in discrimination against gay and lesbian NASA employees during his tenure including incidents such as the 1963 ""immoral conduct"" firing of Clifford Norton.

But with the generational observatory finally on the eve of launch NASA is hoping all the effort will be worth it. ""It will explore every phase of cosmic history – from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe and everything in between"" the agency said in a November blog post about the mission. ""Webb will reveal new and unexpected discoveries and help humanity understand the origins of the universe and our place in it.""

Once completed and delivered Triton’s powerful payload and endurance will provide the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) with the ability to detect and analyse threats that were previously undetectable.

“This production milestone further demonstrates our commitment to both sides of the cooperative program between the Royal Australian Air Force and the U.S. Navy” said Rho Cauley-Bruner Triton program manager Northrop Grumman. “We are on schedule to deliver Triton’s powerful capability in support of Australia’s national security.”

Australia’s first Triton is on track to be delivered just as the U.S. Navy expects to achieve initial operating capability with their multi-intelligence Tritons the same configuration Australia is receiving. The identical capabilities will allow the RAAF and U.S. Navy to share data and maintain an unblinking autonomous intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and targeting capability over some of the world’s most critical maritime regions.

“The Air Force is pleased with the continuing progress of our first Triton and the ongoing strong relationships we enjoy within the Cooperative Program with the U.S. Navy and with the manufacturer of the Triton Northrop Grumman Corporation” said Group Captain Jason Lind Director Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare Air Force Headquarters. “I am looking forward to seeing our first Triton roll off the production line and then commence flying in Australian skies in 2024. This capability will extend Australia’s ability to see and understand our maritime approaches to the north and also as far south as Antarctica.”

“This important milestone highlights the successful partnership between our two great nations and reflects the collaborative work between industry and government in delivering this strategic capability to our Australian Mates” said U.S. Navy Capt. Josh Guerre Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Manager.

Northrop Grumman’s family of autonomous high-altitude long-endurance systems perform critical wide-area ISR collection. Today autonomous HALE systems operate across the globe with greater than 24-hour endurance collecting essential ISR data over land and sea to enable rapid informed decision-making. In the future these systems will connect the joint force implementing advanced autonomy and artificial intelligence/machine learning while delivering indispensable capabilities with fewer people to provide information at the speed of relevance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9uYXNhcy13ZWJiLXRlbGVzY29wZS10aGUtbGFyZ2VzdC1zcGFjZS1vYnNlcnZhdG9yeS1pbi1oaXN0b3J5LXdpbGwtaGF2ZS10aGUtY29vbGVzdC1jYW1lcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA's Webb Telescope – The Largest Space Observatory in History – Will Have the Coolest Camera,"Before the MIRI instrument – one of four scientific instruments aboard the observatory – can operate it has to be cooled down to almost the coldest temperature matter can reach.

Set to launch on December 24 NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is the largest space observatory in history and it has an equally gargantuan task: to collect infrared light from the distant corners of the cosmos enabling scientists to probe the structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

Many cosmic objects – including stars and planets as well as the gas and dust from where they form – emit infrared light sometimes called heat radiation. But so do most other warm objects like toasters humans and electronics. That means Webb’s four infrared instruments can detect their own infrared glow. To reduce those emissions the instruments have to be really cold – about 40 kelvins or minus 388 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 233 degrees Celsius). But to operate properly the detectors inside the mid-infrared instrument or MIRI will have to get even colder: less than 7 kelvins (minus 448 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 266 degrees Celsius).

That’s just a few degrees above absolute zero (0 kelvins) – the coldest temperature theoretically possible though it’s never physically attainable because it represents the total absence of any heat. (MIRI is not however the coldest imaging instrument ever to operate in space.)

Temperature is essentially a measurement of how fast atoms are moving and in addition to detecting their own infrared light the Webb detectors can be triggered by their own thermal vibrations. MIRI detects light in a lower-energy range than the other three instruments. As a result its detectors are even more sensitive to thermal vibrations. These unwanted signals are what astronomers refer to as “noise” and they can overwhelm the faint signals that Webb is trying to detect.

After launch Webb will unfold a tennis-court-size sunshield that will block MIRI and the other instruments from the Sun’s heat allowing them to cool passively. Beginning about 77 days after launch MIRI’s cryocooler will spend 19 days lowering the temperature of the instrument’s detectors to less than 7 kelvins.

“It’s relatively easy to cool something down to that temperature on Earth typically for scientific or industrial applications” said Konstantin Penanen a cryocooler specialist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California which manages the MIRI instrument for NASA. “But those Earth-based systems are very bulky and energy inefficient. For a space observatory we need a cooler that is physically compact highly energy efficient and it has to be highly reliable because we can’t go out and repair it. So those are the challenges we faced and in that respect I would say the MIRI cryocooler is certainly at the cutting edge.”

One of Webb’s big science goals will be to study the properties of the first generation of stars to form in the universe. Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera or NIRCam instrument will be able to detect these extremely distant objects and MIRI will help scientists confirm that these faint sources of light are clusters of first-generation stars rather than second-generation stars that form later as a galaxy evolves.

By peering through even thicker clouds of dust than the near-infrared instruments MIRI will reveal the birthplaces of stars. It will also detect molecules that are common on Earth – like water carbon dioxide and methane and those of rocky minerals like silicates – in cool environments around nearby stars where planets may form. Near-infrared instruments are better at detecting these molecules as vapor in much hotter environments while MIRI can see them as ices.

“By combining expertise from both the United States and Europe we have developed MIRI as a powerful capability for Webb that will enable astronomers from all over the world to answer big questions about how stars planets and galaxies form and evolve” said Gillian Wright co-lead of the MIRI science team and the instrument’s European principal investigator at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC).

The Big Chill

The MIRI cryocooler uses helium gas – enough to fill about nine party balloons – to carry heat away from the instrument’s detectors. Two electrically powered compressors pump the helium through a tube that extends to where the detectors are located. The tube runs through a block of metal that is also attached to the detectors; the cooled helium absorbs excess heat from the metal block which in turn keeps the detectors at their operational temperature below 7 kelvins. The warmed (but still quite cold) gas then returns to the compressors where it dumps the excess heat and the cycle begins again. Fundamentally the system is similar to those used in home refrigerators and air conditioners.

The tubing that carries the helium is made of gold-coated stainless steel and measures less than one-tenth of an inch (2.5 millimeters) in diameter. It extends about 30 feet (10 meters) from the compressors located in a region called the spacecraft bus to MIRI’s detectors located in the Optical Telescope Element behind the observatory’s honeycomb-shaped primary mirror. Hardware called the Deployable Tower Assembly or DTA connects these two regions. When packed for launch the DTA is compressed sort of like a piston to help fit the stowed observatory into the protective faring that rides atop the rocket. Once in space the tower will extend to separate the room-temperature spacecraft bus from the much colder Optical Telescope Instrument and to allow the sunshield and telescope to fully deploy.



But the elongation process requires the helium tubing to extend along with the Deployable Tower Assembly. So the tube is coiled like a spring which is why MIRI engineers nicknamed this portion of the tube the “Slinky.”

“There were a couple of challenges working on a system that spans multiple regions of the observatory” said Analyn Schneider MIRI’s project manager at JPL. “Those different regions are led by different organizations or centers including Northrop Grumman and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and we had to interface with everybody. There’s no other hardware on the telescope that requires that so that was a challenge unique to MIRI. It’s definitely been a long road for the MIRI cryocooler and we’re ready to see it perform in space.”

More About the Mission

The James Webb Space Telescope will be the world’s premier space science observatory when it launches in 2021. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system look beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.

MIRI was developed through a 50-50 partnership between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). JPL leads the U.S. efforts for MIRI and a multi-national consortium of European astronomical institutes contributes for ESA. George Rieke with the University of Arizona is the MIRI US science team lead. Gillian Wright is MIRI European science team lead.

Alistair Glasse with UK ATC is the MIRI instrument scientist and Michael Ressler is the U.S. project scientist at JPL. Laszlo Tamas with UK ATC manages the European Consortium.

“India is situated in a tough neighborhood. If confirmed I intend to double-down on our efforts to strengthen India’s capacity to secure its borders defend its sovereignty and deter aggression” Garcetti who has served as mayor of Los Angeles since 2013 told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

These comments come as India remains battered with militancy and cross-border terrorism in its Jammu and Kashmir region along its Western border where Indian security forces have been fighting both Pakistani state and non-state actors for several decades.

#WATCH | India is situated in a tough neighborhood.If confirmed I intend to double-down on our efforts to strengthen India’s capacity to secure its borders and deter aggression through counterterrorism coordination: Eric Garcetti on his nomination as US Envoy to India pic.twitter.com/JqfFDoE6iV — ANI (@ANI) December 15 2021

India and Pakistan have long been at odds over Jammu and Kashmir. Clashes along the Line of Control the facto border between the two nations have been reported on a regular basis but tensions escalated in August of 2019 when New Delhi revoked the special autonomous status of the state and divided it into two territories under direct central control.

India controls the southern part of the Kashmir region while Pakistan and China occupy its northwestern and northeastern parts respectively.

Additionally India has been involved in a conflict with China along the LAC in its northern sector. The dispute with the Chinese PLA has now entered its second winter with no signs of abating as the talks between the two sides remain inconclusive.

The bonhomie between China and Pakistan and the former’s attempt at arming the Pakistani military with advanced weaponry poses a significant risk to India’s security and presents the challenge of a two-front war.

Garcetti said the aggression should be battled through information sharing counterterrorism coordination joint freedom of navigation patrols and military exercises as well as through “sales of our best defense technologies in order to realize the full potential of our major defense partnership”.

India’s defense cooperation with the United States has grown significantly since 2016. The two partners have signed the four foundational agreements that bolstered their military cooperation. India has also procured American weapon systems to combat the threats it faces against its two traditional adversaries. More deals are in the pipeline.

Garcetti’s call for selling the “best” defense technology seems to be an attempt to arm India against an aggressive China. This announcement is even more significant because US lawmakers remain divided as they staunchly debate whether India should get a waiver from sanctions under the CAATSA for buying the Russian S-400s the delivery of which has reportedly begun.

“I believe it is one of the great success stories of the last few decades” he told legislators “from $0 to $20 billion in procurement information sharing interoperability exercises and maritime work that we’re doing.”

The new ambassador is expected to enhance the defense partnerships. Here’s a look at what all India could ideally like to procure from the US so as to deter China as well as Pakistan.

Using The ‘Defense Sale’ Route

The United States has become one of India’s top arms suppliers supplying $22 billion worth of aircraft helicopters and missiles (Rs 1.4 lakh crore). Deals totaling about $10 billion (Rs 73825 crore) are being negotiated or are nearing completion.

The P-8I Poseidon long-range maritime patrol aircraft and the C-130J transport aircraft are expected to get repeat orders and dedicated support respectively showing a high degree of customer satisfaction. There are several ground-breaking deals too such as the $3 billion order for 30 MQ-9 Predator-B drones (Rs 22147 crore).

SIPRI ranked India as the world’s second-largest importer of significant conventional weapons from 2016 to 2020 accounting for 9.5 percent of worldwide imports.

From 2011 to 2015 the United States was India’s second-largest arms exporter but in 2016–2020 it provided nearly half as many weapons to New Delhi.

In recent times the purchases from the US have proved to be one of the many decisive factors behind India holding its ground in the LAC dispute. Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and Apaches that were purchased from America in 2018 were extensively deployed to the Ladakh sector.

Transport aircraft C-130J Super Hercules that was also earlier purchased from the Americans has been instrumental in carrying men and material to the LAC where deployment has only seen thickening in recent times.

5 Weapon Systems India Could Buy From US

One of the most significant purchases that India could make from the United States is a fifth-generation advanced stealth fighter the F-35. This becomes even more pertinent as China has been aggressively showcasing its own stealthy J-20 fighter jets which were reportedly deployed near LAC last year.

The United States has been pitching its F-35 to countries that were not initially part of the original consortium. The foreign military sale could be used to supply India with the F-35s if it were to show interest.

Earlier the Indian Air Force (IAF) had published a Request for Information (RFI) in April 2019 to procure 114 jets at a cost of $18 billion. The contract was billed as one of the largest military procurement programs in the world.

There were rumors that the United States wanted to sell its fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets to India for both the Air Force and the Navy and it quickly became a hot issue among military analysts as previously reported by EurAsian Times.

The fact that India has so far not shown interest in these mighty stealth fighters that have become popular among a host of European countries is the cost that India might have to incur.

With the French Rafale fleet in its arsenal and its own ambitious AMCA program in the works it has excused itself from any potential purchase of the F-35s for now. The US has also not pitched them to India and instead offered F-21 fighters.

Another area of defense collaboration between the two strategic partners could be on equipping the Indian Navy with nuclear-powered submarines on the lines of AUKUS an alliance from which India was carefully excluded despite its crucial role in the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Indian Navy chiefs and veterans have raised the possibility of Indo-US collaboration on nuclear reactor propulsion technology but their American counterparts have politely declined. This has been seen as a rebuff by India’s military community.

India already has nuclear submarines having commissioned the INS Arihant in 2016 making it the sixth country in the world to do so. The Arihant however is an SSBN (nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine) a slow-moving ‘bomber’ and a stealthy nuclear-weapons launch platform. The Arihant is part of the Strategic Forces Command which is also building three more SSBNs.

The navy wants SSNs or nuclear-powered attack submarines which can conduct a variety of tactical roles including escorting SSBNs accompanying carrier battle groups and chasing down enemy warships.

The United States could step in here and provide India with the requisite submarines as it tries to assume the role of a net-security provider in the Indo-Pacific. This deal if it was to be considered would send a clear message to their common enemy and create meaningful deterrence in the region.

Also with France having offered its Barracuda nuclear submarines to India it could be a missed opportunity for the US if India was to accept and even more so after a disgruntled France scored a point against American with the UAE Rafale deal.

One area where the defense sale contract is expected to finally take off between the US and India is on armed drones. After a period of doubts and hesitation India is finally set to purchase the American MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States after the proposal is cleared by the Defense Acquisition Council.

Currently Indian armed forces operate two MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones leased from the US with 30 more to be ordered to arm its three services with 10 each.

The MQ-9 Reaper also called Predator-B would be an important addition to India’s arsenal for its intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance (IRS) efforts — on the ground and over the seas. The Reapers are long-endurance and high-altitude armed drones that would boost India’s capability by assisting its fighter fleet. It can also effectively destroy enemy targets.

India would ideally also want to procure Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) systems from the US. It is reportedly working on building this technology that China already possesses.

There could be a potential collaboration in the way that the United States could provide technology support and assistance to the Indian Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) which is pursuing the project reportedly called the ADITYA project.

Two of India’s state-run defense laboratories — the Centre for High Energy Systems (CHESS) and the Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC) — are in the process of eventually incorporating the expanding private sector in the R&D efforts in order to make existing fledgling DEW capability operational in a short period of time. This is where collaboration with the US could become a very real possibility.

DEWs are crucial for India’s security environment particularly given the country’s strained relations with China and Pakistan. It’s also worth noting that China is frantically developing several types of DEWs including laser weapons.

China is said to have tested a tactical laser system that looks very similar to the US Navy’s Laser Weapon Systems (LaWS) which is an anti-surface anti-air defensive weapon system.

It is said to be developing airborne laser pods that might be fitted on PLA aircraft such as the J-15 and J-20 and used to shoot down air-to-air missiles blind enemy pilots within optical range or even destroy larger fighter jets or ballistic missiles. This makes India’s urgency to deploy its own DEW laser system pertinent.

Even though India might not urgently require them but China’s possession of stealth bombers could eventually give rise to an intent to purchase the sophisticated technology from the United States.

India military experts have previously shown some interest in procuring a strategic bomber primarily for maritime strike missions and was even considered a potential buyer for the Russian Tu-22M medium-weight bomber for operations in the Indian Ocean region.

It also flew the Tu-142 anti-submarine warfare aircraft which was based on the Tu-95 airframe.

The US B-21 is expected to be equipped with the same LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) as the US Air Force’s B-1B Lancer which when combined with the new aircraft’s stealth features and powerful sensor suite would make it a formidable bomber posing a serious threat to enemy warships across the Indian Ocean.

According to a new study by the Pentagon China’s new stealthy Xian H-20 bomber is planned to carry conventional and nuclear missiles and fly at ranges of up to 850 kilometers. The ongoing dispute with China might necessitate India to also purchase a stealth bomber to create effective deterrence with China.

Even though most of these weapon systems still remain a pipedream the new US Ambassador to India could pay attention and start necessary discussions to see if meaningful cooperation is possible on them. Upon assuming his office Garcetti would do well to pursue this matter if Washington is really serious about reducing New Delhi’s reliance on Moscow in the defense domain."
NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy10cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktY292aWQtY2FzZXMtb24tYm9hcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Lines Face Criticism Over Lack of Transparency,"When Norwegian Cruise Line’s Breakaway arrived in New Orleans on December 5 at least some passengers said they were completely unaware that cases of COVID-19 had been detected on board.

“We didn’t hear of this until we kind of heard you talking a second ago” passenger Don Canole told the Associated Press. “It would have been nice to have known. We would have taken maybe a few more precautions.”

READ: Carnival Nixes Casino Smoking

Fast-forward a bit and passengers aboard the December 11th sailing of Carnival Panorama received notification that their visit to Cabo San Lucas had been canceled because “local authorities… have decided that due to a small number of positive COVID cases on board all guests who debark must be tested” adding “health authorities are not yet prepared to conduct the testing.”

Concerned passengers who inquired as to the number of cases on board reported on social media that their questions went unanswered.

When the cruise industry resumed sailings after being shut down for well over a year it was with the knowledge that COVID cases almost inevitably would be detected onboard ships.

In recent weeks lines have openly acknowledged that they’ve had cases on board but few are willing to talk actual numbers.

“We’ve sailed with literally hundreds of thousands of guests now” Carnival Corporation’s CEO Arnold Donald told Yahoo Finance “we’ve had very few cases of COVID onboard.”

Likewise during a November earnings call Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO Frank Del Rio said that cases on the fleet he oversees had been “inconsequential and well below what we all saw in the general population at the time.”

Just like on land COVID is finding ways to infect even those who are vaccinated masked and doing everything they can to avoid infection.

But the question being increasingly asked when it comes to cruise ships is at what point do operators have a responsibility to tell those on board that cases have been detected.

And it’s not only passengers who are raising concerns. In a December 15th New York Times article a Breakaway crew member speaking on the condition of anonymity revealed that he only found out about the recent outbreak via a fellow employee.

Upon pursuing more information management would not tell him how many positive cases had been confirmed or who had been infected.

“I would like to know who tested positive because this new variant spreads very quickly and I have a medical condition which means I need to be very careful and protect myself” he told the media outlet.

Although there are regulations in place which require ships to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with a daily report regarding cases detected on board there are no such rules requiring that such information be passed along to passengers.

Having been so hard hit by the industry-wide shutdown lines recognize that they must do everything in their power to protect the health and safety of passengers. With that in mind all of the major players have stepped up their efforts including this week putting stricter mask policies in place.

Whereas Norwegian Cruise Line — which has been sailing with 100 percent vaccinated passengers and crew — until recently proudly sold itself as an environment on which cruisers did not have to wear masks that changed following the Breakaway incident.

On cruises departing through at least December 19th they are now requiring that masks be worn indoors by all guests and crew except under very specific circumstances.

Travel agents we spoke with said that while they’d been given no indication as to whether this policy would be extended beyond December 19th they were contacting clients to inform them of the possibility.

Obviously cruise lines have what they see as good reason to keep details about COVID numbers under wraps. They’ve spent the past several months (and untold millions of dollars) getting the word out that cruising is back and thanks to the various protocols put in place perfectly safe.

And to be clear it would appear that the number of cases being reported is relatively small in comparison to the number of passengers who have sailed without incident.

During the early days of the COVID crisis the cruise industry found itself in the spotlight thanks to several high-profile incidents.

As is so often the case the media was far quicker to cover the outbreaks on ships than they have been the herculean efforts undertaken in the year since to develop protocols far more advanced than those put in place by any land-based operations.

The old adage may claim that there’s no such thing as bad publicity but the last thing any cruise line needs after a year during which they were shut down is headlines about COVID cases on board their ships.

But at the same time a lack of transparency seems destined to backfire.

Only by being forthcoming with passengers and the media can cruise lines normalize the fact that COVID cases will be found on ships… just as they are on land.

READ: Royal Carnival and NCL Tighten Indoor Mask Policy

The crisis is not over and thanks to variants may not be for some time to come. It would be foolish to act as if — let alone try and put forth the image that — COVID does not exist on board ships.

Honesty as they say is the best policy.

It’s time for cruise lines to take this approach especially with their clients and be more forthcoming when cases are discovered on board.

Anything short of that will only do the industry harm in the long run.

NRG,NRG Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L3dhdWtlZ2FuLWNvYWwtcGxhbnQtb3duZXItaG9sZHMtbWVldGluZy10by1kaXNjdXNzLXBsYW5zLWZvci1jbG9zaW5nLWNvYWwtYXNoLXBvbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waukegan coal plant owner holds meeting to discuss plans for closing coal ash ponds,"NRG which owns Midwest Generation and the Waukegan Generating Station held its first public meetings this week to discuss plans to close two coal ash ponds in Waukegan a community that is dealing with generations of industrial waste.

Company representatives announced NRG plans to remove all coal ash from one of the ponds while implementing “cap-in-place” at the other meaning workers will drain the water from the pond fill in the lined pit around the remaining coal ash and cap it with artificial materials to prevent runoff and erosion.

The Waukegan Generating Station coal-fired plant can be seen from North Beach in Waukegan on Nov. 30 2021.

At the meetings held Wednesday and Thursday NRG presented its plan for the closure which is available online. It had already been submitted in draft form for review and is also available on their website.

The meetings and disclosure are required as part of Illinois’ coal ash rules which impose restrictions on how coal ash surface impoundments can be closed. The company is required to hold two public meetings to explain its closure plans answer questions and hear comments.

Based on the comments and questions posed to the panel of NRG and Midwest Generation executives and consultants many participants were concerned about the cap-in-place method which would keep the coal ash contained beneath the ground rather than removing it.

NRG concluded that removal was not the best option for one of the ponds because the panelists said it was not polluting nearby groundwater and removal would create heavy traffic in the community since they had ruled out use of railroads and barges due to permitting concerns.

In June 2019 the Illinois Pollution Control Board ruled that the facility violated environmental regulations and was responsible for groundwater contamination in Waukegan and elsewhere. When asked about the ruling the NRG panel said the case is ongoing.

“That matter is still under litigation” said Sharene Shealy environmental director at NRG. “We can’t go into a lot of detail about it. But that finding came after almost 10 years of hearings and legal things. … The board will hold hearings to determine if there’s any additional work or work to be required.”

While the board ruled that the facility is responsible for contamination it did not specify if the formal ash ponds the nearby historical ash fill or both are the source. That may be why NRG representatives said they don’t believe the ponds are a source of contamination.

Dulce Ortiz co-chair of Clean Power Lake County and a member of the Waukegan community asked multiple questions then said most of the company’s answers were unsatisfying.

Dulce Ortiz co-chair of Clean Power Lake County and a lifelong Waukegan resident on North Beach with the Waukegan Generating Station coal-fired plant in the distance on Dec. 1 2021.

“When I started doing this work you know I was very naive and really felt like ‘let’s talk to them. Maybe if we tell them our story they’ll have a heart and they’ll hear’ ” Ortiz said. “But after almost a decade of doing this work I mean you’re not really surprised … because there’s no accountability. They don’t feel responsible to the community.”

Ortiz asked the NRG representatives if they had a plan to incorporate community feedback and if their plan was already finalized.

“We did not walk into this meeting with a plan to do anything with feedback because we hadn’t received it yet” Shealy said. “Now that we are receiving it or we’re in the process of receiving it we will formulate a plan to respond.”

Other spokespeople had similar responses saying they came to the meeting to listen and would respond to feedback accordingly.

The idea that transportation ruled out full removal of the coal ash in both ponds was questioned by multiple community members who pointed out that fly ash a similar type of coal combustion residual is already regularly shipped from the facility.

“We prefer not to haul ash through the streets of the community. … We have a system by capping in place that at the end has the same effect of assuring that it’s environmentally safe or just as good as taking the ash out of the pond” said Paulo Rocha plant manager for the generating station.

The Waukegan Generating Station in Waukegan owned by NRG Energy is ringed by ash ponds on May 12 2021.

NRG presented modeling data that showed how it believed contaminants would spread if the ponds did leak. It modeled how far and to what degree the contaminants would spread if the company capped one or both of the ponds in five years versus 25 years. The pictures for every scenario presented showed a large decrease in span and concentration of the contamination and looked largely the same for cap-in-place and removal.

It is not clear what data NRG used to produce the models. Ortiz said she is still not confident in the modeling data because even if the system holds for 25 years what happens after 100 or 200 years?

“Can we trust (NRG) and then if something catastrophic happens who’s gonna pay for it at the end of the day?” Ortiz said. “They’re also making a decision of the site for community members like you’re not going to be able to do anything with this site. We’re just going to store ash here.”

Faith Bugel an attorney representing the Sierra Club who has been involved with the action against NRG since the start in 2012 said she doesn’t think the community wants the land to forever be covered in fake turf and blocked from use.

“They put a fence around it and they call it ‘passive open space’ which basically is like a big garbage pile that nobody can touch. This site is of value to the community” Bugel said. “I think we have to listen to what the community wants.”

Its specifications are quite puzzling especially for a graphics card that will hit shelves in early 2022 making it Nvidia's most questionable launch so far

4 Reviews

Nvidia lifted the covers off the GeForce RTX 2050 MX550 and MX570 yesterday (December 17 2021). The announcement came as a bit of surprise given that Nvidia has plans to unveil a host of graphics cards at CES 2022 including the GeForce RTX 3050 RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3090 Ti at CES 2022. The GeForce RTX 2050 is the most puzzling SKU of the lot for several reasons.

Although its 2xxx series moniker suggests that the GeForce RTX 2050 is a part of the Turing family Nvidia has confirmed to Anandtech (and several others) that it is actually an Ampere part using a GA107 GPU; the same one found on the GeForce RTX 3050. However it supports none of Ampere's features such as Resizable Bar Nvidia Reflex Shadowplay etc. making it an amalgamation of the worst bits of Turing and Ampere.

The GeForce RTX 2050's spec sheet makes things even gloomier. Its packs 4GB of 14Gbps VRAM on a 64-bit bus giving us an effective memory bandwidth of 112GB/s. It has a TGP of 30-45W base/boost clocks of 1057/1740MHz and 2048 CUDA cores. These specs put it between Turing-era GeForce GTX 1650 and GTX 1660 Ti so one can't help but wonder why it was launched with an Ampere GPU. However its worst spec by far is its 64-bit bus width. To put things in perspective the last graphics card we saw with the spec was the Pascal-based GT 1030.

Technical specifications aside the GeForce RTX 2050's name opens an entirely new can of worms for OEMs and consumers alike. Given that it is an RTX-branded part end users will expect it to perform on par or better than the GTX 1660 Ti and as discussed earlier that is very unlikely to happen. To make matters worse we found the better-specced GeForce RTX 3050's ray tracing capabilities to be nothing short of abysmal so things are looking grim for the GeForce RTX 2050 even before it hits shelves.

We got some GeForce RTX 2050 benchmark figures and they look grim. In 3DMark Time Spy (1440p) it is just a smidgen over the GeForce GTX 1650 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 5300M. As expected the GeForce RTX 1660 Ti and RTX 3050 blow it out of the water. We also get a glimpse at how the GeForce MX570 and MX 550 fare against their previous-generation counterparts. The former's performance is nothing short of impressive but that is to be expected given that it runs the same GA107 GPU found on the RTX 2050. The GeForce MX550 on the other hand employs an older TU117 GPU.

One can't help but wonder just where the GeForce RTX 2050 sits in Nvidia's product stack. It could find niche applications in budget laptops with low-power Alder Lake-M/Rembrandt parts. However the RTX 2050 runs the risk of being outshined by next-generation iGPUs especially the rumoured RDNA2-based models from AMD. At the very least OEMs can slap an ""RTX-enabled graphics card"" label on their spec sheets as a marketing tactic. Nonetheless it's best to reserve judgment until the GeForce RTX 2050 hits shelves in Spring 2022 and we can't wait to see how it performs.

Buy the Acer Nitro 5 with an Ryzen 6 5600H and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE4LzIyODQ0MDkxL252aWRpYS1ydHgtMjA1MC1sYXB0b3AtZ3B1LWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's new RTX 2050 laptop GPU could potentially power more affordable laptops,"Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 2050 laptop GPUs don’t sound “new” at all considering that the company already released the RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs for laptops earlier this year (via VideoCardz). But it’s clear that Nvidia isn’t ready to retire its 20 series GPUs just yet — Nvidia says that the RTX 2050 will be available in laptops starting in the spring of 2022.

The RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture not Turing

The RTX 2050 isn’t just a piece of old hardware brought back from the dead. Unlike other 20 series chips the RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture not Turing. Ampere is the same architecture that the RTX 3050 (and all other 30 series cards) is powered by and packaging it within a 20-series card could potentially offer some of the same ray-tracing improvements at a cheaper price. The RTX 2050 comes with the same 2048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory that the RTX 3050 has. However it offers a 64-bit memory bus when compared to the RTX 3050’s 128-bit potentially leading to a bit of a downgrade in performance.

While it’s possible that Nvidia is releasing a GPU that doesn’t belong to the latest and greatest 30 series due to the ongoing chip shortage the move may also come as a way to provide a middle ground between the RTX 3050 and the RTX 1650. Nvidia might want a mid-range GPU that offers a boost in performance over the RTX 1650 but is still more affordable when compared to devices that carry the RTX 3050.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWFzLW5ldy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDUwLWdwdXMtYXJlLWJldHRlci10aGFuLXRoZXktc291bmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 2050 GPUs are better than they sound,"Given that Nvidia has been forced to revive a handful of older graphics cards to try and ease the demand for the perpetually out of stock RTX 3080 series you might assume the announcement of the RTX 2050 laptop GPU is the same old refrain.

That’s actually not the case. Despite its name the GeForce RTX 2050 is actually based on the same GA107 Ampere design seen in the RTX 3050 laptop GPU rather than the Turing architecture of other RTX 20-series cards. The RTX 2050 could power some of the best gaming laptops for those on a budget when it arrives next year. Here's what we know so far.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050 specs

Of course there are some clear drawbacks to explain the smaller number. While the RTX 3050 features a 128-bit memory bus the RTX 2050 halves this to 64-bits and the boosted clock speed is capped at 1477MHz instead of 1740MHz. But otherwise it’s the same right down to the 2048 CUDA cores 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM and ability to pump out ray traced graphics (albeit not as effectively as pricier hardware).

There’s an advantage to these paired back specifications besides price too: energy efficiency. While RTX 3050 laptops power consumption ranges between 35 and 80W the RTX 2050 laptop GPU is listed as ranging between 30 and 45W.

Alongside the RTX 2050 Nvidia also announced another couple of lower cost laptop GPU options: the MX550 and MX570. The former is based on Turing architecture while the latter uses Ampere but the market for both is the same: thin and light laptops that need slightly more grunt than integrated graphics for photo and video editing as well as some light gaming.

What’s slightly odd about this announcement — other than the confusing 20-series name for what appears to be a 30-series GPU — is the timeline involved. Nvidia says that all three laptop GPUs are being readied for Spring 2022 which is obviously some way off yet.

Why the long lead time? Well it may be down to the global chip shortage but it could also have something to do with the busy January Nvidia is reportedly set to have.

According to the rumor mill Nvidia is due to release three different desktop GPUs next month including two RTX 3050 variants alongside an RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3090 Ti. Whether availability will be any better than what’s nominally possible to buy now remains extremely doubtful however.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vdGFsa2luZy1tbHBlcmYtdHJhaW5pbmctdjEtMS13aXRoLWluc3B1ci1hbmQtbnZpZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Talking MLPerf Training V1.1 with Inspur and NVIDIA,"In a series we have been doing for some time now I wanted to take a quick moment and check in on the state of AI with Inspur and NVIDIA. This year instead of just covering the MLPerf Training v1.1 results I wanted to take the opportunity to cover the release in a bit of a different format. I sent a few questions to Inspur and NVIDIA to get their take on the latest results and some of the trends they are seeing. Due to the pandemic I was not able to get to visit Inspur this year so it is always good to get insight from one of the largest server vendors in the world.

For this installment we have Dr. Shawn Wu of Inspur along with Paresh Kharya of NVIDIA. Paresh STH readers may remember we also talked to last year in our AI in 2020 and a Glimpse of 2021 with Inspur and NVIDIA piece. As a fun one normally in interviews we use the initials of folks as we go through the interview. Paresh and I share “PK” so we are going to use first names instead. This is a break from format due to a very small percentage chance that this would happen.

Talking MLPerf Training V1.1 with Inspur and NVIDIA

Patrick Kennedy: Can you tell our readers about yourself?

Shawn: I am Dr. Shawn Wu Chief Researcher at the Inspur Artificial Intelligence Research Institute. My research is in large-scale distributed computing AI algorithms deep learning frameworks compilers and etc.

Paresh: I have been a part of NVIDIA for more than 6 years. My current role is senior director of product management and marketing for accelerated computing at NVIDIA. I am responsible for the go-to-market aspects including messaging positioning launch and sales enablement of NVIDIA’s data center products including server GPUs and software platforms for AI and HPC. Previously I held a variety of business roles in the high-tech industry including product management at Adobe and business development at Tech Mahindra.

Patrick: How did you get involved in the AI hardware industry and MLPerf?

Shawn: I joined Inspur Information upon receiving my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University. Inspur is a leader in server technology and innovation. This led to my research focus in high-performance computing (HPC) and AI. MLPerf has quickly established itself as the industry benchmark for AI performance making it a natural fit for applying the world-class AI research being done at the Inspur Artificial Intelligence Research Institute. We have been participating in MLPerf since 2019 and have been setting new performance records ever since.

Paresh: Throughout my career I’ve been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on several innovative technologies that have transformed the world. My first job was to create a mobile Internet browser just as the combination of 3G and smartphones were about to revolutionize personal computing. After that I had the opportunity to work on Cloud Computing and web conference applications taking advantage of it at Adobe. And now I’m very excited to be working at NVIDIA just as modern AI and Deep Learning ignited by NVIDIA’s GPU accelerated computing platform are driving the greatest technological breakthroughs of our generation.

MLPerf Training v1.1

Patrick: MLPerf has been out for some time what were your big takeaways from MLPerf Training v1.1?

Shawn: It is an honor to be competing among so many outstanding companies at MLPerf which has been key to the vigorous development of AI benchmarking and resulted in continuous performance improvements. Since Inspur began participating in MLPerf more and more companies have joined and with more competition has come more enthusiasm for the benchmark results. The mission of MLPerf is not static it follows the developments and focus of the industry to continuously update the tested models and scenarios accordingly and helps communicate industry-wide development trends. Through competitive benchmarks like MLPerf the ability to optimize different types of models has been improved and experience gained in how to select components for different models in order to better utilize the performance advantages of Inspur equipment. The actual application of mainstream software frameworks has also had an enlightening effect on our framework selection and optimization process.

Paresh: MLPerf represents real-world usages for AI applications and so customers ask for MLPerf results. This motivates participation from solution providers which continues to be excellent. There were 13 submitters to this round of MLPerf training which had 8 benchmarks representing applications from NLP speech recognition recommender systems reinforcement learning and computer vision.

NVIDIA AI with NVIDIA A100 and NVIDIA IB Networking Set Records Across All benchmarks delivering up to 20x more performance in 3 years since the benchmarks started and 5x in 1 Year alone with software innovation.

NVIDIA ecosystem partners submitted excellent results on their servers with Inspur achieving the most records for per server performance with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Patrick: What is your sense in terms of the percentage that new hardware impacts training performance versus new software and models? NVIDIA often cites how rapidly the performance gains accrue with new software generations.

Shawn: Great hardware will always be the foundation of great performance. But software improvements have a huge impact as well. Smart algorithms can reduce the number of calculations required and help release the full power of hardware. Likewise reasonable scheduling can reduce hardware bottlenecks to improve efficiency granting greater performance.

Paresh: Accelerated computing requires full-stack optimization from GPU architecture to system design to system software to application software and algorithms. Software optimizations are vital in delivering end application performance. Over the last 3 years of MLPerf NVIDIA AI Platform has delivered up to 20x higher performance per GPU with the combination of full-stack optimizations over the 3 architecture generations – Volta Turing and NVIDIA Ampere – provided up to 5x higher performance on our NVIDIA Ampere architecture alone with software and higher scalability afforded by software innovation including SHARP and MagnumIO.

Patrick: The NVIDIA A100 has been in the market for some time now are we starting to hit the point of maximum performance from a software perspective?

Shawn: From a software perspective there is still room for improvement. There is still a major gap between actual computing power and the theoretical maximum based on the hardware. We use software to tap into this otherwise unrealized hardware potential and continue to optimize software to bring us closer to that theoretical maximum. Consequently algorithm optimization remains a major tool for advancing performance.

Paresh: I think we’ll continue to see improvements. We increased performance in every round of MLPerf that A100 has participated in since MLPerf v0.7. We’ve increased performance over 5x since v0.7 on Ampere architecture GPUs. This is similar to how our Volta GPUs performance increased continuously for its entire lifespan. With over 75% of our engineers dedicated to software we continue to work hard to find additional optimizations.

Patrick: Inspur had both Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC servers in this round of MLPerf are there types of customers or workloads/ models that favor one architecture over the other? If so what are they?

Shawn: In Training v1.1 Inspur submitted two models NF5488A5 using AMD CPUs and NF5688M6 using Intel CPUs. NF5488A5 was top-ranked in SSD and ResNet50 tasks and NF5688M6 was top-ranked in DLRM Mask R-CNN and BERT tasks.

Patrick: What trends have you seen over the past year regarding the uptake of the NVIDIA A100 SXM versus the traditional PCIe version?

Shawn: In Training v1.0 there were 5 models using PCIe and 11 using NVIDIA A100 SXM. In Training v1.1 there were 4 models using PCIe and 12 using NVIDIA A100 SXM. So we can see that there was a slight uptick in NVIDIA A100 SXM usage but it was already the overwhelmingly choice over traditional PCIe.

Paresh: Our A100 GPU in SXM form factor is designed for the highest performing servers and provides 4 or 8 A100 GPUs interconnected with 600 GBps NVLink Interconnect. Customers looking for training AI and highest application performance choose A100 GPUs in SXM form factor. A100 is also available in the PCIe form factor for customers looking to add acceleration to their mainstream enterprise servers.

Patrick: What are the big trends you see in training servers in 2022?

Shawn: A big trend will be the overall optimization from the server to the cluster system. For bottleneck IO transmission high-load multi-GPU collaborative task scheduling and heat dissipation issues the coordination and optimization of software and hardware can reduce communication latency to ensure stable operation and improve AI training performance.

A greater variety of AI chips will be used in training tasks; models will be equipped with more powerful GPUs; 8 or more accelerators in a single node will become mainstream. There will also be more and more large-scale models and cluster training will receive further attention and development.

Paresh: Training AI is going mainstream in enterprises powered by broadly applicable use cases like NLP and conversational AI. This is changing the application workload mix of enterprise data centers.

AI training requires data center scale optimizations and clusters are being designed with faster networking and storage for scalability. Scale is important for training larger models that provide higher accuracy as well as improving the productivity of data scientists and application developers by enabling them to iterate faster.

Patrick: For those looking to deploy training clusters in 2022 is there one network fabric that you think will be dominant? Why?

Shawn: CLOS architecture is recommended for the network fabric to ensure non-blocking communication throughout the network. The most commonly used today is spine-leaf architecture which allows the network to expand horizontally on the premise of non-blocking communication.

Infiniband is recommended for the network type Infiniband or RoCE. These two networks support RDMA. We feel that using Infiniband in AI and HPC scenarios especially in large-scale clusters has advantages in latency and stability.

Network bandwidth will continue to improve. For large-scale models such as GPT3 and Inspur Yuan 1.0 it will involve data parallelism model parallelism and pipeline parallelism in 3-dimensional parallelism. Among these model parallelism has the largest amount of communication and will have the greatest impact on future cluster development. The training of large models is now 8-way model parallelism plus multiple pipelines in parallel. We believe that when node bandwidth becomes larger it will no longer be limited by the 8-way model parallelism.

Paresh: The NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand fabric will undoubtedly be the dominant networking solution for training clusters for several reasons. Its end-to-end bandwidth ultra-low latency GPUDirect and in-network compute capabilities are exceptionally important when training models; especially as the complexity of models increases. Models today are growing into hundreds of billions to even trillions of parameters. InfiniBand’s In-Network Computing capabilities are especially important for deep learning; offloading collective operations from the CPU to the network and eliminating the need to send data multiple times between endpoints is a real game-changer in reducing overall training time.

Patrick: Are there plans for Inspur to show other accelerators in the future aside from NVIDIA cards?

Shawn: NVIDIA is one of our most important partners. Every generation of Inspur AI servers will complete NVIDIA GPU product testing and certification. This fundamental partnership covers 90% of the application scenarios in the market. In regards to AI technology some specific scenarios have emerged such as video decoding and encoding accelerated processing where Inspur has released accelerators for these specific scenarios. These accelerators do not conflict with NVIDIA’s main direction.

Patrick: How has storage for training servers evolved in the past year?

Shawn: In training tasks over the past year storage read speed has had a greater impact on models with large training data in the initial stage. Most manufacturers use the faster read speed NVME drives and through the formation of a RAID 0 disk array that data can be read in parallel to further increase read speeds.

Paresh: Training AI has evolved over the last few years from datasets on local storage being sufficient for most use cases to dedicated fast storage subsystems being vital today. Giant models and larger datasets today require fast storage subsystems for overall at scale performance of training clusters. AI training involves large numbers of read operations as well as fast writes once in a while for checkpointing models and experimenting with hyperparameters. For this reason NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer is architected with the high performance storage system that offers over 2TB/s of peak read and 1.4TB/s of peak write performance. This is complemented by the caching for fast local access to data by the GPUs in a node. In addition to the storage subsystems software tools are needed for giant language models for instance NVIDIA Megatron which leverages NVIDIA Magnum IO can take advantage of data being fed at more than 1TB/s

Final Words

I just wanted to take a moment to thank both Shawn and Paresh for answering a few of my questions around MLPerf in 2021 and looking into 2022. Hopefully we can resume doing in-person interviews next year as we get to the next generations of hardware and MLPerf results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMjA1MC1hbmQtbXg1MDAtbGFwdG9wLWdwdXMtdGVzdGVkLWluLTNkbWFyay10aW1lc3B50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 and MX500 Laptop GPUs tested in 3DMark TimeSpy,"First test results of the RTX 2050 and MX570/550

Only hours after being unexpectedly announced the first benchmark results of the new entry-level GPUs from NVIDIA have been published.

The test results came from the Zhihu platform where preliminary results based on preproduction samples have been provided. Out of three SKUs that were announced yesterday the leaked data only covers two SKUs RTX 2050 and MX550. It is assumed that RTX 2050 and MX570 perform at a similar level at least in this 3DMark test.

GeForce MX570 & MX550 Specifications Source: Zhihu

It should be noted that NVIDIA confirmed to ComputerBase that both SKUs are essentially the same (based on Ampere GA107 GPU with 2048 CUDA cores) which means they support ray tracing hardware acceleration as well DLSS (through Tensor cores). However the RT Cores are limited to some extent which has not been explained in detail yet. Furthermore the RTX 2050 has 4GB memory whereas the MX570 is equipped with 2GB. In any case it should not affect the TimeSpy benchmark result.

The specs confirm that both MX500 SKUs are limited to 64-bit memory bus and 12 Gbps bandwidth. The clock speeds are 1155 MHz for the MX570 and 1320 MHz for MX550. The MX550 is essentially a cut-down GeForce GTX 1650 based on Turing TU117 GPU. It retained 1024 CUDA cores but the memory bus was cut in half to 64-bits. At the same time the memory technology was upgraded from GDDR5 to GDDR6 standard.

The test results are not very impressive the RTX 3050 Laptop GPU with 128-bit memory bus scores around 4800 points in TimeSpy Graphics. But again those MX500 results are based on pre-production samples. In fact they are likely to be paired with next-gen mobile CPUs (such as Alder Lake-M) which may not offer the final performance at this state. After all the RTX2050 and MX500 GPUs are officially launching in Spring 2022.

Gigantic “Trump 2020” and “Let’s Go Brandon” flags and banners lined the plaza outside the arena where conservative merchandise vendors set up to hawk their wares. Between the vendors stood a woman wearing a full American flag jumpsuit holding a poster featuring Trump’s face inside of a Q next to a garishly painted truck advertising a group opposing the fluoridation of water.

While waiting in line a woman in front of me asked if I was a local to Dallas and whether it was safe for her and her husband to walk eight blocks from their car to dinner after the sun went down. I told her yes that Dallas is a relatively safe city and that they’d be perfectly fine. “But what about those paid agitators” she responded with serious concern. “I know they come in from out of town.”

No agitators showed up it should be said paid or otherwise.

The scene outside was indicative of the general tone and tenor of the event save for the part where the crowd batted around a couple beach balls while Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” blared in the background. No one could have predicted that.

Facilitated by O’Reilly the “History Tour” which kicked off in Florida last week amounted to an opportunity for Trump to offer a myriad of baseless conspiracy theory laced claims entirely unchallenged. Take for instance O’Reilly’s opening question: Is the Democratic party socialist? “I think they’re beyond socialism” Trump said blithely. “I’m talking about the big C word.” Never mind that the Democratic party cannot manage to pass its own agenda due to the recent intransigence of Senator Joe Manchin — who was praised by name by O’Reilly and Trump.

The rest of the event went more or less the same. For a few hours the two hucksters outlined their revisionist history of the Trump administration the election and the current state of the nation to an audience who hung on their every word. Trump played the conspiratorial hits that appeal to his base: the election was rigged (“That’s all the Democrats are good at politics and stealing elections”); President Joe Biden is intentionally encouraging criminals to cross the border (“The toughest meanest people from prison are being dumped here”); Covid-19 was an intentional biological attack from China (“What came out of the Wuhan Lab”); and January 6th was justified but the violence had nothing to do with this supporters (“BLM and Antifa were among the crowd”).

Editor’s picks

The event wasn’t exactly sold out — I moved from my cheap seats in the second section to a half-empty empty center row not far from the stage to get a better view — but the excitement in the room was palpable. People sang along to the music in the hours leading up to the beginning of the conversation. The entire crowd stood for a rendition of “How Great Thou Art” a Christian hymn. Some folks came out dressed for church perhaps because they had just been at the First Baptist Dallas Church Christmas service where Trump was featured as a special guest.

“Now you may wonder why not just have [Trump] speak right now?” Pastor Robert Jeffress said at the beginning of the service. “I’ll tell you why. Cuz I know you all! And as soon as he finished y’all would walk out of here before my sermon and even more importantly before the offering. So we’re not gonna let you do that.”

Otherwise the crowd looked like your typical Trump rally. Plenty of empty seats but quite a turnout for the Sunday before Christmas. There was no shortage of hats shirts and jackets bearing a variety of slogans — Trump 2024 Let’s Go Brandon I Identify As Vaccinated Trump themed Christmas sweaters and more. Among the crowd were members of the controversial JFK-obsessed QAnon cult led by Michael Protzman that have been holed up at the Hyatt Regency Hotel for over two months where most recently they held an informational session on alternative health (the content of which does not bear repeating). They did not all dress up in the same absurd shirts or make a major scene on Sunday afternoon instead opting to wear more unassuming threads and blending in with the rest of the crowd. But they did catch the attention of a local conspiracy theory YouTuber who confronted Protzman regarding all predictions that have failed to pan out during a livestream (the contents of which does not bear repeating).

On occasion and somewhat surprisingly O’Reilly would ask a tough question. “Do you believe in climate change?” O’Reilly directly asked Trump giving the former president ample room to spread misinformation doubt and absurd equivocations. Even when O’Reilly asked Trump the same question about climate change a second time after failing to get a direct answer he allowed Trump to blather. Trump rarely stuck to the subject of the questions asked rapidly pivoting and switching between topics and no matter how absurd the segue he often found his way to attack China or Russia.

On several occasions the crowd audibly responded to the discussion. Whenever Trump leaned into the conspiratorial or antagonistic tones the crowd whooped and hollered. When O’Reilly asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi someone in the crowd yelled “skank!” And when former President Obama was mentioned a chorus of disapproval rang out.

Occasionally Trump offered a stunning morsel of rational thought delivered in his trademark stream of consciousness style.

“We saved tens of millions worldwide by creating the vaccine” Trump said while occasionally peppering in “no mandates” between sentences. “It would have been like the Spanish Flu without it … We should take credit for it and you play right into their hands [when you doubt the vaccine].”

For a moment things seemed normal. In touch with reality even. But when O’Reilly followed up Trump’s defense of the vaccine by saying “both the President and I are vaxxed. We got the booster” the crowd booed in disapproval.

And then it got worse.

“We don’t have anyone on the left in this room do we?” Trump asked. “Wait no don’t say it. We don’t want anything to happen.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

As of Saturday the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) said power interruptions were still being experienced in the provinces of Antique Iloilo Negros Oriental Negros Occidental Cebu Lanao del Norte Misamis Occidental Surigao del Sur Agusan del Norte Agusan del Sur and Davao Oriental. Also supply was still down in Bohol Biliran Eastern Samar Leyte Southern Leyte and Surigao del Norte.

Transmission services were fully restored in Capiz Camiguin Misamis Oriental and Zamboanga del Sur.

Restoration activities

As of this writing restoration activities were in progress on the entire islands of Samar Leyte and Negros and in Bohol Cebu Iloilo Antique Surigao and Agusan provinces Compostela Valley Davao Oriental Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

As for small power utility groups operating under the National Power Corp. (Napocor) 31 were still not operating either due to faulty lines or emergency plant shutdown. There were 20 69-kilovolt transmission lines in the Visayas and five 69-kV transmission lines in Mindanao that remained inoperable denying supply to 30 electric cooperatives in those two major island groups.

In Mindanao alone 28 138-kV lines have yet to resume transmission for the supply in the entire Surigao del Norte Bohol Leyte and Samar Islands parts of Surigao del Sur and parts of Agusan del Sur.

Toppled poles towers

The NGCP said at least 134 electrical poles in Surigao del Norte alone were toppled by the typhoon. In the Visayas an inspection on Saturday initially listed four toppled towers two toppled poles and one leaning pole.

Odette’s damage on transmission lines affected even some provinces that were not directly hit by the typhoon according to Artis Nikki Tortola deputy administrator of the National Electrification Administration.

Electric cooperatives are still waiting for transmission lines to be repaired to receive power from their respective sources Tortola said in a phone interview.

Energy Undersecretary William Fuentebella earlier said the agency could not give an assurance that power would be restored in all these areas before Christmas as local conditions should first be safe enough for the engineers and linemen to be deployed.

In a meeting with President Duterte on Friday night Fuentebella again expressed concern over the COVID-19 vaccines being stored in areas hit by the blackouts.

Fuel supply

“The [generator sets] in the areas where the vaccines are stored might not last” he said.

As for fuel supply reports from oil companies indicated a sufficient inventory in the affected regions the Department of Energy said in a statement late Saturday.

The whole country may count on a buffer supply good for 29.4 days it added.

However there were 159 oil retail outlets in the affected regions that were forced to close due to power outages flooding structural damage or limited manpower.

Six bulk facilities in Cebu Negros Occidental Palawan and Aklan were also forced to stop operation while three oil depots in Bohol and Cebu and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refilling plant in Davao del Sur could not be immediately contacted.

The pickup had crossed the centerline forcing the truck to swerve. The truck which was carrying about 20000 pounds of cargo then rolled over and burst into flames. The pickup driver did not survive.

The responding law enforcement officers firefighters and employees of a local towing company were concerned about the fire and what the truck was carrying but they saw no signage indicating any hazardous materials and the truck driver told first responders that he wasn't aware of any such materials on board.

A jury awarded six of those first responders $75 million Wednesday in St. Francis County Circuit Court after their attorneys showed that Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. the North Carolina-based company that owned the truck failed to immediately inform the responders that the rig was carrying formic acid a combustible liquid used for dyeing textiles paper and making other chemicals.

Those who arrived unwittingly inhaled poisonous smoke for hours.

Plaintiffs and attorneys said they hope the case will raise awareness about the importance of protecting first responders who are the first line of defense in such situations and must be informed immediately of any type of chemical that could permanently damage their health or cause possibly fatal diseases like cancer.

When formic acid burns it releases toxic fumes. Those who were at the accident scene were exposed to those gases for hours without knowing it later learning when they arrived at a hospital complaining of headaches and burning sensations in their nasal passages and throats that they had been breathing in toxic fumes court documents said.

""Because the formic acid was exposed to the fire from the wreck and was vaporizing for more than four hours plaintiffs unknowingly inhaled the poisonous formic acid"" the lawsuit filed July 31 2020 said.

Old Dominion one of the largest freight companies in the United States did not inform law enforcement officials of the presence of formic acid until hours after the accident according to court documents.

""After more than four to five hours of being exposed to the vaporizing chemical authorities finally received an email from Old Dominion's safety manager saying that in fact there was hazardous material"" the court documents said.

The documents said Arkansas State Police received an email that the truck was transporting formic acid at 8:51 p.m. on April 20 2018 nearly six hours after the accident. There were 500 to 600 pounds of the chemical in the trailer the documents said.

Old Dominion did not respond to messages seeking comment Friday.

Court documents said Old Dominion attorneys argued that no one asked about what the tractor-trailer was transporting that day. The plaintiffs' attorneys presented contrary evidence.

Federal regulations stipulate that trucks have signage and other types of safety standards in place depending on the types and quantities of hazardous materials transported. Laws require carriers to immediately inform law enforcement agencies in the event of an accident if there are dangerous chemicals on trucks.

""Because Old Dominion intentionally and recklessly concealed from the community and the authorities the hazardous material in its trailer plaintiffs have undergone and continue to undergo life altering damages"" including permanent lung damage the court documents said.

""I have permanent lung damage permanent airway damage and sometimes it is hard to breathe"" said Frank McMillion 51 a sergeant with the Arkansas State Police who responded to the accident and was there for at least five hours. ""I get tired a lot. I have to change a lot of the ways I used to do things.""

The jury of nine women and three men awarded McMillion the lead plaintiff in the trial which began on Dec. 6 $25 million. The remaining $50 million is to be distributed among the other five plaintiffs -- a volunteer firefighter a St. Francis County sheriff's office corporal and employees of White Motor Co. Towing and Recovery Service.

Deliberations in the case lasted less than three hours.

McMillion said he hopes the trial and the jury's award will pressure Old Dominion and similar companies to uphold safety standards to protect first responders particularly those in smaller towns and rural areas who are not equipped to deal with dangerous materials.

""Over here in eastern Arkansas it is rural. The majority of the fire departments are volunteer so they are not funded for that and are not equipped for that type of situation"" McMillion said. ""Do we need to call a hazmat company or some type of company that is suited for that that has the equipment the suits the breathing modulators?

""They are trained to deal with that. We know what to do as far as evacuation"" McMillion said. ""We are not trained to deal with it as far as the cleanup storage or gathering of anything [hazardous].""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9kdS5lZHUvYXJ0aWNsZS9vZHUtYXdhcmRzLW5lYXJseS0yMDAwLWRlZ3JlZXMtYXQtaXRzLTEzNXRoLWNvbW1lbmNlbWVudC1leGVyY2lzZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ODU Awards Nearly 2000 Degrees at Its 135th Commencement Exercises,"President Brian O.

Nearly 2000 bachelor's master's and doctoral students received degrees in two ceremonies Saturday at Chartway Arena in the Ted Constant Convocation Center during Old Dominion University's 135th Commencement Exercises.

Two ODU alumni delivered remarks at the first graduation ceremonies at Chartway Arena in two years due to the pandemic.

At the 9 a.m. ceremony Lt. Gen. Donna W. Martin '88 the 67th Inspector General of the U.S. Army spoke to graduates of the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies Batten College of Engineering and Technology College of Sciences and School of Cybersecurity.

At the 2 p.m. ceremony Scott Cooke '93 '96 group vice president and chief financial officer for Toyota Financial Services spoke to graduates of the College of Arts and Letters Strome College of Business and College of Health Sciences.

Brian O. Hemphill Ph.D. presided over his first commencement exercises as ODU president.

""Throughout your personal and professional lives you will have an opportunity to meet a diverse cross section of humanity"" he told the graduates. ""I am confident the world will find in you what they find in so many Monarchs: a dedication to lifelong learning a champion of social justice and a passion for making a lasting impact and a positive difference in the lives of others.

""Your time at ODU developed your ability to listen with a critical ear and think with an open mind. This institution has prepared you for a life of service not only to self and family but to those in need.

""I am confident you will take your Monarch values with you on the journey ahead.""

Austin Agho provost and vice president for academic affairs recognized the 535 distance learning students who earned degrees Saturday - 357 undergraduates 161 master's students and 17 Ph.D.s.

Martin who earned a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice from ODU reflected on her graduation.

""It is such an honor for me to return to the place that was instrumental to my becoming"" she said. ""1988 seems so long ago. And yet when I look into the eyes of the class I still see myself.""

But she told the graduates that ""my generation was not facing any of the challenges you will face when you step off this campus and begin to become.""

She implored the graduates to be agents for change.

""No generation has been better positioned to be great warriors for justice and change"" she said. ""I've seen firsthand the power of a movement led by and for the next generation. Take the torch and leave your mark. Put your stake in the ground and build a future that you want and that you can believe in.""

She cited the examples of Army Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe Army Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz and Army Master Sergeant Earl D. Plumlee who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor last week by President Joe Biden.

""No one ever expects to become a Medal of Honor recipient"" she said. ""But each of you in or out of uniform may be called upon to make a difference. And if this world is going to get better it's going to be up to you.""

She also urged them to embrace rejection saying ""It doesn't define who you are. It will be your perseverance and your tenacity that people will always remember.""

She reminded the graduates ""It's not about you.""

""I've learned that you're going to be happiest just in my humble opinion when you practice simple acts of selflessness"" she said. ""Be proud of your accomplishments in as much as they are the reasons you can take a look around and say that you left things a little better than you found them.""

Cooke who earned his Bachelor of Science degree in finance and an MBA from ODU recalled his graduation 25 years ago at Foreman Field - and the irony of his role in Saturday's ceremonies.

""It was a hot day outside and all I could think of was 'Gosh I wish that old dude on the stage would hurry up and finish talking'"" he said. ""'So that I can get my diploma get the heck out of here and go celebrate.'

""So now I find myself in the precarious position of being that old dude on the stage.""

Cooke a Newport News native who graduated from the former Ferguson High School came to ODU dreaming of playing baseball for the Monarchs. But after his hopes were derailed by arm injuries ""I figured out I should find the inside of a classroom a little more often.""

As the graduates prepare to move on to the next phase of their lives he urged them to be independent thinkers.

""Be a person who listens and a person who unites"" he said alluding to the negative effect technology and social media can have. ""Don't be swayed by the loudest voice in the room but rather by the most rational and compassionate of ideas.""

He also encouraged them to not be afraid to take chances in pursuing their dreams.

""Winston Churchill once said 'Never give up on something that you can't go a day without thinking about'"" Cooke said. ""Find what you are most passionate about. That one thing that you can't go a single day without thinking about. And when you do find it be willing to take risks to make it happen.""

But mostly importantly Cooke said that ""the goal is to have a successful life not a successful career.""

For Cooke and his wife an oncologist that means making family (they have two sons) their primary focus despite their demanding jobs.

""Remember that your career is only a piece of your life"" he said. ""Make sure that you're very intentional with your time and that you spend it with purpose on the things that you love most in this world.""

Tulsa fought through a concerning amount of injuries and the Monarchs needed more time than they thought to shake off the dust that came with not playing football at all in 2020. Nevertheless both teams had leaders step up to keep their teams’ postseason hopes alive and added to their own resumes in the process.

Sportsbooks are predicting a close physical game despite the dings to both teams from throughout the season. Per DraftKings Tulsa is a 9.5-point favorite with the over/under set at 53 points.

Keep an eye on these players who have the chance to let the nation know what they can really do in the Myrtle Beach Bowl.

Odds/lines subject to change. T&Cs apply. See draftkings.com/sportsbook for details.

Jaxon Player DT - Tulsa

An imposing six-foot 294-pound presence in the middle Player is third in the AAC in tackles for loss (12.5). The senior from Waco will provide a tough challenge for a young Old Dominion offensive line and quarterback that lacks the mobility of many other starting quarterbacks we’ve seen so far this postseason.

Player was also named a third-team All-American by Pro Football Focus in 2021 and was an All-AAC selection in 2020.

Hayden Wolff QB - Old Dominion

Earlier this season Wolff replaced the more mobile DJ Mack at starting quarterback and quickly grew comfortable in the role. The redshirt freshman has completed 62 percent of his passes for 1757 yards 10 touchdowns and six interceptions this season. Wolff averaged 195.2 passing yards playing nine games this season. Averaging 36 points in their last five games ODU will rely on Wolff to orchestrate their effective pro-style offense.

At 6’5” and 219 pounds the Myrtle Beach Bowl should give fans an idea of what Wolff’s ceiling is for the rest of his college career.

Shamari Brooks RB - Tulsa

A fifth-year senior running back Shamari Brooks is just 30 yards shy of becoming Tulsa’s second all-time leading rusher. In the last four games Brooks has carried 73 times for 334 yards. That comes out to 4.5 yards per carry and roughly 18 carries per game. His chances to hit that milestone are good. Old Dominion will not make it easy however with the Monarchs allowing 3.5 yards per carry.

Throughout his career at Tulsa he has amassed 3622 rushing yards. Brooks has rushed for 922 yards and six TDs on 192 carries in 2021. Brooks is the AAC’s third leading rusher this season. After rebounding from an ACL injury that kept him out for the entire 2020 season Brooks hitting the 1000-yard mark for the second time in his college career would be a great way to wrap the year up.

Zack Kuntz TE - Old Dominion

A grad transfer from Penn State Kuntz has 71 catches for 674 yards on the season.

If the move to create the semiconductor manufacturing plant succeeds it will be only the second such facility by Taiwan in a foreign country after its production hub in the United States people familiar with the development said.

The Indian government has already proposed a number of sites for the facility and one of Taiwan's leading semiconductor producers including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) may implement the mega project they said.

Taiwan is a major player in the production of chips globally. According to industry estimates the TSMC manufactures around 50 per cent of all semiconductors globally.

""There is a strategic significance of attempting to firm up the FTA and to set up the semiconductor hub"" said one of the people cited above.

Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state. However China claims Taiwan as part of its territory.

The move to set up the facility comes amid increasing demands for chips in India by automakers and technology companies among others when there is a global shortage of chips.

The people said the proposal to set up the semiconductor hub is largely driven by the strategic significance of the ties between India and Taiwan rather than the commercial aspect of it.

""The semiconductor plant in the US was set up in the reflection of the close strategic ties between the two sides. It will be the same in India's case as well"" said one of the people cited above.

The US has been steadfast in its outreach to Taiwan in the face of increasing Chinese hostilities and reassuring Taipei of its continued support.

The government on Wednesday unveiled a plan to provide incentives worth Rs 76000 crore to encourage the setting up of semiconductor design manufacturing and display fabrication (fab) units with a larger goal of making India a global electronics production hub.

In sync with their keenness to expand economic engagement India and Taiwan have already held two rounds of talks for firming up an FTA as well as a bilateral investment agreement to boost trade ties the people said.

India has been promoting its ties with Taiwan in the areas of trade investment tourism culture education and people-to-people exchanges.

The cooperation in the areas of trade investment and industry between India and Taiwan has been on an upswing in the last few years.

The volume of bilateral trade has grown nearly six-fold from USD 1.19 billion in 2001 to almost USD 7.05 billion in 2018 and India ranks as Taiwan's 14th largest export destination and 18th largest source of imports according to official data.

By the end of 2018 around 106 Taiwanese companies were operating in India with the total investment amounting to USD 1.5 billion in the fields of information and communication technology medical devices automobile components machinery steel electronics construction engineering and financial services.

The two sides have also set up teams for further expansion of ties in education as well as skill development training.

At present an estimated 2800 Indian students are studying in Taiwan.

India does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but both sides have trade and people-to-people ties.

In 1995 New Delhi set up the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei to promote interactions between the two sides and facilitate business tourism and cultural exchanges.

The ITA has also been authorised to provide all consular and passport services.

In the same year Taiwan too established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Delhi.

Either description serves to illustrate the central role semiconductor chips play in making life easier driving economic activity and furthering innovations for the digital future. But for something that the entire world relies heavily on the semiconductor production ecosystem is surprisingly some will say alarmingly constricted with only a handful of countries with capabilities to design or manufacture them. Amid the pandemic a shortage of chips has seen production suffer across industries underscoring the need to diversify the production of this essential item. Looking to emerge as a major semiconductors player India has lined up a Rs 76000 crore package to attract knowhow and investment in the sector. Here’s all you need to know.

Why Are Semiconductors Important?

Never before has such a tiny item had so massive an influence on global business as semiconductor chips have come to exert in our digital age. Most electronic devices and new cars that are produced use it to execute their functions while everything from gym equipment to gaming consoles rely on it not to mention most household appliances and personal devices.

In short any device gadget item or product that features electronic displays or needs to process data depends essentially on these chips. The industry which saw total sales of USD 440.4 billion in 2020 is expected to see earnings grow by a fifth this year to touch USD 527.2 billion. This amid a crippling shortage of chips that will see carmakers worldwide produce millions of fewer cars this year while electronics giant Apple said shortages will hurt the sales of iPads and iPhones this year.

What Is A Semiconductor?

It all boils down to electrical properties. Anything that conducts electricity is called a conductor and one that doesn’t is called an insulator. “Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them” says Japanese major Hitachi.

Such as they are says US-based industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) “semiconductors are the brains of modern electronics… and technologies of the future such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and advanced wireless networks”.

How Are They Made?

Semiconductors — also known as integrated circuits (ICs) or microchips — are most often made of silicon or germanium or a compound like gallium arsenide. The process kicks off with the introduction into these pure elements of impurities with the goal of achieving crucial changes in the conductivity of the material. This step is known as doping.

As SIA says most semiconductors start off as sand which after being processed is melted into solid cylinders called ingots. These ingots are thereafter sliced into extremely thin pieces disc which in turn are “polished to a flawless finish”. This is a blank wafer. This blank wafer in the next step is printed with the intricate circuit design as they move to the stage where they become separate chips which happens through cutting them up into tiny individual semiconductors called dies.

The dies are then built into finished semiconductors and take the familiar shape in which they are finally inserted into devices.

This was the mechanical part of producing a semiconductor chip and is accomplished in what is known as a foundry. But the true art in making semiconductor chips lies in devising and designing them involving everything how the chip should operate how the circuit needs to be laid out to achieve that objective and including testing and verification to check that the chip does what it was meant to be.

A single firm that performs all the above steps is called an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) but the bulk of the business operates via a system where what is known as a ‘fabless firm’ designs the chip and then outsources its production to a foundry.

Fabless companies more often than not are located in the developed nations that can afford high investments in R&D while foundries are most likely to come up in countries where labour is abundant and cheap so as to keep production costs low like Taiwan — the world’s largest chipmaker — and China.

What Caused The Shortage Of Chips?

Mainly Covid as the pandemic it has wrought disrupted economic activity shut down factories and businesses and froze global supply chains.

As tech major IBM pointed out the sudden remote work-induced increase in the sales of consumer-electronic products worked as a double whammy in combination with a slowdown in chip production. But as an article in Money Control notes Covid-19 was not the only factor behind the shortage and “the tense relationship between the US and China” also played a part. As the US blacklisted Chinese companies American firms had to look elsewhere for chips something that also served to trigger shortages.

The sudden chip crunch and the debilitating impact it had on all kinds of industries — The Washington Post said that a company in Illinois in US that makes electronic dog-washing booths too was hit by the shortage — sent a shudder down strategic and policy circles sparking efforts to resolve supply chain issues and bottlenecks. The idea was to ensure that no one country played an outsize role in the semiconductor business.

With China’s increasingly assertive stance vis-a-vis Taiwan which Beijing considers part of its territory there was an added push to diversify chip production. So much so that one of the stated goals of the Quad alliance of the US Japan Australia and India is to “launch a joint initiative to map capacity identify vulnerabilities and bolster supply-chain security for semiconductors and their vital components”.

Where Does India Stand On Semiconductor Chip Production?

According to a March 2021 article on indiaai.gov.in an initiative of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Nasscom “semiconductors are a 100 per cent import sector” in India. However it noted that India “has a distinct advantage in chip design” with several global IDMs having established design centres in India. It cites MeitY to add that “India produces nearly 2000 chips every year and more than 20000 engineers in the country are involved in chip design”.

But India is nowhere yet on the global semiconductor radar. As SIA notes the US is the worldwide leader in semiconductors with about “half of global market share and sales of USD 208 billion in 2020”. As IEEE notes the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers are located in the US — which has four of the five global leaders: Intel NVIDIA Broadcom Texas Instruments Inc. (not in that order) — and the Asia-Pacific region where South Korea is home to a top-five player in Samsung.

The reason the semiconductor industry “is dominated by global giants” is due in part “to the enormous scale of the market and the costs of manufacturing integrated circuits and researching new technology” adds IEEE.

MeitY told Parliament in December this year that “semiconductor FABs are highly capital intensive and resource intensive and are at the cutting edge of manufacturing with rapidly changing technology cycles”. It acknowledged further that the semiconductor fabrication capability for leading/cutting edge technology nodes is available with only few companies

globally”.

How Is India Seeking To Boost Its Semiconductor Capabilities?

On December 15 the government came up with a Rs 76000-crore package “for development of semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem in India” announcing incentives of Rs 2.3 lakh crore “to position India as global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors as the foundational building block”.

Stating that the establishing domestic capabilities in semiconductor production “will have a multiplier effect across different sectors of the economy [and] promote higher domestic value addition in electronics manufacturing” it said that the success in this area “will contribute significantly to achieving a USD 1 trillion digital economy and a USD 5 trillion GDP by 2025”.

The scheme is aimed at providing a push to semiconductor and display manufacturing by enabling access to capital support and technological collaborations for companies engaged in production of everything from silicon semiconductor fabs display fabs validation assembly and testing and design.

One of the reputed new channels in India talks tall about the economics but never cared to analyze the reasons for such a profit drop due to shortage of “chips” for the automobile industries. Well I don’t blame them because hat their level of understanding. Let us analyze why there is a hue and cry about the chip. What is this chip and do we need to build this chip? What is the raw material to manufacture this chip? If you could understand these “small print” truths then we can answer what is happening with the automobile industry………for that matter why automobile industry tomorrow will be the same fate for any industry that depends on this “chip”.

Quartz/silica sand is the humble mineral that transformed the world…….from cities to rural villages. Not only quartz but various other minerals are widely talked about in the business community. A few years ago no one knows that such material exists on earth and it is a part of the rocks and soil on which we like. Now these precious minerals (never recognized before) are given various names…….energy transition metals and minerals technology transition minerals and so on. Except for a few countries the value of the earth’s resources is never even realized by the countries…..even modern India (I say modern India because our ancestors realized the importance and gave the true value to these minerals).

Quartz is the raw material for our “chip” It is changing our lives smartphones internet electric cars scooters rockets to space stations pacemakers to super-computers pancake making machines…..name any gadget in the world today……….the god is quartz- “Silicon Dioxide” ingredient of the semiconductor that supports all these gadgets. “Manufacturing transistors out of silicon allowed them to be made small enough to fit on a microchip opening the gates to a rush of gadgets that have become smaller and smarter by the year. Being able to miniaturize these transistors allows us to do things we couldn’t have imagined in previous generations All because we can put a massive computer onto a tiny chip.” says John Neuffer chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association.”

Si a product of SiO2 is found abundantly in the Earth’s crust. Nearly 90% of the crust is made up of SiO2. It is found as SiO2 or found in association with other silicate minerals. How is Si (silicon) manufactured?? This is an energy-intense process. The quartz or quartzite or silica sand ( SiO2) is mixed with coke and heated in a submerged electrode arc furnace. The SiO2 is reduced to SiC ( SiO2 + 3C = SiC + 2 CO + Mg) at temperatures between 1600 to 2000 °C. The SiC thus produced reacts further with SiO2 at higher temperatures to produce Si + SiO (gas) + CO (gas). The Si here is metallurgical grade silicon. This metallurgical grade Si is the raw material for electrical grade Si that is used in all the “chip” making industries. Well that is the story of the ‘chip”. Chip industry is a “blockchain”. It is interlinked between the countries and economies. Now when industries talk about raw material they mean Si and not SiO2. It is a misnomer. But these economists don’t understand that if SiO2 is not available or hoarded by a country then the economy plummets. SiO2 is available for generations. The Si refined from quartz and allied minerals support the $500bn chip industry that runs the global economy worth US$ 3tn. The top 5 major quartz exporting countries in terms of value (in US$) are China (72289000) Turkey (68161000) India (43827000) Spain ( 27107000) and the USA (21351000). Traditionally Mexico and Japan are major Si suppliers to the chip industry while China and USA make the chips. So these countries can take us for a ride as they are doing now. China is also making chips. They are not lagging behind. Around 5.4 million metric tons of silicon was produced in China in 2020 which accounted for about two-thirds of the global silicon production that year. There is absolutely no shortage of raw material. This is how the big brothers control the world economy. The common man should understand this- which the news reporters never even mention about it. India has over 4 billion tons of quartz and related minerals in reserves manly mined from Haryana Rajasthan Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. So when so much quartz is available with us it is our shortsighted policy not to have focused on this industry. What is point of shouting now that the automobile industry profits are plummeting? India has rich natural resources….you name it we have. REE (Rare Earth Element minerals) atomic minerals (Th and U) and energy transition minerals (not Li). The west looted the beach sands rich in atomic minerals and titanium zirconium silica garnet minerals worth millions of dollars in the current economy.

The technology to miniaturize the chip has grown like a virus. Gordon Moore co-founder of microchip giant Intel 50 years ago predicted that the number of transistors that you could fit on a chip would double every two years. Absolutely correct. Now the chip industry has to look into the structure of the body cells and neurons to further miniaturize the chip and multiply its efficiency. I am sure someone should be doing it now. Billions of transistors are now embedded into a tiny chip that the naked eye cannot see. All the developments are achieved by humans like you and me. Institutes of higher learning in the countries played an important role in developing the technology. In the case of India IITs and other similar institutes played an important role globally in developing the chip. I keep wondering now why no one in these institutes or the technocrats in the country have foreseen this crisis of chip shortage for the automobile industry. What we don’t have? We have quartz we have metallurgical technocrats both from automobile sectors and other supporting industries. We have huge funding agencies and national laboratories. What we lack is vision and visionaries. Whether it is medicine industries sciences sports…..we should have a healthy national debate as to what India should be doing for the next 10 years. If we have one then we failed to foresee these issues or the visionaries are shortsighted. Whatever we say China has for ahead of other countries in the world. Take for example any technology business material education…….the country is at the top. Some of my friends argue that they copy…..I cannot understand what is meant by “copy”. Now for the automobile crisis in India who is holding the stick….China and the US. The news reporters as I said should focus on this primary issue rather than reporting that India’s automobile industry is in the doldrums. The basic issue is the lack of collaboration understanding and dialogue between the industries and the institutes of higher learning. With so much raw material (for me raw material is quartz and not silicon) available in the country and state-of-art metallurgical institutes in the country why India should have a shortage of chips for the auto industry? It is a shame. When I hear the news about this shortage my mind spins. NEP tried to change this mindset. Still our textbook fights over mundane issues rather than focusing and tuning the younger generations to future problem-solving equations. IITs have started with incubators/start-ups. It is a good initiative but over the last 12 years the status is not encouraging. The start-ups should be headed by an able technocrat who can get the things done rather than people with poor efficiency and track record. Now it is not too late. The country can transform Indian industry into a global industry in all fields……..as long as we don’t always borrow material from other countries. The news reporters should focus on the root cause analyze and open the debate and tell public where we fault rather than sensationalize the issues. Today it is automobile industry and tomorrow it could be mobile phone you are using. The shortage as I said is artificial. Read what the news papers say:- According to “Nikkei Asia” “the world’s nine leading chipmakers hit a record high of $64.7 million worth of raw materials inventory in June as they continue to ramp up production. The total inventory for these chipmakers including TSMC Intel Samsung Micron SK Hynix Western Digital and more is now at historic highs. The amount of raw materials in total inventory has been steadily increasing since March of 2019 to the point where all these companies have at least 24% more inventory than ever before. Despite the large stockpiling of raw materials demand for semiconductor chips has remained incredibly high negating the increased output. This is largely thanks to the automotive industry which is believed to be purchasing far more chips than it needs for building cars. Traditionally automakers order chips as they are needed. But now many automotive companies plan to switch gears by holding years worth of stock to ensure there’s enough of a buffer to hold out in case of another shortage. However “there are ways to ensure that does not happen. For example Toyota wants to create a new centralized inventory that monitors both chip manufacturing output and how many chips are headed to its storage sites. This solution could potentially be great for chipmakers allowing automakers to not overbuy chips and preventing a massive demand drought.” Reports the newspaper. The automobile industry is not the largest consumer of the “chip” This shortage is driven by smartphone and computer sales. Then why blame the auto industry for the shortage of chips? Says “Nikkei Asia”. This is a lesson for the country with huge amount of raw material. What is the shortage……raw material or visionaries?

Verso's Board of Directors acting upon the recommendation of a special committee of Verso's Board has unanimously approved and resolved to recommend approval of the merger by Verso's shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.

The consideration corresponds to a premium of approximately 35% compared to closing price of Verso's shares on December 17 2021; a premium of approximately 26% compared to Verso's volume-weighted average share price during the last 30 trading days; and a premium of approximately 57% compared to the unaffected closing price of Verso's shares on July 9 2021 the day prior to Atlas Holdings' submission of an unsolicited non-binding proposal to acquire Verso for $20.00 per share in cash.

The acquisition of Verso is fully in line with BillerudKorsnäs' strategy to drive profitable growth in paperboard and the ambition to expand into North America. BillerudKorsnäs aims to build one of the most cost-efficient and sustainable paperboard platforms in North America by converting several of Verso's assets into paperboard machines while maintaining Verso's position as a quality and cost leader in specialty and coated freesheet paper.

In making this acquisition BillerudKorsnäs recognizes that Verso's strategic assets are positioned in a region with abundant and cost-effective fiber supply suitable for production of premium packaging materials. Verso's location also presents favorable export opportunities to both Asia and Europe. Verso will become the platform for BillerudKorsnäs' future expansion in North America and is expected to provide continuous growth opportunities over the next ten years and beyond. The combined company will be one of the largest providers of virgin fiber paper and packaging with a cost and quality advantage.

Randy Nebel President and Chief Executive Officer of Verso said ""With the support of our talented team Verso has successfully streamlined our operations and reduced costs while strategically investing in projects to enhance our ability to support our customers. This transaction builds upon our considerable progress and better positions the combined company to invest in our North American manufacturing capability provide high-quality paper products to customers and accelerate growth.""

Mr. Nebel continued ""This agreement follows careful consideration and negotiation led by the special committee of our Board which was formed following receipt of the unsolicited proposal earlier this year. Our full Board believes this transaction maximizes value for shareholders who will receive a significant premium and immediate and certain value. In BillerudKorsnäs we found a partner that shares our commitments to safety quality sustainability and innovation and is uniquely positioned to recognize the value of our business. We are grateful for BillerudKorsnäs' partnership over the past several months in reaching this compelling transaction particularly amidst an uncertain and restrictive pandemic-related travel environment. We are excited to join forces with BillerudKorsnäs and benefit from enhanced opportunities as part of a larger stronger organization.""

Christoph Michalski President and CEO of BillerudKorsnäs commented ""The combination of BillerudKorsnäs' expertise in high-quality virgin fiber packaging materials and Verso's attractive assets creates an excellent platform for long-term profitable growth. We will obtain cost-effective production of coated virgin fiber material in the Midwestern United States. We also plan to sequentially transform part of the business into paperboard production while continuing to serve the U.S. customers. Our investments will create new U.S.-based jobs in a growing market and accelerate the transition from plastic-based packaging materials to renewable sources.""

Investing in Verso's Platform

BillerudKorsnäs plans to convert Verso's largest facility its Escanaba Mill into a world-class sustainable fully integrated paperboard production site. One machine is estimated to be converted by 2025 a second machine by 2029 with a total capacity of around 1200000 tons (1100 ktonnes). BillerudKorsnäs estimates that the investment for the conversion project will be up to approximately $1 billion2.

In addition to continued paper production in Escanaba during the conversion BillerudKorsnäs plans to continue operating the Quinnesec Mill a cost and quality leader in graphic paper specifically in coated freesheet and specialty papers. The mill has the capacity to produce about 430000 tons (400 ktonnes) of graphic and specialty papers and 240000 tons (200 ktonnes) of market pulp per year.

BillerudKorsnäs is committed to continuing to serve Verso's existing customers.

Additional Transaction Details

The acquisition will be effected pursuant to a definitive merger agreement under which Verso will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of BillerudKorsnäs. The acquisition will be primarily financed by BillerudKorsnäs through increased debt and operating cash flow. Closing of the transaction is not subject to any financing condition.

A special meeting of Verso's shareholders is expected to be convened following the mailing to Verso's shareholders of a proxy statement for the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022 subject to the approval of Verso's shareholders as well as receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals include U.S. antitrust approval as well as approval from relevant state and federal energy regulatory authorities in the U.S.

Scientist Prof Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy said this on Saturday as he addressed that the inauguration ceremony of the Usman Institute Technology (UIT) University on Saturday. The former Usman Institute of Technology has turned into a varsity after the Sindh government upgraded its status to a degree-awarding institute.

Earlier the UIT was affiliated with the NED University of Engineering and Technology.

Dr Hoodbhoy shared that earlier publishing 12 research papers was considered a huge achievement but now academics were trying to get 100s of their papers published resulting in large-scale substandard research works.

Due to the trend of publishing substandard research papers in large quantity the speaker asserted those professors and students were being discouraged who worked hard and consumed time in publishing quality papers.

He added that the phenomenon of publishing more and more research papers in a short span of time had devalued research work in Pakistan. “This needs to be stopped.”

The chief guest at the ceremony was Sindh Governor Imran Ismail. He said “The Youth is the future of our country. I am happy to come to such institutions which are equipped with all the technological facilities for which we send our children to study abroad.”

Addressing the governor Dr Hoodbhoy said that the software exports of India this year had been $160 billion and Pakistan’s were $2 billion. “We don’t have a space programme. Indians have reached Mars. Their pharmaceutical export is around $30 billion and Pakistan’s is $300 million” he remarked. “These are painful facts and cannot be changed unless we change the higher education system in the country.”

To this the governor responded that such a comparison of Pakistan with India was unfair because the size of both the economies was different. He however agreed that Pakistan was below its potential and there were ways to improve that.

“The largest programme our government initiated was Kamyaab Jawan Programme which will fill the gaps in the market” Ismail said. He explained that the students in financial duress were unable to pursue their dreams and the graduates generally did not want to exert pressure on their families and that was why the government in its Kamyaab Jawan Programme was offering Rs50 million loan to them.

The governor said that the government had also initiated the Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme in which low-cost housing was being offered to the public and then there was the Sehat Card Programme with which the public could have medical treatment costing up to Rs1 million. Unfortunately he said the programme could not be implemented in Sindh as the provincial government was not willing to participate in the programme.

Ismail opined that wealth making in Pakistan was considered a crime. He however added that not all businessmen and successful people were plunderers. One should not consider a successful businessman corrupt he said.

The governor congratulated UIT University Chancellor Hussain Hasham and the board members on the occasion.

Acting Vice Chancellor Dr Shoaib Zaidi said the UIT has been serving since 1994 as a non-profit organisation. He told the event that more than 4000 graduates of the institute were serving in reputed firms not only in Pakistan but also internationally.

He said that their students had designed six chips from a design process to actual fabrication which was an extremely rare process for undergraduate students. He added that a top-rated firewall company in the world Palo Alto Networks had the name of UIT on its website included among academies in Pakistan.

Political and corporate leaders and industrial dignitaries including the board members of the Usman Memorial Foundation were also present at the ceremony.",,,,,,,,,

The Michael Curtiz-directed musical went on to earn an Oscar nomination for Irving Berlin song “Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep” at the 27th Academy Awards. The Hollywood Reporter’s original review is below:

In its first VistaVision presentation Paramount offers the exhibitor a stockingful of exploitable assets. First there is the immense pulling power of the two great stars Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye who appear together for the first time. With these is the name of Mike Curtiz one of the world’s top directors who has been associated with a long succession of the industry’s greatest hits and most intelligently made pictures. The piquant personality and twinkling legs of the lithe and youthful little dancer Vera-Ellen are another asset. Then there is the vast and exploitable appeal of Rosemary Clooney to the disc jockey public and the platter fans.

Added to this is the magic of Irving Berlin’s lyrics and music that never have failed to win a warm and secure place in the affections of the American public. By the time the picture is released the whole country should be whistling a batch of new tunes which include: “Count Your Blessings” “Snow” “The Old Man” “Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army” “The Best Things Happen While You’re Dancing” and “Love You Didn’t Do Right By Me.” Of even more appeal is the revival of two well-loved old Berlin numbers “Blue Skies” and “White Christmas.”

It will be a poor showman who can’t get an audience into the theatre when he can base his sales talks upon such expertly assembled and tangible box office ingredients. But the exceptional theatre operator won’t be content with this. He will spare no effort to let all veterans of World War II know that this is their picture. For this is the audience that should feel a great emotional charge from the film and the one that if properly appealed to should go out spreading the enthusiastic word of mouth that will produce the long runs that are necessary if this lavish and expensive Technicolor effort is to show the profit it hopes for.

Curtiz directing one of the finest opening sequences he ever has placed on the screen shows a tired and chewed-up division on the Western Front trying to put on a farewell Christmas entertainment for a well-loved battle-weary fighting general who is about to be relieved of his command. Dean Jagger gives a superb performance as this gallant and competent officer. When the story moves down to the present day we find him a forgotten hero quietly going broke as he makes desperate efforts to manage a failing little New England inn. To his aid comes a former captain (Crosby) and a former buck private (Kaye) both of whom are now big wheels on Broadway. The finish is as corny and sentimental as only service men can be when a general is trying to conceal his softness beneath a protective wall of trumped up gruffness. Yet such is the genius of Curtiz the corniness seems an authentic part of the characterizations. It highlights rather than interferes with the emotional impact of the climax.

This is a story of loyalties and affections that bind together men who have faced peril and hardship together. It is well that it is done so well for without it the story would be nothing more than the standard Paramount plot that has been serving the studio for an awful lot of years. The boy (Crosby) meets the girl (Miss Clooney). The friend (Kaye) and the other girl (Vera-Ellen) try to aid the romance. Bing and Rosemary have a carefully contrived and rather unimportant misunderstanding. She thinks he’s a heel but all is well in the end. Miss Clooney is an attractive girl but she’s also the weak spot in the picture for she lacks the photographic glamour and change of pace necessary to sustain a love story. This element of the film might have been better if Vera-Ellen had been entrusted with the principal romantic interest. It might also have been better if Kaye and Crosby had exchanged parts with Bing playing the conniving “Mr. Fixit” (as he’s done so magnificently in Hope-Crosby pictures). Kaye’s romantic dancing with Vera-Ellen then would have strengthened the love story.

However the public will be buying the Crosby-Kaye team in the expectation of seeing comedy. Danny’s genius for wild and zany specialties played against Crosby’s monumental and hilarious nonchalance could have produced some history making screen fun. The opportunity was so obvious and so inviting that one wonders why it was overlooked. Producer Robert Emmett Dolan lets the two ablest farceurs in the business show what they can do in a female impersonation called “Sisters.” Another time it seems that Danny is going to get a chance to really let go in a ballet burlesque called “Choreography” but it switches to one more top routine for Vera-Ellen. So the general’s appealing situation must compensate for disappointments in both romance and comedy. Mary Wickes as his housekeeper and Anne Whitfield as his granddaughter are excellent at building this up. — Jack Moffitt originally published on August 27 1954",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmlvZGllc2VsbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3BpbGxhcnMtb2YtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMjUxNzg5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pillars of New Production,"2025 International Biomass Conference & Expo

Following the result the Oklahoma City Thunder flipped the page on a three-game win streak now holding a 9-19 record.

With the Thunder down 103-101 wielding 6.9 seconds to go Shai Gilgeous-Alexander took one dribble stepped back to his right and heaved a right-winged 27-footer – drilling the shot for the game.

Gilgeous-Alexander’s buzzer-beating finish marked the third and final lead change in the fourth while also netting the second-straight buzzer-beater in the Paycom adding to Devonte’ Graham’s 61-foot conversion on Wednesday.

Depleted of George and Leonard the Clippers centralized around guard play Saturday as 3-of-4 double-digit scorers came out of the backcourt.

Luke Kennard took reins of Los Angeles’ sharpshooting role early bolstering a 15-point first half for 27 points and 7 rebounds while Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson finished with 18 points and 16 points respectively.

For the Thunder they took to the perimeter without LA’s stars piecing together a 12-of-31 (38.7%) outing from deep including the game winner.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander struck the final blow on Saturday to finish the evening with 18 points and 6 assists. SGA played in the shadows for the betterment of the game but as the lights got bigger – the 23-year-old rose to the occassion. In SGA’s game-winner the guard drew his second-career game-winning bucket – lastly doing so December 26 2020.

Josh Giddey fell inches shy of becoming the youngest NBA player to ever log a triple-double (19 years 69 days) capping Saturday with 8 points 18 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes. Giddey looked on track for the record in the sunset stages of the third frame with 8 points 11 rebounds and 10 assists; however he failed to notch anything in the point column. Giddey’s passing-game purveyed from start to finish dazzling the home crowd with a flurry of transition dimes and needle threaders.

Lu Dort showed little sign of injury ending his 37-minute sample with 29 points and 5 rebounds. Dort erupted during the second frame with 10 points. With a steal Dort nearly put Oklahoma City in the lead inside the final minute but a blown fastbreak layup saw the ball fall out of bounds.

Tre Mann served as the Thunder’s microwave off the bench Saturday evening. Mann wore down the Clippers’ defense from the onset stringing together a pair of stepbacks and a buzzer-beater to reach double-digits in his seven minutes

Following 84-consecutive starts Darius Bazley started Saturday in the second unit. In Baze’s 24-minute cut the 21-year-old tallied 10 points and 2 rebounds on a 3-of-8 shooting clip.

In place of Bazley Aaron Wiggins wielded a starting gig placing 5 points across 18 minutes.

Next up the Oklahoma City Thunder (9-19) square off against the Memphis Grizzlies (19-11.)

In their last game against the New Orleans Pelicans SGA hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 1.4 seconds left before Devonte' Graham launched a Hail Mary from his own half to win it at the buzzer but tonight SGA wouldn't be denied capping off a late-game comeback with the game-winner against his former team the LA Clippers.

Gilgeous-Alexander was having a quieter game by his standards but delivered when his team needed it most.

His layup and a 3-pointer gave them a 93-86 lead midway through the fourth quarter and the Thunder held a narrow lead for most of the final period before Nic Batum's triple gave the Clippers a 101-97 lead with 32.9 seconds to go.

Gilgeous-Alexander cut the deficit to 103-101 with 10.4 on the clock before Justise Winslow missed a pair of free throws to set up the Thunder's final play out of a timeout.

""Obviously a game of ups and downs I was bad for most of it but I tried to just think next play mentality and try to do whatever it takes to get a W and thank God we got one tonight"" he said postgame.

""We pulled it out.""

SGA finished with 18 points and six assists while fellow Canadian Lu Dort led the way with a game-high 29 points. Rookie Josh Giddey hauled in a career-high 18 rebounds to go with eight points and 10 assists falling just shy of his first triple-double and the record for the youngest triple-double in NBA history.

With the 104-103 win the Thunder improve to 9-19 on the season but remain at the bottom of the Western Conference.

They wrap up their four-game homestand and now head to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies in their next game on Monday Dec. 20 with tip-off at 8:00 p.m. ET.

Lu Dort led the Thunder with 29 points while rookie Josh Giddey had a fantastic near-triple-double with eight points 18 rebounds and 10 assists.

Gilgeous-Alexander had a relatively quiet game and up until the final seconds had just 15 points and six assists in 36 minutes. He drilled the most important shot of the night as the buzzer-sounded though stunning the Clippers.

HART Cincinnati received so many donations it needed three trailers to deliver all the items.

“They underwent a horrible tragedy and they can use all the help that they can get” Katie Goodpaster with HART Cincinnati said.“We had created an Amazon wishlist and in that wish list we have had over 1100 orders purchased through Amazon. We have had over $27000 donated to our website via our PayPal link.”

Shari Wyenandt who’s also part of the group added “It grew. So many people donated and kept donating. They were sending things from our Amazon wishlist. The money just kept coming in. We never thought it would be this huge.”

The group of volunteers returned with puppies and dogs. Some of them are injured after the tornadoes.

“We have to make sure that they get into the vet and examined” Goodpaster said. “We give them their vaccines they're spayed and neutered. Also micro-chipped. We’re going to wait until they're ready to be adopted because they've been through some trauma. We haven't found any adoptive homes but we have found foster homes for all of them. So while they're decompressing and relaxing they'll get plenty of food they'll be warm they'll be safe and get a lot of love from the fosters.”

Later the entire company was bought by eBay.

The employees of Paypal had a difficult time adjusting to eBay’s more traditional policies which resulted in everyone except 12 of them leaving the company.

The “Paypal Mafia” is a term coined to refer to these former employees and founders of the company who went on to develop and fund many of the technology firms that are a daily part of everyone’s lives today. Most of these members attended Stanford University or the University of Illinois at some point in their academic careers.

Who Are The Paypal Mafia?

The Paypal Mafia consists of some of the most powerful and richest men in Silicon Valley. Below is a breakdown of exactly how powerful some of these men are and what their net worth and achievements look like.

1. Jawed Karim –

Jawed Karim is the brain behind the design and implementation of Paypal’s real-time anti-fraud system. After Paypal Karim Chad Hurley (who designed the first Paypal logo) and Steve Chen (former Facebook employee) decided to launch a video-sharing app called “YouTube” which was later bought by Google in November 2006 for $1.65 billion. Karim’s estimated net worth is around $140 million.

2. Jeremy Stoppelman –

Jeremy Stoppelman started out as an engineer in Paypal when it was still X.com eventually rising to the position of Vice President of Engineering. Immediately after leaving Paypal he dreamt up the idea of the extremely popular review site called Yelp along with a former Paypal employee Russel Simmons. Jeremy Stoppelman’s estimated net worth is around $111-222 million.

3. Luke Nosek –

One of the core co-founders of Paypal alongside Elon Musk Peter Thiel and Ken Howery Luke Nosek left the company to go travel the world before finding a San Francisco-based venture capital firm Founders’ Fund with Thiel and Howery in 2005. The estimated net worth of Nosek is around $1.2 billion.

4. Ken Howery –

A co-founder and Chief Financial Officer of the company he left to join Founders’ Fund along with Thiel and Howery. Ken Howery’s estimated net worth is around $1.5 billion and he is also available for consulting sessions if you happen to have a spare $100000 laying around somewhere.

5. Peter Thiel –

The co-founder and CEO of Paypal Thiel immediately founded hedge fund Clarium Capital after earning $55 million from his 3.7 % stake in the eBay deal. He made the decision to invest $500000 in Facebook and was the first person who sold his Paypal shares to make $1 billion. Thiel’s estimated net worth is $2.2 billion.

6. Reid Hoffman –

Hoffman joined the company after leaving the world’s first failed social media network SocialNet. He not only became a member of the board of directors but was also made the full-time COO.

He then went on to become the chief executive vice president by the time the company was taken over by eBay. He founded LinkedIn in December of 2002 and now owns a $2.39 billion stake in the company. Currently Reid Hoffman’s estimated net worth is around $3.3 billion.

7. Elon Musk –

The most famous and well-known of this prolific group Musk’s financial services and email payment firm X.com merged with Paypal in 1999 leading to Musk becoming the largest stakeholder of the new company by the time it was sold to eBay. He earned a whopping amount of $165 million from the deal. Musk’s list of achievements extends to the corners of the world.

He launched Space Exploration Technologies(SpaceX) in June 2002 where he is the CEO and CTO. In 2008 Musk became the leader of the electric car firm Tesla Motors. Elon Musk tops the list of the richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of $9.7 billion.

What Are The Lessons The Paypal Mafia Teach?

At this point one can easily understand the control and power these men hold. The chances of a startup becoming a unicorn which is a company with a billion dollar+ valuation is 0.001%. However for these men those chances are at a commendable 50%.

Peter Thiel has his fair share of haters due to his views of monopolies in markets being better than competitive markets in the economy. Thiel describes his interests best by his quote:

“Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not start an operating system. The next Larry Page won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys you aren’t learning from them.”

The Paypal Mafia’s existence raises valid points from the vantage of finance technology and progress as a whole. Adopting the ideas of the tycoons of the world only to improve them by merely 10% is not the progress the world requires.

Learning from these men and implementing the lessons in a unique and new approach of your own is the sure way to bank on higher returns from your investment.

The world does not need to wait for a ‘new Elon Musk’ or Zuckerberg to reach higher heights. These men already exist and have been helping the world progress.

The Paypal Mafia’s glaring success after quitting their jobs is heavily rooted in the fact that each of them launched absolutely unique concepts and companies and took risks with their investments which served the technological and financial world. All of these men’s contributions have shaped the current technological and financial world as we know it.

The story so far: The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPV&FRA) revoked PepsiCo India’s registration of its potato variety used to make Lays chips earlier this month more than two years after the multinational food giant sued Gujarati farmers for allegedly infringing its rights by growing and selling its registered variety. The wider implications of the verdict for intellectual property rights in the agricultural sector are being examined by farmers’ groups as well as seed developers and industrial agriculture companies both international and Indian.

What does the verdict mean for farmers’ rights?

Although the PPV&FRA verdict largely depended on procedural errors and shortcomings of PepsiCo and the registrar with regard to documentation and transfer of rights between the plant breeder and the production company it does touch briefly on the protection of farmers’ rights and public interest. “[F]armers have been put to hardship including the looming possibility of having to pay huge penalty on the purported infringement they were supposed to have been committing” said the judgment noting that PepsiCo had claimed damages of more than ₹1 crore each from small farmers. “This violates public interest” it added allowing farmers’ groups to claim that the verdict sent a strong signal to those who hold intellectual property rights for seeds that the unique rights that the PPV&FR Act provides Indian farmers are not to be transgressed.

Kapil Shah of the Kisan Beej Adhikar Manch one of the Gujarat activists who spearheaded the initial protests also emphasised the difference in rights provided under law to farmers and breeders.

‘Producing from a variety’ including a farmer saving seed and using unbranded seed from a harvest is very different to ‘producing a variety’ which involves breeders following complex technical procedures that farmers largely do not have the skills for. There is no risk of commercial competition for the IPR owner in the first case when harvests are meant for consumption processing and the grocery market unlike in the latter case when harvests are meant for further planting and multiplication of the genome or to generate heterosis in hybrid varieties he said.

Does the PPV&FR Act encourage innovation and protect intellectual property rights of seed developers?

The biggest problem with the law is the lack of proper enforcement according to the seeds industry. “There must be a mechanism to catch and punish those who illegally sell the variety but enforcement is left to States and is patchy at best” said Federation of Seed Industry of India director general Ram Kaundinya to The Hindu  pointing to the rampant spread of unauthorised and genetically modified HTBt cotton seeds as an example of this.

He added that the unique protections provided to farmers in India can act as an enforcement loophole given the grey area between farmers and aggregators. “A farmer is allowed to grow protected varieties sell the produce even sell the unbranded seeds under the law and that intention is good. But what happens when many farmers sell registered seeds to an aggregator who collects it and then sells it in a branded fashion or sells to a competitor? If the aggregator owns an acre of land somewhere he may also call himself a farmer” pointed out Mr. Kaundinya adding that pilferage of the parent seed from farmers’ fields is also a concern.

Other issues with PPV&FR implementation which obstruct innovation include the slow turnaround time for registration of varieties and the requirement that companies submit parent seeds when applying for registration. “Forget foreign investment even domestic investment in innovation is low because of lack of protection of IPR. The Indian seed market has annual revenues of ₹20000 crore but less than 3% or about ₹500-600 crore is ploughed back into research in contrast with 10-12% which is the global standard” he noted.

How does contract farming law impact the issue?

With the first national contract farming law passed by Parliament last year being repealed last month under pressure from protesting farm unions there is no uniformity among the few State laws that exist. The seed industry which depends on farmers for seed production prefers to deal with local contractors rather than sign direct contracts with farmers.

“If a contract is violated there is no way for us to enforce it at the village level so it is better to deal with a local player and form tripartite agreements. It is inconceivable for any company to sue a farmer” said Mr. Kaundinya noting that PepsiCo and Monsanto have faced political and public backlash for doing so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9oZXJzdG9yeS8yMDIxLzEyL3llYXItcmV2aWV3LTIwMjEtYm9va3MtaW5kcmEtbm9veWktcHJpeWFua2EtY2hvcHJh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Year in Review 2021] 7 women authors who created a buzz,"Winter is here and it’s time to cozy up and read.





The past year threw up a slew of interesting books by women authors. From memoirs and fiction to history and food tales authors offered up a diverse reading list that provided warmth succour interesting stories and food for thought.

Priyanka Chopra Indra Nooyi and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni

Actor Priyanka Chopra and former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi published their memoirs while Tahmima Anama wrote a brilliant tale about a woman in the startup world and Chitra Banerjee revisited the little-known life of Maharani Jindan Kaur.





Here is our list of books by women those that we read (and mostly) enjoyed.

My Life in Full Indra Nooyi

This year finally saw a memoir from former PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi - My Life in Full a 320-page treatise on living and making it big in a man’s world. Nooyi takes us through different phases of her life from growing up in a traditional joint family in Madras and then moving to the US to chase the American dream.





The book also reveals organisational support without which Nooyi wouldn't have become what she is today. Most importantly it sheds light on how that also plays a part in how she perceives her colleagues and their contribution to the company.





She also highlights the gender bias present in large corporations and outlines that the road to becoming a CEO was not easy. But she always took her thatha’s (grandfather) words wherever she went “give it your all”.

Unfinished Priyanka Chopra

The former Ms World and India’s biggest crossover star Priyanka Chopra’s memoir Unfinished is a long one-sided conversation ‘unfinished’ in most parts with the reader left wanting for more. Replete with hashtags that complete her giggly persona the book has information already in the public domain. It’s also replete with ""Peeceeisms"".

“If you put water into a cup it becomes a cup. You put water in a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.”

The philosophical takes apart it’s one long rambling account of her life through fame grief and marriage.

By Her Own Rules Ma Anand Sheela

As second-in-command to controversial Godman Osha Rajneesh Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Birnstiel) enjoyed close access to the guru and also the infamy that came along with it.





The falling out with her Bhagwan was even more controversial. She was accused of siphoning off large sums of money and also unleashing a bio-terror attack in Rajneeshpuram (Oregon). She spent 39 months in prison and later started life anew as a caregiver.





Her memoir By Her Own Rules highlights 13 rules she lives by and talks majorly of life “giving her a second chance”.

The Startup Wife Tahmima Anam

Tahmima Anam’s The Startup Wife is a comical and satirical take on the tech startup world full of quirky and interesting characters.





The protagonist Asha Ray a brilliant coder gives up her PhD programme to team up with her high school crush-turned-husband Cyrus Jones and friend Jules to work on a social networking app WAI (We Are Infinite) at an incubator called Utopia. What happens when the app gains popularity and Cyrus is catapulted into the centre of it all? How does it affect their relationship and their fledgling startup?

The book travels down the road highlighting sexism faith and the startup culture as it injects huge doses of satire and comedy to keep the reader in splits.

The Last Queen Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni

Very little is known of Maharani Jindan Kaur – a kennel keeper’s daughter who become the youngest and last queen of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Defying tradition she stepped outside the palace cast aside her veil and fought hard to keep the British from annexing Punjab. A fiercely protective mother she became regent when her son Dalip was barely six-years-old. In The Last Queen Chitra examines in detail the love story her relationships with other queens and why the British vilified her as a ‘prostitute’ a seductress and the Messaline of Punjab.





In an interview with HerStory Chitra said “I think it is crucial for a culture to admire its women and have many women role models of different kinds - especially women who go through difficulties and emerge stronger. That is why I write these stories - in the hope that they will inspire my readers to handle their own difficulties with intelligence and determination as Mother Sita Draupadi and Maharani Jindan do.”

Recipes for Life Sudha Menon

Sudha Menon’s Recipes for Life germinated from two personal experiences – her conversations with her mother after the death of her father and the resultant cooking sessions and writing down of recipes. A few months later Sudha’s mother-in-law a fabulous cook passed on ravaged by dementia. With her went recipes that had come down generations because none of her children had bothered to take notes.

The book is both an ode to food and the emotions behind it.

Sudha spoke to 30 personalities from different fields and documented their mother’s recipes in the book a repertoire of food that symbolises a mother’s love home and memories. Whether it’s boxer Mary Kom banker Uday Kotak Michelin star chef Atul Kocchar or politician Shashi Tharoor Sudha’s list is exhaustive and complete with interesting reminiscences.

As rates of COVID-19 infections rise during the holidays and omicron cases surface across the United States drug companies Pfizer and Merck are preparing to launch the first COVID-19 pills. If authorized by the Food and Drug Administration these at-home treatments could be prescribed by doctors and picked up at your local pharmacy to reduce the risk of becoming severely ill.

""In early clinical research studies both [drugs] demonstrated a significant decrease in the progression of COVID-19 in high-risk patients"" said Dr. Roy M. Gulick chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.

Both drug companies emphasize that their medications will likely be effective against the omicron variant.

Public health officials remain concerned about a pending winter surge. People with higher risk factors -- the unvaccinated immune compromised elderly and those with chronic conditions -- need the pills most and may benefit the most said Dr. Arthur Kim an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.

But with both pills on the cusp of potential FDA authorization physicians have expressed concern about uptake and access. One concern is that the pills need to be taken early -- within the first three to five days after diagnosis.

They are most effective ""before a person becomes critically ill"" said Dr. Paul Currier director of the Respiratory Acute Care Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Once a patient becomes critically ill the virus has already caused a lot of inflammation in the body that likely cannot be stopped by medicines that only target the virus itself.""

That could pose a logistics challenge experts said as people with mild symptoms are currently encouraged to stay home to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others.

At first the pills will only be available with a doctor's prescription and with health care resources still strained ""delays in testing and capacity will reduce their effectiveness in the real world"" Kim said.

Both treatments require patients to take several pills twice per day for five days.

But pharmaceutical executives are optimistic that the pills will make a significant dent in the pandemic.

Pfizer's pill has the ""potential to save the lives of patients around the world"" said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.

Bourla estimated that 1200 deaths and 6000 hospitalizations would be prevented for every 100000 COVID-19 patients who take the pills.

But pharmaceutical companies say emphatically these pills should be used as a last resort and for patients who are already sick. Getting vaccinated is by far the safest and most effective way to prevent getting COVID-19 or becoming severely sick if you do.

""I want to emphasize that no one should use the existence of the pill as an excuse to avoid vaccination"" Bourla said.

""The best way to prevent getting seriously ill from COVID-19 is to use the strongest preventative measures we have: wearing masks and getting vaccinated"" Currier said.

When taken early Pfizer's treatment was 89% effective at reducing the risk of severe illness hospitalization and/or death from COVID-19 according to the company. Merck's pill meanwhile reduced the risk of severe illness hospitalization and death by 30% it said.

If authorized by the FDA Merck and Pfizer's COVID-19 pills could be available as early as next month.

Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in a presentation to investors that the company expects some regions to continue to see pandemic levels of COVID-19 cases over the next year or two. Other countries will transition to ""endemic"" with low manageable caseloads during that same time period.

By 2024 the disease should be endemic around the globe the company projected.

""When and how exactly this happens will depend on evolution of the disease how effectively society deploys vaccines and treatments and equitable distribution to places where vaccination rates are low"" Dolsten said. ""The emergence of new variants could also impact how the pandemic continues to play out.""

Pfizer developed its COVID-19 vaccine with Germany's BioNTech SE and currently expects it to generate revenue of $31 billion next year. It plans to make 4 billion shots next year.

The drugmaker also has an experimental antiviral pill called Paxlovid which reduced hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk individuals by nearly 90% in a clinical trial.

Three analysts estimate sales of $15 billion to $25 billion for it next year according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Pfizer's forecast came after the emergence of the omicron variant last month which has more than 50 mutations compared with the original version of the virus. That has reduced the effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine against infection and spurred fear of rapid spread around the globe.

Prior to the omicron variant top U.S. disease doctor Anthony Fauci forecast the pandemic would end in 2022 in the United States.

Pediatric vaccine

The Pfizer vaccine is authorized in the United States for people aged 5 and older. But it said on Friday that its study in children between the ages of 2 and 4 who were given two 3-microgram doses of the vaccine found it did not create the same immune response that a larger dose of the vaccine had in older children.

The 3-microgram dose did generate a similar immune response in children aged 6 to 24 months the company said. The company said it will now test a three-dose course in both age groups as well as in older children. It had previously expected data from 2- to 4-year-olds this year but said it did not expect the delay would meaningfully change plans to file for emergency use authorization in the second quarter of 2022.

Pfizer and BioNTech have also been developing a version of their vaccine tailored to combat the quick-spreading omicron variant although they have not decided whether it will be needed. They expect to start a clinical trial for the updated vaccine in January Pfizer executives said.

Variant-specific shots if needed could boost sales in 2022. The highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus has been det

ected in over 77 countries and has spread to about one-third of U.S. states.The vaccine was around 95% effective in the adult clinical trial but Pfizer has said that immunity wanes some months after the second dose. Early data suggests that three doses of the shot may be necessary to protect against the omicron variant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL2JkLnVzZW1iYXNzeS5nb3YvdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy1kb25hdGVzLWFub3RoZXItMS03OC1taWxsaW9uLXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lcy10by1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXJhaXNpbmctdGhlLXRvdGFsLWFtb3VudC1vZi1kb25hdGlvbnMtdG8tMTgtNS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Donates Another 1.78 Million Pfizer Vaccines to Bangladesh Raising the Total Amount of Donations to ...,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

If you got Sinovac or Sinopharm originally it won’t hurt to boost with an mRNA vaccine–and it might help.

No one really knows what the BEST combination is at this point but overall protection is higher for those who do opt for a different brand booster shot. And most important there have been no safety issues among those who opt for a different brand booster.

If you got the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine when it became available you’re probably wondering: which booster should I get? Is it safe to get a Pfizer or Moderna booster if I got Sinovac originally? Is it as effective (or perhaps even more effective) than sticking with the original vaccine brand?

“Mix-and-match” refers to whenever we get one vaccine type for the primary series and then another type for the booster. There are a lot of COVID-19 vaccines out there at this point but all of them do the same thing: they train our immune system to recognize a threat by showing something similar to our immune cells. Some vaccines (like Sinovac and Sinopharm) contain copies of the whole virus that have been killed. Others (like the vaccines from Pfizer Moderna J&J and AstraZeneca) just show our immune cells a key part of the virus.

Mixing two different vaccines can produce better immunity than using just one because the immune cells become familiar with slightly different versions of the threat and can therefore recognize it even better. Mixing one dose of AstraZeneca and one of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) can offer better protection than AstraZeneca alone. We also know that after two doses of Pfizer a Moderna booster can produce better protection; and after two doses of Moderna a Pfizer booster can produce better protection.

Not much is known at this point about the effectiveness of getting one of the mRNA shots if you had Sinovac or Sinopharm first. But it’s unlikely to be WORSE than boosting with the same vaccine you had originally. And some preliminary results out of Chile show that boosting Sinovac with Pfizer was safe and more effective compared to a booster of Sinovac.

In Singapore people who originally got Sinopharm are being steered toward either Pfizer or Moderna as a third dose though they can also get a third dose of Sinopharm if they choose. In a few months we’ll get a better picture of any “boost” in effectiveness from studies coming out of this policy.

Most important no safety issues have been raised for any of the COVID-19 vaccine combinations so far.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Members will receive 500 bonus points for every 20-minute block of biofuel they purchase at a cost of $10 / €10 per block.

Customers have had the option to purchase biofuel when booking flights since 2019 with SAS stating the following:

SAS makes no profit on the purchase and this is only adding to the amount of biofuel that SAS is already committed to buy

The amount of biofuel a traveller buys will not necessarily be used on the actual flight the traveller has bought a ticket for but it will be used to replace fossil fuel to the equivalent amount in SAS’ operations as soon as possible and at the latest within 12 months

SAS continues to carbon offset all Eurobonus member’s flights with SAS free of charge

The carrier is targeting a reduction in total carbon emissions of 25 per cent by 2025 through a mixture of the use of SAF and fuel-efficient aircraft.

Commenting on the news Karl Sandlund chief commercial officer for SAS said:

“Through making it more beneficial to buy biofuel with your booking SAS wants to increase the usage of this non-profit service.

“Sustainable aviation fuels are a bridge toward zero-emission aviation and SAS works to pioneer a more large-scale and commercial production and supply.”

PNW,Pinnacle West,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2d0by5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdG9yb250by8yMDIxLzEyL3Bpbm5hY2xlLW9uZS15b25nZS10b3JvbnRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toronto is getting a curvy office and hotel complex with a soaring sky bridge,"The tallest approved building in all of Canada is under construction at the sprawling One Yonge site on Toronto's waterfront but developer Pinnacle International has even grander plans for the megacomplex at the foot of Yonge Street.

As they should: The developer bought the Toronto Star headquarters printing facility and surrounding parking lot back in 2012 for a mind-boggling price tag exceeding a quarter billion dollars.

The multi-phased complex has always included plans to massively expand the existing Toronto Star building — a tower known for its minimalist grid of concrete and glowing blue roof signage — but the latest renderings are revealing a change in course that would retain the building's signature look while adding a curvaceous new vertical extension above.

Designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects the complex will bring three condo towers with heights of 95 80 65 storeys to the north. A future easterly extension of Harbour Street will divide this first trio of skyline-altering towers from a commercial component planned to the south.

The latest plans for the complex's fourth and fifth phases were submitted with the city in December planned as a 22-storey office tower to the east and a 40-storey office and hotel tower to the west.

Much remains the same as an earlier plan for the site including a sky bridge soaring almost two dozen levels above Queens Quay and a hotel/office tower wrapping around the north and east sides of the existing 25-storey Toronto Star building with 15 new levels added above.

And while the existing landmark would remain it would no longer be concrete cladding the exterior.

A metal panel finish would retain the tower's grid-like aesthetic but the distinctive concrete surfaces would be covered up for good.

This is still a welcome departure from earlier plans which would have encased the tower's concrete exterior in the blue glass that makes up so much of Toronto's modern skyline.

Now in its Site Plan Approval phase the application is drawing closer to the final approval conditions that will allow shovels to go in the ground when the developer sees fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Singer Sir Rod Stewart and his son Sean each pleaded guilty Friday to one count of simple battery in relation to a 2019 incident outside a south Florida hotel.

Police at the time said Stewart punched a security guard at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach on New Year’s Eve in 2019 after his son “got about ‘nose to nose’ distance” from the guard’s face and later shoved him.

Footage from hotel cameras from that night revealed that Stewart and his son were the “primary aggressors” a Palm Beach Police Department probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate WPTV at the time said.

Neither Stewart nor his son appeared in court on Friday but pleaded guilty “in absentia” court documents show. They must also pay $675 each in court fines according to the documents.

“No one was injured in the incident and a jury did not find Sir Rod Stewart guilty of the accusation. Instead Sir Rod Stewart decided to enter a plea to avoid the inconvenience and unnecessary burden on the court and the public that a high profile proceeding would cause” Guy Fronstin an attorney for Rod Stewart said in a statement.

“In resolving the case Sir Rod Stewart was not convicted nor sentenced to jail or placed on probation” the attorney added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PoolCorp needs to be company # 10 with a full investigation into its recent business practices specifically the Purchase of the 2nd Largest Swimming Pool Retail Chain as well as the largest Swimming Pool Retail Store Franchise Company in the world. The goal of this petition is to get a feel for what other individuals leaders per se influencers within the swimming pool industry have to say about what it means to have the worlds largest Swimming Pool Distributor PoolCorp secretly buying up Retail Companies. PoolCorp has already implemented this Business Strategy by becoming the 2nd largest Swimming Pool Retailer in the world. We need as many signatures as possible supporting the position against allowing a Distributor to Control the Retail Industry it distributes too..

Why is this important?

PoolCorp is no stranger to the FTC. In fact in and around 2011 the Federal Trade Commission voted 3-1 approving a complaint and consent order against PoolCorp. In the complaint it alleged PoolCorp threatened Manufacturers not to sell to its competitors over an 8 year pressure campaign. It is important to note that the FTC approves a complaint when it has ""reason to believe"" that the law has been or is being violated. With that said the FTC agreed to a consent order which did not require PoolCorp to admit nor was it a finding of wrong doing. What it did do is outline specific actions that PoolCorp has to abide by in the future interactions specifically instructing PoolCorp to avoid any anti-competitive practices. So PoolCorp tried and failed to Control the Manufacturing side of the supply chain. With only a mere slap on the wrist by the FTC. PoolCorp has patiently waited and now recently implemented the only other alternative way to achieve what they set out to do initially back in 2002-2011. They now are disrupting the supply chain management structure by attempting to control and Monopolize the transaction of tons of swimming pool products from Manufacturer to Distributor from Distributor to Trade Professional and from Distributor to the End User.

With a comfortable 2-0 lead they succeeded in putting pressure on the Food Corporation of India early in the match. In the 57th minute they scored the third goal through Mohd. Naeemuddin to end the match on a winning note.

While it was the Sports Authority of India who caught the Canara Bank defence snapping in the early minutes of the game with a field goal by Rimanshu in the 2nd minute Canara Bank staged a comeback in the second quarter with a fine goal by forward Nikkin Thimmiah who has played for India in the Rio Olympics 2016. It was a good variation in the penalty corner conversion that ensured they equalised in the 21st minute.

Sports Authority of India however made a late surge in the final quarter to snatch the winning three points. It was a goal by Roshan F that helped them secure their first victory in the group stage.

Bengaluru: Comptroller & Auditor General of India and Sports Authority of India recorded easy wins on the opening day of the 1st Hockey India Senior Men Inter-Department National Championship 2021 played at the Field Marshal KM Cariappa Hockey Stadium here on Saturday.

The matches between Services Sports Control Board and Defence Accounts Sports Control Board in Pool A; Association Of Indian Universities with Central Reserve Police Force in Pool A All India Police Sports Control Board with Steel Plants Sports Board in Pool B and Petroleum Sports Promotion Board with Major Port Sports Control Board in Pool C were forfeited resulting in a 5-0 default win for Services Sports Control Board Central Reserve Police Force All India Police Sports Control Board and Petroleum Sports Promotion Board respectively.

In the first match of the day CAG marched to a strong 3-0 win against Food Corporation of India (FCI) in their Pool C encounter.

Dominating the proceedings right from the first hooter CAG established a good lead in the second quarter with Chandan Singh showing fine form to score back-to-back goals through penalty corner conversions in the 18th and 19th minutes. With a comfortable 2-0 lead they succeeded in putting pressure on the FCI early in the match. In the 57th minute they scored the third goal through Mohd. Naeemuddin to end the match on a winning note.

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

Here are companies at the top of the Index earning Trendsetter status:

AT&T (100.0 percent); Becton Dickinson and Co. (100.0 percent); Consolidated Edison Inc. (100.0 percent); Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (100.0 percent); HP Inc. (100.0 percent); Visa Inc.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

The consumer goods company is leaving 4711 Yonge Street Why The 90000 sq ft block is available in February 2025

The 90000 sq ft block is available in February 2025 What next CBRE has the marketing assignment

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Procter & Gamble owns home health and personal care brands including Tide Gilette and Pantene. Geraldine Huse is the president of P&G Canada."

It depicted an androgynous person applying mascara and a bold message: “Gender’s just too fluid for borders.”

HSBC would seem to have no business interest in gender theory except that the bank too rejects borders. The bank lobbied aggressively against Brexit in 2016 and has protested the result ever since. The free flow of capital brooks no constraints.

The same goes for much of corporate behavior today. On this side of the pond major corporations have aligned themselves publicly with progressive political and social causes from LGBTQ+ pride and abortion rights to racial justice and climate change. American business long served as the archetypal bourgeois institution: meritocratic buttoned-up and reliably Republican.

Advertisement

But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has since given up its old partisan loyalties and woke corporate titans preach a new golden rule. As Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said: “You don’t have to choose between doing well and doing good.” The pursuit of profit now follows the march for social justice.

Observers have struggled to make sense of these developments. But conservatives are justified in feeling betrayed just as progressives are right to be leery of their new corporate allies. Woke corporate activism as the HSBC example attests is primarily an attempt to launder self-interest through liberal ideology and to renege on actual obligations.

Woke corporate politicking takes many forms and American business has intervened in public debates in a variety of ways in recent years. The marketing has become commonplace pushing progressive political narratives under the pretext of advertising: Gillette condemns “toxic masculinity” the NFL declares that “football is gay” and so on.

Advertisement

Beyond this so-called brand activism corporate retribution has become a regular tactic in Republican-controlled states. Fortune 100 companies have used their market power to force the repeal of legislation threatening high-profile boycotts in states like Indiana North Carolina and Georgia.

Some corporate activism can plausibly be explained by a straightforward business logic. After all maintaining a progressive reputation can serve the bottom line. For knowledge-sector firms it can attract talent in the competitive labor market for high-skill (read: college-educated) workers. The retailer or consumer-product company may win over the emerging market of conscious consumers in the bid for brand loyalty. “Go Woke Go Broke” is a mere mantra not a law of business performance.

Nevertheless critics are swift to point to the hypocrisy. How can Nike elevate Colin Kaepernick as a woke spokesman for Uyghur-made shoes? How can Amazon create its own Paris Agreement for net-zero emissions while bowing to Chinese censors and exploiting a vulnerable workforce?

Advertisement

How can Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz lecture employees about “building bridges not walls” for impoverished immigrants yet admonish workers attempting to organize to emulate the self-sacrificial struggle of Holocaust survivors?

Advertisement

The hypocrisy abounds but the hypocrisy is the point. Woke posturing can serve ulterior motives — not just marketing and recruiting but hedging against risks. In a period when business feels besieged from the left and the right performative wokeness may forestall political retribution.

A new initiative can function as a kind of PR sleight-of-hand to obscure malfeasance while a new corporate policy may serve as a peace offering to would-be regulators. Rather than a means of engaging in political activity woke capital may be a ploy to avoid being its subject.

What often distinguishes woke capitalism is how it employs quasi-governmental power to enforce its ideology. Nonprofit organizations track and publish corporation performance on a range of progressive social issues such as the Human Rights Campaign’s “Corporate Equality Index” on the promotion of LGBTQ+ rights.

Advertisement

Other organizations develop industry standards for corporate disclosure such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) standards for environmental social and corporate governance reporting. (Though the Securities and Exchange Commission has not adopted SASB standards major institutional investors including BlackRock Vanguard and State Street now require them for portfolio companies.)

Often business institutions themselves develop and enforce rules promoting particular social agendas. For instance the NASDAQ stock exchange instituted a rule requiring a listed company to disclose the gender ethnicity and LGBTQ+ status for members of its board which shall have at least two “diverse” directors.

In perhaps the most telling example the Business Roundtable virtually codified “corporate social responsibility” dogma in August 2019 when it proposed to redefine the purpose of a corporation to encompass “a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders.”

Never mind that American law explicitly defines corporate obligations or that historically legislatures granted corporate charters for narrowly prescribed purposes; the statement co-signed by nearly 200 CEOs enumerated a particular set of responsibilities to customers employees suppliers business partners communities and shareholders.

Advertisement

Many critics decried the statement for abandoning the doctrine of shareholder primacy which prioritizes maximizing shareholder value over and above other considerations. But however symbolically the Business Roundtable statement may have displaced shareholder primacy with so-called stakeholder capitalism it did virtually nothing to change actual corporate behavior.

Nowhere did the statement list a particular set of measurable objectives much less establish means to uphold accountability. It merely spelled out business’s vaunted new purpose with the “commitment” to be responsible and uphold it.

And so even after two years the signatory companies had generally failed to incorporate new governance language that elevated the status of stakeholders and many opposed proposals to implement the statement’s vision claiming that the statement itself never required changes to their treatment of stakeholders

What was notable about the Business Roundtable statement aside from the widespread praise it garnered despite its vapidity is what it implied. That is major business leaders consider themselves to be unaccountable to others even as they claim responsibility for themselves.

Advertisement

Beyond the exercise’s farce there is a real tragedy here. American businesses have for decades acknowledged particular obligations to non-shareholders including workers customers and the broader public. The modern business practice of “stakeholder planning” has been around for more than a half a century and its purpose was practical not political: to help managers and executives understand how different business decisions affected different groups how to balance the often-conflicting interests that different groups might have.

But corporate politicking does little to meet these obligations. If anything it undermines them.

Consider workers. On the whole the new woke politics espoused in boardrooms and public brochures has little impact on them.

A recent American Compass survey of workers found that 59% of the American labor force would prefer its employer to focus on business and avoid taking public stances on social justice issues. Opposition to woke employers is strongest among those with the least education and only those with post-graduate degrees say that they’d prefer their employers to engage in social justice issues.

What woke capitalism demands is exactly what its messages dismiss or seek to avoid: constraint. We cannot expect businesses to constrain themselves. Instead we need institutional levers that check corporations’ worst impulses and hold them accountable to the obligations they have to workers and their families as well as the national interest and American public as a whole.

This can start with two groups where obligations are clearest and where direct accountability is more achievable: shareholders and workers.

To better hold woke corporations accountable to their shareholders policy reform could open new avenues for litigation. For instance shareholders could be granted the privilege to sue corporations for violating their fiduciary duty when they engage in political activities unrelated to their pecuniary interests.

Exposing public companies and their executives to litigation in this way could prove to be powerful countervailing force against the worst woke impulses. Sen. Marco Rubio’s Mind Your Own Business Act would create just this sort of legal constraint on public corporations and their executives on behalf of shareholders.

Advertisement

Other reforms could build structures within companies for workers to exercise their voice in the boardroom and hold executives accountable to their interests. For instance federal labor law could be reformed to enshrine the right to elect worker representatives on corporate boards. A few proposals already exist to establish a minimum requirement for worker representatives as a composition of boards. A more modest starting point may be to give workers the option to fill one or two board seats with their representatives.

Another approach to give workers representation within the boardroom would be to institute employee stock ownership plans or ESOPs. This is an employee benefit program that would acquire company stock and hold it on behalf of the employees thereby giving them an ownership interest in the company and depending on the scale of the ESOPs board representation as any other large shareholder.

Opposing woke capitalism shouldn’t become another form of political posturing from the bully pulpit merely the obverse of woke capital itself. The goal of any effort to rein in woke capitalism should be to build structures to serve as countervailing forces against woke capitalism’s impulses on behalf of workers.

Vista-based Nevada Hydro Co. has proposed building a 200-foot-high dam above the lake and a 500-megawatt underground power plant with turbines on 845 acres of U.S. Forest Service. Water would be pumped from the lake to a man-made reservoir when demand for electricity is low with water flowing back to the lake when demand is high. The project has been named the Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage Project or LEAPS.

A company is proposing to build a hydroelectric power project on Lake Elsinore’s west side seen in this photo.

The city of Lake Elsinore Riverside County the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians environmentalists and local residents oppose the project.

In a letter dated Dec. 9 FERC’s director of hydropower licensing Vince Yearick informed Nevada Hydro’s president that the commission was dismissing its project application because Nevada Hydro failed to provide the Forest Service with recreation groundwater seismic and geotechnical studies as well as a construction plan.

“The Forest Service states that while it has held multiple meetings with Nevada Hydro to seek resolution and completion of the required studies Nevada Hydro has informed the Forest Service that it does not intend to perform the studies and provide the remaining information prior to the Commission’s issuance of any license for the project” Yearick said in the letter.

Rejected again

On Dec. 13 the commission rejected Nevada Hydro’s Dec. 10 request for a preliminary permit that would give the company up to four years to conduct a project feasibility study. Nevada Hydro however could request a rehearing on the matter within 30 days said FERC spokeswoman Celeste Miller.

It was unclear what Nevada Hydro’s plans are moving forward. Company representatives including President Rexford Wait declined to comment.

New energy source

Nevada Hydro has also proposed installing 32 miles of transmission lines and 170 high-voltage steel towers that would carry electricity from Lake Elsinore to the unincorporated communities of La Cresta Tenaja Lakeland Village and Temescal Valley and then connect to power lines owned by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.

Nevada Hydro founded in 1997 said the project would give the region a reliable energy source and support 600 construction jobs and 20 to 30 permanent jobs. According to its website LEAPS was designed to respond to the growing need for reliable renewable electricity and to help meet California’s ambitious emissions reduction programs.

Welcome news

The federal government’s latest actions were welcome news to LEAPS opponents.

“Since this project is no longer formally in our program of work which serves to identify and prioritize current forest projects we will be able to shift our focus and put more energy into improving our recreational facilities and reducing hazardous fuels to reduce the risk to communities from catastrophic wildfire” said Freddie Duncan acting Trabuco District ranger of the Cleveland National Forest.

The Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians spoke out against the project last year claiming Lake Elsinore as sacred tribal lands that were part of the Luiseno Creation Account and that events tied to the tribe’s religion and cosmology occurred there.

“We are pleased with this (project application) dismissal” Pechanga Chairman Mark Macarro said in a statement Friday Dec. 17. “There’s a reason Nevada Hydro has continuously failed to provide the necessary information for a thorough review: this is a hazardous incompatible and infeasible project for the wrong location. It’s time they move on.”

Problematic history

Nevada Hydro has been trying to get its LEAPS project off the ground for 17 years. It submitted its first application to the commission in February 2004. The history of the LEAPS project and the rocky relationship between Nevada Hydro and FERC dates back to 2004 and has gone back and forth with the commission ever since.

In 2011 FERC in another rejection letter to Nevada Hydro cited conflicts between the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District and Nevada Hydro for denying its application. The commission also said Nevada Hydro and the commission had different goals had been unable to work together in the past and likely would be unable to collaborate if a license were issued.

Lake Elsinore reacts

On April 9 2019 the Lake Elsinore City Council unanimously voted to take a formal stance opposing the LEAPS project subject to conditions Deputy City Manager Nicole Dailey said in an email.

Among the community’s myriad concerns with the project are its potential adverse impacts on lake water quality lake levels the fishery and the shoreline. Other concerns Dailey said include the potential for disasters should the proposed dam breach fire hazards from the proposed 32-mile segment of high powered transmission lines the impact on wildlife the overall impact to the aesthetics of the community and the lake and the potential for property damage and acquisitions.

“The City Council has urged Nevada Hydro the project proponent to give serious consideration to these concerns and to provide additional project details including actual and measurable public benefits” Dailey said. “Unfortunately despite the passage of more than two years community concerns have not been addressed and the benefits of the project to the public remain elusive while the project impacts could be considerable.”

She said the commission acted appropriately in dismissing Nevada Hydro’s application.

“The U.S. Forest Service required Nevada Hydro to conduct additional studies in the Cleveland National Forest” Dailey said in an email. “Nevada Hydro refused to perform the studies and it appears from the dismissal gave the commission no choice but to dismiss the application based on their policy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9tb3N0LWxvdmVkLWNlby10ZWNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy01NTcwMTYuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L25ld3MvbW9zdC1sb3ZlZC1jZW8tdGVjaC1jb21wYW5pZXMtNTU3MDE2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Satya Nadella To Sundar Pichai: 11 Most Loved CEOs Of Large Tech Companies,"Comparably -- an online portal that reveals company cultures and market compensation updated by actual employees has now shared a list of the best company CEOs (of large companies) as rated by their staff.

USA: Working with Connecticut Department of Transportation Metro-North Railroad has completed the installation of signalling and Positive Train Control on the Waterbury Branch.

The single-track line had been the last section of MNCR still relying on manual block operation and its resignalling completes the roll-out of the train protection system across the three-state network.

Dating from 1849 the historic Naugatuck Railroad has been worked by Metro-North since 1983 and the line was subsequently purchased by the state of Connecticut. It had been exempted from PTC implementation because it did not have any signalling. Train movements were authorised by a Rail Traffic Controller at Metro-North’s Operations Control Centre. However the department and operator decided to install CTC and PTC to improve safety and operational flexibility.

Work on the project began in April 2019 funded by CTDOT from state and federal contributions. CTC installation was completed in November enabling the PTC to be activated from November 20. The track has been upgraded to enable trains to operate at up to 75 km/h. New passing loops have been installed at Derby Beacon Falls and just south of Waterbury with a fourth planned at Devon.

Making use of the new signalling and loops CTDOT is looking to introduce a ‘two-way rail service’ on the branch in the coming months envisaging up to 22 trains each weekday from the summer of 2022.

‘Simply put PTC and signalisation mean better safety and better service’ explained Joseph Giulietti Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Transportation. ‘Metro-North has been an essential partner in advancing the Waterbury Branch into the future and helping lay the groundwork for expanded train service. We thank them for playing an important part in helping us move Connecticut forward.’

‘The successful installation of the new signal system on the Waterbury Branch allowed us to bring the final segment of Metro-North online for PTC increasing passenger safety while also giving us the ability to provide more service on the branch in the future’ added MNCR President Catherine Rinaldi. ‘I am excited for our Connecticut customers to reap the benefits of a smoother commuting experience.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYXJ5bmV3cy50di9waWEtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYS0zMjAtc2ltdWxhdG9yL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vYXJ5bmV3cy50di9waWEtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYS0zMjAtc2ltdWxhdG9yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PIA gets first Airbus A-320 simulator,"KARACHI: The national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has acquired the first Airbus A320 simulator for the training of pilots refresher courses and air safety ARY News reported on Saturday.

The state-of-the-art Reality 7E Evolution Airbus A320 Full Flight Simulator (FFS) was acquired from L3Harris Technologies that will be installed at PIA Training Centre (PTC) in Karachi.

Pakistan will become the first country in the region that has acquired an A320 simulator for pilots’ training and air safety. It is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan has 670 pilots of Airbus A320.

Before acquiring the modern simulators the pilots were bound to travel abroad for refresher courses along with an inspector of civil aviation.

The installation of the Airbus simulator will end the huge expenditure of the national flag carrier for pilots’ training. It was learnt that pilots’ training was conducted at the cost of almost $300 per hour in the foreign countries excluding the travel and accommodation spendings.

The national airline has started the construction of a simulator complex in which the simulators of Boeing 747 777 and Airbus 320 will be installed.

Rockwall police said military-grade munitions and equipment were found inside the newly-purchased storage unit at The Vault Storage off East Ralph Hall Parkway.

Authorities said any items that posed a threat to public safety were removed or destroyed.

A couple bought the storage unit up for $3000.

They said they usually go after collectible units but in this case they knew they had to call police.

Justin Grimes and his wife Jeana have been buying up storage units for a few years but this unit was different.

""This is probably the most extreme intense unit that we have found"" Grimes said. ""It’s better safe than sorry.""

Friday afternoon the Grimes uncovered military grade munition and weaponry inside.

The couple said the previous owner an elderly man stopped paying rent so they purchased the locker for $3000.

Grimes who served in the Marine Corps himself said he had a suspicion when he saw some inventory photos online.

""I knew what was in there. I called the police to come verify what I think I already knew"" he said. ""I still don’t know what all they took.""

Rockwall police won’t disclose all of the possible military inventory.

""Our first concern is the safety of the public"" said Rockwall PD Lt. Aaron McGrew.

McGrew confirmed they called in the Garland Bomb Squad the United States Air Force and the FBI to set up a perimeter Friday night.

Ralph Hall Parkway was shut down and nearby businesses were evacuated.

""There was one device that was unstable and needed to be made safe and they took it into a field directly behind"" McGrew said.

The Grimes documented the overnight investigation on their YouTube channel Grimes Finds.

Once federal agents cleared out early Saturday morning they started to sift through what was left.

There are several boxes they haven’t even had time to go through before they head straight to auction.

""I really love what I do and so I was up on these barrels with tank rounds around it because I wanted to get a baseball card. It could be a million-dollar baseball card in there"" Grimes added.

Rockwall police said they handed the investigation over to the FBI to decided exactly where the weapons came from and whether these weapons were legal to own.

Vista-based Nevada Hydro Co. has proposed building a 200-foot-high dam above the lake and a 500-megawatt underground power plant with turbines on 845 acres of U.S. Forest Service. Water would be pumped from the lake to a man-made reservoir when demand for electricity is low with water flowing back to the lake when demand is high. The project has been named the Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage Project or LEAPS.

This rendition from LEAPS developer Nevada Hydro purports to show a view of the Lake Elsinore Advance Pumped Storage Project from Lake Elsinore’s Eastern Shore.

A company is proposing to build a hydroelectric power project on Lake Elsinore’s west side seen in this photo.

The city of Lake Elsinore Riverside County the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians environmentalists and local residents oppose the project.

In a letter dated Dec. 9 FERC’s director of hydropower licensing Vince Yearick informed Nevada Hydro’s president that the commission was dismissing its project application because Nevada Hydro failed to provide the Forest Service with recreation groundwater seismic and geotechnical studies as well as a construction plan.

“The Forest Service states that while it has held multiple meetings with Nevada Hydro to seek resolution and completion of the required studies Nevada Hydro has informed the Forest Service that it does not intend to perform the studies and provide the remaining information prior to the Commission’s issuance of any license for the project” Yearick said in the letter.

Rejected again

On Dec. 13 the commission rejected Nevada Hydro’s Dec. 10 request for a preliminary permit that would give the company up to four years to conduct a project feasibility study. Nevada Hydro however could request a rehearing on the matter within 30 days said FERC spokeswoman Celeste Miller.

It was unclear what Nevada Hydro’s plans are moving forward. Company representatives including President Rexford Wait declined to comment.

New energy source

Nevada Hydro has also proposed installing 32 miles of transmission lines and 170 high-voltage steel towers that would carry electricity from Lake Elsinore to the unincorporated communities of La Cresta Tenaja Lakeland Village and Temescal Valley and then connect to power lines owned by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.

Nevada Hydro founded in 1997 said the project would give the region a reliable energy source and support 600 construction jobs and 20 to 30 permanent jobs. According to its website LEAPS was designed to respond to the growing need for reliable renewable electricity and to help meet California’s ambitious emissions reduction programs.

Welcome news

The federal government’s latest actions were welcome news to LEAPS opponents.

“Since this project is no longer formally in our program of work which serves to identify and prioritize current forest projects we will be able to shift our focus and put more energy into improving our recreational facilities and reducing hazardous fuels to reduce the risk to communities from catastrophic wildfire” said Freddie Duncan acting Trabuco District ranger of the Cleveland National Forest.

The Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians spoke out against the project last year claiming Lake Elsinore as sacred tribal lands that were part of the Luiseno Creation Account and that events tied to the tribe’s religion and cosmology occurred there.

“We are pleased with this (project application) dismissal” Pechanga Chairman Mark Macarro said in a statement Friday Dec. 17. “There’s a reason Nevada Hydro has continuously failed to provide the necessary information for a thorough review: this is a hazardous incompatible and infeasible project for the wrong location. It’s time they move on.”

Problematic history

Nevada Hydro has been trying to get its LEAPS project off the ground for 17 years. It submitted its first application to the commission in February 2004. The history of the LEAPS project and the rocky relationship between Nevada Hydro and FERC dates back to 2004 and has gone back and forth with the commission ever since.

In 2011 FERC in another rejection letter to Nevada Hydro cited conflicts between the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District and Nevada Hydro for denying its application. The commission also said Nevada Hydro and the commission had different goals had been unable to work together in the past and likely would be unable to collaborate if a license were issued.

Lake Elsinore reacts

On April 9 2019 the Lake Elsinore City Council unanimously voted to take a formal stance opposing the LEAPS project subject to conditions Deputy City Manager Nicole Dailey said in an email.

Among the community’s myriad concerns with the project are its potential adverse impacts on lake water quality lake levels the fishery and the shoreline. Other concerns Dailey said include the potential for disasters should the proposed dam breach fire hazards from the proposed 32-mile segment of high powered transmission lines the impact on wildlife the overall impact to the aesthetics of the community and the lake and the potential for property damage and acquisitions.

“The City Council has urged Nevada Hydro the project proponent to give serious consideration to these concerns and to provide additional project details including actual and measurable public benefits” Dailey said. “Unfortunately despite the passage of more than two years community concerns have not been addressed and the benefits of the project to the public remain elusive while the project impacts could be considerable.”

She said the commission acted appropriately in dismissing Nevada Hydro’s application.

“The U.S. Forest Service required Nevada Hydro to conduct additional studies in the Cleveland National Forest” Dailey said in an email. “Nevada Hydro refused to perform the studies and it appears from the dismissal gave the commission no choice but to dismiss the application based on their policy.”",,,

Now a Weibo-based chip industry leaker asserts that the OEM is working on its successor already. This possibly accelerated timeline might be related to MediaTek's rising status in the same field.

4 Reviews

Smartphone OEMs are reportedly falling over themselves to get their new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered flagships on the market early. Unfortunately for them there are rumors that this top-end processor's successor is already in the works.

The tipster Mobile Chip Masters asserts that this is the case and that Qualcomm aims to ship it as early as May 2022. According to the leaker the OEM has done so in order to secure valuable time on the 4nm manufacturing node run by TSMC which has apparently been engaged to produce the ""8 Gen 2"" in volumes even greater than those of either the Gen 1 or MediaTek's competing Dimensity 9000.

On that note the ""threat"" posed by the 9000 is framed as Qualcomm's motivation in this leak: apparently this plan would make the OEM TSMC's 2nd biggest customer pushing MediaTek down to approximately 4th. Then again the ""Gen 2"" referred to in this post could in fact be the 'second wave' of the Gen 1 said to have been ported to TSMC's process from that of Samsung in an earlier leak.

Top chip manufacturers like Broadcom and Skyworks also have offices in this region. According to reports Apple is hiring these engineers for chip development that may involve RF Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips. Bloomberg speculates that Apple plans to develop its own RF Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips to replace Broadcom Skyworks and Qualcomm’s related components.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the recruitment plan. However after the report Skyworks shares plunged 11% Broadcom and Qualcomm both fell more than 4%. Apple is the big beneficiary of many chip manufacturers. Bloomberg data shows that Apple-related revenue accounts for 60% of Skyworks’ revenue. For Broadcom 20% of its revenue comes from Apple-related businesses. The $15 billion wireless component supply agreement reached by Broadcom and Apple in early 2020 will expire in 2023.

There is also the British GPU designer Imagination Technologies. Apple’s decision to start self-developed GPUs in 2017 almost bankrupted Imagination Technologies. It was not until 2020 that the two parties reached a new license agreement. This is not the first time Apple has entered the field of wireless chips.

Apple has made custom parts on AirPods and Apple Watch before. Apple also uses a U1 UWB ultra-wideband chip on a large scale since iPhone 11. This chip is for near-field precise positioning. Apple has also released Bluetooth and UWB technology for AirTag “anti-lost device”.

Apple is devouring everything upstream and downstream.

The main reason why Apple’s job information will involve Broadcom and Skyworks is the place of Irving and Apple’s historical habits. In addition to the offices of Broadcom and Skyworks in Irvine NXP is also here (Apple mobile payment uses NXP’s NFC chip). Also the University of California Irvine which is famous for radio frequency-related engineering projects is also here.

Apple has the habit of setting up offices near suppliers and sometimes this is the first step in Apple’s replacement. In the past Apple set up a chip office in Portland Oregon near the Intel building in Austin Texas and Orlando Florida (AMD) in Haifa and Herzliya Israel (with Intel engineers) and in Germany (near Infineon’s headquarters in Munich).

In addition Apple invested in a power management chip company Dialog Semiconductor Plc in 2018 and took over hundreds of employees in the UK and Italy. Apple is still expanding everywhere. Its headquarters is in Cupertino but it also has many employees in San Diego (where Qualcomm is headquartered). It has expanded its recruitment to chips smart homes displays and software.

The leaked AI benchmarks also revealed that the latest flagship MediaTek chip might be capable of surpassing Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. Now a new leak reveals that the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 might be faster than Qualcomm’s new flagship chip.

A leaked video on Weibo showed a smartphone running the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 on AnTuTu and Geekbench. Starting with AnTuTu MediaTek managed to surpass the one million mark with a score of 1017488 points. We know from previous leaks that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also surpassed one million points on AnTuTu.

Moving on to Geekbench and the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 record a single-core score of 1273 points and a multi-core score of 4324 points. We have already seen the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 version of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra manage a nearly identical single core score of 1219 points although the Snapdragon chip is yet to cross the 4000 mark in Geekbench’s multi-core test.

And while the Dimensity 9000 chip is looking faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 the GPU test on GFXBenc v3.0 Manhattan saw MediaTek’s flagship chip score 238fps. The Snapdragon chip was up ahead with 267fps. It was the same story in the Aztec test where the Dimensity 9000 did 43fps while the Snapdragon managed 49fps.

The Dimensity 9000 also got 17573 in PCMark and 1024 in ETHZ AI Benchmark (v5). You can check out the full video here. It is worth noting that the benchmarks don’t account for sustained performance but from the looks of things MediaTek may just leap frog Qualcomm in terms of performance.

It was first published on April 28 2021.

Since the coronavirus pandemic’s earliest days public health experts have agreed that intercepting and minimizing outbreaks would rely on our ability to answer a seemingly simple question: Do I have the virus?

Getting tested—and tested frequently—has been the mantra for helping slow the spread of COVID-19. With increased traveling during the holiday season and cases of new variants like Delta and Omicron on the rise experts say testing (on top of getting vaccinated) is crucial in keeping infection numbers low. Compared to this time last year consumers have far more COVID-19 testing options available to them—including a handful of tests that can be administered from the comfort of home.

“Each type of test has its place” says Patrick Godbey lab director of Southeast Georgia Regional Health System and Southeastern Pathology Associates. “You use the different types of tests for different situations.” And the advent of do-it-yourself tests he says “has the potential to be tremendous.”

Most of the at-home tests authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration to date are kits that ask users to collect their own spit or swab samples and mail them to a lab for processing. But in recent months the FDA has also granted emergency use to at least 13 at-home tests that return results on the spot within an hour.

Experts hope the broadening selection of testing options will help prevent people with asymptomatic infections from turning into unwitting super-spreaders. Government officials are also responding to testing needs: Certain states such as Massachusetts and New Jersey have created programs to deliver free rapid tests to residents while President Biden announced a plan earlier this month that will soon require private health insurers to cover the costs of over-the-counter at-home COVID tests.

“The three most dangerous words during COVID are ‘I feel fine’” says Mara Aspinall co-founder of the biomedical diagnostics program at Arizona State University. “We need to be testing regularly. No test is perfect and this disease is unfortunately sneaky.”

How do at-home rapid COVID-19 tests stack up?

So far the US has administered more than 682 million COVID-19 diagnostic tests according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of these tests use a molecular technique called polymerase chain reaction or PCR that looks for small pieces of the virus’s genetic material in a sample (usually a swab of the nose or upper throat but sometimes saliva) taken by a health worker at a testing site.

The accuracy of COVID-19 tests are based on two main factors: Sensitivity and specificity. A test’s sensitivity is how well it can correctly identify a person who has the disease in this case COVID-19; a test’s specificity measures how well it identifies those without the disease. The closer each of those are to 100 percent the more accurate the test.

Because PCR is a lab test it can take a few hours or days to turn around results. But the technique is highly accurate at picking up positive cases since it can confirm the virus’s genetic presence—even if faint—in a given sample. “It is considered the gold standard” says Thomas Denny a professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center.

Most of the newly-approved at-home kits that return results right away use a different much faster technique. Instead of looking for traces of the virus’s genetic footprint these tests—called antigen tests—screen for fragments of proteins shed by the virus.

Antigen tests are good at quickly identifying people with larger amounts of the virus and therefore proteins shed by it. These individuals are typically more infectious and should self-quarantine.

DIY Assistant Editor Sandra Gutierrez tried out an antigen test made by Australian manufacturer Ellume which was the first rapid fully at-home antigen COVID-19 test authorized by the FDA. The test costs about $30 online and at pharmacies and delivers results within 15 minutes. Image Credit: Ellume

However antigen tests are far less sensitive than PCR tests and are more likely to lead to false negatives—in which the test gives a negative result even though the person has COVID-19—especially in folks who are asymptomatic. Depending on the stage of an infection it is possible for someone to be negative according to an antigen test but positive with PCR or vice versa experts warn. Faulty unreliable test results have led to major recalls of millions of at-home tests as was the case earlier this fall when more than 2 million of Ellume’s home tests were affected by higher-than-acceptable false positive results.

Experts also stress the danger of mishandling at-home tests since (after all) most of us are not professionally trained to collect saliva take nasal swabs or properly store sensitive testing materials.

“You have people who are not used to performing laboratory tests performing those tests” says Godbey who also serves as president of the College of American Pathologists. “They need to be meticulous about every aspect.”

And regardless of what type of test you’re taking there’s always the possibility of picking up the virus right afterward—which makes it nearly impossible to ever conclude with certainty that someone is not infected.

“Testing is only a snapshot of a particular time” Denny says “whether you do it at home or at a testing center.”

How easy are at-home tests to use?

Popular Science staff ordered and tested a few of these at-home tests to evaluate their ease-of-use identify any struggle points and determine how useful they are for consumers overall.

Ellume

Specificity: 93 – 99 percent (97%)

DIY Assistant Editor Sandra Gutierrez tried out an antigen test made by Australian manufacturer Ellume which was the first rapid fully at-home antigen COVID-19 test authorized by the FDA. The test costs about $30 online and at pharmacies and delivers results within 15 minutes.

The self-administered nasal swab is just as annoying as when it’s taken by a professional according to Gutierrez. “If you think that controlling the swab makes it any better” she says “it does not.” But overall Ellume’s testing process was fairly easy.

Update: On October 5 2021 the FDA recalled more than 2 million Ellume COVID-19 tests due to abnormally high rates of false positive test results in certain affected lots. The issue was categorized as a Class I recall the FDA’s most serious type of recall due to the serious health implications of delayed diagnosis of the actual illness or incorrectly administering COVID-19 treatment. Thankfully none of the users of recalled tests who reported false positive results have died. You can still buy Ellume at-home tests but the company is maintaining a voluntary recall policy which allows you to return and replace tests if you believe it was a part of the recall.

Abbott’s BinaxNOW Self-test

Specificity: 100 percent (per company); 96.6 – 99.5 (98.5%) per FDA

Another at-home antigen test Abbott’s BinaxNOW promises results within 15 minutes and is available now at major drugstore chains including Walgreens and CVS at $24 per box. Each box comes with two tests; both should be used by the same individual with the second taken 36 hours after the first. This can help compensate for the typical downside of an antigen test—taking two makes it less likely to miss an infection just because it’s new especially if you isolate at home in the interim.

For those who are willing to quarantine for a few days while waiting for COVID test results mail-in kits might be a better option. These kits still rely on the user to collect the sample but the analysis is done in the lab using the same technique that PCR tests done at a doctor’s office or clinic employ. These tend to be a little more expensive but they’re also more accurate.

As Science Editor Claire Maldarelli learned one of these at-home collection kits from DxTerity will cost you around $100 doesn’t require a prescription (some kits do) and you can order it on Amazon. The COVID test requires a saliva sample rather than a nasal swab. It was however “extremely easy to use” she says with easy-to-follow instructions and clearly-labeled equipment. Her only additional note: “You need a lot more saliva than you realize!”

DxTerity’s at-home collection test can be purchased on Amazon without a prescription for $110. The test uses a saliva sample collected at home and sent back to the company’s lab for testing. Image Credit: DxTerity

Labcorp Pixel and Quest Diagnostics

Specificity: 100 percent

Another mail-in alternative is Labcorp’s Pixel at-home kit which runs $119 out of pocket and can be ordered on the company’s website without a prescription. Associate technology editor Rob Verger tried Labcorp’s Pixel kit out and found its 12-step process fairly painless. He did note that the process requires setting up an account with the company and dropping the test off at a FedEx location in time for a same-day express service—“so you’ll need to fit that step and timing into your plans.”

His verdict: “As easy as a home COVID test could be it seems but you still need to devote a little bit of time to doing it carefully.”

Quest Diagnostics

Quest Diagnostics makes a similar at-home kit to Pixel priced at about $125 which also gets sent back to the lab for testing. Your test is received and sent to the lab free of charge.

Other at-home COVID-19 tests to consider

Beyond the handful of options tested by Popular Science a small cadre of new tests offer actual molecular analysis (similar to PCR testing) from home.

Cue

Availability: Online

Online Ages: 2 and older

2 and older Cost: $50 – $90 monthly membership; $225 3-pack

$50 – $90 monthly membership; $225 3-pack Sensitivity: 97.4 percent

Specificity: 99.1 percent

Cue’s at-home testing cartridge looks for the coronavirus’s genetic material like a lab test but returns results in about 20 minutes. It is an FDA-authorized at-home molecular test—considered more accurate than the rapid antigen tests. The testing kit uses a nasal “wand” or swab cartridge and a square multi-use reader that connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth. However Cue’s purchasing options are pricey which includes a membership model: $50 per month for 10 tests a year and $90 per month for 20 tests a year. You can also do one-time purchases of test packs starting at $225 for three. But all of these options require you to buy the $249 reader separately (there is a discount on the reader and additional tests if you choose one of the memberships).

Lucira Check It

Online at LuciraHealth.com Ages: 2 and older

2 and older Costs: $75

$75 Sensitivity: 94 percent in symptomatic individuals 90 percent in asymptomatic

Specificity: 98 percent

The Lucira Check It at-home kit is a cheaper molecular test option. These single-use tests include a AA battery-operated test device sample vial and nasal swab. Like PCR tests they also detect genetic material of the virus though they use a slightly different method to identify the viral DNA and turn around positive results in as soon as 11 minutes and 30 minutes for negative results. If you need an official digital record of your results Lucira can send a free text message to your phone—no app required.

In October 2021 Lucira recalled the swabs included in the kit which were supplied by a partner company Copan. The affected kits were distributed between April 22 2021 through September 22 2021. These kits should not be used and Lucira is offering replacement swabs for customers who have a recalled one.

Flowflex

Authorized by the FDA in October ACON Laboratories’ Flowflex is another rapid antigen home test. With one test per box the nasal swab lateral flow test gives results in about 15 minutes and can be used for those with and without symptoms. The Flowflex home test showed a higher sensitivity for detecting the Delta variant compared to other antigen rapid tests according to performance tests published in The Lancet on November 24. CVS and Walgreens are selling the tests for $10.

Quidel QuickVue

Quidel’s QuickVue at-home rapid antigen test takes about 10 minutes and can be found at most pharmacies. We found it at CVS for $24. Quidel recommends that you use the test within six days of the first signs of symptoms or potential exposure. It comes with two tests; you should take the second test one to two days after you take the first.

How accurate are the at-home COVID-19 tests?

In general PCR tests are more sensitive and specific than rapid antigen tests. Because Quest’s and Labcorp’s tests are taken at home and sent back to their labs for testing each of those tests’ sensitivities and specificities are close to 100 percent. DxTerity’s test which uses a saliva sample that’s sent to the company’s lab for testing has a 97.2 percent sensitivity and a 92.5 percent specificity.

Ellume maker of one of the handful of tests in which the samples and results are given at home reported that its test identifies positive cases (sensitivity) 95 percent of the time and negative cases (specificity) 97 percent of the time. This was based on a study of 198 symptomatic and asymptomatic users and the results were compared against PCR testing.

Abbott pitted its BinaxNOW Self Test—another totally at-home COVID-19 test—against PCR tests in 460 symptomatic patients. The company found that if users were within seven days of symptom onset BinaxNOW agreed with positive PCR results about 85 percent of the time and with negative PCR results about 98 percent of the time.

But when zoomed out to users within two weeks of symptoms agreement with positive PCR results fell to 77 percent. Independent tests of BinaxNOW suggest the antigen test correctly identifies the virus 64 percent of the time for those with symptoms and only 35 percent of the time in asymptomatic people. However it did accurately identify negative results (in those that don’t have COVID-19 according to PCR) almost 100 percent of the time.

The last test we looked at Cue was evaluated in 292 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals by a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic who recently published their results in the journal Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease. The Mayo Clinic team found that the Cue test had a positivity rate of between 91.7 and 95.7 percent and a specificity of 98.4 percent.

Cue’s at-home COVID-19 test was part of a pilot program with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense where it’s being used at mobile testing units drive-through clinics K-12 schools and hospitals as well as in Tribal Nations and rural communities. It is now available to the public. Image Credit: Cue

When to use an at-home COVID-19 test

Experts say that diagnostic testing—whether at home or at clinics and community sites—will continue to be critical in preventing the spread of future concerning variants and bringing an end to the pandemic.

Right now there’s a lot to keep our eye on. 61 percent of the US population is fully vaccinated while 27 percent have received boosters. But the COVID-19 death toll saw an uptick in the fall and early winter months. As of December 1 2021 there are still about 118000 new cases daily and about 1150 lives are lost each day to the disease.

“Now’s not the time to give up on testing” Denny says. “We need to double down.”

Overall experts say an expanded array of options for identifying positive cases will help us curb their proliferation. “The more we can do simple regular at-home testing the less we need it” Aspinall says. “It’ll become a habit as easy as brushing your teeth.”

As we continue to reopen businesses socialize travel and reduce mask mandates home tests can prevent infected people from spreading the coronavirus. They can also fill in gaps for those who may have less access to in-person testing.

And they could be deployed during local outbreaks or clusters at nursing homes prisons or other residential facilities to quickly determine who’s sick says Prathit Kulkarni an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine.

So how should you approach at-home tests? If you’re unvaccinated and symptomatic they’re a great way to confirm a COVID-19 infection without risking a trip out of the house.

If you have no symptoms and just want to know whether you can safely attend a family dinner or soccer game an at-home test remains an imperfect way of self-screening. Remember: If the test comes back negative there’s still the chance the result is false and you could accidentally expose others by being within six feet of them without a mask on.

Back in March of 2021 the FDA authorized so-called “serial” antigen tests that can be taken within days of each other increasing confidence in the test results. That’s the case for Abbott’s BinaxNOW self-screen which comes in a pack of two tests to be taken 36 hours apart.

Otherwise there is an even better way to prevent yourself from spreading COVID-19 at gatherings Kulkarni says: Get vaccinated. Being fully vaccinated and getting a booster if eligible significantly reduces your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,

Then Franklin will get into the interesting reasons — the less obvious factors that turned his former four-star recruit into the leading receiver for the reigning Super Bowl champions.

“Chris also just had a maturity to him very early on” Franklin said during a recent visit to Raymond James Stadium before his Nittany Lions face Arkansas in the Jan. 1 Outback Bowl.

Godwin’s maturity showed in the approach he took to being a Penn State receiver from 2014-16. Franklin could play him at any of the three spots because Godwin understood the game quickly and thoroughly.

It also showed up off the field. Godwin dated his high school girlfriend (Mariah DelPercio) through college and into the NFL. They got married in May. Franklin mentioned that relationship as one sign of the distraction-free all-business approach Godwin took at Penn State.

“He knew what he wanted and how he was going to do it and literally he’s a pro’s pro” Franklin said. “If you ever spend any time with him he is sharp and buttoned up and polished and polite. He’s a star.”

That became apparent early in their time together at Penn State. In 2014 Godwin became the fourth true freshman in program history to have a 100-yard receiving game. The next year he was the Big Ten’s second-leading receiver (1101 yards).

When he left for the 2017 NFL draft (where the Bucs picked him in the third round) Godwin ranked in the top seven in Nittany Lions history in touchdown catches (18) yards (2404) and receptions (153).

“He’s just so reliable” Franklin said. “So I’m not surprised at all with the success that he’s having on or off the field.”

Franklin has followed Godwin’s NFL career from afar and pointed to another story that shows his former player’s maturity: Godwin relinquishing his No. 12 jersey to Tom Brady to keep his quarterback happy.

“He just gets it you know?” Franklin said. “He gets the big picture. He’s going to be a great teammate. He’s going to be a playmaker but he’s also going to be a great ambassador to not only Penn State but obviously the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.”

Pro football’s sorest loser was on one in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ shutout loss to the New Orleans Saints failing to score any points in a game they were favored to win by double digits.

Brady briefly addressed Tampa Bay media in his postgame conference call muttering into his microphone while wearing a wrinkled white T-shirt: “We’ve got to get a lot better. Got to get back to work. There’s a lot of football left see if we can go get a win next week.”

It’s just delicious. Brady coasted through a bunch of easy seasons in the AFC East for decades before making the jump to the NFC thinking he could take advantage of Drew Brees’ retirement and fill a power vacuum in the NFC South. Instead he’s been beaten at nearly every turn and has yet to notch a regular season win against New Orleans through four meetings.

So we’re playing the hits. Here’s an updated photo gallery of every grimace from Brady’s loss to the Saints in Week 15 and the tough games he experienced them before it since signing with Tampa Bay:

Both winning streaks will be on the line in Week 15 as Tampa Bay hosts the division rival New Orleans Saints on Sunday Night Football.

The Bucs’ respective win streaks won’t be the only thing on the line this Sunday. With a fifth straight win and 10th straight home victory they’ll become champions of the NFC South for the first time since 2007. Now that’s making history and to do so against the Saints—division winners for the last four years—would be that much sweeter.

While the team as a whole will look to write their names in the history books as the franchise’s seventh division-champion team there will also be some individuals looking to work their way toward history as well. Let’s see where things stand heading into Sunday night’s Week 15 clash.

RTX,RTX Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE4LzIyODQ0MDkxL252aWRpYS1ydHgtMjA1MC1sYXB0b3AtZ3B1LWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's new RTX 2050 laptop GPU could potentially power more affordable laptops,"Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 2050 laptop GPUs don’t sound “new” at all considering that the company already released the RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs for laptops earlier this year (via VideoCardz). But it’s clear that Nvidia isn’t ready to retire its 20 series GPUs just yet — Nvidia says that the RTX 2050 will be available in laptops starting in the spring of 2022.

The RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture not Turing

The RTX 2050 isn’t just a piece of old hardware brought back from the dead. Unlike other 20 series chips the RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture not Turing. Ampere is the same architecture that the RTX 3050 (and all other 30 series cards) is powered by and packaging it within a 20-series card could potentially offer some of the same ray-tracing improvements at a cheaper price. The RTX 2050 comes with the same 2048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory that the RTX 3050 has. However it offers a 64-bit memory bus when compared to the RTX 3050’s 128-bit potentially leading to a bit of a downgrade in performance.

While it’s possible that Nvidia is releasing a GPU that doesn’t belong to the latest and greatest 30 series due to the ongoing chip shortage the move may also come as a way to provide a middle ground between the RTX 3050 and the RTX 1650. Nvidia might want a mid-range GPU that offers a boost in performance over the RTX 1650 but is still more affordable when compared to devices that carry the RTX 3050.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMjA1MC1sYXB0b3AtZ3B1LTE1MTAzMDcyNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's RTX 2050 laptop GPU slaps an old name on new technology,"NVIDIA is once again reviving an old name in its graphics chip lineup but this time it's for thoroughly modern technology. As AnandTech reports the company has introduced an GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU that may sound like recycled low-end hardware but is based on the same Ampere design found in the RTX 3050 series. The naming scheme is confusing to put it mildly but that does give you up-to-date ray tracing in a potentially more affordable package.

You'll have to settle for a 64-bit memory bus instead of the 3050's 128-bit pipe and the boost clock stops at 1477MHz versus 1740MHz. However you'll still get the same 2048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory while peak power consumption drops to a much more reasonable 45W compared to the 80W of higher-end chips. This is partly meant for 'in-between' laptops that don't have the chassis space or batteries for RTX 30 GPUs.

The company has also revealed two entry-level chips the MX550 and MX570 although it's shy on details beyond promises of more CUDA cores faster memory and greater power efficiency than the MX450 they replace. The MX550 is based on the older Turing architecture while the MX570 uses Ampere. Like with past MX chips these are meant for thin-and-light portables where integrated graphics might not be good enough.

There's another issue beyond the branding: the release window. NVIDIA doesn't expect the RTX 2050 or new MX parts to reach shipping laptops until spring 2022. That's an usually long lead time and suggests NVIDIA is announcing the GPUs now to clear the slate for CES in January. Whatever the reasoning you'll have to be patient if you want a laptop with modern NVIDIA graphics but find RTX 3050-equipped systems beyond your reach.

The company claims the unit is ""hundreds of times faster than a typical computing unit such as NVIDIA RTX 3080."" 350 times faster to be exact but that only applies to certain types of applications.



Still in a demo stage the Photonic Arithmetic Computing Engine (PACE) integrates electronics and photonics in a singular chassis performing operations at the speed of light and thus achieving extreme acceleration for certain AI Deep Learning and Machine Learning compute workloads.

PACE accelerates certain matrix acceleration applications so much faster than NVIDIA's RTX 3080 because of the very nature of its computing elements. It's easy enough to understand: latency which is the frame of time between when an event is ordered to happen and when it actually happens is much much lower on Lightelligence's system. That's the benefit of data traveling around at the speed of light.

To achieve this Lightelligence knew it would have to focus not only on the optical capabilities of the PACE but also on traditional semiconductors and software solutions linking the two. The company thus describes itself as a hardware and software provider; the company has also designed algorithms specifically designed to crack some of the most fundamental computing problems of today in a photonic environment.

""One of Lightelligence's unique advantages over other companies developing optical computing is our ability to co-design many different domains together"" said Erwan Di Vita lead engineer for PACE at Lightelligence. ""Our photonic engineers work alongside analog digital packaging and software engineers to design the chips which are then manufactured and built into 3D systems by our post-silicon teams. Without such innovations from our opto-electronic packaging team none of this would be possible.""

The PACE is a somewhat narrow engine when it comes to what exact workloads it can execute. But as the company says ""PACE efficiently searches for solutions to several of the hardest computational math problems including the Ising problem and the graph Max-Cut and Min-Cut problems illustrating the real-world potential of integrated photonics in advanced computation."" In that perspective we can classify it as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) of sorts: it does very few things (or a single thing) very very well.

As Yichen Shen Ph.D. founder and CEO of Lightelligence put it ""These problems belong to an important class of intractable mathematical problems known as NP-complete which have stumped mathematicians for the last 50 years"" he said. ""Algorithms for NP-complete problems are important because these problems can be mapped to each other and they have hundreds of practical applications in fields that include cryptography power grid optimization and advanced image analysis. The progress we've made on NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems illustrates the potential of our technology to transform computing.""

However the PACE achieves that coveted specialization through an added field of computing - which not only makes the system faster it makes it incredibly more efficient. While traditional semiconductor systems have the issue of excess heat that results from running current through nanometre-level features at sometimes ludicrous frequencies the photonic system processes its workloads with zero Ohmic heating — there's no heat produced from current resistance. Instead it's all about light.

Lightelligence is built around its CEO's Ph.d. thesis - and the legitimacy it provides. This is so because when ""Deep Learning with Coherent Nanophotonic Circuits"" was published in Nature in 2017 Lightelligence's CEO and founder Yichen Chen had already foreseen a path for optical circuits to be at the forefront of Machine Learning computing efforts. By 2020 the company had already received $100 million in funding and employed around 150 employees. A year later Lightspeed has achieved a dem product that it says is ""hundreds of times faster than a typical computing unit such as NVIDIA RTX 3080"". 350 times faster to be clear.

The PACE's debut aims to charm enough capital to comfortably reach its goal of launching a pilot AI accelerator product to the market in 2022. That's still only a stretch goal in the company's vision however its goal is to develop and distribute a mass-market photonics-based hardware solution as early as 2023 targeting the Cloud AI Finance and Retail markets. Considering how Lightelligence managed to improve the company's 2019 COMET design performance by a factor of a million with PACE in a span of two years it'll be interesting to see where their efforts take them when it comes to launching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMjA1MC1teDU1MC1teDU3MC1sYXB0b3AtZ3B1cy1hbm5vdW5jZWQtNzY3ODc0NS_SAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTIwNTAtbXg1NTAtbXg1NzAtbGFwdG9wLWdwdXMtYW5ub3VuY2VkLTc2Nzg3NDUvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050 MX550 MX570 laptop GPUs announced,"Nvidia has announced three new GPUs for the laptop space based on its Turing and Ampere architecture.

They will be powering new entry-level laptops that will be coming out in 2022 and could provide a better gaming performance on laptops in the space.

The new GPU is called the RTX 2050 and it’s designed to fill out the lower end of the RTX 2000 series. The graphics chip actually features more CUDA cores than the RTX 2060 mobile chip but it has significantly less video memory.

The specs for the RTX 2050 mobile GPU.

Still the announcement is strange since it was only back in May when the company launched the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti mobile GPUs. Specifically the RTX 3050 is supposed to be available for laptops as low as $799 although prices can go as high as $1000.

Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it’s struggling to secure enough chip supplies for the RTX 3050. However it seems the company is trying to address GPU demand in more affordable laptops.

“Many people have different hardware requirements for the apps they use and the tasks they perform” Nvidia said in the announcement. “To give more choices to gamers and creators we’re introducing new GeForce laptop options that will be available via our network of partners worldwide.”

In addition to the RTX 2050 the company is releasing the GeForce MX570 and MX550 mobile GPUs for laptops. These graphics chips have been designed to power video- and photo-editing tasks. However the new GPUs won’t arrive until next spring.

It’s not the first time Nvidia has returned to the RTX 2000 series. Earlier this month the company revived the RTX 2060 desktop graphics card to help “alleviate supply constraints” during the ongoing chip shortage. The problem is that US retailers have yet to begin selling the new RTX 2060 card. Nvidia later told PCGamer that supplies for the product won’t ramp up until the end of this month though January."

Being a landlord is one of the oldest ways to earn a passive income. And these days you don’t have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.

Check out real estate investment trusts which are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.

REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants fixing damages or chasing down late payments. Instead they simply sit back and enjoy the dividend checks rolling in when they pick a winning REIT.

Of course the COVID-19 pandemic did impact some commercial real estate. And not all REITs are the same. If you are a landlord for e-commerce giant Amazon for instance you should have no problem collecting a steady stream of rental income.

With that in mind let’s take a look at two REITs paying oversized dividends to investors — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash.

Amazon’s landlord

The first one is STAG Industrial (STAG) a REIT that owns and operates single-tenant industrial properties throughout the U.S. Its biggest tenant is Amazon.

The company’s portfolio consists of 517 buildings totaling approximately 103 million rentable square feet across 40 states.

Note that 434 of the 517 properties are warehouses which happen to be an essential part of e-commerce.

Moreover a tenant survey in 2020 revealed that around 40% of the REIT’s portfolio handles e-commerce activity.

To see how solid STAG Industrial is take a look at its dividend history.

Since the company went public in 2011 it has paid a higher dividend every single year.

While most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule STAG Industrial pays shareholders every month. The monthly dividend rate stands at 12.08 cents per share which translates to an annual yield of 3.2%.

STAG Industrial shares are up 50% year to date. If you don’t feel comfortable picking individual stocks in this elevated market you can always build a diversified passive income portfolio automatically just by investing your spare change.

When it comes to paying monthly dividends one company stands out above all — Realty Income (O).

Realty Income has been paying uninterrupted monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That’s 616 consecutive monthly dividends paid.

Better yet since the company went public in 1994 it has announced 114 dividend increases.

Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of nearly 11000 commercial properties located in all 50 states Puerto Rico the UK and Spain. It leases them to around 650 tenants operating across 60 industries.

Story continues

This means even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn the impact on company-level financials will likely be limited.

For instance while Realty Income rents some properties to AMC Theaters — whose business was hurt by COVID-19 — it also has Walgreens FedEx and Walmart as some of its top tenants. And these businesses turned out to be largely pandemic-proof.

Earlier this week the REIT increased its monthly cash dividend to 24.65 cents per share giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 4.4%.

To put things in perspective the average dividend yield of S&P 500 companies is just 1.3% today.

Looking beyond REITs

Of course stocks are volatile. And even the best REITs are not immune to the market’s ups and downs.

Diversification is key — and you don’t have to stay in the stock market to get it.

If you want to invest in something insulated from stock market swings take a look at some lesser-known alternative assets.

Traditionally investing in sectors like exotic vehicles or multifamily apartment buildings or even litigation finance have only been options for the ultrarich.

But with the help of new platforms these kinds of opportunities are available to retail investors too.

Regeneron’s humanized mice for therapeutic TCR discovery; plus Pattern Century and more BioCentury’s roundup of translational news

In Science Immunology Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) demonstrated how its VelociT humanized mouse model platform could enable de novo discovery of fully human therapeutic TCRs. Using the company's VelociGene technology researchers led by Lynn Macdonald replaced mouse TCRA and TCRB variable regions along with ectodomain regions of four other genes with human sequences to generate 'VelociT' mice. In a validation experiment the team isolated and screened TCRs from VelociT mice immunized with human tumor-associated peptide antigens yielding a TCR that showed antitumor activity in a xenograft mouse model of melanoma.

For more than a year antibody drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly have been the go-to treatments for early COVID-19 thanks to their ability to head off severe disease and keep patients out of the hospital.

But both drugmakers recently warned that laboratory testing suggests their therapies will be much less potent against omicron which contains dozens of mutations that make it harder for antibodies to attack the virus. And while the companies say they can quickly develop new omicron-targeting antibodies those aren’t expected to launch for at least several months.

A third antibody from British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline appears to be the best positioned to fight omicron. But Glaxo’s drug is not widely available in the U.S. accounting for a small portion of the millions of doses purchased and distributed by the federal government. U.S. health officials are now rationing scarce drug supplies to states.

“I think there’s going to be a shortage” said Dr. Jonathan Li director of the Harvard/Brigham Virology Specialty Laboratory. “We’re down to one FDA-authorized monoclonal antibody” with omicron because of the reduced effectiveness of Regeneron and Lilly’s drugs.

The delta variant still accounts for more than 95% of estimated U.S. cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But agency leaders say omicron is spreading faster than any past variant and will become the dominant strain nationwide within weeks.

Delivered by injection or infusion antibodies are laboratory-made versions of human proteins that help the immune system fight off viruses and other infections.

Glaxo’s drug developed with Vir Biotechnology was specifically formulated to bind to a part of the virus that is less likely to mutate according to the companies. Early studies of laboratory-simulated omicron by the drugmakers and outside researchers show promising results.

Supply of the drug is “extremely limited and additional doses of the product will not be available until the week of January 3rd” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in an statement posted online.

After pausing distribution last month to conserve supply HHS is now shipping 55000 doses of the drug called sotrovimab to state health departments with the doses arriving as early as Tuesday. An additional 300000 are expected in January.

The agency said it is distributing the drug to states based on their levels of infections and hospitalizations.

HHS recommends states conserve the drug for the highest risk patients who are most likely to have omicron infections either based on laboratory testing that can identify the variant or elevated levels of omicron spread in local communities identified as 20% and higher.

High-risk patients include seniors and those with serious health problems such as obesity heart disease diabetes and immune-system disorders.

Prior to the pause in shipments Glaxo’s drug accounted for about 10% of the 1.8 million antibody doses distributed to state health officials between mid-September and late November according to federal figures.

London-based Glaxo says it is on track to produce 2 million doses by May under contracts with the U.S. Canada the U.K. Japan and several other countries. The company is working to add more manufacturing capacity next year.

The loss of two leading antibody therapies puts even more focus on a pair of highly anticipated antiviral pills that U.S. regulators are expected to soon authorize.

The drugs from Pfizer and Merck would be the first treatments Americans can take at home to head off severe disease. Pfizer’s drug in particular has shown a powerful effect curbing hospitalizations and deaths by nearly 90% in high-risk patients.

“If it’s rolled out effectively this has a real big potential” to make up for antibody treatments said Andrew Pekosz a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. “That’s an immediate place where these antivirals could minimize the impact of omicron.”

Still initial supplies of both drugs are expected to be limited.

The shrinking toolbox of treatments is a painful reminder that the virus still has the upper hand in the U.S. even with more than 200 million Americans fully vaccinated.

Scientists around the world are racing to understand omicron including whether it causes more or less severe disease and how easily it evades protection from prior infection vaccination and antibody drugs.

“We’re certainly going to see hospitalizations rise” said Dr. James Cutrell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “If we have a lack of antibodies that’s certainly going to contribute to that many more patients needing to be in the hospital.”

Longtime Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen a Whatcom County Republican has died following a COVID-19 diagnosis while traveling in El Salvador last month. He was 52. Washington Senate Republicans confirmed the death Saturday and released a brief statement from Ericksen's wife and two daughters. “We are heartbroken to share that our husband and father passed away on Friday Dec. 17. Please keep our family in your prayers and thank you for continuing to respect our privacy in this extremely difficult time” the statement read. Senate Minority Leader John Braun said Ericksen ""could be larger than life"" and said the Republican caucus ""will miss him greatly.""

The cause of death or other details including where Ericksen was when he died were not immediately disclosed. Ericksen tested positive for Covid-19 in November while on a non-legislative trip to El Salvador. After his diagnosis Ericksen sent a desperate email plea to the House and Senate Republican caucuses. ""I cannot get back home and it's to the point that I feel it would be beneficial for me to receive an IV of monoclonal antibodies (Regeneron)"" Ericksen wrote in his email. ""I have a doctor here who can administer the IV but the product is not available here."" Regeneron makes an FDA-approved treatment for Covid-positive patients who are at high risk for hospitalization or death. It's not clear if Ericksen was able to obtain the drug. Soon after his email blast for help he left El Salvador on a medevac flight to Florida. As of the week before Thanksgiving he was reported to be in stable condition.

However in the month since Ericksen’s whereabouts and condition had been something of a mystery. Efforts by The Bellingham Herald his local newspaper to contact him or his family for an update had been unsuccessful. First elected at age 29 to the Washington House in 1998 Ericksen served six terms before getting elected to the state Senate in 2010 according to his legislative biography. He last won re-election in 2018 by just 46 votes. He served the 42nd Legislative District. Ericksen was the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Energy and Technology Committee. He was also a founding member of the Senate Republican’s Freedom Caucus. “We need to take a stand for lower taxes less government regulation and respect for people’s constitutional rights” Ericksen said in a February press release announcing the formation of the caucus.

During the 2021 legislative session Ericksen sponsored legislation to prohibit requirements that people get a COVID-19 vaccine. The bill did not get a hearing in the Democratically controlled state Senate. It's not known if Ericksen was vaccinated or not against Covid-19. Asked earlier this year by Keith Eldridge of KOMO-TV if he was vaccinated Ericksen declined to say. He added ""I'm not for [vaccines] or against vaccines."" A lifelong resident of Whatcom County Ericksen was a graduate of Cornell University and had a master's degree from Western Washington University. In 2017 Ericksen formed a business Pac Rim Bridges LLC with former Republican state Rep. Jay Rodne according to filings with the Secretary of State’s Office. On Ericksen's 2021 financial affairs disclosure statement he described Pac Rim Bridges as a consulting firm and reported that it was providing services to the Kingdom of Cambodia.

In 2019 The Seattle Times reported that Ericksen and Rodne had secured a $500000 contract with the government of Cambodia to promote improved relations with the U.S. and had traveled to the Southeast Asian country to meet with its longtime prime minister Hun Sen. In a 2018 report Human Rights Watch said Cambodia was in a ""human rights freefall"" and was ""rapidly reverting towards a one-party state."" On a previous trip to Cambodia in 2018 Ericksen served as an election observer. He was quoted in Cambodian media praising the election as “free just and nonviolent expressing the wills of the Cambodian people"" even though the U.S. government has described Cambodian elections as ""neither free nor fair"" according to The Seattle Times reporting.

In mid-November Dar es Salaam Tanzania’s largest city responded to weeks of drought by rationing water to residents and businesses. But some sections of the city of nearly seven million people only have running water once a week—if at all.

With the developed world focused on decarbonization and the energy transition an ongoing water crisis in Africa and other regions of the Global South has not received the same level of concern. Even at COP26 a newly formed Water and Climate Coalition banded together with the mission to “raise awareness share experience and provide guidance” about the issues.

But with the climate emergency intensifying the critical importance of public control of water runs headlong into the sometimes debilitating role played by international financial institutions in funding water projects that fail to deliver.

Many African countries rely on Western governments and international financial institutional investment to build manage and maintain water infrastructure. As of 2019 the World Bank has funded $8.2 billion in water sector projects in sub-Saharan Africa the highest investment in any region representing over one-quarter of its entire Water Global Practice portfolio. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) a member of the World Bank Group has invested more than $1.4 billion globally in private water corporations since 1993 and has committed to major annual increases.

These investments would appear to benefit countries that cannot raise the tremendous sums needed to build manage and maintain water supplies. But water access remains poor and many African countries are given little to no opportunity to consider funding opportunities outside of privatization. Instead these life-altering decisions are made by private companies and by financial entities controlled by member governments in the developed world.

Like similar undertakings in the United States and Europe many African private water projects have failed repeatedly prompting national officials or local activists to press for remunicipalization.

“Corporations and institutions like the World Bank are trying to suck water and profits out of Africa as though they have a massive drinking straw” Akinbode Oluwafemi the executive director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) an influential Pan-African environmental organization told an international press briefing in October during the CAPPA-sponsored Africa Week of Action Against Water Privatization.

Like similar undertakings in the United States and Europe many African private water projects have failed repeatedly prompting national officials or local activists to press for remunicipalization the transfer of privatized assets that were once run by local or national agencies back to public control.

The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) was established after the Tanzania government stepped in to end its especially disastrous experience with water privatization. In 2003 City Water Services (CWS) a private utility company owned by Britain's Biwater International and Germany’s Gauff Ingenieure won a contract with the Tanzanian government to provide water to Dar es Salaam. But two years later the private utility had only invested less than half of the $8.5 million needed to update the city’s 50-year-old pipe network which led to water shortages and erratic services for city residents. Tanzania eventually won a lawsuit against Biwater.

For several years Tanzania and its international and private-sector partners tried to press forward with the contract before the government pulled the plug on the private company and set up DAWASCO in 2005. A report found that CWS officials were not able to rise to the immense challenges of rescuing a dilapidated water system collecting customers’ payments and navigating the political environment. Early on DAWASCO managed improvements in some areas such as repairing leaks and extending service connections. But current drought conditions have magnified the numerous water quality connection revenue and management issues. The reliance on international funding that comes with complex conditions which countries struggle to meet also complicates matters.

In Nigeria grassroots activists have been fighting privatization for decades. During the Africa Week of Action a group of women demonstrators unsuccessfully tried to enter a state government building in the state of Lagos to confront lawmakers and deliver petitions opposing further privatization. Like Dar es Salaam Lagos has struggled with aging infrastructure inconsistent supplies for users regulatory failures and budget difficulties. A 2020 investigation by CAPPA on waterworks in Lagos found many individual water distribution plants functioning inconsistently or not at all which left the nearly 15 million residents of one of the largest cities in the world vulnerable to COVID-19 and other diseases and forced to rely on private water sellers.

Beginning in the late 1990s the IFC encouraged the Nigerian government to support public-private partnerships and other investments such as privatizing the Lagos Water Corporation. However public and other reform efforts have largely collapsed one after another stoking years of protests over dismal water access and deteriorating water quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Brockton Enterprise

BOSTON — The NBA-leading Golden State Warriors are tough enough to beat on a normal night. Given that the Boston Celtics were without six players five of whom were in health and safety protocols that task became exponentially more difficult on Friday.

The Celtics still almost pulled it off behind a valiant second-half effort as they erased a 20-point deficit but ultimately Stephen Curry and the Warriors proved to be too much and Golden State managed a 111-107 victory at TD Garden.

Here are five thoughts about the Celtics (14-15) who are in a precarious playoff position:

Plenty of heart and guts in the second half

On the first leg of back-to-back games and with three rotation players sidelined in Al Horford Grant Williams and Dennis Schroder along with losing Romeo Langford in the first half to a neck injury it felt as if could have been a pack-it-in scenario for the Celtics.

But Boston showed a resiliency it has seldom shown throughout this season to battle back from a 14-point halftime deficit. The Celtics battened down defensively holding the Warriors to 14 points in the third quarter after surrendering 68 points in the first half. Jayson Tatum (27 points 8 rebounds 6 assists) and Jaylen Brown (20 points 9 rebounds) also stepped up in the frame combining to score 17 of Boston's first 18 points.

""Loved the fight and effort overall"" Celtics coach Ime Udoka said. ""Shorthanded or not we've got capable guys out there. We felt we defended at the proper level in the second half.""

Even though the Celtics trailed by 10 points with under four minutes to go they kept clawing with Marcus Smart leading the charge. Smart who tallied 19 points 8 assists and 6 rebounds had the Celtics scrapping until the final buzzer as he dove for loose balls got an offensive foul call on Curry and brought the Celtics to within 109-107 by hitting a 3-pointer with 4.2 seconds left.

It's that type of determination that will carry the Celtics. On the flip side it seems to only happen when they need to overcome a large deficit.

The Stephen Curry show

Curry arrived in Boston fresh off becoming the NBA's all-time 3-pointer leader and It looked as if he was going to put together another stunning performance when he scored 16 points in the first quarter.

While Curry finished with a game-high 30 points he went only 3-of-14 from the field over the final three quarters. Boston made it tough for him to get clean looks but he still found a way at the end to provide the most pivotal baskets.

Curry made a key 3-pointer off a long offensive rebound with 4:24 left and came through with an even bigger bucket on a floater in the lane with 35 seconds left to give the Warriors some breathing room. Curry was buoyed by Andrew Wiggins who netted 27 points on 11-of-20 shooting.

Missed opportunities

In any comeback that falls short it's easy to lament the chances the Celtics didn't take full advantage of or the ones that ended up costing them.

In the final second of the first half Boston basically gave the Warriors four free points when Smart inexplicably fouled Curry on a heave from beyond half court. Udoka disagreed with the call and received a technical which allowed Curry to sink four straight free throws.

""[Curry's] a guy you have to pick up at every point on the court"" Udoka said. ""Might have got overaggressive there. It looked like Marcus didn't jump or contest it. He put his hands up obviously and Curry jumped forward a little bit. They said it was foul. It's a tough one to give up obviously when you work your way back into the game so we were all disappointed with that.""

The Celtics had their own issues at the charity stripe missing eight free throws in the second half. Robert Williams and Brown combined to miss four free throws in the first 3:20 of the third quarter and Williams missed another crucial pair with the Celtics trailing by seven with 2:05 left.

Lackluster first half

Even with a few of Boston's big men absent from the contest Udoka didn't seem too worried about the rebounding department prior to the game.

But in the first half the Warriors outworked the Celtics on the glass by grabbing nine of their 12 offensive rebounds in the opening 24 minutes. The Warriors set the tone on the first possession of the game when it got four offensive rebounds in a row.

Udoka said he showed the team some clips at halftime displaying the Warriors outhustling the Celtics.

""We definitely did it to ourselves"" Smart said. ""Offensive rebounding they're getting second- third- fourth-chance shots. They outhustled us and they outworked us. Like Ime talked about it the basketball gods rewarded them for that. We can't put ourselves in that situation.""

Aaron Nesmith roller-coaster ride

Buckle up when it comes to the play of Aaron Nesmith. The second-year forward brings a ton of energy to the court with his all-out hustle but he still has yet to find a way to play with control — it's earned him the nickname Crash Bandicott according to Smart. That proves beneficial and harmful as he tries to carve out a role in Boston's rotation.

Nesmith had three straight offensive possessions midway through the fourth quarter that characterized the wide range of his up-and-down play. First he missed a wide-open 3-pointer from the corner only to get the ball in the same spot on the following trip down the floor. This time he drove baseline and converted a strong three-point play. The next time the Celtics were on offense however he turned the ball over.

Nesmith who also drew a charge on Curry late in the third quarter played 23 minutes and chipped in with 11 points.

It was very reminiscent of the Philadelphia Eagles loss in which Zach Wilson had three touchdown drives during the first two quarters and none during the final two. It was the same story today as the Jets led 17-10 at halftime and lost 31-24 with a defensive score as the lone points after the break.

Obviously some blame falls on Wilson being that he’s the quarterback but there was plenty wrong with this unit as a whole in quarters three and four.

Saleh Speaks on Miami Clampdown

Play

After the game head coach Robert Saleh addressed the lack of second-half offense from a defensive perspective during his postgame press conference.

“They did a good job getting in man coverage and all that stuff” the Jets HC began “which is the best way just play [us] with good eye discipline and early in that third quarter establishing the line of scrimmage from a defensive standpoint and even the drive that we had going with the two explosives like I talked about — we finally get something going and we gave it back with a sack-fumble — so we could never get anything rolling in the second half.”

That fumble was Wilson’s only turnover in Week 15 and it was a killer. The rookie was under pressure for what felt like the entire second half and on certain plays he was caught holding the ball longer than he should because of tight coverage downfield.

Let me be clear though the second-half struggles were a collaborative effort. As Saleh mentioned Dolphins HC Brian Flores switched up his game plan bringing his secondary up in tight man coverage.

They were able to do this because the Jets had no deep threat that scared them — I’m looking at you Denzel Mims and Keelan Cole.

Wilson’s favorite targets were Jamison Crowder and his tight ends (Tyler Kroft Ryan Griffin and Trevon Wesco combined for five receptions off five targets). These are all underneath options not downfield threats.

This offense is really missing Elijah Moore and Corey Davis right now and the effect of their absence is starting to impact other areas. For example the offensive line allowed one sack in the first half and five in the second.

With George Fant out and Alijah Vera-Tucker on the sidelines for part of this stretch the Dolphins pass rush targeted backups like Conor McDermott and Dan Feeney. Starting right tackle Morgan Moses was having a difficult time holding his edge as well the longer the football remained inside the pocket.

It reminded me of the same way Buffalo neutralized Mike White. Wilson talked about this domino effect of inefficiency after the game.

He stated: “Yeah once you get man coverage [the quick passing] kind of goes away right? You gotta let guys try and win you gotta give them time to win on routes and so it’s gonna cause me to hitch on some but they’ll probably give up some down the field. Unfortunately we didn’t capitalize on any of those but for the most part it’s gotta be earned when those [defenders] step up like that. I was trying to do my best of just sitting in the pocket and trusting the protection and just trying to give those guys a shot down the field.”

Who Deserves the Most Heat?

Play

The quarterback generally gets the most heat when the offense disappoints but we all saw Wilson operating this playbook beautifully throughout the first half — so what gives?

Twice now halftime adjustments have outsmarted the Jets (considering the Eagles game) but this time the defense held up their end. Wilson had the ball he just couldn’t do anything with it.

Some of that falls on Mike LaFleur who had an incredibly creative first two quarters. Perhaps the Jets OC showed his best cards too early because the second half lacked ingenuity.

As Wilson noted Miami was challenging them to win one-on-ones in coverage and on the offensive line and very few Jets players stepped up. That puts all the pressure on a rookie QB to make something out of nothing and although he worked his magic earlier in the game Wilson was unable to do so late.

So who’s to blame? Who should we direct our ire toward as fans?

The rookie quarterback slowly finding his way? The offensive coordinator who was outsmarted and out-schemed? The wide receivers who couldn’t create an inch of space? The blockers who folded under pressure? Or the GM for the lack of depth on the roster?

All would be fair assessments but Saleh simply attributed it to “rhythm.” He voiced: “Offensive football is a rhythm — sustaining drives creating first downs keeping the ball in manageable situations… Obviously it’s something we’ll look at but I don’t know if there’s anything that I can put my finger on right now.”

Yesterday evening at approximately 8:30 a woman we spoke with was at Ukiah’s Ross Dress for Less shopping for stocking stuffers. She paid for her items and on her way out the door the security alarms went off. It turned out that one of her items still had the security tag.

While the store’s loss prevention officer was working with her to sort out the situation a man in his late 20s or early 30s walked up to the line with an expensive rolling suitcase filled with items and an armload of merchandise.

The woman we spoke with watched this man stand in line momentarily looked left looked right and then confidently walked out the door with what she estimated was $600.00 worth of goods.

The woman still engaging in her interaction with the loss prevention officer pointed out the shoplifter and was told simply “I cannot do anything.”

In a brief conversation with a Ross manager last evening we learned this sort of incident happens often at the Ukiah location and management is instructed to report it to their higher-ups. When asked if these incidents ever result in charges being filed the manager could not say because it is “out of our hands” once reported up the company’s chain.

Keep in mind California’s Proposition 47 passed by voters in 2014 actually recategorized a number of non-violent offenses as misdemeanors rather than felonies including shoplifting where the value of property stolen does not exceed $950 dollars.

City officials instructed officers to ticket people selling food without a permit. On both Saturday and Sunday officers ticketed vendors. Public works employees confiscated carts and food items.

""They all wear multiple hats and that includes handling the food while handling the cash. And Covid or not cash is one of the dirtiest items because it passes through so many hands"" said San Francisco resident Jenny Shao.

City officials said the issue is about safety. A vendor was seen cooking hot dogs with an exposed propane tank on a busy sidewalk. The hot dogs were stored in a plastic bag.

""They all need to follow the rules. All of us need to follow the rules. They are there in place for a reason"" said Shao.

The city said outreach workers have been asking the vendors for weeks to get a permit and follow basic food-handling safety guidelines. The city said the vendors ignored them which led to the weekend crackdown. It appeared the city did not go after illegal vendors operating away from Union Square.

Vendors selling clothes and other non-food items were also left alone.

""I rather them be out there selling food than selling drugs"" said a shopper who gave her name as Ms. Brown. ""You have to do what you have to do to survive.""

Some shoppers said they support the vendors many of which are immigrants from Central America.

""They don't mess with the people that are stealing from the stores but they're messing with the vendors. That's messed up"" said Mike Jones a street vendor who had set up in front of a Ross store on Market Street..

The city said food vendors who were cited this weekend wouldn't have pay the ticket if they can get a permit.

This article was published 18/12/2021 (874 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

Steinbach consumers and business owners have had 12 months to acclimatize to Sunday shopping and while no one can claim it’s been a typical year business and community leaders say the change has largely been a positive one for the city.

Sunday shopping began in Steinbach on Dec. 13 2020 one day after the Manitoba government proclaimed legislation that allowed retailers to stay open later on Sundays and holidays.

Brian Pallister had promised to make the change while campaigning to be re-elected premier in 2019. At the time it remained to be seen whether his promise resonated in Steinbach a Progressive Conservative stronghold that was nevertheless ambivalent about Sunday shopping. As recently as 2018 city council decided against adding a Sunday shopping question to the ballot.

JORDAN ROSS / THE CARILLON Gerald Jeske general manager of Clearspring Centre says the mall parking lot is bustling on a typical Sunday afternoon.

But shoppers vote with their feet and once the legislation was changed larger stores in Steinbach quickly added Sunday hours of operation. Meanwhile most smaller shops along Main Street remained closed. One year later that pattern has held suggesting both approaches can coexist.

Sales bump at the mall

At Clearspring Centre the popularity of Sunday shopping is evident from Highway 12.

“I think you can tell even by the parking lot” general manager Gerald Jeske said in an interview. “At two o’clock on a Sunday afternoon it’s bustling with people.”

Nearly every retailer in the mall has chosen to operate Sundays from noon to 5 p.m. (Sobeys stays open an extra hour.)

“We decided to have these hours to respect the community to respect people who do attend services in the morning” Jeske said. “We wanted to strike the right balance.”

Jeske said Sunday shopping at the mall has helped to keep more dollars in Steinbach.

“Some of the retailers have noticed a bump in sales for sure” he said. “Dollarama does phenomenal on Sundays.”

Looking ahead Jeske was optimistic.

“This could open the door for more national merchants to come to Steinbach.”

Grocers greet change

Real Canadian Superstore which opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m. has some of the most generous Sunday hours in Steinbach.

“Sunday shopping has been a hit here at this store since day one” manager Paulo Sousa said Tuesday by phone. “Our customers just love the fact that we’re open Sundays.”

Sousa said he settled on the store’s Sunday hours by looking at consumer patterns and the size of population the store serves.

Sousa said Sunday shifts are voluntary but aren’t hard to fill.

“We’ve really never ever had any staffing issues for Sundays.”

Sousa who is entering his eighth year at the store said customers often asked for Sunday hours before last year’s legislation change. Adding Sunday hours smoothed out peak shopping times and reduced Saturday lineups which Sousa said made shoppers feel safer during the pandemic.

“What we found is we didn’t have these crazy peaks of customers coming in the day before and the day after Sunday.”

Sousa said corporate policies prevented him from disclosing whether the store has seen a bump in weekly sales over the past year but he allowed Superstore is seeing “more customer traffic.”

Across Park Road Sobeys remains closed on Sunday mornings opening only from noon to 6 p.m.

Franchise owner-operator Lee Kotowicz said he won’t be lengthening those hours which give staff the morning to worship or relax and get them home in time for a family supper.

Kotowicz said nobody wants to work every Sunday but his staff are willing to do their part once or twice a month.

Sundays at Sobeys were quieter during the summer but have picked up at Christmastime Kotowicz said. People duck in after church or pick up an item on their way to a family gathering.

At the checkout Kotowicz said orders tend to be smaller but some customers have shifted their weekly shop to Sundays.

As for weekly sales Kotowicz said COVID-19 is making it “really hard to tell if the Sunday is increasing sales” or simply spreading them over seven days.

But Kotowicz said Sunday hours have reduced food waste at the store which can now sell items baked Saturday that used to be discarded Monday.

Steinbach’s Canadian Tire initially remained closed when the provincial changes took effect then began operating from noon to 5 p.m. a few weeks later. Hannu Nurkkala who is listed as the store’s associate dealer declined an interview and directed questions to a corporate spokesperson.

Dark on Main Street

Apart from Shoppers Drug Mart and Giant Tiger few Main Street businesses have chosen to open Sundays.

The decision remains an easy one for Bev Penner owner of Prairie Oils and Vinegars whose store stays open a bit later on Fridays instead.

“I want a day off. When you’re a small business who’s the one that works all the other hours? It’s me.”

Penner said she doesn’t need to operate seven days a week to provide good customer service. Her business offers curbside pickup and online ordering. If a customer calls to say they’re running late Penner will stay behind an extra 15 minutes.

“I’ve met a customer here on a Sunday too just to give them their online order.”

She said she doesn’t worry that she’s missing out on sales by being closed one day a week.

“The handful (of customers) that have asked over the year it’s not enough to pay my employees’ wages.”

Penner said Winnipeg boutiques similar to hers are also closed Sundays.

“People are heading to Walmart and Sobeys and Superstore that’s where they’re going when they need something on a Sunday.”

JORDAN ROSS / THE CARILLON David Banman a lawyer and former city councillor displays tote bags leftover from an earlier advocacy campaign. Banman says Steinbach has managed the transition to Sunday shopping well.

Another Main Street shop owner whose store is closed Sundays declined an interview by email saying he wished to “keep a low profile on the topic.”

Mayor chamber favour choice

“It’s been a bit of a mute issue. I haven’t heard good or bad about the Sunday shopping” Mayor Earl Funk said Tuesday by phone.

“It was more of a concern before it happened than after.”

Funk’s views on Sunday shopping have evolved since he ran for mayor in 2018. Responding to a survey of mayoral candidates Funk told this newspaper that he favoured keeping Sunday for family friends and rest.

“It is part of our heritage and it makes us unique” he wrote.

At the time allowing Sunday shopping would have required city council to pass a bylaw. But in 2020 the province effectively made the decision for municipalities. City council then decided against passing a bylaw to restrict Sunday shopping.

A year later Funk said council made the right call.

“Now you do have choice. You can choose to be open or you can choose to be closed. That is true democracy and that is true choice.”

Funk said he seldom shops on Sundays save for an occasional trip to a convenience store. It’s “business as usual” at his Main Street store Earl’s Meat Market whose continued Sunday closure hasn’t caused customers to migrate to grocery stores meat counters.

“I thought that at first sales might drop somewhat on Mondays and Tuesday. That has not been the case” Funk said.

The Steinbach Chamber of Commerce likes city council’s hands-off approach to Sunday shopping executive director Michelle Bezditny said by phone.

“The majority of our members supported Sunday shopping in our city” she said referencing periodic surveys leading up to last year’s change that found more and more members were fine with having the option to open Sundays.

“With the choice left up to individual businesses whether to open on Sunday or be closed on Sunday it really ultimately has provided the flexibility needed to proceed as comfort levels and opinions vary” Bezditny explained.

“It definitely keeps these local dollars in our community.”

The chamber hasn’t collected data on Sunday shopping over the past year but Bezditny said it seems to be having a stabilizing effect on the local economy.

“It seems to have flowed quite effortlessly and seamlessly and I wonder if the major contributing factor to that is it’s left up to individual businesses.”

The only catch has been staffing.

“Workforce shortage is a challenge that we are hearing across the board” Bezditny said.

Longtime advocate pleased

David Banman a lawyer and former city councillor renewed his push for Sunday shopping in the months leading up to the 2018 municipal election.

Banman said this week that Steinbach has managed the transition well.

“I think it’s gone a lot better than even most people predicted.”

Banman said Steinbach’s old shopping rules were “outdated” and held businesses and consumers back.

“It was creating all these really strange rules.”

Pharmacies could open Sundays unless they were situated in a grocery store. Meals could be purchased at a restaurant but those same ingredients couldn’t be had at a grocery store.

Banman now regularly shops Steinbach on Sundays. On one such trip last Sunday Banman said he encountered people he knew from Niverville and Landmark who in the past may have shopped in Winnipeg instead.

“I think people really underestimated the amount of people who would shop here from outside the immediate region.”

Banman said the past year suggests Winnipeg and Steinbach consumers aren’t all that different from one another.

“People work all kinds of different hours these days. They worship at different times and places. I mean with the pandemic that’s made it even more different.”

Some Sundays Banman keeps office hours but said he doesn’t ask his support staff to come in. He takes the same approach with those still opposed to Sunday shopping.

“If it’s not right for you I totally understand” he said. “The many thing I think was to get people the choice whether you’re a consumer or a business.”",,,,,,

Those 48 people who tested positive represented 0.78% of the 6091 passengers and crew members on board Symphony of the Seas which left Miami on Dec. 11 and made stops in St. Maarten St. Thomas and Perfect Day at CocoCay (Royal Caribbean's private island) the cruise line said in an updated statement provided Monday morning by spokesperson Lyan Sierra-Caro.

Initially the cruise line reported 44 cases on board. ""This number (48) includes four additional close contacts which were identified as COVID-19 positive at the end of the voyage"" Sierra-Caro said Monday. ""The guests were quarantined on board and assisted upon the ship’s arrival on Dec. 18.""

All passengers 12 and older were required to be fully vaccinated and to test negative to board the Symphony of the Seas ship. The ship sailed with 95% of the onboard community fully vaccinated on the Dec. 11 to Dec. 18 cruise with 98% of those people who tested positive being fully vaccinated Royal Caribbean said.

On Saturday the cruise line also notified passengers from that trip and from two others (a sailing that departed Dec. 4 and one that departed Dec. 18) that a passenger who sailed on that same ship earlier this month tested positive for the omicron variant of the coronavirus.

""We were notified by the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that a guest on board our (December) 4th cruise tested positive and it was identified as omicron"" Sierra-Caro said Saturday. ""They asked us to notify guests on the sailing – the one that ended today – and the current one.""

In the email to the passengers who sailed on the three cruises on Symphony of the Seas Royal Caribbean outlined what happened.

""This guest did not report symptoms to our onboard medical teams as outlined in our health protocols"" the cruise line said in a copy of the email obtained by USA TODAY. ""Their post cruise test results were subsequently confirmed as the omicron variant.""

The 48 cases on the recently disembarked cruise ""were found as a result of immediately identifying close contacts after a guest tested positive"" Sierra-Caro said noting each person was quarantined quickly.

Initially Royal Caribbean said that everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic. In the statement Monday morning it said that ""everyone who tested positive were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and we continuously monitored their health.""

Six passengers disembarked earlier in the cruise and were transported home. The rest of the passengers were assisted Saturday at disembarkation in Miami Sierra-Caro said.

In the email to passengers Royal Caribbean said that the cases on the Dec. 11th sailing were ""unrelated to the omicron case from the guest who sailed on Dec. 4th.""

It is not immediately clear why the cases were unrelated.

The cruise line advised that passengers visit a certified testing center three to five days after disembarkation per CDC guidance.

On Saturday the CDC said in a statement that the agency was aware of the situation on Symphony of the Seas and that it was working with the cruise line to gather more information.

On Monday the CDC told USA TODAY in a statement provided by spokesperson David Daigle that the health agency continues to work with Royal Caribbean to gather information about the cases and potential exposures. The CDC added that ""RCI collected specimens from the voyage that sailed from 12/11-12/18 for genetic sequencing.""

On the CDC’s cruise ship color status list Symphony of the Seas is “Yellow” indicating that the “CDC has investigated and the ship remains under observation” according to the agency.

Passengers say Royal Caribbean was overwhelmed

Connor O'Dell 29 from Orlando Florida was traveling with a party of 12 on the Symphony of the Seas sailing that wrapped up Saturday. Six of his traveling companions tested positive for COVID-19. Everyone in their group was fully vaccinated and most had had a booster shot O'Dell said.

O'Dell and his fiance James Johnson 36 tested negative he said.

The first person who tested positive in their group was Johnson's aunt who is 66 and at high risk for COVID-19 O'Dell said. She was symptomatic and reported her symptoms to Royal Caribbean Thursday during the cruise.

""She was very symptomatic"" O'Dell said noting she had a bad cough and sore throat and that neither a doctor nor nurse gave her an in-depth physical exam or asked her about preexisting conditions. ""We all knew the risks of going on the ship – the problem is that we were promised a set of protocols (or) adequate medical staffing and they were never adhered to.""

It took around four hours for a nurse to come to administer a coronavirus test and get a result. Johnson's aunt was then quarantined for the rest of the trip.

Johnson said he contacted medical staff and after several attempts he reached a nurse who told him that they were understaffed. He asked if the ship's medical team could check on his aunt. His aunt received a call the next day.

Out of their party she was the only one who was checked in on by the cruise line at all even after five others tested positive Johnson said.

Johnson and O'Dell self-quarantined but later were told that they could leave their stateroom after the positive test came back on Johnson's aunt even though they had been spending time together as a group.

""We kept asking 'are you sure we can leave?'"" Johnson said. After half an hour O'Dell said that they were asked by crew members to isolate again.

Johnson said that they received conflicting results with his cousin being told she tested positive then later told that it was actually her boyfriend who was positive.

""They were so overwhelmed"" Johnson said. ""They just kept saying something (and then) changing what they were saying. Everything was so confusing"" he said.

When asked to comment on whether staff was overwhelmed and if the protocol wasn't followed properly Sierra-Caro said that wasn't the case.

""Our staff was able to handle all the cases on board and we followed all of our protocols for testing and quarantine"" Sierra-Caro said.

As omicron spreads cruise industry says it's focused on health and safety

Cruise Lines International Association the leading trade organization for the cruise industry told USA TODAY Monday in a statement that health and safety are the cruise industry's ""highest priority.""

""Together with our members we are monitoring developments related to the Omicron variant and remain closely engaged with local and national authorities in the places where cruises sail"" the association said in a statement provided by Bari Golin-Blaugrund vice president of strategic communications.

The cruise lines association continued that the protocols which include testing masking vaccination and other measures were ""designed with variants in mind.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tY3J1aXNlLWRvY2tzLWluLW1pYW1pLXdpdGgtNDQtY292aWQtY2FzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean cruise docks in Miami with 44 COVID cases,Former Florida Gov. and US Sen.

The cruise line also announced that one of the passengers onboard a prior cruise itinerary had tested positive for the Omicron variant.

'We were notified by the CDC that a guest onboard our (December) 4th cruise tested positive and it was identified as omicron' a spokesperson for Royal Caribbean told USA TODAY on Saturday. 'They asked us to notify guests on the sailing the one that ended today and the current one.'

Forty-four out of 6074 passengers - or about .72percent - onboard the cruise that departed on December 11 tested positive for COVID after the trip around the Eastern Caribbean. The cruise line said they've all been quarantined.

The scene is slightly reminiscent of the early stages of the outbreak in 2020 when cruise ships became the first super-spreaders due to their enclosed environment and contact between travelers from different cities and countries.

Royal Caribbean said future cruises won't be halted.

Passengers were warned by Royal Caribbean of the 44 cases. The cruise line added that the guest who had previously tested positive for Omicron had failed to report their symptoms to the crew while onboard.

'This guest did not report symptoms to our onboard medical teams as outlined in our health protocols' Royal Caribbean said in an email according to USA Today. 'Their post-cruise test results were subsequently confirmed as the omicron variant.'

She said that the Omicron case was unrelated to the 44 cases on Saturday.

Onboard Royal Caribbean cruise ships passengers age 12 and older are required to be fully vaccinated and to test negative to board the cruise.

Those under 12 are required to have a negative test.

Royal Caribbean has advised passengers to get tested three to five days after disembarking following CDC guidelines.

Royal Caribbean had allowed fully vaccinated passengers to go maskless in designated areas

Twenty-one of its cruise ships came back in operation during the summer

Cruise ships were the first super-spreaders amid the first COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. The enclosed environment and contact between travelers from different countries were the main factors contributing to the severity of the outbreak.

On February 1 2020 a passenger who had been aboard the Diamond Princess days before tested positive for the virus.

After the ship arrived in Japan on February 3 2020 more than 700 people on board became infected. The Diamond Princess was quarantined in the port of Yokohama and for weeks it was the largest outbreak in the world after China.

Cruise lines have recently updated their mask policies requiring all passengers to wear masks indoors unless actively eating or drinking as an additional measure to curb the spread of the Omicron variant.

Royal Caribbean had allowed fully vaccinated passengers to go maskless in designated areas. Twenty-one of its cruise ships came back in operation during the summer.

Since US cruises resumed in June travel and tourism operators have enacted vaccine and testing requirements to avoid disruptions that cost them millions of dollars for much of the pandemic.

There are currently more thean 50 million active cased of COVID-19 in the country

Major Carnival Corp and Royal Caribbean Group brands require most passengers age 12 and older to be fully vaccinated but the companies do make some exceptions. Unvaccinated children under the age of five can cruise on Carnival's ships.

Passengers must present a negative COVID test taken no more than two days before boarding. Royal Caribbean accepts antigen tests.

Walt Disney Co's Disney Cruise Line requires all passengers eligible for vaccines in the United States to be fully vaccinated. Starting January 13 all guests ages five and up will need to be vaccinated.

Unvaccinated passengers must show a negative COVID-19 test taken between three days and 24 hours before their sail date. Rapid antigen tests are not accepted.

Everyone is tested by Disney Cruise Line at the terminal before boarding meaning unvaccinated passengers are tested twice.

Norwegian Cruise Line has a 100percent vaccination policy meaning children under 5 who are not yet eligible for a vaccine are not permitted on cruises.

Norwegian tests its passengers for COVID at the port before they board.

The US has reported more than 800000 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic started more than any nation in the world

To be considered fully vaccinated all the cruise lines require the final vaccine dose to be administered 14 days before the start of the cruise.

In November Disney World had to put its COVID-19 vaccination mandate on hold for its Florida theme park employees after Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law making it illegal for companies to require staff to get vaccinated.

The Labor Department announced Saturday that it won't start checking businesses' compliance with its recently reinstated vaccine-or-test rule until January 10.

Originally the deadline for private businesses and companies to enforce the rule that their employees either get vaccinated against coronavirus or test weekly was on January 4 2022.

After a series of court challenges the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration mandate could move ahead.

The US has reported more than 800000 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic started more than any nation in the world.

There are currently more thean 50 million active cased of COVID-19 in the country.

Florida is the center of cruising in the US with over 60 percent of all the country's embarkations.

With the super-contagious strain of COVID-19 now circulating in the community the chief medical officer issued an emergency order cancelling a major dance hall event at the Lion’s Centre on Saturday night amid fears that the country is about to see a significant rise cases of the virus over the holidays.

“In response to possible community transmission of the Omicron variant the chief medical officer has issued an emergency order to cancel a large event planned for this evening” said Premier Wayne Panton in a statement issued Saturday evening.

“In light of this rapidly evolving situation I want to appeal to members of the community to carefully consider your attendance at any large gathering and to adhere to all safety protocols. The Omicron variant is extremely contagious and we must do all we can to slow the spread” he added.

The Rub-a-Dub Cooler Festival at the Lions Centre had been sold out and had already been rescheduled after being cancelled in September after the Delta variant started circulating in the community for the first time this year.

Now given the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant Medical Officer of Health Dr Samuel Williams-Rodriguez urged everyone to strictly practice COVID-19 prevention measures including hand washing mask wearing and social distancing throughout the holiday season.

“These simple guidelines combined with the full vaccination course and booster offer the best chance of protecting ourselves and those we love” he said.

The first suspected case of Omicron was identified in a traveller on Wednesday. Public Health officials confirmed that the individual was vaccinated and so had not been in quarantine and had been moving freely in the community for two days before testing positive.

The following day at the press briefing Dr Williams-Rodriguez confirmed that there were at least ten more suspected cases four of which were confirmed Friday. But by Saturday officials said there were at least 27 likely cases.

According to the latest information about this variant from around the world early scientific studies show it multiplies about 70 times quicker than the original and Delta versions and data suggest that cases on average double about every two days."

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

An offer for Packers fans For the best local Wisconsin news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. $1 for 6 months

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3BzZy1tYmFwcGUtcmVhbC1tYWRyaWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Did P.S.G.'s Money Buy?,"As a final scene it was so fitting that for a second it was possible to wonder if Kylian Mbappé had done it on purpose.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

If you're anything like me then you'll probably also get a kick out of these interior paint color names. I combed through some popular paint brand collections and chose the ones that made me giggle—and in some cases roll my eyes. Admittedly whoever is in the interior paint-naming industry seems to be a little less pun-prone and definitely less risqué than whoever names nail polishes ( and don't have anything on Dead Salmon and Disco Nap for example) but there are certainly some clever and fun ones. Plus I'm starting to believe the weirder the name the prettier the color so this is also a good place to be if you need paint inspiration.

Want to turn it into a game? Either 1) Drink every time you cringe laugh or think of an obscure pop culture reference 2) write down the first thing each name makes you think of and use the results as a Rorschach Test or 3) send this to friends and have everyone submit haikus with their favorite combinations of the paint color names and the best one wins... I don't know poetry points or something.

“This is one of our most popular colors and one of my favorite neutrals all-around” says Wadden. “Warmer neutrals like this are really important right now because from a psychological perspective warmer hues tend to create a cozier environment and spaces that feel like a sanctuary.” If you layer in soft textures you can use this shade to create a cocooning relaxing space that isn’t too dark.

According to the piece the city is seeking to qualify as a “prohousing city” by exceeding its state-mandated RHNA goals of 1800 units by 50% (an ambitious 2700 units).

How the city intends on satisfying this 10 year goal is unclear.

The City’s latest Major Projects report lists less than 1000 units in the pipeline with a vast majority of those coming from The Emery (500 units) and The Bayview projects (186 units).

Planning for The Emery project goes all the way back to 2006 when the Sherwin-Williams paint factory closed (approved in 2016). The Bayview project goes back to 2013 when it was the Nady building.

With the recent completion of The Intersection Project on San Pablo Avenue these are the only two significant housing projects currently under construction within the city.

Emeryville Housing Pipeline Closing Up?

The article also did not touch on all the housing projects that have recently been withdrawn within the city. The Onni Tower Project (638 units) 58Fifty Shellmound (244 units) the Atrium project (144 units) and now The Marketplace Parcel A (167 units) have all recently moved to withdraw their plans.

These projects represent a combined 1193 units pulled by developers since the pandemic began.

Why so many developers are dropping plans for housing in the city is not clear but in the case of the 58Fifty who are shifting to a commercial project they cited high construction costs a lack of interest by their capital partners and “concerns around future rental controls in the State of California” in the City Progress Staff Report (pg. 22).

The Marketplace Parcels A & B were originally approved to include 185 total units (167 market rate and 18 affordable) as well as parking and retail. The developers are now looking to eliminate the original housing plans and instead build 406178 sq. ft. of R&D space and 833 parking spaces. The 18 affordable units that they are committed to would now come as a standalone affordable project instead of being dispersed throughout the larger project.

“If you look at the cost to build relative to rents the returns would basically be close to zero” noted CCRP President Mark Stefan at the October 28th Planning Commission meeting when prompted about their decision not to pursue housing. “Avalon Bay has as much experience in the real world building apartments they dropped out.” Stefan pointed to the spike in the cost of building materials as a contributor to the high construction costs.

Longfellow Real Estate Partners formerly withdrew its proposed 750000-square-foot 16-story mixed-use Atrium project in October (reported by SF Business Times).

The Onni Tower project was withdrawn shortly after the pandemic began. Another developer has recently acquired the Bay Bridge Center with the intent of building a “mixed-use” project although these plans have not been formerly submitted.

Most Current Projects slated for Standalone Affordable Housing

The city does have plans in place for more standalone affordable housing mostly clustered along San Pablo Avenue near the Southern Oakland border. A majority of the balance of the estimated 1000 in-progress units would come from two supportive housing projects.

The City has indicated that it may prefer a monetary contribution to the City’s affordable housing fund in lieu of building the aforementioned 18-unit standalone Marketplace complex. This contribution could bolster the city’s coffers to build more affordable units.

And the crowd is on board!

Jake Paul enters the ring to the Village People and YMCA #PaulWoodley2 pic.twitter.com/nsbgdMq29Q — Collin Sherwin (@CollinSherwin) December 19 2021

The 2021 boxing calendar has been a busy one and while there are a couple weeks left the final major card is tonight December 18th in Tampa Florida. Jake Paul and Tyron Woodley top a Showtime PPV card that features a mix of serious boxing and celebrity curiosity factor.

Paul and Woodley are fighting a catchweight bout maxed at 192 pounds in a rematch of their August bout. Paul won that won via split decision and was scheduled to face Tommy Fury this time. Fury backed out due to medical issues and Woodley stepped in for the rematch.

The card includes a significant women’s lightweight bout between Amanda Serrano and Miriam Gutiérrez. If Serrano handles her business as the heavy favorite she will likely face pound-for-pound queen Katie Taylor in 2022. If Gutiérrez springs the upset it creates chaos.

The other notable fight brings the curiosity factor. Former NFL star Frank Gore faces former NBA star Deron Williams in the first fight for both athletes. The four-round bout was originally sanctioned as an official pro fight but it has been downgraded to an exhibition.

We’ll be providing live updates of the results all evening. Favored odds below come courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.

Deron Williams vs. Frank Gore heavyweights (4 rounds exhibition)

Round 1: Williams 10-9 — Gore landed a couple solid jabs early but Williams used his reach advantage to keep Gore mostly at bay. In the final minute Williams landed a couple solid shots to shake Gore. In the closing seconds Williams landed a couple more blows. It was more pushing than anything with sloppiness to be expected in a debut.

Round 2: Gore 10-9 — Things got really ugly really quickly. Williams shoved Gore to the mat and the former NFL star appeared to injure his ribs. Gore continued and then shoved Williams down himself. Gore landed a big shot in the final minute that likely scored him the round. This is more pushing and shoving than anything else.

Round 3: Williams 10-9 — This is just a disaster of a fight. The pushing and shoving is continuing. When they clinch they never really separate when told to. Both fighters are mostly just throwing haymakers and occasionally landing. Williams gets the slight edge in the third round.

Round 4: Gore 10-9 — Hell if I know how this round should have been scored. Gore landed some shots Williams landed some shots but they did more pushing again. I’ll go Gore in this round to give us a 38-38 draw.

My final scorecard: 38-38 Draw

Official scorecard: Williams wins split decision. Williams got scores of 38-37 and 40-35 while Gore got a score of 38-37.

That same day Irwin 23 also shared the cute moment featuring her husband and baby girl on her Instagram Story.

Little Grace has become a regular fixture at the kangaroo exhibit per the photos her parents share on social media.

In November Powell posted a cute picture of his daughter sitting in her stroller surrounded by a mob of joeys at the family zoo.

In the shot Grace reached her hand out to one of the animals perched in front of her while several other kangaroos stood behind her in the background.

""I think Grace has decided that she's part of the kangaroo mob @AustraliaZoo 🦘❤️"" Powell wrote as Irwin replied ""She is the sweetest ❤️.""

Blast from the past: Tom Holland 25 has seen his childhood dreams come true – for a picture of the 25-year-old dressed as Spider-Man as a child has emerged shared by girlfriend Zendaya

Zendaya's post comes after it emerged she and Tom were advised not to date by Spider-Man producer Amy Pascal.

The Venom producer's warning clearly fell on deaf ears — and it isn't the first time its happened.

'I gave the same advice to Andrew [Garfield] and Emma [Stone]' the producer revealed. 'It can just complicate things you know? And they all ignored me.'

Andrew and Emma met on the set of the 2012 movie The Amazing Spider-Man.

One image stunned fans as she looked completely different due to her mousey brown hair.

The nostalgic snap sees Emily posing with two friends and smiling with a drink in her hand.

Meanwhile Emily is still following footballer Jack on Twitter despite dumping him.

The Inbetweeners star cut ties with the Premier League star on Instagram after he went public again with his on/off girlfriend Sasha Attwood.

Last month The Sun revealed The Celebrity Juice captain enjoyed secret dates with the 26-year-old footballer while he and his girlfriend Sasha were on a break.

Taking to her Instagram Story this week she shared a quote that read: ""A person grows in beauty whenever they move away from what harms them and into their own power.""

Emily and Jack were in regular contact after The Sun broke news of their liaisons.

But all contact ended as Sasha remained silent.

A source close to Jack has said: ""By all accounts Emily is really hurt and feeling incredibly bruised by the whole encounter.

""She's kept a dignified silence about their fling but now Jack who made out he was single has gone running back to Sasha.

""One minute he was besotted the next he was back with Sasha and acting as if Emily didn't mean anything.

""When their affair came to light it quickly became apparent that people were getting hurt and that things could get very messy.

""Emily didn't want a huge drama and took the executive decision to calmly walk away and has unfollowed him in true millennial style.

""She's a feisty independent woman and won't stand for being second-best.

""Maybe they can be pals again once the dust has settled  but certainly not for the foreseeable.""

Emily and Jack had been introduced by one of the Manchester City footballer's teammates.

After swapping direct messages on Instagram they exchanged numbers.

They later met each other at the Lowry hotel in Manchester before one of Emily's stand-up gigs and then at her house in North London.

Jack the Premier League's first £100million player first met model Sasha 25 at school.

It was also revealed Jack's tangled love life became even more complicated when he was linked with Love Island's Amber.

Kemp announced that Rivian Inc. (Rivian) will invest $5 billion in a carbon-conscious campus in Georgia for its electric adventure vehicles.

Across operations Rivian will create approximately 7500 jobs on just under 2000 acres located at the site known as the East Atlanta Megasite represented by the Joint Development Authority of Jasper Morgan Newton and Walton counties. Once manufacturing operations are fully ramped up the Georgia facility will be capable of producing up to 400000 vehicles per year. Rivian’s manufacturing plant represents the single-largest economic development project in state history.

“We are so proud that Georgia will now be home to Rivian’s largest manufacturing facility” said Governor Kemp. “This single investment – the largest in state history – represents the future of automotive manufacturing and establishes the leading role the Peach State will play in this booming industry for generations to come. In addition to Georgia’s long-term focus on logistics talent workforce and responsive government that significantly contributed to today’s pivotal announcement my administration’s more recent emphasis on innovation and development in the electric mobility ecosystem has equipped our state with a new tool in the tool box to deliver big wins for hardworking Georgians.”

“In the top state for business we value our partners in the private sector and the jobs and investment they provide countless communities. Our Georgia Quick Start workforce training resources world-class higher education institutions and statewide logistics infrastructure assets are prepared to meet Rivian’s production and research and development needs. As one of the world’s most dynamic innovative companies Rivian’s exciting announcement today begins a new chapter for Georgia and we are honored to welcome them to the Peach State!”

Construction on the facility located at Stanton Springs North is expected to begin in summer 2022 and the start of production is slated for 2024. Rivian’s technology centers at the new campus will support the company’s research and development programs. The company is actively working to ensure that both the construction process and future facility meet Rivian’s high standards of conservation and sustainability for a cleaner wilder future. The entire project will support the expansion of the U.S. electric vehicle industry and will serve to decarbonize the transportation and energy sectors.

Rivian is the latest success in Georgia’s push to recruit the entire electric mobility ecosystem to the state. In August Governor Kemp announced the launch of the Electric Mobility and Innovation Alliance a statewide initiative between government industries electric utilities nonprofits and other relevant stakeholders focused on growing the electric mobility ecosystem in the state and strengthening Georgia’s position in electrification-related manufacturing and innovation. In addition to bringing new investments to the state Georgia is committed to ensuring the state’s existing industry and accompanying 55000 automotive manufacturing jobs receive the support for retraining and expansions needed to transition to meet the new demands of electrified transportation.

“We’re happy to partner with Georgia on our next manufacturing site which will allow us to meet demand for Rivian products and to scale our business rapidly” said Rivian Chief People Officer Helen Russell. “Our work together is rooted in collaboration transparency fairness and a strong sense of belonging. We’re excited for Georgians to bring their creativity and ideas to Rivian. We’re confident that alongside Illinois Georgia is the place for Rivian to scale and thrive.”

Rivian has developed and vertically integrated a connected electric platform that can be flexibly applied to a range of applications including the company’s adventure products as well as B2B products such as its last-mile delivery vans launched in partnership with Amazon. Rivian’s launch products the R1T and R1S provide an unmatched combination of performance off-road capability and utility. Earlier this week the Rivian R1T all-electric truck earned the coveted 2022 truck of the year from MotorTrend calling it “the most remarkable pickup truck we’ve ever driven!”.

“On behalf of the Joint Development Authority of Stanton Springs we are overjoyed with Rivian’s decision to call Stanton Springs home and we welcome them to the country’s premier joint economic development partnership” said Joint Development Authority of Stanton Springs Chairman Jerry Silvio. “Rivian will now join two revolutionary leaders in their respective fields to make east Atlanta a beacon of technology and employment potential. The Joint Development Authority of Stanton Springs began over 25 years ago with the goal of creating high-tech regional-focused jobs for generations to come. We are thankful for the dedication and steadfast focus from our economic development directors Shane Short and Serra P. Hall and our attorney Andrea Gray to ensure this vision is met and exceeded. Through the years the four counties and our utility partners have planned strategically to ensure minimal impact on the local environment. With Rivian’s announcement today the continued collaboration between the State of Georgia the JDA and now Rivian will be unprecedented.”

Rivian’s strategic location on the I-20 corridor will enable the company to access resources and speed its products to market. Offering 1200 miles of highway and 5000 miles of rail Georgia is equipped to move product quickly and efficiently. Further with investments such as the newly opened Mason Mega Rail Terminal at the Port of Savannah which is the largest on-terminal rail facility in North America Rivian will be able to efficiently tap into supply chain needs.

“We are excited to welcome Rivian to the Peach State’s manufacturing community” said Griff Lynch Executive Director for the Georgia Ports Authority. “As we expand our facilities for processing containers and finished vehicles we look forward to the opportunity of providing supply chain solutions to Rivian a world-class manufacturer of electric vehicles.”

“Georgia’s exceptional multimodal transportation network is foundational for the future of transportation and has led to our state being recognized as a national leader in EV corridor readiness which is critical for further EV development” said Russell McMurry Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Transportation. “We look forward to providing the transportation infrastructure necessary to make this project successful for a company that will transform transportation as we know it and are excited to know that Georgia will be home to such a vital partner.”

Rivian’s just under 2000-acre parcel will include abundant natural space. Open job postings in Georgia will be immediately available at www.rivian.com/careers. Inquiries about project RFIs RFPs listing and supply chain outreach can be directed to georgia@rivian.com.

“The Newton County Water & Sewerage Authority is grateful to partner with Rivian and once again the Joint Development Authority of Stanton Springs for a landmark opportunity. We view this venture as a once-in-a-lifetime moment where our most important resource water must be managed in a way that it becomes the standard that all future projects aspire to achieve” said Mike Hopkins Executive Director of the Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority. “The State of Georgia is a beacon of preservation and a steward for water protection. Our water system is uniquely designed to support our citizens businesses and natural environment in the Southeast – Rivian’s focus on environmental excellence fits perfectly within our vision here.”

Additionally Georgia’s strong and diverse talent pool is bolstered by one of the largest state university systems in the country. Eighty-five accredited public and private universities in the state award more than 132000 degrees and certificates to its graduates annually. A key driver in Georgia’s seamless system of higher education the Technical College System of Georgia consists of 22 colleges offering education and training in numerous industries that keep Georgia competitive in the global economy.

“Metro Atlanta is ideally suited for Rivian’s new operations and will allow the company to benefit from our region’s diverse and highly skilled workforce. Access to our unique community of innovative businesses and collaborative higher education institutions will also be a great asset for this significant new facility” said Metro Atlanta Chamber President and CEO Katie Kirkpatrick. “Congratulations to the team at Rivian and all of the organizations that supported this decision that will bolster the continued growth and prosperity of our region.”

To further assist the company with its workforce requirements Georgia Quick Start will build and operate a state-of-the-art manufacturing training center that will provide Rivian with a fully customized training program that meets the company’s start-up needs. This will also build capacity and curricula within the Technical College System of Georgia to maintain a long-term pipeline of highly skilled employees who are trained specifically in these operations. In addition the Georgia Department of Labor will assist the company in identifying and recruiting workers.

Director of the Georgia Department of Economic Development’s (GDEcD) Aerospace Defense and Advanced Manufacturing team Hank Evans represented GDEcD’s Global Commerce division on this competitive project in partnership with numerous partners across the state. Partners include the Joint Development Authority (JDA) of Jasper Morgan Newton and Walton Counties; the Georgia Ports Authority; the Georgia Department of Transportation; Georgia Quick Start; the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce; and Georgia Power.

“Rivian’s decision to locate in Georgia will have a tremendous impact on the entire state” said Georgia Department of Economic Development Commissioner Pat Wilson. “As I have said we will see more change in the automotive industry in the next 10 years than we have seen in the past 100 and with this announcement Georgia will be home to one of the main drivers of this transformation. For Rivian sustainability doesn’t stop with just making EVs it is carried throughout their work going so far as to carefully plan construction efforts at the site to preserve and protect the beauty and uniqueness of their new home. This is to be applauded and makes us proud to become part of their story. Rivian will be an outstanding corporate citizen and community partner and we look forward to a strong future together as the jobs and investment they create will change lives and accelerate Georgia’s sustainable and electrified future.”

Georgia is at the center of the rapidly expanding Southeast Automotive Alley and Rivian’s investment accelerates the evolution of Georgia’s automotive ecosystem. Within the last five years 78 automotive-related companies have located or expanded operations in Georgia creating thousands of new jobs. While existing companies in Georgia have expanded their portfolios to include parts for EVs companies from Korea Germany Turkey and the Netherlands have also recently announced plans to build EV-related facilities in the state.

Georgia’s prime location extensive infrastructure skilled workforce and business-friendly climate has made it an attractive location for a diverse array of rapidly developing industries focused on creating a sustainable future. Through fostering healthy industry practices and encouraging collaboration and innovation the state is leading in the development and use of emerging technologies for the evolving automotive and mobility industries.

From Georgia Power:

Georgia Power today joined with Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia Department of Economic Development to welcome Rivian – a world-class electric sport utility vehicle and pickup company – to Georgia. The company which places a focus on sustainability and positive environmental impact and was named the 2022 MotorTrend Truck of the Year selected Georgia for a nearly 13 million square foot plant for vehicle and battery operations along Interstate 20 near Social Circle.

Today’s announcement is the latest example of the success of targeted statewide economic development efforts such as the Electric Mobility Innovation Alliance (EMIA) launched in July by Governor Kemp. The goal of the EMIA is to bring together leaders from the public and private sector as well as researchers and utilities such as Georgia Power to ensure the state’s economic recruitment efforts and Georgia’s laws rules and regulations welcome the growing electric transportation and battery charging industry and workforce development opportunities.

“This is a tremendous victory for the state of Georgia and is another great example of the longstanding partnership between the state government and the business community on bringing new jobs to the state and growing our economy. It’s because of that collaboration Georgia remains a top choice for some of the world’s most innovative companies” said Chris Womack president chairman and CEO of Georgia Power. “On behalf of Georgia Power we welcome Rivian to Georgia today. This announcement is especially exciting against the backdrop of the investments we have made as a state in electric vehicles and transportation including a network of nearly 1000 public charging stations from multiple partners now available across Georgia. We’re excited to see the impact Rivian and their expertise will have in our state.”

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in Georgia and throughout the Southeast region continue to shift their product lines to keep up with the increasing production of electric vehicles. Georgia Power in partnership with the State of Georgia currently supports the EV needs of several OEMs including Kia Mercedes-Benz BMW and Volkswagen. Several other EV industry leaders in addition to Rivian have already made the move to locate or expand to Georgia in recent years including battery producer SK Innovation and EnChem; as well as modules and storage systems producer Duckyang; charging station leader Heliox; and all-electric bus manufacturer Blue Bird to meet the growing ecosystem needs for residential and business customers across the country.

Georgia’s evolving automotive industry

To date Georgia is home to more than 200 automotive-related facilities that contribute more than $3 billion annually to the state’s economy. In 2021 Georgia boasted 977000 workers to support these operations and facilities. Additionally the state’s growing EV and battery production industry created 5700 new jobs and $3 billion in new capital investment before Rivian’s announcement. The state currently ranks sixth in the nation for EV charging infrastructure and is currently the top state in the Southeast for EV customer adoption.

Georgia Power continues to support the State of Georgia in proactive efforts to attract multibillion-dollar companies involved in the production recycling and development of the auto manufacturing industry and EV supply chain.

Georgia Power also recently partnered with the University of Georgia’s College of Engineering to create an e-Mobility Certificate program. With elements of engineering public policy public health and business acumen this new program will prepare Georgia’s workforce for an electrified transportation future. The company is also working closely with design students at Georgia Tech to evaluate the environmental benefits and future workforce opportunities of transportation electrification.

Having recently broken ground to implement the innovative renewable thermal energy system at one of its facilities in California Saputo will leverage the Hylux technology to reduce the CO 2 intensity of its operations.

This partnership highlights Saputo’s commitment to pursuing sustainable business practices as it seeks to safeguard the environment while continuing to grow as a world-class dairy processor. In February 2020 Saputo Inc. pledged to make significant progress on its climate water and waste performance by 2025 with targets including the reduction of the CO 2 intensity of its operations by 20%. Renewable energy initiatives like Hylux are part of this strategy.

“This partnership enables the demonstration and future expansion of an innovation that addresses a significant gap in the renewable energy market—economically viable renewable thermal energy for onsite application says John D. H. King co-founder and CEO of Hyperlight Energy. “We are looking forward to embarking on this journey with the support of the Saputo Dairy USA team.”

According to Saputo Dairy USA Director of Corporate Responsibility Kalee Sanino “We are committed to doing our part to help transition to a net-zero food system by 2050. We see this collaboration with Hyperlight Energy as a way to leverage our strengths for the greater good and contribute to solving sustainability challenges present in today’s food system.”

Saputo believes the Hylux technology has potential to make the economics of solar thermal energy more accessible. Through the success of this project both SDUSA and Hyperlight Energy hope to raise awareness and broader application of the technology across industries creating a ripple effect of reduced GHG emissions.

Chthonic which incorporated in Alberta in 2018 launched Entropy in 2019 as a video livestreaming service allowing creators to collect payments from their viewers.

They have actively promoted the site as a “free speech” alternative to mainstream social media services – repeating the pitch used by other extremist-friendly “alt-tech” platforms including Bitchute Gab and Parler.

Like those sites Chthonic’s promise of limited moderation has attracted prominent extremists some of whom were deplatformed from mainstream sites in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. or earlier.

In a December podcast Greg Johnson who runs the white nationalist website and publisher Counter-Currents said “Entropystream is the only way we can take credit card payments.”

Johnson added “We have been deplatformed from the global credit card processing industry by angry merchants unhappy merchants who don’t like our message” using coded antisemitic terms familiar to observers of white nationalist groups.

There are some indications that Chthonic has been specifically courting this niche of deplatformed extremists.

A tweet from their official “@EntropyDevs” Twitter account on July 10 2020 promoted a livestream with white nationalist comedian Owen Benjamin with the promise of a “censorship free interaction.”

A separate tweet on March 12 2020 reminded followers that they could send paid “offline super chats” to French-Canadian white nationalist Jean-Francois Gariepy in advance of his stream later that evening.

And on Jan. 28 2020 a tweet featuring a screenshot of white nationalist Nick Fuentes streaming in the Entropy app was captioned “While corporate media is closing down comment sections and streaming platforms step up their censorship efforts @NickJFuentes has still found a way to offer you censorship free interaction. Join him LIVE NOW in Entropy.”



Nick Fuentes appeared in this January 2020 tweet from Entropy.

Fuentes’s Twitter account has since been banned and while he was for a time using Entropy to collect payments from devotees to his white nationalist “America First” media brand as of late last month he could no longer be found on the site.

On Nov. 29 Fuentes told the viewers of his nightly stream that he could no longer use Chthonic’s flagship platform to collect payments.

“Entropy is not going to work anymore … because I was banned” Fuentes said explaining that “their payment processor forced them to ban me by name.”

Fuentes continued “Their payment processor called them up at Entropy and said ‘If you don’t ban Nick Fuentes we’re going to deplatform your whole site.’”

But in the same stream Fuentes said a solution had been found.

“We have a new superchat system” Fuentes said referring to a convention in streaming services whereby users make donations and streamers in return prioritize reading and interacting with those users’ questions and comments.

“Superchats are back” Fuentes added without elaborating on how this had been accomplished. “The link is in the description of this stream.”

Days before Chthonic’s co-founder director and CEO Emmanuel Constantinidis had offered an explanation to Entropy users.

After he was asked on Entropy's Discord chat server whether Fuentes had been banned from the service Constantinidis wrote “Yes but we built him a replacement.""

Constantinidis continued “It’s a complicated story but sufficed to say we won't leave anyone out to dry.”

On the Nov. 29 broadcast Fuentes went on to announce that future superchat-style payments would be handled by a new site Streampayments.

The URL for that new site was registered on Nov. 17 according to DNS records.

Users who register for the Streampayments site receive an email with the subject line “Streampay Account Verification” from “rachel@entropystream.live” an email address linked to the URL of the original site from which Fuentes was removed apparently belonging to co-founder Rachel Constantinidis who is also Emmanuel’s wife.

Hatewatch reviewed source code for the Streampayments site and confirmed that it contained payment processing routines for both Entropy and Streampayments.

From source code and a payment receipt obtained by Hatewatch it is evident that Stripe is currently the main payment processor for Entropy users.

In a discussion on Chthonic’s discord server Rachel Constantinidis stated that Google Pay’s tools were used to encrypt customer credit card information.

Far-right streamers can earn tens of thousands of dollars per month from audience donations as Hatewatch has previously reported .

And according to their own publicity materials Chthonic pockets 15% of the money streamers bring in on Entropy.

The company has also sought other revenue streams however. In a fundraising plea posted to subscription fundraising site Subscribestar Entropy asked for $2937 to “cover our basic costs so that we can continue building a censorship free internet and producing useful and interesting content as we bring you along on our journey.”

By October this effort had netted the company only three patrons two at the $5 per month level and one pledging $10 per month. By December Entropy’s Subscribestar page had been deleted.

DNS records for both Entropy and Streampayments reveal that both of their sites are reliant on the infrastructure Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform provides.

Azure supplies hosting software platform and infrastructure services to website creators and administrators via the technology giant’s global network of data centers.

Notably Azure’s ready-made tools make it easier for inexperienced developers to create websites with sophisticated features such as livestreaming that require high storage and bandwidth.

Emily Laidlaw is Canada research chair in cybersecurity law at the University of Calgary where her research focuses on online abuse free speech and law reform.

In a telephone conversation she said that while Canada is “in the middle of law reforms” around online hate speech currently “there is no intermediary liability” when it comes to hate speech.

“If the platform is acting as as an intermediary there is no specific law to address its liability for hate speech” Laidlaw continued.

“The question is whether a court would view the platform here as communicating hate speech – essentially not in the capacity of an intermediary – and thus can bring charges under the criminal code.”

Her colleague at Calgary associate professor Michael Nesbitt is an expert on the intersection between law national security and terrorism.

In a separate telephone conversation Nesbitt pointed to the Canadian government’s recent proscription of several far-right actors as “terrorist entities” including The Base  Atomwaffen Division  the Proud Boys and James Mason.

He said that these proscriptions explicitly criminalized offering support – including monetary support – to such groups but that the underlying law did not require an entity to be listed for prosecutions over support for terrorist acts.

He added that while “we haven’t seen a case where a website host has been held responsible” for providing support to such entities or acts the obligations the laws put on financial institutions meant that they may cut off anyone proximate to extremism from an abundance of caution.

Hatewatch contacted Microsoft stripe and Chthonic founder and CEO Emmanuel Constantinidis with detailed requests for comment on their relationships. None immediately responded.

Fuentes is not the only extremist who utilizes the platforms Chthonic has built on top of Microsoft’s foundations.

Prominent white nationalists streaming and collecting payments on the site include:

Failed comedian and would-be compound builder Owen Benjamin.

Longtime white nationalist propagandist Greg Johnson who has a page under his Counter-Currents brand.

Patrick Casey leader of the white nationalist American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa).

Robert Ray aka “Azzmador” a neo-Nazi fugitive wanted for his role in the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville Virginia in 2017.

British neo-Nazi and conspiracy theorist Mark Collett.

Matt Parrott co-founder of the now-defunct Traditionalist Worker Party .

White nationalist talk show Red Ice TV.

In addition to these Hatewatch’s analysis revealed at least 30 more monetized extremist accounts on Entropy.

According to a long post from Emmanuel Constantinidis on Entropy’s Discord server on May 13 Chthonic appears to be deliberately attempting to create a platform that will accommodate white supremacist ideologues.

He also criticized rival alt-tech services such as Odysee and DLive for implementing bans on hate speech saying that it would lead to the “censorship of legitimate dissident opinions.”

In the post he told users “We have been working at decoupling Entropy from services we view as at risk from politically motivated targetting” adding that “this means fortifying our payments systems servers and mail system from attempts at deplatforming.”

According to documents obtained from Alberta’s provincial government Chthonic was incorporated on Jan. 25 2018 by Emmanuel and Rachel Constantinidis who at that time both resided in Calgary.

At some point between that date and Hatewatch’s records search on Dec. 1 David Bell also listed as a Calgary resident was added as a director with each of the three shown as owning 33.333% of voting shares in the company.

While they are still listed as Alberta residents YouTube videos reviewed by Hatewatch indicate that the trio along with Bell’s wife have moved to Antalya Turkey.

Just as black and white film made way for Technicolor and resolution reached high definition so too will the current annual accounting of energy consumption make way for the better optics on hourly accounting or what is known as 24/7 hourly matching. Consumers need to know if their electricity is renewable or not and unfortunately green electrons are not physically Technicolor green.

Not keeping it 100%

In 2017 Google became the first major company to match its annual electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy. Now the claim of “100% renewables” is not what a layman might expect as it doesn’t mean that 100% of Google’s consumption came from renewables but rather that Google purchased enough renewable energy to match its annual consumption in the form of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) via power purchase agreements (PPAs). Of course Google’s facilities were still connected to mixed-energy grids and utilized power produced by fossil fuels.

This is one of the problems with current EACs: A company can claim energy generated during the day at a solar farm in the middle of the night a year later effectively meaning green energy operates as brown storage. This can be seen as a form of “greenwashing” and means corporate PPAs do less to decarbonize the grid than assumed. Unfortunately many companies don’t even realize they’re “greenwashing.” As Dan Goldman co-founder and managing director of U.S. green investment fund Clean Energy Ventures said at TBB Berlin 2021 “there are companies out there that have no idea how to know their emissions.”

To Google’s credit the tech-giant realized that “100% renewable” should be synonymous with “0% non-renewable” and the latter remains an impossibility when grid-connected. When Google looked more closely at its consumption it realized that it had to go much further to reach 24/7. After all since renewables like solar and wind are variable (and Google’s data centers are not) hour to hour the company was still relying heavily on coal and gas from the grid. It is now spearheading the concept of 24/7 and has set itself the goal of operating on carbon-free energy (CFE) 24/7 by 2030.

That gap between renewables procurement and actual renewables impact on the grid “is taken by 24/7” said Olivier Corradi the creator of electricityMap and the CEO of Tomorrow. He argues that 24/7 means that you “can’t report zero if space and time are not matched. And that is a big step because right now we’re saying that zero is misrepresentative because we don’t have enough granularity.”

Why go 24/7?

Obviously 24/7 refers to a temporal shift from annual to hourly energy accounting but 24/7 calls for spatial accounting too. This two-pronged focus is key to 24/7’s ability to drive grid decarbonization. Not only should renewable electricity be consumed in the same hour it was procured (unless it comes from storage) but it should also be procured via the same network.

“As the percentage (of renewables) increases it will continue to become more and more important that we’re aware of where and when renewable power is placed onto the grid in order to maximize impact” Chris Pennington the director of energy and sustainability for U.S. data management company Iron Mountain told pv magazine.

And 24/7 is gaining traction. As Hannah Hunt impact director for Re-Source Platform put it “both clean energy buyers and sellers are showing increased interest in exploring 24/7. RE-Source and Eurelectric have a joint 24/7 Task Force that includes more than 60 large energy buyers (including Google IKEA Microsoft Telefonica) sellers grid operators and technology providers. Even for companies that are not actively pursuing 24/7 we’re seeing interest to discuss the potential benefits and solutions.”

Similarly Google’s data center energy strategic negotiator Amanda Peterson Corio told pv magazine that the challenge of climate change means “we are already seeing growing momentum behind 24/7.” As examples Corio pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden’s “commitment 24/7 CFE for federal buildings in its infrastructure plan” and the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All ‘24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact’.

Of course the temporal-spatial aspect of 24/7 should drive the uptake of energy storage and improved grid infrastructure (particularly interconnectors) as well. It is a method of accounting that incentivizes the right behaviors. And 24/7 “will ultimately reinforce the value and impact of solar+storage solutions” said Pennington.

Timestamping output

Timestamping of electricity production is mounting as an important enabler of 24/7 renewables. That is at least according to the EnergyTag Initiative pushing to put hourly temporal information on EACs so that 24/7 is possible through Granular Certificates (GCs).

According to EnergyTag’s founder Toby Ferenczi timestamping is a way to verify hourly procurement of CFE reliably. “With GCs CFE is priced according to its real-world availability cheaply when it is in over supply and more expensive when it isn’t” he said.

The emergence of inspectable ledger technologies like blockchain among others means that granular traceability is within reach. EnergyTag is looking to provide a framework to which software companies can adhere with guidelines being designed to “protect against double counting double issuance and other issues important for making granular certificates a robust instrument” said Ferenczi.

However Corradi pointed out that there are other systems to make traceability trustworthy. One example is “flow-tracing” which tells you where electricity comes from by country of origin and could be applied to EACs to calculate how many GCs can be bought and sold between countries. Another option is to “publish everything as open data.” The necessary factor is that everybody calculates their data using the same methodology.

“Trust for me comes down to being able to be transparent about what you’re doing” said Corradi. “Which emissions factors are you actually using? How are you treating the imports and the exports on the grids? Are you able to have certificates go from one grid to the other? What are the rules that enable these things? How is storage considered?” These are the questions currently being discussed in the EnergyTag Initiative and Corradi said the decisions need to be transparent and “not hidden in some complex 200-page white paper.”

Google’s Corio believes the “24/7 carbon-free approach reflects an unparalleled level of transparency. It enables us to show hour-by-hour where we need to develop new clean energy projects advocate for policy changes and in some cases look to new technologies that can help fill in the gaps.” Looking to set a strong example in June Google released the 2020 CFE percentages of all its data centers and its overall progress toward the 2030 target.

Ultimately Corradi explained there are two ways of looking at traceability. The first is to say that it is impossible to know where an electron comes from and therefore if you buy X amount of renewables then you can claim to have used it (known as the purchasing power paradigm). The second to borrow a “smoothie” analogy offered by Corradi is that you can’t selectively choose different energy from your neighbor on the same grid in the same way you can’t selectively choose a particular fruit once it has been made into a smoothie. However said Corradi “you can pursue procurement that impactfully removes the fruits from the smoothie that you don’t want i.e. fossil fuels.” The more granular accounting becomes the more pre-emptively selective we can be and the more renewable the smoothie becomes.

The initiative’s discussions are not caught on anything “too divisive” said Ferenczi but are rather busily occupied with hammering out the extensive amount of detail required to cover the bases of such a complex system. Details such as: “how to ensure that the EnergyTag guidelines work with existing traditional certificate schemes? How to manage units less than 1 MWh? How to include storage? How to manage data quality issues?”

Popular content

“We need to make it very simple and easy for all types of energy consumers even those without large energy procurement teams or the ability to sign long-term purchasing agreements” said Ferenczi. “This is value that GCs can bring.” The value that any buyer whether they’re a small- or medium-sized business or Google can be sure where their energy is coming from.

Watch this space

Unfortunately not every member of the EnergyTag Initiative is as keen on spatial accounting as they are on the temporal. But time alone is not enough. Corio said the spatial element is “massively” important to Google’s 24/7 progress. “It is only by analyzing our hourly footprint at this regional level that we can begin to pinpoint the exact challenges of each grid where we operate to becoming truly carbon-free.”

Fundamentally what the 24/7 approach demands continues Corio is that we “think about the grid on which we operate. We cannot take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach if we want to move the needle towards reaching ‘absolute zero’ emissions.” And this needle needs a push because there are regions in the world “where we have so far been unable to purchase renewable energy because of market barriers and regulatory constraints” and “regions that do not have efficient wind and solar resources deployable at scale.”

Full-time skeptics

Not everyone is pro 24/7. One suggestion is that 24/7 will drive up the cost of renewables and EACs. In theory as Corradi points out if you “restrict the liquidity of the certificate then the price can increase.” But the point is whether 24/7 incentivizes the right behaviors. If renewables and EACs become scarce due to restrictions of time and space the price may rise but it should also incentivize energy storage interconnectors and other solutions to renewable intermittency.

In addition 24/7 should incentivize good policy. A company like Google isn’t likely to invest in a country if the grid isn’t up to scratch or the local renewables are not amenable to 24/7 procurement. As Corradi put it in the end a grid is just a big shared asset that takes time to decarbonize and “physically representative targets” send a “strong signal to policymakers [by saying] ‘I will make my decision on where to place my assets based on how clean of a grid you can provide in the future.’ And I think that is what is really interesting about 24/7.”

Another criticism touted by some corporates particularly those with high levels of emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors is that 24/7 is too much to ask. They complain annual targets are already difficult and that “big tech” is simply “moving the goalposts.”

Of course the goalposts haven’t moved; we just didn’t realize how far away they were. Annual 100% renewable matching is not the goal but decarbonization is in the same way that reaching the cloud line of a mountain isn’t the same as reaching the summit. As Google’s Corio put it “100% renewable energy matching is an important step on the path to full decarbonization but in order to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change we must target the ultimate goal of moving to fully carbon-free grids.”

Time to act

There are many ways actors can move to 24/7 CFE. Companies can improve their hourly carbon footprints by load-shifting the most carbon-intensive activities at times when renewables are most available.

On the policy front Corio calls for “wholesale market expansion and reform. We need more transmission to unlock congestion and deliver CFE to the regions where people live.” Another is to reduce restrictions on EACs such as the 1 MWh constraint. And one key policy would be the requirement for temporal matching of green hydrogen production. “It would be a disaster if we are allowed to claim hydrogen to be green based on electricity produced on a different grid at the right time” said Corradi.

There should also be policy discussion about panic buying of EACs during potential early 24/7 scarcity periods where bigger companies cause others to miss out.

The move to 24/7 feels inevitable. The more granular our view of the electricity system the more renewables can join and the more impactful procurement of renewable energy can be for grid decarbonization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWdpc3Rlci1oZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RhdGVfcmVnaW9uL21lZGljYWwtY2FubmFiaXMtZGlzcGVuc2FyaWVzLWNvbWluZy1zb29uLXRvLXNvdXRoZXJuLXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEvYXJ0aWNsZV8wOTdlOTMwMi1iMGQ2LTUyODUtYTA4Ny05YjA1MTdhMmU3MmEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical cannabis dispensaries coming soon to southern West Virginia,"Beckley WV (25801)

American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said a large service outage in October began when high winds shut down three of five runways at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport the airline’s largest hub.

American he said ended up with jets and people in the wrong places and had a hard time getting workers to pick up extra shifts to handle the problem.

Although workers are doing a great job during the pandemic they are reluctant to take extra shifts due to the risk of the novel coronavirus and unruly passengers he said.

“We need people to want to pick pick up additional shifts” Parker told the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee. Parker said there are enough pilots and staff to run the airline under normal circumstances but not with surprise weather events.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said they have to make sure they don’t schedule too many flights for the available resources.

He said people who want to be pilots have to spend $150000 to get the required training which typically is not covered by federal student loans.

Kirby Parker and leaders of Southwest and Delta all said they’re taking steps to train more pilots.

Under questioning John Laughter chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines said Delta has had to end some flights due to a shortage of pilots for regional jets that serve less-populated areas. He sees recovery coming next year.

Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said federal mask requirements for airline passengers “don’t add much if anything“ because most planes have HEPA air filters and turn over the cabin air.

They spoke during a hearing on airlines getting $54 billion in aid from taxpayers to keep employees on the payroll during the pandemic. All said the money saved jobs and businesses and made it possible to recover quickly once air travel rebounded.

Sam’s Club started selling discounted gift cards for Southwest and Hawaiian Airlines gift cards this past week with the discount available on Hawaiian Airlines gift cards being even better than that offered by Costco.

The Deal

Key Terms

Southwest – limit 3 per membership.

Hawaiian – limit 4 per membership.

Quick Thoughts

Costco has been offering a 10% discount on $500 Southwest gift cards for quite some time but it’s great to see the same offer available at Sam’s Club seeing as there’ll be a lot of people with a Sam’s Club membership who don’t have a Costco membership.

Costco also started offering a 10% discount on Hawaiian Airlines gift cards recently but Sam’s Club’s offer is even better seeing as it’s a 12% discount reducing the $500 face value cards to $440.

There are a couple of potential added benefits of the Sam’s Club offers compared to Costco. Gift card purchases from Sam’s Club sometimes track through shopping portals so you might be able to earn some additional cashback that way.

A second potential benefit is if you have a Cash App debit card. There’s a (possibly targeted) Boost for Sam’s Club which gives a 5% instant discount on SamsClub.com purchases. That can be used every rolling 24 hours and has a limit of $20 off which means the offer is good on up to $400 of spend.

That means a $500 Southwest gift card with the Cash App Boost applied will only cost $429.99 (a 14% discount) while a $500 Hawaiian Airlines gift card would cost $420 (a 16% discount).

Note that by solely redeeming gift cards for a flight booking you’d be forgoing travel protections so that’s something to weigh up when deciding whether to buy these.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbXlub3J0aHdlc3QuY29tLzMyODcxNTMvaG93LWNvdmlkLTE5LXVwZW5kZWQtYmxpbmtlbnMtZGlwbG9tYXRpYy1taXNzaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How COVID-19 upended Blinken's diplomatic mission,"HONOLULU Hawaii (AP) — U.S. Air Force Special Air Mission 50601 departed from Joint Base Andrews on the night of Dec. 9 with an ambitious journey ahead — an eight-day around-the-world trip with America’s top diplomat Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

But the diplomatic mission to Britain Indonesia Malaysia and Thailand would soon be upended by the global surge in coronavirus cases. At least three members of the traveling party tested positive for COVID-19 and forced the abrupt cancellation of the last stop and a frantic re-calculation of the remaining itinerary.

The Air Force confirmed on Saturday that at least two members of its crew on the plane had tested positive for COVID. That followed the State Department’s announcement that a journalist among the traveling press corps had tested positive which alarmed the rest of the party and resulted in the trip being cut short.

“Two U.S. Air Force aircrew members supporting the Secretary of State’s international travel tested positive for COVID-19” Ann Stefanek the chief of media operations for the Air Force said in a statement. “Both aircrew members were fully vaccinated. Neither had come into close contact with the Secretary of State or senior staff.”

She said one is asymptomatic while the other is experiencing mild symptoms and that both are following host nation COVID protocols which generally mandate a 10-day quarantine.

The first crew member who was symptomatic tested positive in Jakarta after arriving in the Indonesian capital from Liverpool England where Blinken participated in a Group of Seven foreign ministers’ meeting.

It was not immediately clear where the second crew member tested positive but the journalist tested positive in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday according to the State Department which has declined to comment on the Air Force cases.

The journalist’s diagnosis in Malaysia set off a panic among the traveling party because of quarantine requirements for those testing positive at the next stop in Thailand.

Presented with a series of options to avoid the possibility of others testing positive especially before the Christmas holiday Blinken opted to curtail his trip. Instead of spending Wednesday night in Thailand and having meetings there the next day Blinken made a brief stop at the airport in Bangkok to replace the infected crew members and did not leave his plane.

He then flew to Guam an American territory in the Pacific and then to Hawaii before returning to Washington early Friday morning.

The State Department says it has more than fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control guidance for COVID by requiring every member of the traveling party to take daily COVID tests over the course of the trip and asking all of those on board the plane to take follow-up tests.

The department said Saturday that all official members of the traveling party had tested negative for the virus upon their return to Washington.

At this point it's really no surprise that when you order a Frappuccino at Starbucks you're not just drinking a delicious creamy blend of espresso whipped cream and syrup — you're also drinking heaps of sugar. Rather than being unaware of the sugar that Starbucks Frappuccinos contain it's more likely that you're choosing to blissfully ignore that fact as many of us do with things that taste great but aren't great for us.

What may surprise you however is just how bad the seemingly healthy matcha at Starbucks can be. Although it's a type of green tea Healthline notes that matcha has more caffeine and antioxidants than the typical steeped drink. And since the entire tea leaf is ground into a fine powder to make it matcha retains more of the natural health benefits than regular green tea. According to Healthline drinking matcha may even help lose weight by boosting metabolism and could reduce the risk of heart disease.

Though a byproduct of its goodness is matcha's notoriously grassy taste. Ideally matcha powder is simply whisked with hot water and sipped. However due to its not-so-pleasant taste sweeteners and milk are often added. This is perhaps why the drink at Starbucks does not taste as grassy as it normally would. In fact Starbucks baristas on a new Reddit thread admit that the key to get around this is lots and lots of sugar — among some other thoughts about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd4eGluZXdzLm9yZy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMTItMTgvbGFib3ItYm9hcmQtY2VydGlmaWVzLWZpcnN0LXVuaW9uLWF0LWEtdXMtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXN0b3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Labor board certifies first union at a US Starbucks store,"BUFFALO N.Y. (AP) The National Labor Relations Board confirmed a vote Friday to form a union at a Starbucks store in Buffalo meaning the coffee retailer for the first time will have to bargain with organized labor at a company-owned U.S. store.

""We don't want to fight Starbucks — we're asking them to turn over a new leaf"" said Jaz Brisack an organizer at the store one of three New York Starbucks locations that petitioned the labor board for a union election in October.

Voting wrapped up last week and the board certified the results of the Buffalo employees' 19-8 vote Friday.

Workers United the union representing the employees filed formal objections in the other two elections late Thursday delaying certification. The objections claim Starbucks waged a ""shock and awe"" campaign meant to dissuade workers from voting to unionize.

The 50-year-old company has actively fought unionization for decades saying its more than 8000 company-owned U.S. stores function best when it works directly with employees.

Workers at a store in the Buffalo suburb of Hamburg voted 12-8 against a union. The outcome of a Cheektowaga store's vote could not be determined because both sides challenged seven separate votes. Union organizers said six of the votes were cast by ineligible employees.

If the outcome of the ballot challenges favors unionization organizers will drop the objection to the Cheektowaga results attorney Ian Hayes said.

The objections say Starbucks employees ""were subjected to a massive campaign of overwhelming psychological force from the moment they publicly expressed the desire to form a union.""

Dozens of managers were sent in to speak against the efforts in individual and group meetings with employees according to the filings. Workers were told they could lose benefits under a union and pro-union employees were spied on and saw their schedules changed and hours reduced.

The actions disrupted the ""laboratory conditions"" considered necessary for a fair election the union said.

""These claims are grossly inaccurate. We did not and do not engage in intimidation tactics"" Starbucks responded in a statement. ""We are partners and we show up for one another. That's what we do and what we continue to do.""

If the NLRB determines that the claims could be grounds for setting aside an election it would order a hearing to determine whether a new election should be held.

Workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by Workers United an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.

After the Buffalo vote Starbucks workers at two locations in Boston petitioned the NLRB for union elections. Three other Buffalo-area stores and a store in Mesa Arizona also have filed petitions with the labor board for their own union elections. Those cases are pending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWVzcHJlc3NvLW1hcnRpbmktcmVjaXBlLXRpa3Rva9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks' Espresso Martini Recipe On TikTok Is So Simple,"The holidays are always filled with plenty of sweets paired with coffee and you can count on Starbucks to be ahead of the game when it comes to their holiday drinks and seasonal red cups.

Starbucks Japan is known as the place to go for cute drinkware and seasonal Frappuccinos but lately the chain has been branching out with some surprises on the cake menu as well.

The chain’s latest surprise is the Matcha & Coffee Cream Pop which is only available at select locations.

We’d never seen anything this cute in the cakes section at Starbucks before so as soon as we laid eyes on this unusual cake pop we didn’t need any convincing to purchase one for 319 yen. Its small and compact size shown here next to a Pasmo transport card for scale made it the perfect accompaniment to our afternoon coffee.

Lifting the entire morsel to our taste buds we felt an intoxicating sense of decadence as if we were eating a big slice of cake with our hands. We didn’t have to worry about getting our fingers dirty though thanks to the stick firmly prodded inside of it.

Our first bite delivered a delightful crunch through the matcha chocolate casing which gave way to a light and fluffy matcha cake interior finished off with layers of coffee cream. The texture of the cake was a true standout as the matcha dough is baked with a guimauve (marshmallow) base mixed into it giving it a spongy-soft lightness.

The height of the cake gave each bite a satisfyingly full mouthfeel while the individual components blended together harmoniously to create a coffee-to-matcha ratio that was simply perfect. Despite its small size it delivered bagfuls of flavour making our afternoon coffee one to remember.

The Matcha & Coffee Cream Pop is only available for a limited time and at select locations so if you find it in the display case be sure to give it a try. And if you’re looking for more elusive Starbucks items you can always hunt down the Joyful Medley drinks which are only available at two locations in all of Japan.

It's that time of the year when Christmas treats and festive foods are plentiful.

I've decided to put my taste buds to the test and try the delights at Starbucks Greggs Costa and McDonald's to tell you which ones I loved - and which ones I would pass.

These limited edition treats are only available during the festive season - so make sure you get your hands on them before they run out.

There is a wide variety of treats to try across your favourite café chains with many incorporating staple Christmas flavours including mint minced pie filling orange chocolate toffee and many more.

With Christmas just two a week away these treats will definitely get you in the holiday spirit.

But which ones came out on top?

We've sampled dozens of sweets to tell you which ones we think you should try and which ones to skip.

Starbucks

The popular café chain offers a wide variety of festive treats to choose from.

Starbucks's menu offers six sweets and cakes as well as muffins shortbread and brownies.

This is what I thought of each one:

Cran-merry Cheesecake Muffin - 7/10

The muffin is full of flavour not too sweet and is moist - a winner in my books.

North Pole Nat Shortbread - 8/10

I was quite surprised at how delicious this shortbread was. A really nice proportion of icing vs. cookie. I'd definitely order this again.

Christmas Tree Brownie - 9/10

This is by far my favourite treat from Starbucks and in my opinion their best brownie. Think of a rich chocolate brownie that's crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Perfection.

Red Velvet Loaf Cake - 5/10

I was disappointed in this one and had high hopes considering I love red velvet. The cake was too dry with little flavour. Nice icing on it but overall wouldn't buy again.

Toffee Nut Latte Cupcake - 6/10

I'm only giving this a lower rating because it was too sweet for my liking. However the toffee icing was delicious. If you're a mega sweet tooth and don't mind the sugar rush I suggest giving it a go.

Jolly Jammie Cookie - 7/10

A traditional jam cookie. I can't fault that it goes well with a cup of coffee and was delightful.

Costa

Costa is one of Britain's best-loved café chains and this year they've taken their Christmas menu to a whole other level.

I've previously sampled their Christmas drinks and was very impressed by their commitment to their festive menu.

Costa offers a total of 18 Christmas cakes muffins and cookies galore - and I can say I'm incredibly impressed with the variety.

Here's what I thought:

Gingerbread Muffin - 6/10

I thought the muffin tasted flavoursome but the sponge was a little dry for me.

Gingerbread Latte Vegan Cookie - 8/10

I'm quite a fan of this cookie and considering it's vegan it tastes really good for the fact it's plant-based. A solid 8.

Jammy Rudolph Shortcake - 7/10

A delightful shortcake with a red nose of jam in the middle. A traditional pick-me-up biscuit for a mid-afternoon snack.

Vegan Santa Gingerbread - 8/10

I really liked this gingerbread biscuit so I bought a few more to store in my cupboard for afternoon tea - I highly recommend.

Christmas Cake - 7/10

A traditional Christmas fruit cake topped off with icing. It's rich and very moist and I would say it's a very decent fruit cake.

Chocolate Sparkle Cake - 9/10

I was very pleasantly surprised at this cake - it tastes like it came fresh from a bakery. The hazelnut icing in the middle is perfect compared with the soft chocolate sponge.

Winter Frosted Marble Cake - 6/10

I really liked the icing on this cake however I felt the sponge was a little dry for my liking.

Clementine & Cranberry Loaf Cake - 8/10

I really liked this loaf the sponge was moist and the orange and cranberry were delightfully paired together. A winner in my books.

Reindeer Cake - 3/10

I didn't like this cupcake very much the sponge was too dry and it didn't stand out to me as much as the other cakes.

Golden Billionaire's - 6/10

I did quite like this shortbread I would purchase it paired with a coffee. However it wasn't as flavoursome as I expected. The texture of the shortbread was good.

Florentine Mince Tart - 2/10

Considering I'm not a huge fan of mince pies I did not really like this. There was too much going on with the combination of caramel chocolate seeds and cherry. I would pass.

Chocolate & Salted Caramel Torte - 4/10

I expected slightly more from this torte considering how good it looked. The flavours didn't stand out and the texture was a little rubbery.

All Butter Mince Pie - 6/10

I'm not a mince pie fanatic as you can probably tell but I was impressed with this one. It's probably my favourite mince pie of all time if I had to choose one.

Mince Tart (gluten free) - 6/10

There's not much difference between this gluten-free version I was quite pleased and could hardly tell the difference between the two mince pies.

Terry's Chocolate Orange Muffin - 9/10

I'm not a fan of orange chocolate - but this muffin is a game-changer. There's orange chocolate filling in the middle and it tastes absolutely delicious.

After Eight Muffin - 8/10

A mint chocolate muffin with mint filling inside what a spectacle. It's a special treat to have this Christmas I suggest you try this one.

Crispy Chocolate Star - 8/10

This was one of my favourites. It's a chocolate and caramel rice crispy covered in white chocolate. Yummy.

Chocolate & Caramel Bun - 7/10

The chocolate filling inside paired with caramel icing on top makes this one of the top contenders when it comes to Christmas treats. I would definitely recommend giving this a go.

Greggs

Greggs offers a select number of Christmas treats and they are affordable.

They aren't as fancy as the other cafes with a focus on biscuits shortbreads and cookies - but they are still delicious as ever.

Christmas Star Biscuit - 5/10

A crunchy biscuit coated in milk chocolate. Nothing too special about this one.

Christmas Shortbread Bites - 5/10

A crumbly shortbread biscuit topped with caramel and milk chocolate. Didn't strike me as anything outstanding would have to give it a lower rating.

Christmas Tree Biscuit - 4/10

This biscuit comes in a similar texture to the others but with a ginger flavour.

Christmas Bun - 7/10

I quite liked this vanilla flavour bun dipped in fondant icing and topped with sprinkles. The sponge was moist and delicious. They also have festive sugar paste decorations on each and are lovely for children. They come in a pack of four.

McDonald's

McDonald's was by far the cheapest when it comes to Christmas treats.

However the fast-food chain only has two options on their menu - the Celebrations McFlurry and their Festive Pie.

Here's what I thought about them:

Celebrations McFlurry - 8/10

The McFlurry is loaded with chocolate bits including Maltesers clusters Galaxy chocolate drops Caramel pieces Mars Chewy pieces and Twix. I don't think it gets any better than that.

Festive Pie - 7/10

I quite liked this festive pie it has a combination of mincemeat and custard. McDonald's pies never disappoint - and this one doesn't either.

Verdict

My favourite Christmas treat of all is Starbucks' Christmas Tree Brownie.

But I think it is clear which café chain reigns the champion when it comes to festive menus.

Costa has gone the extra mile this Christmas with a large variety of options to choose from.

They also have the best festive treats in my opinion with their Terry's Chocolate Muffin and Chocolate Sparkle Cake taking the second and third top spots as my ultimate favourite Christmas treats.

The cold temperature did a lot of damage to Florida’s agriculture with 30% of the state’s $1.4 billion citrus crop lost and sugarcane strawberries vegetables and other crops destroyed.

Throughout the state because of frozen equipment and ice on powerlines thousands spent Christmas in the dark after losing power. A newspaper article from the time reports Florida Power & Light representatives urging people to unplug toys and decorations and put on sweaters over the holidays.

Although no snow was reported in St. Augustine some areas of northern Florida saw up to 3 inches and 1 inch was reported as far south as Sarasota.

Although St. Augustine did not get as cold as other parts of the state the weather made Christmas 1989 a time to remember for locals.

Long-time resident Bob Harper spent the holiday weekend with his family in the Panhandle.

“When we left town it had been very warm so we did not bother leaving the heat on” Harper said. “While away we saw the weather reports on the news and because we lived in a 19th-century house with probably Flagler-era plumbing we know as we might have some problems since the freeze that occurred.”

'It sounded like a waterfall in our house'

“A day or two afterward and my neighbor next door had walked around the house and heard water running so he shut the water off thank goodness” Harper said. “So when we got back we turned the water back on and it sounded like a waterfall in our house so we turned the water back off and we called the plumbers. The result was we had 13 broken pipes in our house and to repair them we had the tear out walls between the floors to get to the plumbing.

“Another thing was we had plants in the house and they look as though they had been hit by a snowstorm. They were all wilted and dead” said Harper.

Harper who is also a citrus grower with a farmer in Central Florida was hit doubly hard by the freeze.

“Our groves took a hard hit from the freeze"" he said. ""There was a golden blanket of dead oranges on the ground for miles and miles we lost acres and acres of fruit but we have since recovered from that. We learned a lesson about wintertime in Florida even though I'm a fourth-generation Floridian and I should know better now whenever we hear temperatures are dropping we run the water or cut it off and drain the pipes.”

Although agriculture was hit hard in a lot of the state St. Johns County fared better than most because the county’s two main crops at the time potatoes and cabbage weren't in season.

“We were lucky that it got cold when it did” said former County Commissioner Jeb Smith whose family has been farming in the Hastings area for generations. “We were fortunate but we felt for the others who got hurt. Florida farmers are a community that sticks together.”

First responders kept busy for days

The weekend was very busy for local police and firefighters.

“I remember what it was like very clearly because that was actually one of the first big things that I worked” said retired St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Kevin Kelshaw. “I had just started a month before and it kind of landed in my lap. I didn't even have a department vehicle. I remember driving my Buick station wagon trying to get to the office and sliding across U.S. 1 onto Lewis Speedway. Once I got to the sheriff’s office I stayed there all night.”

A newspaper report from the time said first responders were busy for days helping with car accidents and medical calls.

“You know at the time we didn’t prepare for something like that in Florida.” Kelshaw said. “My wife Kathy was working for the sheriff doing purchasing and she was going all over and looking for gloves ski masks or anything to keep the guys and girls on duty warm. Nobody had cold-weather gear.”

Retired St. Augustine Record reporter and editor Margo Pope remembers the freeze well.

“It was a really strange couple of days"" she said. ""Cars wouldn’t start power was out places bridges were closed because of ice. I had to get to work so my husband Alyn drove me to the foot of the Bridge of Lions and I walked across and took the photo of the police car blocking traffic that ran on the front page.

“I was feeling really good walking along talking to people and then I slid and hit the ground there on the sidewalk in front of the cathedral” Pope said. “I was on my way to work and it was broad daylight but I never saw the ice so I wasn't really prepared for it. I fell by the front doors of my own church.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGxwci5vcmcvaGVhbHRoLXNjaWVuY2UtZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAyMS0xMi0xOC9vbGQtcmFpbC1wYXRoLWNvdWxkLWJyaW5nLW1pbGxpb25zLWluLXJldmVudWUtdG8tbWlzc291cmktdG93bnMtYXMtdHJhaWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missouri State Parks to turn rail path into 144-mile trail,"An old rail path that runs 144 miles from Windsor to Beaufort Missouri is now set to become a recreational trail and is projected to bring millions of dollars in revenue to Missouri towns.

Advocates of the trail pushed for years for the out-of-service Rock Island Corridor a section of the former Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad to be converted into a recreational trail.

The Missouri Department of Natural Resources announced earlier this week it would accept ownership of the rail line. Missouri State Parks will manage and develop the trail.

Missouri Central Railroad a subsidiary of Ameren donated the property to the state.

“We are inspired by the trail’s potential to provide Missourians and visitors with a new way to enjoy our beautiful state bringing tourism dollars and economic development to communities along the corridor” said Mark Birk a spokesperson for Ameren in a statement.

Concerned about the decline of the nation’s rail structure in the 1980s Congress established a process known as “railbanking” which allows trail agencies to adopt out-of-service rail corridors through an agreement with the rail company.

The Missouri DNR and Missouri Central Railroad signed the Interim Trail Use Agreement in December 2019. The transfer needed to be finalized by Dec. 31 of this year.

Missouri State Parks estimates that fully developing the Rock Island Trail in sections over several years and preparing it for use by walkers runners and bikers will cost $100 million.

When the trail is ready visitors will be able to stop every few miles to visit restaurants wineries and stores in towns along the cross-state trail said Greg Harris executive director of Missouri Rock Island Trail.

“There are huge benefits for communities with recreational trails because when people come to communities they're hungry they're thirsty they may want to spend the night” Harris said.

Researchers found in 2012 that the 240-mile Katy Trail which runs across most of the state of Missouri has a direct economic impact of $18 million per year and attracts 400000 visitors annually.

“Much like the Katy Trail we expect the Rock Island Trail to help grow local economies and small businesses create jobs and provide Missouri with another great outdoor recreational resource” Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement. “Missouri’s tourism industry is strong and projects like this one only help it grow stronger. We are proud to support the development of the Rock Island Trail.”

Harris predicts that the new trail will produce a return on investment even larger than the annual return of the Katy Trail because it will pass through more towns with restaurants and amenities.

The completed Rock Island Trail State Park will stretch from Union to Pleasant Hill near Kansas City. At 204 miles it will be the fourth-longest rail-trail in the nation and form a loop with the Katy Trail.

Missouri State Parks will begin holding open houses next year to get feedback from community members about what features they would like the trail to have.

Special to the Dispatch

In the summer of 1969 Columbus Dispatch columnist Johnny Jones published a list of Downtown restaurants compiled by Helen Goodfleisch of New Albany. At the time she was secretary to Ohio Attorney General Paul Brown.

Her list contained what she believed to be every dining spot within a two-block radius of the Statehouse and she had tried all of them.

Born in Germany in 1849 Dr. Justus Ohage had emigrated to the United States in 1863 moved to St. Paul in 1881 become the first American surgeon to successfully remove a gallbladder in 1886 mandated smallpox vaccines as St. Paul's health commissioner in the early 1900s and donated Harriet Island to the city as a park to boost public health.

Ohage had just turned 81 when the doctors toasted him at the convention. ""The physicians and surgeons rose to their feet and applauded as the aged doctor made a bow"" the Minneapolis Tribune reported — a graceful gesture from a surgeon known for his gifted hands and scrappy demeanor.

Trained in Germany and Scotland Ohage first hung his doctor's shingle in St. Paul in the 1880s and moved into a new brick Queen Anne in Irvine Park with a turret tower on one corner. He would take out a mortgage on the house to help purchase Harriet Island where the public baths — a term for swimming beaches — were aimed at improving public hygiene in an era before running water was common.

Truly a man before his time Ohage removed 135 gallstones as well as the gall sac from a woman during his pioneering operation at St. Joseph's Hospital. When lumberjacks from unsanitary camps aimed to visit St. Paul in 1902 he required them to show proof of smallpox vaccination.

And Ohage regularly dragged polluting railroad honchos and building owners to court for violating city smoke emission ordinances in hopes of clearing the city's sooty skies of coal smoke.

""Dr. Ohage is rated as one of the greatest authorities on public health and sanitation in this country and one of the best public health officials in any city"" the Tribune reported in 1915. Time and again ""he clashed with the old St. Paul [City] Council on matters of public health and there is no record of his failure to get what he demanded."" The newspaper said Ohage ""knew when to be diplomatic and when to use the mailed fist.""

University of Minnesota Prof. Larry Jacobs learned about Ohage after recently moving into the doctor's Irvine Park house and going through a file on him that past owners had amassed. Jacobs called Ohage ""a true mensch"" Yiddish for a person with high integrity.

""Lines to his free health clinic reportedly stretched out the door"" Jacobs said. ""When the city offered to rename Harriet Island after him he repulsed the effort as an insult to propriety and his moral standing.""

Ohage instead suggested naming the island after Harriet Bishop St. Paul's first school teacher. Years later the city renamed the road leading to Harriet Island and the park's Great Lawn after Ohage.

Ohage married Missouri-born Augusta Ensor who was pregnant with their seventh child when they moved to Irvine Park. She died three months later from childbirth complications in 1889 at 34 and he never remarried hiring domestic helpers to juggle his responsibilities as a widowed father. One of the children Justus Jr. followed his father into surgical medicine and like him served as president of the Minnesota State Medical Association.

Ohage died at the family home on Dec. 26 1935 at the age of 86. His obituary recounted how he was presented with a medal at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when St. Paul was judged the world's healthiest city. ""During his career many reforms were initiated in St. Paul to protect the citizens from disease"" the Minneapolis Star said.

But the feisty doctor lives on through his old speeches and newspaper quotes. In a 1902 address to the American League for Civic Improvement convention in St. Paul Ohage pointed to railroads as among ""the worst offenders"" for the air pollution then choking the city.

""With all prosperity that these corporations boast of they will buy a low grade of fuel simply for the saving of a few dollars and do not care a farthing how much misery and discomfort they cause to the people who are unfortunate enough to be their neighbors"" he said.

He recounted how one young woman who died of tuberculosis on a hot summer night ""was denied the benefit of fresh air because the instant her windows were opened a locomotive would fill the house with sulphurous nauseating smoke.""

A 1903 story described Ohage as ""waging relentless war"" in court against building owners and railroad engineers forcing them to pay fines and install smoke-reducing equipment — efforts he claimed had cut emissions in St. Paul by 50%.

""A man has no more right to flood his neighbor's house with smoke ruining his merchandise and furniture"" Ohage fumed ""than he has to throw garbage into the windows.""

Attorney General Rob Bonta’s approval announced Friday will allow Kaiser and Providence to form a new company St. Mary Medical Center LLC as they partner to construct a new hospital in Victorville

The approval also may include a possible trauma center at the new Providence/Kaiser hospital in Victorville and continued emergency medical services in Apple Valley after St. Mary is shuttered.

The partnership will increase St. Mary’s bed capacity from 213 to 260 at the hospital which will be built on Amargosa Road south of Bear Valley Road.

St. Mary spokesman Matt Cabe on Saturday told the Daily Press ""We received the Attorney General's conditions on a partnership between Providence and Kaiser Permanente to build a hospital in the High Desert. We are jointly reviewing and hope to better understand the requirements in the days to follow.""

New hospital closed hospital

Providence officials in June announced the construction of a new hospital in Victorville and the closure of the 65-year-old St. Mary because it did not meet the state’s more stringent seismic requirements expected to take effect in 2030.

Providence officials also said that bringing the St. Mary building into seismic compliance would not be financially and operationally feasible.

Kaiser and Providence expect to spend up to $1 billion on their joint hospital according to an Aug. 5 report from Kaiser Health News. Prior cost estimates for the new hospital came in at $750 million.

Providence and Kaiser officials originally estimated a 2026 date for the opening of the hospital that would be located west of Interstate 15. According to a filing with the state the new hospital is slated to open by 2028.

AG’s approval

Terms of AG Bonta’s approval include St. Mary owning 70% while Kaiser will own 30% and have substantial joint control of the company’s operations.

The AG announcement also shared the results of an investigation by the California Department of Justice’s Healthcare Rights and Access Section as well as expert analysis.

The investigation determined that while the increased capacity would be a benefit to the community the change in control also could have a negative impact on health care market competition and access to services in the High Desert region.

The conditions of Bonta’s approval seek to improve health care access and maintain healthy competition.

“When we review transactions between corporations and hospitals our duty is to the people of California” Bonta said. “The addition of a new hospital in the High Desert will be a benefit to the community and with the conditions we’ve imposed individuals and families who rely on public programs like Medi-Cal will have uninterrupted local access to affordable essential care.”

Under California law any transaction involving the sale or transfer of control of a nonprofit hospital must secure the approval of the attorney general.

The statutory charge of the state’s AG is to determine whether the transaction is in the public interest and whether the transaction may impact the accessibility and availability of health care services.

While evaluating the proposed transaction between Kaiser and St. Mary the AG’s office received hundreds of comments from members of the High Desert community regarding the impact the change of control could have on their ability to access health care at St. Mary.

In November the California Department of Justice conducted an online public meeting regarding the proposed control and change in the governance of St. Mary.

Most of the public comments during last month’s meeting were centered on the fear of losing hospital and emergency services and lengthy patient transport times to hospitals outside of Apple Valley.

During the meeting Fred Ortega the senior director of government relations at Prime Healthcare which oversees Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville said his foundation was willing to “save” St. Mary by contributing “at least $100 million” to upgrade and modernize the medical center seismically.

The AG’s press release said taking the public’s concerns into account the HRA conducted a thorough investigation that revealed that St. Mary’s affiliation with Kaiser could lead to a preference for beds for Kaiser’s patients which might cause Medi-Cal patients to lose access to acute care emergency maternity pediatric and cardiology services.

Additionally Kaiser’s dominance as a health insurer and St. Mary’s as a main provider of hospital services in the area could lead to anticompetitive effects in the region’s health care market.

To address these issues AG Bonta’s approval imposes multiple competitive and health impact conditions including:

Caps on price increases for current St. Mary contracts including absolute price caps for managed Medi-Cal and managed Medicare contracts to ensure their rates do not rise significantly above those of Kaiser.

A reduction in profit sharing between St. Mary and Kaiser and a reduction in the discount Kaiser receives for its reimbursement rates at St. Mary to balance competitive harms to non-Kaiser payors and incentives for St. Mary and Kaiser;

Terms that require St. Mary and Kaiser to continue to run as independent entities and prohibit sharing of non-public competitively sensitive information.

A monitor to ensure compliance with these conditions.

Health impact conditions

Continued participation in Medi-Cal and Medicare.

Prohibition on discrimination on the basis of protected personal characteristics.

Within one year Kaiser will prepare a plan to ensure full and equal access to health care for all Kaiser patients in the High Desert region.

A comprehensive study of the feasibility of opening a trauma center at the new hospital will be completed within three years.

A comprehensive plan for reusing the existing hospital site and facilities as either a freestanding emergency department a freestanding mental health facility or sale of the hospital to a new general acute care hospital operator will be completed within five years.

For the next five years $750000 will be allocated annually to the St. Joseph Health Community Partnership Fund to support low-income and underserved populations in St. Mary’s and the new Victorville hospital’s primary and secondary service areas.

HRA works proactively to increase and protect the affordability accessibility and quality of healthcare in California according to Bonta’s office.

HRA’s attorneys monitor and contribute to various areas of the AG’s health care work including nonprofit healthcare transactions consumer rights and anticompetitive consolidation in the health care market.

Also anticompetitive drug pricing privacy issues civil rights such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ healthcare-related rights; and public health work on tobacco e-cigarettes and other products.

The latest story published on The latest story published on Magenta's network-dedicated newsroom webpage arguably fits that description to the letter blending impertinence with tackiness to unconventionally (at least by the rest of the wireless industry's standards) flaunt T-Mo's subjective (and objective) 5G infrastructure supremacy.





The result is a moderately humorous and exceptionally adorable comparison between three gingerbread houses each meant to represent the size of a major US carrier's 5G network. As you may already be aware T-Mobile's next-gen cellular signal currently covers nearly twice the surface of AT&T's comparable technology and four times (!!!) Verizon's fastest mobile connectivity so naturally said gingerbread houses are designed to illustrate that huge difference as accurately as possible.









Unfortunately there are no actual 5G-themed treats you can buy before Christmas to show your support for your favorite ""Un-carrier"" which further suggests T-Mobile is slowly losing its ""edge"" trying to send customers a slightly more sober marketing message while completely ditching the ""dumb and dumber"" name-calling of its rivals from John Legere's CEO years.





As part of a series of unorthodox ads and publicity stunts dubbed ""If 5G Were..."" today's magenta blue and red-coated gingerbread houses follow in the footsteps of a pumpkin-themed comparison from just a couple of months back and a somewhat predictable trio of snowpeople exactly one year ago (among others).





The aim of course is to depict T-Mo's 5G strengths outside boring coverage maps although to get the full story of how far ahead of the competition this operator really is you'll also have to check out some of those independent reports tracking average nationwide speeds . In other words that significantly larger house also happens to have a stronger foundation solid hardwood floors and nicer furniture.





There's nothing more festive than huge corporations using Christmas as a backdrop for highlighting their various competitive advantages over equally massive companies. All irony aside everyone likes a good holiday laugh and T-Mobile's Verizon and AT&T-deriding publicity stunts are often just brazen and well tacky enough to at least mildly entertain even the most hardcore fans of the ""Un-carrier's"" arch-rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlc3lydXAuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTgvd2luZC1mb3VuZGVyLWFudGhvbnktbGFjYXZlcmEtYnV5LWZyZWVkb20tbW9iaWxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wind Mobile founder Anthony Lacavera wants to buy Freedom Mobile,"Wind Mobile founder Anthony Lacavera wants to buy it back now that the wireless carrier may be up for sale again.

Lacavera founded Wind in 2008 and sold it to Shaw Communications in 2016 for $1.6 billion. Since then Wind was renamed Freedom Mobile. Now as Rogers works to acquire Shaw for $26 billion some expect regulators will force it to sell Freedom to avoid a reduction in wireless competition as part of the deal.

A lengthy report from the Globe and Mail details Lacavera’s plan to buy Freedom should the Rogers-Shaw deal come to pass which involves leveraging a group of investors including pension funds private equity and family offices. Lacavera declined to share the names of investors with the Globe although he did admit to sticking with investors from Canada the U.S. and Britain to avoid controversy (Wind’s launch was delayed due to issues raised by the CRTC over its ownership).

“I think that would be good for the Canadian market if [Freedom] was restored to being an independent pure play wireless company” Lacavera told the Globe. Lacavera previously expressed disappointment over the proposed Rogers-Shaw deal saying that “prices most definitely are going to go up.”

Should Freedom go up for sale and Lacavera succeed in his bid to acquire the carrier he plans to make 5G accessible to all Canadians with innovative pricing. Additionally Lacavera believes Canadian wireless rates should be 20 to 30 percent lower. Dynamic pricing could be one way Lacavera will do that — he explained that networks can be dynamic now and that it can switch customers between 5G and 4G depending on their needs. As such pricing could change dynamically depending on what customers are doing on their phones.

Others are interested in buying Freedom Mobile

However Lacavera isn’t the only one interested in scooping up Freedom if it goes up for sale. Quebecor president and CEO Pierre Karl Péladeau previously expressed interest in buying Freedom as part of its plan to expand Vidéotron into Western Canada.

The Globe notes that Eastlink founder John Bragg also expressed interest in purchasing Freedom but that the company’s not holding its breath.

However none of this matters if Freedom doesn’t go up for sale — so far it’s not clear if it will. Even if selling Freedom becomes part of the Rogers-Shaw deal it’s unclear how much of the carrier will need to be sold. Rogers may be forced to part with only a certain amount of customers contracts spectrum licences physical stores and towers to appease regulators.

Plus Freedom could find itself behind others on 5G since Shaw opted out of the recent 3500MHz spectrum auction due to the Rogers acquisition. The 3500MHz spectrum will be key in rolling out actual 5G since the mid-band spectrum offers several benefits over the low-band 5G currently deployed in Canada.

The CRTC Competition Bureau and Ministry of Innovation Science and Economic Development are still reviewing the Rogers-Shaw deal.

HMD Global’s budget-friendly Nokia phones have followed a familiar blueprint for a few years now. You can pretty much expect a circular camera bump a matte plastic construction and a light Android skin. Now it’s bringing affordable 5G from T-Mobile into the mix on the Nokia X100.

What you need to know about the Nokia X100

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

Nokia X100 (6GB/128GB): $252 at T-Mobile The Nokia X100 launched as a T-Mobile exclusive that promises affordable 5G. It sits just below the Nokia G50 in terms of pricing though it packs quite a few improved specs. The X100 is also just above the G300 — the most affordable 5G option under the Nokia banner. If you’re not a T-Mobile subscriber at the moment you can also check out the Nokia X100 on select MVNOs like Metro by T-Mobile.

The X100 keeps things pretty simple with just one configuration to pick up and it packs 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. If you need more space HMD Global added a microSD card slot for good measure. Qualcomm’s 5G-ready Snapdragon 480 is keeping everything moving under the hood too. You’ll only find one color option to choose from; an eye-catching Midnight Blue that seems to transition between blue and dark gray in the light. There’s no mention of an official IP rating — not a surprise at this price — so be sure to steer clear of puddles. See also: The best budget phones

A 6.67-inch Full HD+ display tops off the entire package and it’s made from tough Gorilla Glass 3. There’s a 16MP punch hole selfie camera along with four total cameras on the back. You might recognize the circular camera bump right away and a 48MP wide lens serves as the main attraction. It’s backed by a 5MP ultrawide lens a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro option. The cameras utilize ZEISS optics which brings a whole suite of portrait mode settings to your fingertips.

Our Nokia X100 arrived running Android 11 straight out of the box which is good for now. However we asked HMD Global about future support and it confirmed that it is not planning any Android version updates and will only offer two years of security patches.

The Nokia X100’s closest rivals also fall into T-Mobile’s budget 5G sphere. Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G will set you back $282 at the Un-Carrier but it comes with a Dimensity 720 chipset and a more robust update schedule. You can check out the OnePlus Nord N200 as well which matches the X100’s Snapdragon 480 but only promises one new Android version. It’s the most affordable alternative at just $216.

What’s good?

The Nokia X100 is designed to be an affordable media streaming powerhouse and for the most part it delivers. The Full HD+ display is crisp and the 20:9 ratio was chosen specifically for video. It gets impressively bright as long as you’re not in direct sunlight and the headphone jack means you can still enjoy your wired headphones. If you prefer to skip the headphones the X100 packs a single down-firing speaker which is surprisingly loud and clear at full volume.

Overall the Nokia X100 packs some pretty impressive cameras. The 48MP main shooter is sharp and you can adjust between the default 12MP shots or take advantage of the full resolution. The 2MP macro lens is mostly there for some extra fun but you can occasionally get cool results like the Dodge hood ornament seen below. I also like the ZEISS portrait options especially the bokeh effects. Essentially you can change the background blur to include shapes like stars or hearts in addition to the basic circles.

The 48MP main camera punches above the $252 price tag especially when you add the ZEISS portrait options.

The hardware setup gives you some pretty good bang for not too many bucks with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage more than enough for most tasks. I didn’t run into too many lag issues even when bouncing between apps quickly. Nokia’s Android skin is one of the lightest we’ve seen in a while and it feels pretty close to stock with just a few creature comforts.

I had no issues making the 4470mAh battery last beyond a day of consistent usage and I occasionally got close to a second full day before charging. The 18W wired charging recovered 39% in 30 minutes and it took about 75 minutes to get back to a full charge. The side-mounted fingerprint reader is reliable and the software-based Face Unlock works well in clear bright conditions.

What’s not so good?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

I don’t love that the Nokia X100 is a T-Mobile exclusive. While you can grab it on one of the Magenta MVNOs I prefer to see budget phones come with universal functionality. However the X100 is also available as the X10 in non-US markets so that’s your best bet for a truly unlocked version.

HMD Global went all-out making the X100 a solid streaming companion but it comes up short in one key way — the bezels. It packs sizeable bezels around all four sides as you can see above and the punch hole selfie camera has a relatively large ring around it too. I almost would have preferred a small notch if it meant smaller bezels overall. The display is bright in most conditions but it struggles in bright sunlight which can make it hard to browse social media or stream your favorite shows.

Nokia's 6.67-inch display comes up short in sunny conditions.

Many budget phones embrace the plastic lifestyle — look at Samsung Motorola and OnePlus for example. HMD Global followed suit with the X100 but the plastic doesn’t always feel the best. The Gorilla Glass 3 display feels tough enough but the plastic backing lets it down. I don’t think the plastic will crack from a few drops but there’s a little give to it when I press on the back.

The Nokia X100 launched with Android 11 onboard which is a good thing. However HMD Global confirmed to us that it has no plans to upgrade it to Android 12 yet. Unless that changes you’ll be stuck with Android 11 from the moment you open the box to the moment you buy a new phone and just two years of security patches severely limits the phone’s long-term value. Even OnePlus tends to find a way to bring a single Android update to its budget-friendly Nord options while Samsung goes far beyond. This is especially odd given the fact that previous Nokia X series phones have been promised three years of updates.

Nokia X100 review: Should I buy it?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

If you’re a T-Mobile customer in search of a budget-friendly 5G device the Nokia X100 is a solid option. It packs quite a few Nokia trademarks and it’s geared to keep up with your favorite shows and social media accounts. The software update situation is a little galling considering the Nokia catchphrase of “Love it Trust it Keep it” but the overall camera experience and the large 6.67-inch display punch above its price tag. The X100 is a classic Nokia design with plenty of updated specs at just over $250. See also: The best T-Mobile phones

Those of you looking for another affordable T-Mobile option can look no further than the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G ($282). It swaps Gorilla Glass 3 for Gorilla Glass 5 with a classy design that looks more like glass than plastic. You also get a full 5000mAh battery for your money. The best budget alternative is the OnePlus Nord N200 ($216). It’s one of the cheapest 5G devices around and has the light Oxygen OS skin on top.

Nokia X100 5G from T-Mobile and its MVNOs just got more affordable thanks to the Nokia X100. It packs a Snapdragon 480 chipset and a Full HD+ 6.67-inch display that's great for media streaming. See price at T-Mobile

Launched as a promotion back in 2017 the Insider Hookup program was available for a limited time throughout the years.The program offers the account holder 20% off voice lines for as long as they keep the account including for lines added after the opening of that account. The Insider Hookup program is a promotion aimed at customers who switch to T-Mobile but they can only benefit from the offer by getting a special code from a T-Mobile employee.After the success of the initial program T-Mobile turned the Insider Hookup promotion into a full-fledged program with no time limit. However instead of giving T-Mobile employees a couple of codes per year to hand to switchers as they see fit the carrier limited the number to just one per quarter.This year however T-Mobile has decided to let even more switchers into its Insider Hookup promotion. According to T-Mo Report  the carrier is enhancing the program for this holiday by offering four codes per employee to use by January 5 2022.The Insider Hookup promotion will only be available for the following plans: Magenta Magenta MAX and Essentials. To benefit from the deal you must ask a T-Mobile rep at a local store (or maybe try T-Mobile’s subreddit ) for a special code and redeem it on the Insider Hookup website.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2hyb21lY2FzdC1nb29nbGV0di10bW9iaWxlLXR2aXNpb24taHViLWNvbXBhcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chromecast with Google TV vs T-Mobile TVision HUB,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2hyb21lY2FzdC1nb29nbGV0di10bW9iaWxlLXR2aXNpb24taHViLWNvbXBhcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The promise was a war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs. The documents show flawed intelligence faulty targeting years of civilian deaths — and scant accountability.

This is the first part of a series. Part 2 examines the air war’s human toll.

اقرأ باللغة العربية

Shortly before 3 a.m. on July 19 2016 American Special Operations forces bombed what they believed were three ISIS “staging areas” on the outskirts of Tokhar a riverside hamlet in northern Syria. They reported 85 fighters killed. In fact they hit houses far from the front line where farmers their families and other local people sought nighttime sanctuary from bombing and gunfire. More than 120 villagers were killed.

In early 2017 in Iraq an American war plane struck a dark-colored vehicle believed to be a car bomb stopped at an intersection in the Wadi Hajar neighborhood of West Mosul. Actually the car had been bearing not a bomb but a man named Majid Mahmoud Ahmed his wife and their two children who were fleeing the fighting nearby. They and three other civilians were killed.

In November 2015 after observing a man dragging an “unknown heavy object” into an ISIS “defensive fighting position” American forces struck a building in Ramadi Iraq. A military review found that the object was actually “a person of small stature” — a child — who died in the strike.

None of these deadly failures resulted in a finding of wrongdoing.

These cases are drawn from a hidden Pentagon archive of the American air war in the Middle East since 2014.

The trove of documents — the military’s own confidential assessments of more than 1300 reports of civilian casualties obtained by The New York Times — lays bare how the air war has been marked by deeply flawed intelligence rushed and often imprecise targeting and the deaths of thousands of civilians many of them children a sharp contrast to the American government’s image of war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs.

The documents show too that despite the Pentagon’s highly codified system for examining civilian casualties pledges of transparency and accountability have given way to opacity and impunity. In only a handful of cases were the assessments made public. Not a single record provided includes a finding of wrongdoing or disciplinary action. Fewer than a dozen condolence payments were made even though many survivors were left with disabilities requiring expensive medical care. Documented efforts to identify root causes or lessons learned are rare.

The air campaign represents a fundamental transformation of warfare that took shape in the final years of the Obama administration amid the deepening unpopularity of the forever wars that had claimed more than 6000 American service members. The United States traded many of its boots on the ground for an arsenal of aircraft directed by controllers sitting at computers often thousands of miles away. President Barack Obama called it “the most precise air campaign in history.”

This was the promise: America’s “extraordinary technology” would allow the military to kill the right people while taking the greatest possible care not to harm the wrong ones.

The ISIS caliphate ultimately crumbled under the weight of American bombing. For years American air power was crucial to the beleaguered Afghan government’s survival. And as U.S. combat deaths dwindled the faraway wars and their civilian tolls receded from most Americans’ sights and minds.

On occasion stunning revelations have pierced the silence. A Times investigation found that a Kabul drone strike in August which American officials said had destroyed a vehicle laden with bombs had instead killed 10 members of one Afghan family. The Times recently reported that dozens of civilians had been killed in a 2019 bombing in Syria that the military had hidden from public view. That strike was ordered by a top-secret strike cell called Talon Anvil that according to people who worked with it frequently sidestepped procedures meant to protect civilians. Talon Anvil executed a significant portion of the air war against ISIS in Syria.

The Pentagon regularly publishes bare-bones summaries of civilian casualty incidents and it recently ordered a new high-level investigation of the 2019 Syria airstrike. But in the rare cases where failings are publicly acknowledged they tend to be characterized as unfortunate unavoidable and uncommon.

In response to questions from The Times Capt. Bill Urban the spokesman for the U.S. Central Command said that “even with the best technology in the world mistakes do happen whether based on incomplete information or misinterpretation of the information available. And we try to learn from those mistakes.” He added: “We work diligently to avoid such harm. We investigate each credible instance. And we regret each loss of innocent life.”

He described minimizing the risk of harm to civilians as “a strategic necessity as well as a legal and moral imperative” driven by the way these casualties are used “to feed the ideological hatred espoused by our enemies in the post 9/11 conflicts and supercharge the recruiting of the next generation of violent extremists.”

Yet what the hidden documents show is that civilians have become the regular collateral casualties of a way of war gone badly wrong.

To understand how this happened The Times did what military officials admit they have not done: analyzed the casualty assessments in aggregate to discern patterns of failed intelligence decision-making and execution. It also visited more than 100 casualty sites and interviewed scores of surviving residents and current and former American officials. In the coming days the second part of this series will trace those journeys through the war zones of Iraq and Syria.

Taken together the reporting offers the most sweeping and also the most granular portrait of how the air war was prosecuted and investigated — and of its civilian toll.

There is no way to determine that full toll but one thing is certain: It is far higher than the Pentagon has acknowledged. According to the military’s count 1417 civilians have died in airstrikes in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria; since 2018 in Afghanistan U.S. air operations have killed at least 188 civilians. But The Times’s analysis of the documents found that many allegations of civilian casualties had been summarily discounted with scant evaluation. And the on-the-ground reporting — involving a sampling of cases dismissed cases deemed “credible” and in Afghanistan cases not included in the trove of Pentagon documents — found hundreds of deaths uncounted.

The war of precision did not promise that civilians would not die. But before a strike is approved the military must undertake elaborate protocols to estimate and avoid civilian harm; any expected civilian casualties must be proportional to the military advantage gained. And America’s precision bombs are indeed precise: They hit their targets with near-unerring accuracy.

The documents along with The Times’s ground reporting illustrate the many often disastrous ways the military’s predictions of the peril to civilians turn out to be wrong. Their lessons rarely learned these breakdowns of intelligence and surveillance occur again and again.

Repeatedly the documents point to the psychological phenomenon of “confirmation bias” — the tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms a pre-existing belief. People streaming toward a fresh bombing site were assumed to be ISIS fighters not civilian rescuers.

Men on motorcycles moving “in formation” displaying the “signature” of an imminent attack were just men on motorcycles.

Often the danger to civilians is lost in the cultural gulf separating American soldiers and the local populace. “No civilian presence” was detected when in fact families were sleeping through the days of the Ramadan fast sheltering inside against the midsummer swelter or gathering in a single house for protection when the fighting intensified.

In many cases civilians were visible in surveillance footage but their presence was either not observed by analysts or was not noted in the communications before a strike. In chat logs accompanying some assessments soldiers can sound as if they are playing video games in one case expressing glee over getting to fire in an area ostensibly “poppin” with ISIS fighters — without spotting the children in their midst.

The military spokesman Captain Urban pointed out that “In many combat situations where targeteers face credible threat streams and do not have the luxury of time the fog of war can lead to decisions that tragically result in civilian harm.”

Indeed the Pentagon records detail how in Mosul in 2016 three civilians were killed when a bomb aimed at one car instead struck three — in part because the military official approving the strike had decided to save more-precise weapons for other imminent strikes. Yet The Times’s analysis of the documents and ground reporting showed that civilians were frequently killed in airstrikes planned well in advance.

Military officials often speak of their “over the horizon” long-range surveillance capabilities. But the documents repeatedly identify deficiencies in the quality and quantity of the video footage guiding intelligence.

Sometimes only seconds’ worth of footage was taken before a strike hardly enough to assess civilians’ presence. Often video shot from the air does not show people inside buildings people under foliage people under the aluminum or tarpaulin covers known as “quamaria” that shield cars and market stalls from the sun.

In more than half of the cases deemed credible by the military one or two civilians were killed entering the target area after a weapon was fired. Officials often describe these as awful but inescapable accidents. But while many might have been averted through additional precautions — widening the surveillance camera’s field of view or deploying additional drones — the phenomenon continued unabated amid the intense pace of battle and a shortage of surveillance aircraft.

And sometimes for reasons redacted in the documents the weapons simply miss. In April 2016 the military reported that it had killed a notorious Australian ISIS recruiter Neil Prakash in a strike on a house in East Mosul. Months later very much alive he was arrested crossing from Syria into Turkey. Four civilians died in the strike according to the Pentagon.

Yet despite this unrelenting toll the military’s system for examining civilian casualties rarely functions as a tool to teach or assess blame.

Not only do the records contain no findings of wrongdoing or disciplinary action but in only one instance is there a “possible violation” of the rules of engagement. That stemmed from a breach in the procedure for identifying a target. Full investigations were recommended in fewer than 12 percent of the credible cases.

In many cases the command that approved a strike was responsible for examining it too. And those examinations were often based on incorrect or incomplete evidence. Military officials interviewed survivors or witnesses in only two cases. Civilian-casualty reports were regularly dismissed because video showed no bodies in the rubble yet the footage was often too brief to make a true determination.

In his response to The Times Captain Urban said “An honest mistake on a strike taken with the best available information and in keeping with mission requirements that results in civilian casualties is not in and of itself a cause for disciplinary actions as set forth in the law of armed conflict.”

American officials had an opportunity to mine the documents for root causes and patterns of error in 2018 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Defense University undertook a study of civilian deaths. But one of the researchers who sought to analyze the documents in aggregate told The Times that almost all of his findings had been cut from the report. Another high-level study of the air campaign has never been made public.

In the end what emerges from the more than 5400 pages of records is an institutional acceptance of an inevitable collateral toll. In the logic of the military a strike however deadly to civilians is acceptable as long as it has been properly decided and approved — the proportionality of military gain to civilian danger weighed — in accordance with the chain of command.

Lawrence Lewis the former Pentagon and State Department adviser whose analysis for the 2018 study was quashed said in an interview that the military’s technological prowess and the highly bureaucratized system for assessing how it is employed may actually serve an unspoken purpose: to create greater legal and moral space for greater risk.

“Now we can take strikes in city streets because we have Hellfire missiles and we have fancy things with blades” he said. “We develop all these capabilities but we don’t use them to buy down risk for civilians. We just use them so we can make attacks that maybe we couldn’t do before.”

The Promise of Precision

The new way of war came to fruition in the wake of the 2009 surge of American troops into Afghanistan which brought some stability but never turned the war around.

By the end of 2014 with NATO’s mission also ending President Obama declared America’s ground war essentially done. Henceforth the United States would primarily provide air support and advice for Afghan forces battling the Taliban.

At roughly the same time as Islamic State fighters swept through Mosul and massacred thousands of Yazidi Kurds at Mount Sinjar Mr. Obama authorized a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS targets and in support of allied forces in Iraq and Syria.

The weaponry was hardly untested. This high-tech arsenal increasingly sophisticated had been critical to success in the 1991 Persian Gulf war in NATO’s 1999 campaign in the Balkans and more recently in Yemen and Somalia. By the time of the wars in the Middle East the MQ-9 Reaper drone outfitted with laser-guided Hellfire missiles had become the surveillance and attack vehicle of choice.

At an ever-quickening pace over the next five years and as the administration of Mr. Obama gave way to that of Donald J. Trump American forces would execute more than 50000 airstrikes in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan in accordance with a rigorous approval process that prized being “discriminate” “proportional” and in compliance with the law of armed conflict. Not only would this be the most precise air campaign ever; it would be the most transparent.

The only official accounting of that promise is the hidden Pentagon documents.

They were obtained through Freedom of Information requests beginning in March 2017 and lawsuits filed against the Defense Department and U.S. Central Command. To date The Times has received 1311 out of at least 2866 reports — known as credibility assessments — examining airstrikes in Iraq and Syria between September 2014 and January 2018. Requests for records from Afghanistan are the subject of a new lawsuit.

Each report is the fruit of a review process that begins when a potential civilian-casualty incident is identified by the military or more frequently alleged by an outside source — a nongovernmental organization a news outlet or social media.

Assessment experts classify allegations into two categories. A case is “credible” if it is deemed “more likely than not” that the airstrike caused civilian casualties. In the reports examined by The Times 216 cases were deemed credible. “Noncredible” cases fail to meet that standard — often because there is no record of a strike at the place and time in question or because the available evidence is considered insufficiently specific or simply weak.

Until now fewer than 20 of these assessments dating to late 2014 have been made public.

To assess the military’s assessments between late 2016 and this past June The Times visited the sites of 60 incidents deemed credible in Iraq and Syria as well as three dozen others deemed noncredible or not yet assessed. (It also visited dozens of strike sites in Afghanistan.) In 35 credible cases it was possible to locate the precise impact area and find survivors and witnesses on the ground. Then the reporting included touring wreckage; collecting photo and video evidence; and verifying casualties through death certificates government IDs and hospital records.

Frequently the reporting closely matched basic information from the documents. But the detailed accounts that ultimately emerged from the rubbled ground were often in stark contrast to what had been assessed from the air.

‘Play Time?’

this area is poppin

It was Jan. 13 2017 and the battle for East Mosul would soon reach the neighborhood of al-Faisaliya. Iraqi forces were 120 meters away; farther back an American ground team was helping coordinate air support.

In Erbil and in Doha Qatar a ground controller and aircrew members typed out messages helping fulfill the array of combat directives and rules of the strike process:

The war against ISIS heralded the dawn of “strike cells” — remote operations centers from which most airstrikes were directed and controlled. These war rooms synergized the myriad players — pilots sensor operators intelligence experts ground forces weaponeering specialists civilian-casualty-mitigation analysts lawyers even weather officers. Strike cells boasted at times that with their video feeds and surveillance aircraft they could understand what was happening on the battlefield as well as if they were there themselves.

As the war intensified and ground commanders won greater authority to call in strikes the cells expanded with a small number of Americans embedded with allies on the battlefield. The cells were seen as so successful that they made their way to Afghanistan too. And as the Trump administration sought to pressure the Taliban into a deal decision-making authority for airstrikes was often pushed further down the chain of command.

The cells conducted “dynamic strikes” — identified and executed within minutes or hours in the flow of war accounting for an overwhelming majority of the air campaign. “Deliberate” strikes which were preplanned — extensively vetted often filmed over weeks or months and analyzed by several working groups — decreased over time.

In both scenarios the targeting process essentially boiled down to two questions: Could the presumed enemy target be positively identified? And would any harm to civilians be proportional in line with the law of armed conflict — or would it exceed the “expected military advantage gained”?

For positive identification the officer designated with strike approval needed “reasonable certainty” that the target performed a function for the adversary. That could be relatively straightforward as when the target was a fighter firing directly on friendly forces. But a more ambiguous target like a suspected ISIS headquarters might require further surveillance.

To determine proportionality analysts evaluated whether the target was used exclusively by the enemy or might also be used by civilians then assessed civilians’ “pattern of life.” Ultimately they would calculate how many civilians were likely to be killed or wounded.

For deliberate strikes this generally entailed an exhaustive “collateral damage estimate” a computer calculation of the expected civilian casualty count based on a mix of factors: the pattern of life the population density the specific weapon being used the kind of structure being targeted — a concrete building an aluminum shed a mud hut. The officer approving the strike would weigh that estimate with other factors such as the potential for secondary blasts from explosive materials nearby.

For dynamic strikes the process could be vastly compressed. Especially if there was a threat to friendly forces or some other urgency strike cells were more likely to rely on an impromptu assessment of a video feed.

Either way based on that calculation the military was required to take “feasible precautions” to mitigate civilian harm. The greater the likelihood of someone being in the wrong place at the wrong time the more precautions taken — say by deploying more-precise weaponry to limit the blast radius or by attacking when the fewest civilians were predicted to be present.

The military does not provide a precise definition of what is proportional. Essentially the expected civilian toll was proportional if the officer making that determination reasonably believed it to be so and if it did not exceed a “noncombatant cutoff value.” Otherwise officials say the target would be discarded.

The final official step was a legal review. But efforts to protect civilians could continue until moments before a weapon was fired. From the cockpit pilots could select how a weapon detonated — upon impact or with a delayed fuse. Or they could call an “abort” if for example a civilian was spotted walking into the target area.

Under the right circumstances this process could result in a strike so precise that it would destroy the section of a house filled with enemy fighters and leave the rest of the building intact.

Children playing where the school sheltering Qusay Saad’s family stood before Jan. 13 2017 when a strike hit it. Ali Al-Baroodi for The New York Times

As Iraqi forces approached Qusay Saad’s home in East Mosul ISIS forced his family to move to an area still under its control. They found refuge in his brother’s abandoned house in al-Faisaliya.

Through a night of gunfire and explosions Mr. Saad and his wife Zuhour comforted their three children and prayed that Iraqi forces would reach them. Then ISIS ordered them to move again into an abandoned school next door with two other families. That was the building observed in the chat on Jan. 13 2017.

The first airstrike hit as the Saad family sat down to breakfast. Mr. Saad recalls concrete blocks pressing down on his head and his wife screaming. A man from one of the other families lifted away the blocks and he quickly wrested his 14-month-old daughter Aisha from the rubble and handed her to his wife.

The second strike came just as he turned to free his 7-year-old son Muhammad.

“The strike was unbelievable” he said. “An entire three-story house was just crushed.”

Three members of another family escaped. Mr. Saad could not find his wife their 4-year-old son Abdulrahman or Aisha. But Muhammad was alive his thigh split open. Bleeding from the head Mr. Saad picked up the boy and fled.

It would be two months before he could recover the bodies. The Iraqi government offered no help. So the family paid to excavate the site. Mr. Saad watched as his wife and two youngest children were lifted out. Aisha’s head was missing but her little body was in her mother’s arms.

They were buried not far from their home which Mr. Saad has kept as it was when they all lived there. Sometimes his brother said he spends whole nights at the graveyard.

Last month The Times told him of the findings of the military’s assessment. It offers this account:

The target was a building assessed as harboring four ISIS fighters. A review of the imagery revealed that after the first strike which because of a “weapon malfunction” only partly collapsed the building four adults and four children could be seen moving in its center. The building was hit again and fully collapsed. Later three people emerged. The strike team did not report any civilians in the vicinity and because of the drone’s angle a view of the eight people in the building after the first strike “was obscured.”

The allegation was deemed credible with eight civilians killed but no further investigation was ordered. Eight “enemies” were also killed the document said.

When told of the Army’s findings Mr. Saad could not understand how a military with such a wealth of information could have failed to see them — or how the pursuit of fighters he never saw could justify leveling a building full of families. If the Americans would show him the video he said he would show them Mosul.

“They have to come here and see with their own eyes” he said adding “What happened wasn’t liberation. It was the destruction of humanity.”

How Deadly Failures Happen

Last May the Pentagon’s inspector general completed a classified report evaluating the policies for ensuring that “only valid military targets are struck” and that “damage to property and loss of civilian life is mitigated to the maximum extent possible.”

A redacted version echoing similar studies by other agencies in recent years declares the targeting process to be sound.

The Pentagon’s own assessments tell a far richer story.

The documents often do not articulate precise causes and in many cases several factors coalesced into a deadly failure. But The Times’s analysis of the 216 cases deemed credible together with its reporting on the ground reveals several distinct patterns of failure.

Misidentifying Civilians

Positive identification of the enemy is one of the pillars of the targeting process yet ordinary citizens were routinely mistaken for combatants.

In a dissenting footnote to the 2018 Joint Chiefs’ study Mr. Lewis and a colleague cited research showing that misidentification was one of the two leading causes of civilian casualties in American military operations. With few troops on the ground they wrote “it is reasonable to expect a systematic undercounting of misidentifications in U.S. military reports.”

Indeed according to the Pentagon records misidentification was involved in only 4 percent of cases. At the casualty sites visited by The Times misidentification was a major factor in 17 percent of incidents but accounted for nearly a third of civilian deaths and injuries.

At times the error involved quicksilver intelligence of an imminent threat. In The Times’s ground sample though misidentification occurred just as frequently in strikes planned far in advance — as in a January 2017 strike on an ISIS “foreign fighter headquarters” in East Mosul that killed 16 people in what turned out to be three civilian homes. Three ISIS buildings down the street were untouched.

Yet in case after case the misidentification appears to be less a matter of confusion than of confirmation bias.

That was what happened on Nov. 20 2016 after a Special Operations task force received a report of an ISIS explosives factory in a Syrian village north of Raqqa. In a walled compound operators spotted “white bags” assessed to be ammonium nitrate. Two trucks with a dozen men departed stopped at various ISIS checkpoints drove to a building “associated with previous ISIS activity” then returned to the compound. The first strike targeted one truck which caused “secondary explosions.” On the evidence of those blasts and the “white bags” operators received approval to strike three buildings. After impact two “squirters” fled the westernmost building. That building and another were struck again.

The findings of the military’s review begun after online reports that a strike in the same area had killed nine civilians and injured more than a dozen contradicted nearly all of the original intelligence.

NOV. 20 2016 — RAQQA SYRIA A military review showed that a target believed to be an ISIS explosives factory was actually a cotton gin. Nine civilians were killed. Further investigation was not recommended. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Examining scans of the compound analysts detected no ammonium nitrate. The presumed secondary explosions were actually reflections from a nearby building and one of the “squirters” was a child. Finally a six-month time lapse of imagery showed that the compound was “more likely a cotton gin than a factory” for explosives. Two civilians were killed the report said. (The task force continued to call the gin a legitimate target citing a news report that ISIS controlled three-quarters of Syria’s cotton production.)

Several months later in Iraq American forces received intelligence about a suspected car bomb — a dark-colored heavily armored vehicle moving through the Wadi Hajar neighborhood of West Mosul.

Scanning a surveillance feed an air-support coordinator quickly homed in on a possible match: a green vehicle whose windows appeared to be covered over. He did not see any signs of reinforced armor but positively identified both the green car and a closely trailing white vehicle as car bombs.

Both vehicles traveled away from the front line and stopped at an intersection where several people were gathered on a covered section of sidewalk. The driver of the first car got out and joined the group. The target authority approved the strike.

The targeted vehicle “sustained a direct hit” according to the military assessment. The group on the sidewalk “sustained weapons effects.”

But the review of the footage found no evidence that the vehicle was a car bomb. There was no telltale secondary explosion. Nor was the car heavily armored. And though the people on the sidewalk were visible in the footage they were never mentioned in the pre-strike chat.

FEB. 25 2017 — MOSUL IRAQ Based on a review of all available information the CIVCAS allegation is credible. Full motion video (FMV) shows that five individuals near the target vehicle were killed or injured by the strike and there is no information to indicate that those individuals had been or could be positively identified as combatants .

The full picture which the targeting team involved in the strike failed to see emerged when The Times visited Wadi Hajar earlier this year.

Ordered by ISIS to leave the neighborhood Majid Mahmoud Ahmed his wife and two children had piled into their blue — not green — Opel Astra station wagon. Following close behind in a white car were his brother Firas and his family. At an intersection where other fleeing residents had gathered Mr. Ahmed spotted his friend Muhammad Jamaal Muhammad waving and got out to say hello. As another neighbor approached the airstrike hit.

“I remember there was a big explosion and I fainted” recalled Abdul Hakeem Abdullah Hamash Al Aqidi an elderly man who had been standing by his door at the intersection. He lost an eye and had to have a plate implanted in his injured left leg. His son’s left leg had to be amputated.

In all seven local people — including the four members of the Ahmed family — were killed. Mr. Mohamed who had waved to Mr. Ahmed cannot banish from his mind the image of his friend’s wife Hiba Bashir burned into the seat still holding her infant son in her lap.

The military spokesman Captain Urban acknowledged that “confirmation bias is a real concern” citing the Kabul airstrike in August that killed the 10 members of a family. “There is more work to do on this” he said.

Failing to Detect Civilians

If the military often mistook civilians for enemy fighters frequently it simply failed to see or understand that they were there. That was a factor in a fifth of the cases in the Pentagon documents and a slightly smaller fraction of the casualties. However it accounted for 37 percent of credible cases and nearly three-fourths of the total civilian deaths and injuries at the sites visited by The Times.

Captain Urban said the targeting process had been vastly complicated by enemies who “plan resource and base themselves in and among local populace.”

“They do not present themselves in large formations” he added “do not fight coalition forces with conventional tactics and use geography and terrain in ways not conducive in every way to easy targeting solutions. Moreover they often and deliberately use civilians as human shields and they do not subscribe to anything remotely like the law of armed conflict to which we subscribe.”

Even so the documents show that frequently instead of extended surveillance analysts relied on brief “collateral scans” — as little as 11 seconds long — in determining that civilians were not in the area. The footage was often limited by shortages of surveillance drones particularly during the battles to retake Mosul and Raqqa.

In a number of cases targets that had been placed on “no-strike lists” because attacking them would violate laws of war — a school a bakery a civilian hospital — were removed after the military mistakenly judged that they were now used exclusively by the enemy.

In Mosul in February 2017 a hospital was taken off the list after the military concluded that civilians had left the area and that the building was being used only as an ISIS headquarters and propaganda center. The week before the strike according to the report analysts had examined still images of children “interacting” with the hospital but had determined that striking at night would “alleviate collateral concerns.” Four civilians were killed and six injured.

For the military’s analysts studying the “pattern of life” is a crucial step in predicting collateral damage. But to examine the documents and interview local people is to understand how often unseen civilians might have been seen or their presence at least suspected had the military had a more intimate knowledge of the war-torn fabric of everyday life.

In some documents as evidence of no civilian presence military officials state that people would leave their homes at the sound of approaching aircraft. The reality is starkly different: Neighbors would huddle together seeking communal sanctuary in a house or group of houses invisible to surveillance drones.

Many of the deadliest airstrikes happened this way. Among them was the strike at the Syrian hamlet of Tokhar.

In July 2016 a Special Operations task force identified a large group of ISIS fighters two kilometers from where U.S.-backed forces were fighting ISIS. They observed the fighters traveling in pickups known as “bongo trucks” to three “staging areas” where no civilians were present. The fighters they concluded were assembling for a counterattack. Shortly before 3 a.m. they bombed the three staging sites and five vehicles confident of killing 85 ISIS fighters.

July 19 2016 — TOKHAR SYRIA A military investigation concluded that as many as 24 civilians were “intermixed” with the combatants reported killed at three ISIS “staging areas.” The Times found that the targets were houses and that more than 120 civilians were killed. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Almost immediately reports of a vast civilian death toll surfaced online. The task force conducted a full investigation and determined that between seven and 24 civilians “intermixed with the fighters” might have been killed.

The Times visited Tokhar in December 2018. Surviving villagers gave this account:

That night as they had every night for a month some 200 villagers had trekked to the outer edge of the hamlet and taken shelter in four homes at the farthest remove from the quickening battle.

There was no evidence they said that ISIS had been near any of the four houses. In fact residents said drones had been flying overhead for weeks giving them solace that coalition forces knew they were there.

The Times documented the names of civilians killed in each of the four houses corroborating details with open-source information local journalists and others on the ground and determined that more than 120 people died. There were few young men left to pull bodies from the rubble. It took nearly two weeks and still some were never found. If the full death toll were acknowledged Tokhar would be the largest civilian casualty incident the United States has admitted to in the air war against ISIS.

Saif Saleh 8 years old at the time awoke that early morning to the collapsing walls his arm trapped under debris. His parents used up every favor to collect $6000 for surgery to graft skin from his leg.

Asked what he would like to tell the American military Saif’s father said “We want to say that you should be sure the area is empty or that there are no civilians before you bomb.”

The military investigation found that there was no evidence of negligence or wrongdoing; that the “policies procedures and practices” were “sufficient for continued operations”; and that “no further action” was necessary. No condolence payments were authorized.

Overlooking Flawed Intelligence

Often civilians were killed in strikes executed in the face of incomplete outdated or ambiguous intelligence. Several such factors came together in a strike that killed at least 10 civilians in Tabqa Syria in March 2017.

As American-backed forces prepared to recapture the city west of Raqqa military officials approved strikes on a group of ISIS targets: two headquarters a police station and a weapons factory. Each strike went as planned according to initial assessments. Then came reports of civilian casualties.

The military review found that the intelligence for both headquarters was based on single reports from months before. (The targets had been identified earlier but for strategic advantage commanders had decided to wait until Syrian Democratic Forces were pushing into Tabqa.) The intelligence package on the first building warned that there was “insufficient” evidence to corroborate the judgment relied on to remove the building from a restricted-targeting list that it was used solely by ISIS; the report said simply that an ISIS emir had frequented the site.

Similarly the review found that the intelligence did not support the view that the second headquarters was used exclusively by ISIS. What’s more even though both headquarters were in densely populated areas with residential structures nearby there was insufficient footage to assess the presence of civilians — one minute of video of the first target and less than two of the second.

The review also raised serious questions about the quality of intelligence for the two other targets.

Flawed Video

Sometimes the problem was less the quantity of video than the quality

Analysts at the military’s Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar saw this clearly when they reviewed 17 minutes of grainy footage that preceded a Nov. 13 2015 strike on an ISIS “defensive fighting position” in Ramadi. Using the center’s 62-inch high-definition TV they concluded that what had been identified as an “unknown heavy object” being dragged into a building was actually “a person of small stature” “consistent with how a child would appear standing next to an adult.”

Often the overhead surveillance camera missed people simply sitting or standing under something doing the most quotidian things.

June 15 2016: An ISIS fighter on a motorcycle turned onto a secondary road near Mosul University. It was Ramadan; the shops and stalls were teeming with people. Among the five civilians also killed and four wounded in the strike:

Walking Into Danger

More than half of the cases the military deemed credible involved someone entering the target frame in the moments between a weapon’s firing and impact as in a March 2017 strike in Mosul when shrapnel killed a man pushing a cart down a road near an ISIS mortar tube.

These deaths which account for 10 percent of acknowledged civilian casualties are often framed as unavoidable accidents. In the Mosul strike that killed the man with the cart operators had already twice aborted weapons releases because civilians had entered the frame — demonstrating concerted efforts to avert danger. Yet the systematic nature of the problem suggests the military could be doing more.

Indeed the review of a February 2017 strike on a “high value individual” at a funeral in Mosul that injured two civilians includes some recommendations. While noting that the civilians’ presence “could not be predicted to reasonable certainty” it adds that an additional surveillance aircraft could have provided a more encompassing view. (Because of the target’s importance two aircraft were used to zoom in rather than out on the wider scene.) Yet again surveillance drones were in short supply.

Secondary Explosions

In the late spring of 2015 as ISIS continued to prove resilient in carrying out attacks and retaining territory American targeteers and weapons specialists prepared a nighttime airstrike on a car-bomb factory in the industrial district of Hawija north of Baghdad. Occupied apartment houses ringed the area. But the nearest “collateral concern” was assessed to be a “shed.”

Not long before dozens of displaced families unable to afford rent had also begun squatting in the abandoned houses scattered through the industrial zone. Among them were Khadijah Yaseen and her family who had fled the fighting in their hometown Yathrib.

The night of June 2 was particularly hot so the family slept outside. They woke to screaming and the sound of the jets.

“There was fire everywhere” Ms. Yaseen recalled when The Times met her at a displaced persons camp in October 2016. Most of those killed were from squatter families like hers. “You couldn’t count them. There were so many people that died.”

As many as 70 a military investigation found. Ms. Yaseen lost three grandchildren: 13-year-old Muhammad 12-year-old Ahmed and a 3-year-old girl Zahra.

June 2 2015 — HAWIJA IRAQ Plans for a coalition airstrike on an ISIS car-bomb factory failed to account for the potential for secondary explosions. As many as 70 people were killed the military investigation found. READ REPORT | SEE ALL DOCUMENTS

Hawija is among the deadliest examples of the failure to predict the collateral consequences of striking weapons caches or other targets with the potential for secondary explosions. Such explosions often reached far beyond the expected blast radius; they accounted for nearly a third of all civilian casualties acknowledged by the military and half of all civilian deaths and injuries at the sites visited by The Times.

Although the American military planned the Hawija strike the bombs were dropped by the air force of the Netherlands. There the case became a cause célèbre after it emerged that the defense minister had worked to suppress the findings of the military investigation.

In the report of the investigation targeteers and weapons experts describe the ultimately disastrous calculations taken to win approval for the strike. They worked and reworked the target carefully calculating what kinds of munitions to use until their model concluded — despite the fact that they would be striking a car-bomb factory with apartment buildings nearby — that there would be no civilian deaths. (The Dutch military would only carry out strikes with an expected civilian-casualty rate of zero.)

The document describes a secondary explosion that produced a “visible shock wave” extending more than 750 feet from the target.

“That is massive to be able to see a shock wave like that on a video” said a former high-level official involved in the air campaign against ISIS speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The only comparable explosion he’d seen he said was the 2020 blast that devastated the port of Beirut.

Among the sites visited by The Times at least half of the strikes with secondary explosions involved targets — like a power station or a factory for improvised explosive devices — that the military could have predicted would produce such blasts.

However at other times it was unaware of both a weapons cache and a civilian presence. That was the case in the largest civilian casualty incident the military has admitted in the war the March 17 2017 airstrike on two ISIS snipers in the Mosul al-Jadida neighborhood that killed at least 103 civilians.

Failures of Accountability

On Jan. 6 2017 Rafi Al Iraqi woke to the sound of a bomb close by. Another hit next door. Moments later his own house was struck. He could hear his oldest son Hamoody screaming in the wreckage. “I just gave him to some people to take him to the hospital” Mr. Al Iraqi recalled. “Then I went back in to find my other children.”

What happened next was captured on video taken by ISIS’ media agency which often visited blast sites for propaganda.

Rescuers emerged holding limp bodies. Mr. Al Iraqi’s daughter Nour was alive. “I took her with my own hands to the hospital” he recalled this past June in his most recent interview with The Times. “But by then she had died.” A nearby house for ISIS fighters was untouched.

Soon via the ISIS video and news reports word spread online that three families had been targeted in the Zerai neighborhood near Mosul’s Grand Mosque. In all 16 civilians were killed including three of Mr. Al Iraqi’s children and his mother-in-law. Hamoody’s leg was lacerated.

The military began a civilian-casualty assessment which found that there had been a single strike in Zerai that day — on a house assessed to be used exclusively as an ISIS “foreign fighter headquarters” and “artillery staging location.” The strike had been preplanned with no expected civilian casualties.

The post-strike footage showed no civilians killed or injured. The post-strike chat did not indicate the presence of civilians though it did mention a wounded man — judged to be an ISIS fighter — being helped from the ruins.

The footage was 1 minute and 22 seconds long. The allegation was deemed noncredible. Officially 16 people had not died that day in Zerai. (The Pentagon finally acknowledged the casualties in September 2020 after years of follow-up by The Times.)

Except for the rare instances of revelation and subsequent outcry the Pentagon’s brief published reports on the minority of cases it finds credible are the only public acknowledgment of the air war’s civilian toll.

The Times’s reporting in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan points to the broader truth.

In addition to the finding that many allegations of civilian casualties were erroneously dismissed The Times discovered that even when civilian deaths were acknowledged they were often significantly undercounted.

Roughly 37 percent of the allegations deemed credible stemmed from prior ground investigations by journalists or nongovernmental organizations; in those cases the acknowledged death tolls roughly tracked outside reporting. But in the other cases The Times’s own reporting found that the civilian toll was nearly double that acknowledged by the military. (That did not include ISIS fighters’ wives and children whose information was difficult to verify.)

The documents identify children killed or injured in 27 percent of cases; in The Times’s ground reporting it was 62 percent. In 40 percent of the sites visited survivors had been left with significant disabilities which were not tracked by the military.

Beyond the casualty count the structure and execution of the assessments do not encourage the regular examination of immediate lessons or deeper trends.

The records obtained by The Times some significantly redacted range from short first-impression reports to more formal credibility assessments. The reports generally contain a narrative drawn from the strike’s “target package” — including intelligence about the target the civilian-casualty estimate actions to mitigate civilian harm video footage and chat logs tracking each step of the process.

Not only was there no record of disciplinary action or full investigations in roughly 9 of every 10 cases but only a quarter included any further review recommendations or lessons learned. Even the architecture of the forms makes it difficult to analyze causes in aggregate; they do not have specific boxes for specific factors involved in a fatal error. There are a few places to record proximate causes or lessons learned but those fields are mostly empty or redacted. Records are often incomplete missing attachments or were only partially entered into shared databases.

In many cases the unit that executed a strike also ended up investigating it; their assessments often included minimal information. For example a Special Operations unit’s rationale for rejecting allegations that a December 2016 airstrike near Raqqa had killed as many as nine civilians consisted of a single paragraph stating that it had reviewed its strikes in the area and found “no evidence of possible civilian casualties.” There was no further information or detail from the footage.

The Times found that such omissions as well as redactions and missing documents were often associated with Talon Anvil the Special Operations unit that carried out the recently revealed airstrike that killed dozens of civilians in Syria in 2019.

The Video Evidence

Of the 1311 assessments from the Pentagon in only one did investigators visit the site of a strike. In only two did they interview witnesses or survivors.

Captain Urban the military spokesman said that in hostile territory investigators might be unable to visit a blast site and interview “personnel on the ground.”

Instead often the resounding piece of evidence studied was video recorded in the wake of a strike. Yet just as poor or insufficient footage frequently contributed to deadly targeting failures so did it hamstring efforts to examine them.

Often the footage was only seconds or minutes long in many cases too brief to see rescuers carrying survivors from a collapsed building. (Frequently rescuers would wait before approaching a bombed area for fear of being misidentified and provoking a second strike known in the military as a “double tap.”) Often images were obscured by the smoke of the blast.

In an interview — speaking anonymously because of a nondisclosure agreement — an analyst who captures strike imagery said superior officers would often “tell the cameras to look somewhere else” because “they knew if they’d just hit a bad target.”

And at times there was simply no footage for review which became the basis for rejecting the allegation. That was often because of “equipment error” because no aircraft had “observed or recorded the strike” or because the unit could not or would not find the footage or had not preserved it as required.

In a number of cases compelling allegations were dismissed because the claim’s details did not precisely match the imagery.

For example when Airwars — the leading source of civilian casualty allegations referred to the military — reported that a strike in East Mosul in April 2015 had killed dozens of civilian rescuers the allegation was rejected because of “discrepancies in eyewitness accounts.” Despite accurately testifying that three bombs had struck an electric substation a witness said the third had come a quarter-hour after the second and had not exploded; the document described that as “inconsistent” with the military’s imagery and strike report. (The allegation was later deemed credible after The Times visited the site and told the military that at least 18 civilians had been killed and more than a dozen wounded.)

Even when allegations were deemed credible the military often undercounted the toll because victims unseen by the overhead camera before the strike remained invisible in the aftermath. Case in point: the 2016 Ramadan bombing near Mosul University that killed five civilians and wounded four. The military reported injuries to two civilians who had been in the pre-strike footage.

Cases Closed

When the military receives an allegation of civilian casualties it runs through a checklist to determine whether the case merits further inquiry. Most never reach the point of video review. About a quarter of the noncredible cases were summarily closed because they lacked sufficient information or detail such as a specific location or 48-hour time frame. But more than half were rejected in some cases erroneously because the military could find no record of corroborating strikes in the geographic area identified in the allegation — or because there were too many potential matches and too little detailed information.

That information would be found in official logs maintained by different strike authorities. But The Times found numerous instances in which the logs were incomplete or inaccurate: Often records show the coalition knew its logs were flawed.

Frequently cases were closed because the military said it lacked the information to pinpoint the neighborhood in question. Sometimes that conclusion was rooted in misunderstandings of local custom and culture.

In January 2017 citing insufficient information an officer quickly closed a case based on social media reports that civilians had been killed in a strike on a funeral in the al Shifaa neighborhood of West Mosul. Fruitlessly the officer had searched logs for potentially corroborating strikes in the cemetery closest to that neighborhood.

However as reflected in a graphic video accompanying the initial reports the strike had not taken place at a cemetery: A thumbnail depicted the entrance to a house. In fact Muslim funerals are rarely held at cemeteries. What’s more Muslims bury the dead quickly and it had been four days since this man Col. Aziz Ahmed Aziz Sanjari had died.

The colonel’s death had brought many members of the Sanjari family’s tribe to their home to mourn. It was a sunny afternoon so more than a dozen people sat outside. They could hear a drone humming above but were unworried. It was a common occurrence. A few minutes later the bomb hit. Eleven people were killed The Times found.

‘Sometimes Bad Things Happen’

Captain Urban acknowledged that “In some cases our assessment of the numbers of civilian casualties does not always match that of outside groups and we acknowledge that those numbers may change over time as well.

“We do the best we can given the circumstances to understand fully the effects of our operations and the harm done to innocent life. That we sometimes do not always arrive at the same conclusion of outside groups does not diminish the sincerity with which we strive to get it right.”

Several Pentagon studies rendered in military bureaucratese have observed some of the failures of accountability. The April 2018 Joint Chiefs of Staff examination of civilian deaths from airstrikes in the Middle East and Africa found that “feedback to subordinate commands on the cause and/or lessons learned from a civilian casualty incident is inconsistent.” The recent Pentagon Inspector General report spoke of “omissions.”

Yet for the most part these reports do not speak to questions of how airstrikes repeatedly go wrong.

Mr. Lewis the co-author whose efforts to analyze the assessments in aggregate were excised from the Joint Chiefs’ study said the report instead relied primarily on interviews with assessment officers. They were able to detect certain patterns — especially casualties from secondary explosions and from people entering the target frame after a weapon’s firing — but few of the systematic reasons behind the bulk of civilian deaths.

The Times asked him why the military would develop such intricate procedures to prevent civilian casualties and then assess them but not prioritize documenting or studying causes and lessons learned. Not only does the system provide legitimacy for the military’s actions he said; it also allows the United States to boast of a process that is a global model of accountability.

The former high-level American official in the campaign against ISIS said the procedures served an additional purpose — to provide a “psychological veneer” for the people involved: “We did the process. We did what we needed to do. Sometimes bad things happen.”

He said that after returning from his post anguished by what he had seen he had started therapy. He pointed to Raqqa rendered a necropolis by American-led airstrikes and compared it to the ruins of Aleppo which was bombed by the Russians without the American military’s sophisticated considerations of proportionality — the collateral damage estimates no-strike lists or rules of engagement.

“Eventually I stopped saying that this was the most precise bombing campaign in the history of warfare” he said. “So what? It doesn’t matter that this was the most precise bombing campaign and the city looks like this.”

In Afghanistan

All the boys and men of Band-e-Timor knew that when the Toyota Hiluxes came you should run for your life.

People called them wegos. At the wheel were Afghan paramilitary forces who usually set out on full-moon nights at the fork in the road before Lashkar Gah charging through the village of Barang straddling the Kandahar-Helmand border and into other parts of Band-e-Timor “capturing everyone: old men young men everyone” said a resident named Matiullah.

U.S. officials said an Aug. 29 drone strike in Kabul destroyed a vehicle carrying bombs. The Times found that it had killed 10 members of one family. Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times

It did not matter if you were not Taliban people said. If you were male the Afghan forces would arrest you simply to collect a bounty for your release. If you were old or feeble the price was just over $500; a man in his prime would fetch twice that. “You would have to sell your cow or your land to get your relatives released” said Rahmatullah a village resident. Often it was the poorest who would run.

On the night of Jan. 31 2018 the moon was especially bright. The wegos as usual came accompanied by what villagers said were American aircraft. Hidayatullah a driver by profession three days from marrying knew he could not afford the bounty and the wedding so he drove out into the desert. Then an airstrike found him said Matiullah who is his cousin. Dozens of other civilians mistaken for Taliban as they fled on foot and motorbike across Band-e-Timor died in the raid as well.

The August drone strike in Kabul that killed an Afghan aid worker and nine of his relatives grabbed the world’s attention. But most American airstrikes in Afghanistan took place far from the cities in remote areas where cameras were not filming mobile lines were often cut and the internet was nonexistent.

America’s longest war was in many ways its least transparent. For years these rural battlefields were largely off-limits to American reporters. But after the Taliban returned to power in August Afghanistan’s hinterlands opened up.

The Times arrived in Barang a little over a month later visiting 15 households in this hamlet of mud homes and farmland and also interviewing tribal elders and others across Band-e-Timor. Most said they had never spoken to a journalist before. The accounts they gave — consistently and reliably in hourslong interviews — help explain how America lost the country how its war of airstrikes and support of corrupt security forces paved the way for the Taliban’s return.

On average each household lost five civilian family members. An overwhelming majority of these deaths were caused by airstrikes most during wego raids. Many people admitted they had relatives who were Taliban fighters but civilians accounted for most of those lost:

A father killed in an airstrike while running for the forest. A nephew killed as he slept with his flock of sheep. An uncle shot by American soldiers as he went to the bazaar to buy okra for dinner.

At the sound of helicopters Hajji Muhammad Ismail Agha’s sons had bounded for the desert. The “foreign helicopters” fired on them. One son Nour Muhammad was killed; the other Hajji Muhammad survived. “How could the planes tell the difference between a civilian and a Taliban?” the father asked. “He was killed just a little far from here. I watched it happen.”

None of these incidents were mentioned in Pentagon press releases. Few were tallied in United Nations counts. So isolated from the Afghan government were residents that when asked for their loved ones’ death certificates they asked where they might obtain them. Instead to verify deaths The Times visited tombstones in graveyards littered across the desert.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9wcmluY2UtZWR3YXJkLWlzbGFuZC9wZWktbGlxdW9yLWFjdC1jaGFuZ2VzLTEuNjI5MTk3NtIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42MjkxOTc2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.E.I. lifts some importation limits as part of changes to Liquor Act,"Islanders can now bring as much alcohol as they want into P.E.I. from other provinces as long as it can be safely stored in their vehicle.

Additionally Target has invested heavily in mass surveillance technologies and policing and produced unprecedented public-private partnerships with governments making it one of the most powerful corporations in the U.S.

“What sets Target apart from the crowd is an aggressive datamining of customer interactions. That includes customers’ cell phones web cookies purchase histories prescription and other health information.“ Reuters 2014

Revisiting Target’s “Great Hack”

Eight years ago this week it was revealed that Target was at the center of the largest retail hack in U.S. history with millions of customers’ info compromised including 40 million credit cards and 70 million names addresses emails and other “personal info” according to Bloomberg Businessweek. At the time it was the second largest credit card theft in history the AP reported. Instead of informing their customers immediately Target took several days.

Bloomberg reported that Target’s computer security team was notified of the data breach by FireEye the cyber security vendor they recently purchased services from. Target had ample time to disrupt the hack but instead ignored the massive breach of up to 110 million customer’s most sensitive information. “The story they tell is of an alert system installed to protect the bond between retailer and customer that worked beautifully. But then Target stood by as 40 million credit card numbers—and 70 million addresses phone numbers and other pieces of personal information—gushed out of its mainframes.”

Target didn’t act until the U.S. Dept. of Justice contacted them weeks later on December 12 2013. Target never provided the public an explanation for its seeming negligence.

The U.S. Senate investigated the hack and included in their findings that “…Target’s security team neither reacted to the alarms nor allowed the FireEye software to automatically delete the malware in question. Target’s Symantec antivirus software also detected malicious behavior around November 28 implicating the same server flagged by FireEye’s software.”

This is significant considering how Target aggressively goes after shoplifters. Two years before the hack the Boston Globe reported “Security technicians compile alerts throughout the day and blast them out to stores to keep them aware of ongoing issues. For example last week a local man was suspected of stealing electronics from area Targets so shops were put on notice.”

Activists are losing trust in America’s retail darling. Paul Stephens director of policy and advocacy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse an advocacy group said Target is already a leader in the data mining industry and “that makes this breach all the more frightening.”

It is notable that at that time Target itself was collecting much more info from their customers than shopping preferences and social media likes.

Target’s Data Universe and Surveillance Capitalism

Target and other major corporations extract enormous amounts of shopper information and compile massive private dossiers on customers. Data mining is done through “linkability” or combining that info with other sources that can be assembled into a deep portrait of that person’s public and private affairs including financial.

Screenshot from Target’s website of a job post in the field of A.I.

Data mining companies are able to retrieve sweeping information on the general population from several ways including working with other big data firms international hackers intelligence agencies and governments around the world.

Few retailers have invested in big data like the Minneapolis corporation. Target erected its own data warehouses in Elk River (2007) and Brooklyn Park (2014) a security operations center (or corporate command center commonly known as C3) in downtown Minneapolis a data sciences office in Pittsburgh a global capabilities center in Bengaluru India dozens of investigation centers and a massive surveillance empire to collect troves of information on the public. Target has engaged in this practice for over two decades with little scrutiny.

According to Reuters “The company can identify by name more than half the customers who walk into their stores and browse their website […] What sets Target apart from the crowd is an aggressive datamining of customer interactions. That includes customers’ cell phones web cookies purchase histories prescription and other health information.”

They assign every shopper a Guest ID number tied to their credit card name and email address becoming a bucket that stores a history of purchases Target can then monitor and aggregate with additional customer info they collect and buy from other data companies.

In 2012 the New York Times Magazine published an excerpt from the bestselling book The Power of Habits: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. Duhigg dug deep into Target’s massive data mining operations. According to the author:

“Also linked to your Guest ID is demographic information like your age whether you are married and have kids which part of town you live in how long it takes you to drive to the store your estimated salary whether you’ve moved recently what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what websites you visit. Target can buy data about your ethnicity job history the magazines you read if you’ve ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced the year you bought (or lost) your house where you went to college what kinds of topics you talk about online whether you prefer certain brands […] your political leanings reading habits charitable giving and the number of cars you own.” Charles Duhigg The Power of Habits: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business

Consultant and chairman of the Predictive Analytics World conference Eric Siegel told Duhigg “Almost every major retailer […] has a ‘predictive analytics’[…] department’ but Target has always been one of the smartest at this.”

Surveillance capitalism is a system resulting from corporate data mining of the public that predicts individual shopping habits where corporations manipulate human behavior that keeps consumers spending and maximize profits. Under surveillance capitalism humans and their predicted habits are the commodity.

In Shoshana Zuboff’s critically acclaimed book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism she explained:

“Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to product or service improvement the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‘machine intelligence’ and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now soon and later. Finally these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace for behavioral predictions that I call behavioral futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations for many companies are eager to lay bets on our future behavior.” Shoshana Zuboff The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power (2019)

Targeting Your Kids

Corporations don’t just track adult consumers they also track children. As explained in the documentary film The Great Hack kids growing up today in the age of social media will have massive private dossiers collected on them by the time they become adults. With this data corporations can classify children according to their behavior in order “to lay bets on future behavior.”

In early 2013 months before it was hacked Target was part of a class action lawsuit for spying on the public adults and children alike using predatory technology called Flash cookies.

According to the online legal news service Law360:

“Target Corp. and Toys R Us Inc. surreptitiously installed tracking software on consumers’ computers that allowed them and other advertisers to monitor the consumers’ Internet browsing history and collect personal information according to proposed class actions removed to Missouri federal court last week [Target] allegedly installed […] flash cookies […] which allowed them to access the browsing histories of any consumer every time they revisited the website.” Law360

Target and all of its innovative ways to spy on adults and children give new meaning to a story told recently on the ‘Money. Power. Land. Solidarity’ podcast by host GP Jacob. He recalled years ago when the multinational corporation sponsored the new media center at a local Minneapolis elementary school where he worked. He said they made the teachers dress up in red like Target employees.

Getting caught using Flash cookies leaves little room for doubt that this was an opportunity for Target to collect student’s personal and academic data and monitor their online activities.

Charles Duhigg documented the retailer’s cutting edge technology that targets expecting mothers in his chapter “How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do.” Marketing analyst Andrew Pole created Target’s pregnancy prediction model. From analyzing customer demographics and shopping habits the corporate giant can tell with an incredibly high amount of accuracy if a woman or girl is pregnant. Expecting mothers spend major money with retailers according to Target giving them a technological advantage over some other competitors vying for this demographic.

A year after it began using its pregnancy prediction poll an angry father walked into a Minnesota Target store demanding to see the manager Duhigg documented in his book. “My daughter got this in the mail” he said holding a Target advertisement. “She’s still in high school and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs. Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”

Turns out the girl was pregnant. Target eventually stopped speaking to Duhigg and prohibited him from being on the property of its headquarters in downtown Minneapolis.

Facial Recognition Tech Used in Target Stores

It was first reported by the Boston Globe in 2011 that Target was spying on shoppers implying that the corporation was using facial recognition technology (FRT) in stores.

The Minneapolis corporation was collecting biometric data from customers when the Globe quoted one Target forensics specialist saying “We are using state-of-the-art equipment to gather as much intelligence as possible reduce business risks and take down criminals.”

It also reported that Target has “one of the largest and most advanced networks of cameras.” They described technology called gaze trackers that are hidden inside Target store shelves that track which brands customers are looking at and for how long stating that it has “a system that automatically sends alerts when shoppers dwell too long in front of merchandise…”

In March 2013 it was confirmed by Consumer Reports (CR) that Target collected information from store visitors “recorded by in-store cameras” according to the retailer’s own privacy policy. The publication alerted readers to retailers who use “super spy cams” hidden in mannequins that monitor shoppers.

Eight months before Target’s hack CR forewarned of the consequences to corporations including Target of amassing sensitive customer data and falling prey to data miners:

“Video can be merged with a store’s other data such as footage of you at the cash register plus the transaction details of what you bought for how much using what credit card. Your face and vehicle license plate can be linked. If that info is not securely stored it could be hacked. Stores don’t provide sufficient disclosure so you can’t opt out to protect your privacy.“ ShopSmart Magazine Consumer Reports March 2013

When they questioned Target about its vast surveillance system and data collection on customers CR reported that “Target refused to comment about the store’s use of video analytics and other tools.”

The retailer extracted biometric data using FRT on every person that walked through the doors of selected stores for an undisclosed amount of time according to Buzzfeed. It reported that Target and other retailers have been collecting sweeping biometric data from millions of customers for years without their consent or knowledge.

A spokesperson for Target provided Unicorn Riot with the following statement:

“Target doesn’t use facial recognition software in any of our stores. We keep our stores safe by conducting regular team training and implementing robust security procedures. We concluded a facial recognition software test in a small number of Target stores in the summer of 2018 to understand its ability to help prevent fraud and theft. The test was solely related to security and before the test we updated our privacy policy and posted signs at the entrance of the impacted stores to inform guests of the additional security measures.“ Target Spokesperson

However it is clear they were using FRT well before it got hacked in November 2013. It is also clear from past reporting on the massive hack that the primary media focus was on stolen credit card info and Target never had to account for its customers’ biometric data when up to 110 million customer’s “personal info” was compromised.

Investments in Mass Surveillance and Incarceration

As documented throughout this series Target has invested heavily in mass surveillance technologies and law enforcement since the early 2000s with its SafeZone/Safe City surveillance program. It began in downtown Minneapolis with the installation of 30 CCTV cameras. It eventually expanded citywide and nationwide.

Surveillance became such an integral part of Target’s business model that in 2006 top executives made jarring revelations via the Washington Post: “In many ways Target is actually a high-tech company masquerading as a retailer.”

The corporate giant first began funding cops in 1990 when it launched its Law Enforcement Grant Program. However following 9/11 Target began heavily investing in police and mass surveillance technologies.

According to Bloomberg Businessweek “For decades Target fostered partnerships with law enforcement unlike those of any other U.S. corporation. It became one of the most influential corporate donors to law enforcement agencies and police foundations supplying money for cutting-edge technology and equipment.”

In 2003 a year before the launch of the SafeZone Target opened up two state-of-the-art crime labs where their “investigators” analyze video audio and image forensics to aid security and local police in fighting crime.

Target made it clear to the Washington Post that they are proponents of data fusion or data integration across sectors arguing that info sharing could help fight crime. Target’s vice president compared tracking criminals to tracking inventory: “It struck me that following repeat criminals was really an inventory-management problem.”

As detailed throughout this series Target’s public-private surveillance apparatus between downtown Minneapolis businesses nonprofits and police included the Downtown 100 Initiative (DT100) supposedly designed to target repeat offenders. The DT100 has been criticized for its targeted surveillance of Black youth experiencing homelessness with data mining precision.

One group likened this to slavery.

We often say incarceration is “warehousing” of people a continuation of enslavement treating humans as property. That’s exactly how @Target Vice President @nategarvis explained their role: “It struck me that following repeat criminals was really an inventory-management problem.” pic.twitter.com/RapEfSv3Sg — Stop LAPD Spying Coalition (@stoplapdspying) March 22 2021

Intelligence Forensics Services and More

Following 9/11 Target boasted of its crime fighting capabilities its partnership with police around the world its two state-of-the-art forensics labs and the services it offered local law enforcement free of charge. By 2009 Target investigators had the capabilities of doing much more than analyzing audio videos and photos of crime suspects.

Four years before the Target hack the retailer was a vendor at the National Association for Justice Information Systems conference in Nashville.

Target’s presentation was titled “Intelligence: Gathered Analyzed Disseminated & Managed.” Other vendors at the conference presented on new innovations such as “Biometrically Enabled Prison Management Systems” and how to develop a “National Information Exchange Model.”

Unicorn Riot obtained a handout from Target’s presentation that listed resources and services they offer to law enforcement for free which included: intelligence analysis man power for search warrant executions surveillance van sting trailer and more as listed on the “Target Investigations Resources” handout below.

In 2013 months before the massive hack Target hosted a social media training for law enforcement around the country on how to use major online platforms more effectively for surveillance and other purposes.

The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition a Los Angeles based advocacy group dedicated towards “abolition of the police state” shared a brochure of the LAPD regional crime center sponsored by Target that reads: “INVESTIGATE – COLLABORATE – INCARCERATE.” The group told its Twitter followers to “Remember that motto next time you see pearl clutching about looting at a Target.”

Warnings of and Whistle Blowing on the Public-Private “Surveillance State“

Civil libertarians have long pushed back against government and private sector partnerships and forewarned about the implications of dragnet surveillance on the general population for the purpose of control but under the guise of “fighting terrorism.”

In 2004 the ACLU warned:

“…acting under the broad mandate of the ‘war’ on terrorism the U.S. security establishment is making a systematic effort to extend its surveillance capacity by pressing the private sector into service to report on the activities of Americans […] [with] vast computerized networks that automatically feed the government a steady stream of information about our activities.” ACLU Statement

Yale Law School professor Jack Balkin wrote in 2008 that massive data mining operations are nothing less than the government’s way of backdoor spying on Americans in what he called the “National Surveillance State.”

“The line between public and private modes of surveillance and security has blurred if not vanished. Public and private enterprises are thoroughly intertwined.” Jack M. Balkin Minnesota Law Review

It is important to note that Target is not just funding local law enforcement. According to Target it also partners with the FBI Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in addition to funding local county prosecutors paralegals probation officers and city attorneys. Target has extraordinary reach into local and federal government and law enforcement with the multinational corporation seeking to blur the lines.

In his book “Mindf*ck“ Christopher Wylie a former private sector counterintelligence operative and Cambridge Analytica data scientist turned whistleblower said the British company Strategic Communication Laboratories’ (SCL) business model was particularly for the purpose of taking “projects that governments couldn’t officially undertake themselves” due to legalities and sharing that info with its leaders. SCL was a psychological warfare company that peddled propaganda and swayed elections Wylie wrote.

Its subsidiary Cambridge Analytica (CA) the now-defunct data mining company that was instrumental in the election of former President Donald Trump and the subject of the film The Great Hack bragged about having 5000 data points on every American voter.

We asked a spokesperson from Target if the company ever did business with Cambridge Analytica and he responded that he personally didn’t know of any connection but would do some research and follow up. However his follow up did not include an answer to this particular question.

For decades Target has extracted massive amounts of information from its customers including biometric data before it got hacked by perpetrators whose identities are still unclear. In May 2017 Target agreed to pay $18.5 million to close investigations with state attorneys general over the massive security breach affecting up to 110 million customers but it was never mandated to explain why they ignored the hackers or identify specifics about customer data that was stolen.

Target having volumes of the public’s information considering their unprecedented partnership with government and police and its history of allowing 110 million of its customer’s data to get hacked should give everyone pause.

Unicorn Riot reached out to Target for answers around the questions of whether customer biometric data was leaked in 2013 and why Target stood back and allowed the hack to happen in the first place but a spokesperson just referred us to its website for all info related to the data breach.

In hindsight what is clear is the customer credit card numbers were not nearly as valuable as the aggregated data itself. According to one whistle blower featured in The Great Hack “Data surpassed oil in its value. Data is the most valuable asset on earth.” And according to a former Target executive who helped pioneer its counterintelligence operations “[Target’s] most important asset was data analytics on guests.“

No official reason was given to explain why Target as a corporation decided not to support the event which succeeded a similar one which had taken place there since 2008. Held instead at Walmart on Monday the 13th it would’ve been Sheriff Staly’s first time running the annual children’s gift program since he ended retired Sergeant Larry Jones’ event ‘Christmas with a Deputy’.

Both Jones’ previous event and Staly’s new one focus on bringing underprivileged youth to go Christmas shopping where their parents may not be able to do so for them. Last week’s Walmart shopping spree was still able to take 122 local kids shopping with around $16000 raised by donations from FCSO deputies and other community members.

Staly’s full letter to Target’s CEO reads as follows:

When Target Corporation directed the local Palm Coast Target to cancel the Flagler Sheriff’s Children’s Charities planned Shop with a Cop event the Grinch paid a visit. The Grinch then found a heart and joined FCSO and others in taking 125 kids on a free shopping spree to Walmart! (Paid for by donations from FCSO employees and the community.) Thank you Walmart for stepping-up and supporting Flagler Sheriff’s Children’s Charities Shop with a Cop event. See you next year! 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐟𝐟 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐲’𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭’𝐬 𝐂𝐄𝐎 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐰: Mr. Brian Cornell December 15 2021 Chairman & CEO Target Corporation 1000 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis MN 55403 Dear Chairman Cornell: Like many law enforcement agencies across the country the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office partnered with Target for over a decade to provide a “Shop with a Cop” holiday shopping spree for local children who might not otherwise have Santa visit their home. This year was to be the same. We worked with your local Palm Coast store selected a date and your employees were once again excited to participate. Then on October 6 2021 my staff received an email abruptly cancelling the partnership. We were told Target “retired” the “Heroes & Helpers” program and was “introducing a new give-back program to serve our communities anchored to our purpose of helping families discover the joy of everyday life. We’ll be expanding our impact and reach partnering directly with local nonprofits organizations across the country to provide families in need with essentials gifts and more.” When we informed Target staff that Flagler Sheriff’s Children’s Charities was a nonprofit 501(C)(3) the email was ignored and no response was received. A Google search quickly found many articles and carefully worded statements by Target’s Corporate public relations teams dating to 2020 in which Target denies it was “dropping its sponsorship of its annual holiday ‘Shop with a Cop’ event” (at least for 2020). When reviewing Target corporate policies under “Safety & Preparedness” we noted claims like: “We have thousands of public safety partnerships across the country.”

“Target is a committed partner… Providing more than ‘Corporate Lip Service’ and genuinely reach out and engage the public safety community.”

“Target is a shining example of public-private partnership.” Your recent actions demonstrate these statements are little more than corporate propaganda. As with any attempt to deceive or influence the public your statements provide the tiniest grain of truth in an attempt to paint a false narrative. So far in 2021 we have responded to 428 calls for service to the Palm Coast store. Further since I became Sheriff in 2017 we have handled more than 3870 calls for service to your Palm Coast store. In this aspect you have definitely “engaged the [local] public safety community.” However as to partnering with law enforcement it is evident your organization has elected to follow the pathway of political convenience. As the Target Corporation displayed “Grinch” like behavior in cancelling the partnership at the last minute we went to your competitor Walmart who welcomed us with open arms. On December 10 2021 we took over 125 culturally diverse children partnered with over 125 law enforcement corrections and professional support employees shopping. Starting with a party train rides face painting crafts games and much more they rode in patrol cars with lights flashing and sirens blaring to Walmart (ironically we drove by Target on our way to Walmart). I am very proud of our employees and their support for the nonprofit Flagler Sheriff’s Children’s Charities. Annually our employees donate over $30000.00 to support the two official charities of Flagler Sheriff’s Children’s Charities – Shop with a Cop and the Florida Sheriff’s Youth Ranches. For this event they donated almost $16000.00. Community supporters donated as well and together each child received $175.00 to buy presents for themselves their brothers sisters moms and dads. Many “chaperones” took money out of their own pockets when the children selected gifts totaling over the limit to bring a smile to a child’s face. After the shopping spree the children ate hamburgers and hot dogs and were then taken back home. For siblings who could not go shopping our team gave them bags full of donated toys so they did not feel left out and we made every effort to care for the entire family. This was a team effort a partnership between the law enforcement community and Walmart. This is community policing and building bridges with our future at its best! A concept you have apparently abandoned by cancelling your partnership with law enforcement for the holidays. In closing I want to make it very clear this is not about your local Palm Coast Target store employees. We enjoy a positive relationship with our local store which we will continue to build upon. Your employees were looking forward to this event before Corporate shut it down. Not only did the local Target employees enjoy seeing the big smiles on the children’s faces but they appreciated the thousands of dollars in sales this event brought to the store which helped meet their revenue and sales goals. I do not take issue with our local store rather it is your corporate decision to end a very successful partnership which I find to be ill-conceived and short sighted. The “Heroes & Helpers” program was a proven mechanism which built relationships with first responders the community and Target. It appears the Target Corporation has taken the path of political expediency throwing away an established relationship and a proven program for no gain. Please understand the purpose of this letter it is not seeking financial support or backing as you can see we take care of our own. Rather this letter is designed to highlight the hypocrisy and double-speak which your organization demonstrates. Caving into divisive rhetoric does not build a community but erodes its foundation. I support your right to end our partnership however it comes with a price; while I doubt it impacts your bottom line you have lost a customer in both my wife and I. Further I will educate my peers within the law enforcement community about your corporate action and decision. Finally I will take the opportunity to discuss Target’s position in every public forum with which I have a platform.

CJ CheilJedang said Sunday its launching a vegan brand called PlantTable due to a growing interest in vegetarian food here in Korea and around the world.



The food company said it will launch two types of vegan Bibigo Dumpling products in Singapore and Australia sometime this month. The dumplings use a meat replacement made out of soybeans known as textured vegetable protein explained a company official.



The products have already been available via e-commerce platforms since Friday here in Korea.



Along with its first-ever vegan dumplings CJ is also introducing vegan kimchi which does not use any jeotgal or salted seafood.



Saying the two products are just the “tip of the ice berg” CJ plans to expand its vegan product lineup next year with the goal to enter the United States Europe and halal markets.



“We are planning to expand our vegan product offerings on a full scale next year and launch vegan versions of home meal replacement products too” said a spokesperson for CJ CheilJedang.

Another food company eyeing the plant-based meat alternative market is Pulmuone. The food maker is using its expertise in tofu to develop various soy-based meat alternatives.



One example is an array of ready-made bulgogi products from Pulmuone which use soy-based textured vegetable protein. The products are receiving positive feedback from consumers since its launch in November the company said.



“The texture of the plant-based meat was very similar to real meat. almost like chewing actual pork. I think it’s useful for people who are trying to go vegetarian but still miss eating animal meat” said housewife Lee Kwang-sook living in Gyeonggi Province who recently tried Pulmuone’s plant-based meat product.



The tofu maker is also making inroads in the United States considered one of the most advanced and competitive markets for alternative meat products. There the likes of soy-egg from Just Egg and plant burger patties from Impossible Food are commonly eaten and used at restaurants across its 50 states.



Late this year Pulmuone’s US branch inked a deal to supply its alternative meat products to 200 locations of WaBa Grill a California-based stir-fry restaurant chain.



Some food companies have taken the vegan trend a step further and decided to open restaurants using only plant-based meat alternatives and vegan sauces.



Korean ramen and snack maker Nongshim said this month it will open a vegan restaurant inside the Lotte World Tower building in Jamsil southern Seoul in April next year.



It’s offerings such as the rigatoni ragu pasta and double cheese avocado burger will be made with plant-based meat and sauces from Nongshim’s vegan brand Veggie Garden it said.



“We are seeing more value-conscious customers paying interest to vegan food and its capability to reduce greenhouse gases. We believe consumer interest on vegan food will increase along with the expansion of vegan markets” said an official from Nongshim.

The market for plant meat replacements is at its beginning stage says industry officials. But the race to develop innovative vegan meat replacements that resembles the taste smell and texture of real meat is expected to heat up even more especially as more young Koreans accept veganism as a life style choice.



As of this year there is an estimated population of some 2.5 million vegans and vegetarians in Korea. This is a 66 percent increase from 2008 statistics from the Korean Vegan Union showed.



Such change in preference has motivated the government to up its investment in the research and development of alternative protein. More than 4.5 billion won ($3.79 million) has since been invested by the government into startups that develop alternative meat-like plant-based protein or lab-grown meat a four-fold increase from 2016.



The market for alternative meat is projected to expand as well. According to the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp. data the market is expected to reach 7 trillion won in 2023.



The Korea International Trade Association even predicts plant-based meat will surpass the market share of animal meat accounting for more than 60 percent of the global protein market by 2040.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2VuZXJneS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvcmVuZXdhYmxlL3VwLWxhZ2dpbmctYmVoaW5kLW90aGVyLXN0YXRlcy1pbi1kZWxpdmVyaW5nLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktdGFyZ2V0cy1yZXBvcnQvODgzNDY2NDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UP lagging behind other states in delivering renewable energy targets: Report ET EnergyWorld,"Advt

New Delhi: Uttar Pradesh has fallen behind other power-intensive states in terms of delivering on renewable capacity targets and it needs to take urgent action to get back on track and avoid slowing down India's decarbonisation journey says a report.A joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and energy think tank Ember also highlighted that the state is lagging behind in its 2022 solar capacity target of 10.7GW as compared to its peers.Urgent action is needed to get back on track not only for the state to meet its own targets but also to avoid slowing overall progress towards India's targets of 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2022 and 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 the report cautioned.As of October 2021 Uttar Pradesh had a total installed renewable capacity of 4.3GW which is only 30 per cent of its 2022 renewable capacity commissioning target of 14.1GW it stated.In comparison other states with high electricity demand are well ahead on their 2022 capacity commissioning targets. Gujarat and Rajasthan have achieved 85 per cent and 86 per cent respectively Tamil Nadu (72 per cent) Maharashtra (47 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (45 per cent).The report said Uttar Pradesh is lagging behind its peers on its 2022 solar capacity target of 10.7GW - the second largest solar target among all Indian states. Only about 2GW or 19 per cent of that target has been achieved it stated.""Uttar Pradesh has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to rolling out solar capacity to meet its targets"" says report co-author Aditya Lolla senior electricity policy analyst at Ember.Uttar Pradesh accounts for a tenth of India's power demand - the second largest share after Maharashtra. Over the past decade the state's electricity demand has increased by almost two-thirds and peak demand has more than doubled. And by 2030 electricity production is estimated to grow by 47 terawatt hours (TWh) it stated.""Until now Uttar Pradesh has met most of its strong demand growth with coal capacity expansion. Going forward solar can fulfil the vast majority of future electricity demand growth if the state achieves its 23.5GW by 2030 target"" says Lolla.""Hitting that target requires a major effort to ramp up solar capacity additions to around 2.5GW every year on an average.""Lolla and co-author Kashish Shah IEEFA energy finance analyst say Uttar Pradesh is now at a crossroads where the choices it makes about meeting future power demand growth could either speed up or slow down India's decarbonisation journey.Meeting its 2030 solar target will allow Uttar Pradesh to avoid locking in resources to build new coal plants beyond those already under construction said Shah.""Building new coal-fired power plants is becoming increasingly unviable"" he said.Capital for coal power projects is drying up. Apart from state-owned non-banking financiers - Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) - there is no investor willing to finance coal projects in India he noted.In addition coal power plant utilisation has been falling. The plant load factor of Uttar Pradesh's 23.7GW coal fleet has dropped from 68 per cent to 61 per cent in the last five years.""And heavy reliance on coal now leaves its power system vulnerable to any disruptions even those caused outside the state. Coal shortages in India in October 2021 forced the state to purchase very expensive power at Rs 22/kWh in the open market"" the report said.It highlights various barriers to solar uptake that need to be tackled urgently. These include the cancellation of renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) in recent years by state electricity distribution companies (discoms) and the discoms' increasingly high aggregate technical and commercial ( AT&C ) losses of above 30 per cent.Expensive and unreliable coal-fired generation has put tremendous pressure on the finances of discoms. In 2019-20 Uttar Pradesh discoms incurred a loss of Rs 4917 crore (USD 660 million) despite tariff subsidies of Rs 10120 crore (USD1.36 billion).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9uaHBjLXBsYW5zLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1wcm9qZWN0cy1vZi0yN2d3LWluLTktc3RhdGVzLW5lcGFsLWNtZC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODM2ODg2NC5jbXPSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMvbmhwYy1wbGFucy1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktcHJvamVjdHMtb2YtMjdndy1pbi05LXN0YXRlcy1uZXBhbC1jbWQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MzY4ODY0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NHPC plans clean energy projects of 27GW in 9 states Nepal: CMD,"

State-owned NHPC has plans to set up new hydro and solar projects of more than 27000 MW capacity in nine states and neighbouring country Nepal  the company's CMD Abhay Kumar Singh said.The new capacities would come up in Uttar Pradesh Bihar Odisha  Rajasthan Tamil Nadu Kerala Maharashtra  Andhra Pradesh and Odisha Singh told PTI in an interview.NHPC is in talks with some of these states which have shown interest in the projects. Others will also be engaged for the purpose the CMD said.Singh said that Nepal has also shown interest in hydro projects in joint venture with NHPC. Singh had met with the Nepal Prime Minister during his recent visit to that country.When asked about fund availability for the projects he said ""At present NHPC will not have a problem in making a capital expenditure of Rs 10000 crore. We are in profit of about Rs 3500 crore and it will increase further to Rs 5000 crore substantially helping us to increase our capex to Rs 13000 crore.""Speaking further he said there were certain NHPC projects especially in the Northeast which were stalled for long. Efforts have been taken to resume them.The 2000 MW Subansiri lower hydroelectric project in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh is progressing well. In Dibang also all hurdles have ended and the 2880-MW dam project will begin soon.NHPC is presently working on projects of total 6000 MW capacity and another 9000-10000 MW is in the pipeline Singh said.He said the company will meet its target of 50000 MW energy capacity which includes solar within time.""We have made a break up of the target by 2025 2030 2040 how much capacity we have to install and accordingly we will be meeting our targets. And we will reach our goal within time"" the CMD said.NHPC under the Ministry of Power  is the largest hydro power company in India."

The remarkable delivery reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer took place in September while Yiran Sherry 33 and her husband Keating Sherry 34 were taking their three-year-old son Rafa to pre-school.

Yiran Sherry’s waters broke while the family was stuck in traffic. With contractions increasing rapidly and traffic barely moving the couple realized they were not going to make it in time.

Keating Sherry placed the vehicle on autopilot after setting the navigation system to the hospital 20 minutes away in the western suburb of Paoli.

He said he laid one hand gently on the car’s steering wheel as he attended to his wife.

“She was squeezing my hand to the point where I thought she was going to shatter it” Keating Sherry told the Inquirer. “I was [saying] ‘Yiran OK focus on your breathing.’ That was advice to myself as well. My adrenaline was pumping.”

Yiran Sherry said the decision over whether to try to wait to give birth until they reached the hospital was an agonising one. However she said she kept glancing at their estimated arrival time and saw it was barely moving.

“Should I push or should I hold? Should I push or should I hold? Fuck it let’s do this” she recalled telling herself according to People magazine.

She gave birth to her daughter as they arrived at the hospital whispering: “Oh my God Keating. She’s out.”

Nurses cut the baby’s umbilical cord over the car’s front seat.

Keating Sherry said: “Once the pediatrician said ‘She’s healthy congratulations’ that was quite the sigh of relief.”

Once she was in hospital Yiran said nurses kept coming into her room to see the “Tesla baby”.

“[They would ask] ‘Are you the one who delivered the baby in the car?’” Yiran Sherry said.

The couple named their daughter Maeve Lily after briefly considering Tess in tribute to the car manufacturer.

“Thank you genius Tesla engineers for your brilliant design of autopilot” Keating Sherry said.

The baby’s delivery is a good news story for Tesla which has been plagued by bad publicity over safety concerns and workplace abuse.

This week a taxi company in Paris discontinued use of Tesla Model 3 cars after a fatal crash. Tesla previously faced a lawsuit in Florida over an accident involving the death of a teenager in a Model S in 2019.

Co-founded by the world’s richest man the PayPal and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk in October the company was ordered to pay $137m damages to a Black employee who was racially abused. Tesla also faces sexual assault allegations from numerous women.

But the idea is not to entertain us but it appears to be a bold expression of disappointment.

According to the video (English subtitles are available) after a period of a pleasant experience with the car multiple error codes appeared in the instrument cluster and a tow truck was required to get the car to a Tesla service center.

After a month the owner received info from Tesla that the car can't be fixed without replacing the battery pack which will cost €20000 ($22480). Let's recall that the car is some 8 years old so there is no warranty anymore.

We don't know the full story but there was a concern that it might not be the only thing to repair/replace so the cost could be even higher.

The unhappy owner has decided to blow up the car in a former quarry by using 30 kg of dynamite. The team has put inside also the doll of Tesla's CEO Elon Musk that was thrown out of a helicopter.

Insane Tesla Model S EXPLOSION!! 30kg of dynamite! (source: Pommijätkät)

Well barely a few parts were left from the car but at least the owner appears to be satisfied with the outcome even more so than from driving it. He noted that he is probably the first who exploded a Tesla.

Anyway regardless of the story the concerns about the EV maintenance cost after the warranty period are real. Especially in the case of the Tesla brand which tries to have a closed ecosystem so there are not that many opportunities for third-party services.

We already saw stories about high repair costs/battery replacement costs. It's interesting that Tesla-repair specialists like Rich Rebuilds multiple times reported difficulties and most recently converted a Tesla Model S to ICE instead (it was a fun project).

Aly Song/Reuters

Elon Musk spoke with Time Magazine on the ""business of risk"" in Tesla's autopilot technology.

Tesla is working on problems with its self-driving technology which has caused several accidents since 2018.

""Even if you save 90% of the lives the 10% that you don't save are going to sue you"" Musk told Time

Tesla may be paving the way for autonomous electric vehicles in the auto industry but that still comes with criticism over the technology's failures.

Elon Musk recently named Time Magazine's 2021 Person of the Year sat down with Time's editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal to talk about his work including increased scrutiny over accidents caused by the company's self-driving technology.

""There's something somebody said to me at the beginning of when we were pursuing autonomy: even if you save 90% of the lives the 10% that you don't save are going to sue you"" Musk told Time noting he's seen month-to-month improvement in Tesla self-driving capabilities.

He continued: ""I think it's one of those things where you're not going to get rewarded necessarily for the lives that you save but you will definitely be blamed for lives that you don't save.""

Musk's comments come as Tesla continues to face legal problems over its autonomous driving technology which has been linked to 12 accidents since 2018. Some Tesla drivers are suing over fatal crashes while others are seeking legal action against the company for allegedly misrepresenting and using deceptive marketing for its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving services.

In an interview this week with the Financial Times — which also selected Musk as its 2021 Person of the Year — Musk said he believes he hasn't misled or risked the safety of Tesla owners with self-driving technology.

""I don't think there's a CEO on this planet that cares more about safety than me"" Musk told the Financial Times.

According to Musk he vigorously pushed to develop Autopilot which he told Time can make driving more efficient and save millions of lives per year. When activated Tesla's self-driving technology is designed to monitor the surrounding environment keeping the car centered in its lane and a safe distance away from other cars.

It does not make the car drive itself according to the company and still requires the driver's full attention to avoid accidents.

In the second quarter of 2021 the company recorded one crash for every 4.41 million miles driven using Autopilot technology compared to one crash for every 1.2 million miles of a Tesla car driven without Autopilot according to Tesla's Vehicle Safety Report.

In August the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began investigating 765000 Tesla vehicles produced since 2014 after Full Self-Driving software caused 11 accidents involving first-responder vehicles killing one and injuring 17 others.

According to letters sent to Tesla in September the NHTSA asked for more information about its non-disclosure agreements with vehicle owners and asked Tesla to recall vehicles if a software update is required to fix a safety defect. Tesla updated Autopilot shortly after the investigation started in an attempt to address the issues.







Earlier this year the New York Times reported that Musk berated a Tesla manager who proposed implementing a system to monitor for Autopilot malfunctions during development of the program in 2015. The system would've included a computer chip and additional hardware as safeguards but Musk said it would slow the Autopilot's development progress according to the Times.

Tesla was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment from Insider."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhY2tzdGVyLmlvLzQ0MDE3My9tZTQ2MS1waW5nLXBvbmctYmFsbC1jaGFzaW5nLXJvYm90LTZmMDQ0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ME461: Ping Pong Ball Chasing Robot,"Overview

The ping pong ball chasing robot is our final project for Dan Block's ""Computer Control of Mechanical Systems"" course at the University of Illinois. In this project a base station with a camera locates ping pong balls and a robot car and instructs the robot car to ""kick"" the balls until all are outside of the boundary. The base station uses OpenCV's Python wrappers for ball detection and ArUco tag detection. The ArUco tags are used to define the origin and virtual boundary. An ArUco tag on the robot car allows the base station to calculate the position of the robot relative to the origin. The differential-steering robot car built over the semester in a series of labs features a Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D processor that controls two drive motors and an additional DC brush motor that drives the ball-kicking paddle. The TMS320F28379D runs a PI control loop to track a commanded forward and angular speed using motor encoder data for feedback. A Raspberry Pi 4 provides these desired speeds over UART along with a command to turn the paddle on or off.

Project Demonstration

MS320F28379D Launchpad

The Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D Launchpad Interfaces with the Raspberry Pi over a Serial UART Interface. The communication protocol consists of four states triggered by the Raspberry Pi: An echo state for debugging a ""send data"" state a ""receive data"" state and a paddle motor control state. In the receive state the Launchpad receives two floating point values desired forward and angular speed from the Raspberry Pi. In the send state the Launchpad sends estimated forward speed and angular velocity. In the paddle motor control state a GPIO output driving the gate of a transistor is set high or low depending on the received data.

Motor encoders are used to calculate the angular position of the two wheels using the enhanced quadrature encoder pulse (eQEP) peripheral. After converting from encoder pulses to linear distance the left and right wheel velocity is calculated using a discrete derivative. The forward velocity is taken as the average of the left and right speeds and the angular velocity is the difference between the left and right wheel velocities divided by the width of the robot. PI (proportional integral) control is used to track the desired forward and angular speed. Errors for the left and right velocity are calculated as a function of the desired speed the turn rate error and the estimated left and right speeds. The controller calculations are triggered by a timer interrupt every 4ms.

The code running on the Launchpad can be found in RED_BOARD/labstarter/final_project_main.c

Raspberry Pi

The bulk of the robot's control takes place on the Raspberry Pi Model 4. A control loop and a base station loop run simultaneously on the Pi using Python's threading module. The state of the robot the pose estimation and the desired pose are accessed and/or modified by both threads. Data locks are therefore used to prevent race conditions or bugs caused when two processes try to operate on the same data at the same time.

BaseStationThread

The base station thread initializes by connecting to a TCP server running on the base station PC. The initial state of the robot is calculated by averaging the robot's position data over several frames and the desired position accessed by the control thread is initialized to the position of the closest ball. The base station thread then continuously polls for the robot's position the position of the closest ball and the distance from the robot and the ball to the nearest boundary. If the nearest ball is outside the virtual boundary or the robot is more than a foot outside the virtual boundary then the robot's state is set to WAIT . In this state the robot is stationary and the paddle motor is off. In the other case the state is set to KICK . In the KICK state the control thread drives the robot to the nearest ball and triggers the paddle motor. Robot pose information from the base station is fused with estimated forward and angular speed from the Launchpad with a Kalman filter. The state of the robot is corrected every iteration of the base station loop. Finally the desired position is updated to the location of the closest ball. The base station loop runs with a period of 75ms limited by the base station's frame rate. Deterministic timing is difficult without a real-time OS or timer interrupts but software timers allowed us to account for the time taken to run the loop and get timing that was plenty accurate.

Control Thread

The control thread first initializes the serial communication between the Pi and the Launchpad. The control loop then runs continuously with a period of 5ms. the robot's position is estimated each iteration of the control loop. Forward and angular velocities are read from the LaunchPad and numerically integrated to calculate the predicted pose. Because these estimates are prone to drift they are periodically corrected with more accurate but less responsive base station data using a Kalman filter. Then the control loop checks the state of the robot which is set in the base station loop. In the WAIT state a desired forward and angular speed of 0 is sent to the Launchpad along with the command to turn the paddle motor off. In the KICK state the desired forward and angular speeds are determined by the position controller. The position controller takes the current position and desired position as inputs. The desired heading is then calculated with atan2  and the error between the current heading and desired heading is calculated so that the robot turns clockwise or counterclockwise depending on which angle is smaller. The desired angular speed is then a constant gain multiplied by the error. The desired forward speed is the product of a constant gain the norm of the distance between current and desired positions and a windowing function that prevents the robot from moving forward until it's pointed in the right direction. Finally the desired forward and angular speeds are saturated to some maximum value. After sending desired velocity commands to the Launchpad the control loop determines the state of the paddle motor. If the robot is within a foot of the ball or the estimated time to reach the ball is less than two seconds the paddle motor is turned on. The paddle motor is turned off if these conditions are not met.

The code running on the Raspberry Pi is found in RASPI/main.pyRASPI/PiThreads.py  RASPI/RobotControl.py  and RASPI/SerialCommuncation.py

Base Station

The purpose of the base station was to determine the pose of the robot in a global coordinate system find the position of the balls near the robot and host a TCP server from which the robot could request this data from. The base station program was run on a PC with one thread hosting the TCP server while the main thread determined the robot pose and ball position using a Logitech C920X Pro webcam and OpenCV. The pose was calculated for every frame of the video and then updated on the TCP server.

Base-Station Visualization. Marker are labeled in white with their coordinates (X Y theta) given in feet and radians. Circles are drawn around the tracked balls and are labeled with their coordinates [X Y]. The green label indicates the target ball while cyan and red represent balls inside and outside the boundary marked by the red polygon respectively.

Marker Tracking and Robot Pose Estimation

To track the robot's position and establish a global coordinate system fiducial markers were tracked using OpenCV with the ArUco module which provides functions to generate track and estimate the pose of ArUco fiducial markers.

To estimate the pose of the markers first the corners of each marker are found. Using the corners and the side length of the markers the pose of the camera relative to each marker can be determined in terms of rotation and translation vectors. Further information regarding marker detection and pose estimation can be found here.

To accurately estimate the pose of the markers the intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients of the camera need to be accounted for. These parameters were determined by performing a camera calibration. Following this tutorial the camera was calibrated using a ChArUco board which combines the typical chessboard pattern used for camera calibration with ArUco markers. This allows for the calibration board to be occluded or partially visible in the images used for calibration making the process easier. The code used for camera calibration can be found in BASE_STATION/cameraCalibration.py .

To establish a world coordinate system four markers are placed on the floor with the bottom left marker being defined as the origin. Next the rotation vectors of the camera with respect to the origin are converted to a rotation matrix using cv.Rodrigues() . Multiplying the inverted rotation matrix by the translation vectors for all markers yields the position of each marker with respect to the origin. The orientation of the markers in the plane of the global coordinate system is obtained by first converting the rotation vectors for each marker to rotation matrices using cv.Rodrigues()  then extracting the Euler angles from each rotation matrix using cv.RQDecomp3x3() . This results in pose of any marker in the global coordinate system. Further information regarding the coordinate transformations can be found here.

With the pose of the four markers on the floor in the global coordinate system and their location and pixel coordinates a perspective transformation matrix can be found using cv.findHomography()  which maps pixel coordinates to global coordinates. This assumes that all pixel coordinates are on the plane established by the four markers (i.e. the floor). Hence it does not account for height above the plane.

Ball Detection

To detect the balls from the video frame a binary mask was created by finding the parts of the frame that were in a certain range of HSV values. This isolates only the part of the image that falls within that range thus isolating the balls in the frame. Since the HSV ranges for each color of ball were different four binary masks were created offline corresponding to the four colors of balls (blue orange pink and green). Next the closed contours in the binary mask were found and then filtered by area to filter out other objects that may have been in the HSV range but were too large or small to be balls. The pixel coordinates of the ball were determined by finding the center of the minimum enclosing circle of the contour. Since the balls are relatively close to the floor their coordinates can be converted to global coordinates using the perspective transformation matrix and cv.perspectiveTransform() with minimal error.

The logic for determining which ball to target is as follows: 1) Find the first ball inside the boundary (set by the markers forming the world coordinate system) and set that as the target 2) If the distance to one of the other balls is less than the distance to the current target minus 1 foot make that the new target 3) Once all balls have been compared store the position of the target ball on the TCP server for the robot to access. Targeting was done in this manner to mitigate the robot switching between two balls that were roughly the same distance from the robot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3N0YXJsaW5rLXByZS1vcmRlci1kZWxpdmVyeS10aW1lcy1jYW4tc2hvcnRlbi1zdWdnZXN0cy1yZXNlYXJjaC1maXJtLWFzLWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtZWFzZXMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vc3RhcmxpbmstcHJlLW9yZGVyLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRpbWVzLWNhbi1zaG9ydGVuLXN1Z2dlc3RzLXJlc2VhcmNoLWZpcm0tYXMtY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1lYXNlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starlink Pre-order Delivery Times Can Shorten Suggests Research Firm As Chip Shortage Eases,"This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Space exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) Starlink satellite internet constellation which is currently facing a pre order backlog partly caused by a semiconductor shortage might see an improvement in the future if a report from a research firm Jefferies is accurate. In a report released yesterday Jefferies outlines that the shortage which has also affected other industries such as consumer electronics and automobiles is starting to ease but it remains cautious believing that the situation might not normalize under 2023.

Starlink Processor Supplier Sees Chip Delays Subside But Overall Semiconductor Shortage Expected To Last Until 2022

The shortage combined with an overwhelming demand for its service has seen Starlink struggle to meet customer pre orders for its equipment. These preorders require the company to ship a user terminal (dish) a WiFi router and other accessories to customers so that they can connect with the orbiting satellites and access the Internet.

It has seen Starlink push countless deliveries to next year after promising customers that it would start shipping their gear by the end of this year. In a new note research firm Jefferies believes that the semiconductor shortage is starting to ease out. The firm bases its conclusions on data from an American distributor and a British retailer. It outlines that microcontroller supplies have stabilized and pricing and lead times are in the ""stable-to-higher"" category.

Starlink's user terminal which allows users to connect to the network uses a central processing unit (CPU) designed by STMicroelectronics with British design house Arm Ltd's processor layout. It uses four of Arm's Cortex A53 CPU cores which are developed with power efficiency in mind.

Jefferies mentioned STM in its research note sourced by Seeking Alpha. In it the firm outlines that delays for products from STMicro and Texas Instruments have subsided but companies are facing great demand for power management circuits.

Seeking Alpha explains the (paywalled) comments as:

Shortages relating to STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) were viewed as ""pain points"" earlier this year but those delays have subsided though broad-based demand for power management integrated circuits continues. Additionally Analog Devices (ADI) and Infineon could start to see shortages while supplies from Xilinx (XLNX) ""remains in very short supply.""

The firm also comments on the overall semiconductor industry as it believes that high backlogs will last throughout 2022 which will also result in higher prices and backlogs for the chip firms.

Starlink's user terminal also uses memory modules from Kingston and both NAND and DRAM memory prices are expected to drop in the first quarter of next year according to research firm TrendForce.The lack of a teardown of the terminal prevents accurate insight into its component suppliers' supply constraints.

The shortage has also seen SpaceX introduce a new user terminal and router to customers highlighting that the upgraded equipment has shorter production times. While the pre order backlog stands at more than 750000 orders received according to the latest information Starlink plans to scale up operations in the future aggressively.

At this front it has already requested the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to deploy up to five million terminals in the U.S. alongside revealing plans to manufacture ""millions"" of terminals in a new factory in Texas. Starlink is also currently fighting to convince the FCC to open its plans to launch the internet satellites with SpaceX's Starship next generation launch vehicle platform which is currently awaiting its first orbital launch in Boca Chica Texas. Starship will enable Starlink to rapidly deploy a large number of satellites for what is planned to be a 42000 satellite constellation.",,,,,,,,,

The Army's Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) is a fifteen-ton tracked heavily armed drone being prepared for future warfare. The Army is currently evaluating its performance in conjunction with a variety of technologies including 30mm Chain Guns high-fidelity sensors attack drones anti-tank missiles smoke obscurants and electronic warfare.

Attack possibilities and new tactical applications are greatly multiplied by using an unmanned vehicle which can integrate many heavy armor technologies into a lighter weight high-speed deployable system.

“When you design just to be remote you can accomplish many of the things of a larger vehicle and a much smaller package because obviously you don't have to package people and then you don't have to package protection. And so it's likely that we'll see the kinds of capabilities that historically would track to a larger platform in smaller and lighter platforms” Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman Director of the Next-Generation Combat Systems Cross-Functional Team at Army Futures Command told the National Interest in an interview.

Coffman explained the service is now refining requirements and testing prototype RCV-Ms and plans another intense set of evaluations at Fort Hood Texas next year. Some of the Army’s industry partners include Textron Systems QinetiQ and General Dynamics Land Systems.

“We're gonna do company-level operations in Texas using offensive and defensive scenarios to really hone the requirements in the lessons of some of the things on future battlefields” Coffman said.

Without needing to operate with heavy armor to protect a crew a robotic armed vehicle can integrate a wide sphere of technologies to include advanced computing electronics multi-domain command and control equipment and a wide range of weapons.

“RCVs are payload agnostic. We can have counter-drone we can have smoke sensors and lethality. We can have anything that you can imagine on the battlefield on a robot. That is exciting stuff” Coffman said.

RCVs can operate as expeditionary forward attack platforms to test or breach enemy mechanized forces conduct high risk surveillance missions under enemy fire or network with aircraft or aerial drones to integrate ground-air operations.

Some may fire 30mm or 50mm cannons javelin anti-tank weapons or find targets for overhead precision air attack. As new technologies are tested the Army anticipates it will continue to refine concepts of operation. As various innovations are introduced the Army will make assessments and evaluate what Coffman described ast “trade spaces” with which to evaluate options for the vehicles.

“These cannons (30mm and 50mm) are providing trade spaces for Army senior leaders to make decisions that will absolutely change the geometry and the lethality of future vehicles” he added.

There are no numbers on Long Island chicken owners but local poultry retailers reported record sales in recent years with thousands of people now belonging to online Long Island chicken groups. But the idyllic vision of keeping a backyard homestead sometimes does not mirror the reality of densely populated Long Island life — especially when neighbors or owners begin squawking.

Novice chicken keepers sometimes don’t realize they have males in their flock — which are noisier and often more aggressive than their female counterparts — until the birds start crowing at several months old.

Joanne Kenwood adopted what she thought were three hen chicks from an upstate farm in October 2020 and was looking forward to raising them on her Miller Place property. But six months later she heard the first dreaded cock-a-doodle-doo. She rehomed the bird only to hear a second crow a week later. Kenwood adopted two replacement birds from a local farm and with another stroke of bad luck realized she had brought home rooster number three.

""It [the crowing] was ridiculously loud and super early in the morning; at 4 a.m. it started"" said Kenwood who retired from her job at a home construction firm last year. ""Yeah that’s not going to work for me.""

Gender miscues with roos

Many municipalities have some restrictions on backyard poultry raising but Brookhaven and Huntington are the only Long Island towns to explicitly ban roosters. Kenwood said she understands why Brookhaven does not allow roosters and said she would have opted to rehome the birds even if it did.

Still chicken enthusiasts in every town often find their new dawn wake-up call is just not compatible with suburban life. The roosters then need to find a new place to roost which means rehoming or worse abandonment.

Frankie Floridia president of the Port Jefferson Station-based rescue group Strong Island Animal Rescue League said it took a month to find proper homes for four roosters that were dumped at Heritage Park in Mount Sinai in August 2020. He questioned why any retail operation in a place like Brookhaven would be allowed to sell roosters. Stores sometimes sell birds as ""straight run"" meaning the sex has not been identified.

""It’s totally unfair that these places are allowed to sell these chicks not knowing whether they’re male or female to a place where they’re going to have a death sentence"" Floridia said.

Finding places on Long Island willing to accept roosters can be difficult and local Facebook groups are filled with posts from people looking to rehome unwanted males. One group with more than 1000 members is solely dedicated to that purpose.

A Long Island man dumped five roosters Dec. 13 at the nonprofit Animal Nation in Westchester County’s South Salem — and it was the fourth time he had done so in the past few years according to the group’s president Patrick Moore. The organization fields calls every day from people in New York City New Jersey on Long Island and beyond looking to home a rooster Moore said. The demand is so high that he said people will lob birds over the organization’s fence when they have been told there is no room.

""The roosters that are being tossed over the fence we just don’t have enough pens for"" Moore said. ""We had to invest in making a bachelor pad for our boys.""

Crowing about chicken sales

Interest in chicken keeping is stronger than ever.

Tractor Supply Co. a national chain that sells chicks chicken-raising equipment and hobby farm supplies and has stores in Medford and Calverton reported double-digit sales growth in every quarter since the pandemic began in March 2020. Representatives of Long Island Poultry a poultry seller in Calverton estimate the business grew tenfold in that time.

Animal advocates cited several factors why poultry owners may find themselves with a surprise rooster. The bird may be born out of a home or school hatching project of which 50% will likely be male. They might be sent as an extra bird through a mail order hatchery to keep the rest of the brood warm — ""bubble wrap for the other birds"" said Moore of Animal Nation. Or as in Kenwood’s case their sex is incorrectly identified at birth and they are then purchased by chicken keepers who think they are getting hens.

Those who successfully adopt hen chicks might not realize what happens to their male counterparts.

Each year in the United States 300 million male chicks are killed shortly after they are hatched usually by gassing grinding or suffocation according to The Humane League a Rockville Maryland-based nonprofit that lobbies corporations on behalf of animals. United Egg Producers an industry group in 2016 committed to ending the practice and said this year it will do so when a method to identify sex before the eggs hatch is scalable.

John Di Leonardo president of the nonprofit advocacy and rescue operation Long Island Orchestrating for Nature (LION) said the number of fowl rescues the organization responded to rose from about 1000 in 2019 to 1200 in 2020. The number stayed steady only because the Riverhead-based volunteer group has reached its capacity. His rescue work with LION became so demanding that Di Leonardo said he quit his longtime job with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in July.

‘Adopt don’t shop’

Di Leonardo said relaxing rooster regulations in dense towns is not the answer. Instead he recommends people who have the space and means to start ""bachelor flocks"" for roosters or ""drake squads"" of male ducks. The male birds seemingly do well when there are no females around to compete for their attention.

""If you remove the girls from the equation boys often get along very well"" Di Leonardo said. ""They’re usually just trying to show off for the ladies just like us humans.""

Of course raising all males means going without the spoils of backyard chicken keeping. Di Leonardo a vegan said people should take in chickens for the pleasure of fowl keeping rather than to generate eggs.

""I think [the adage] ‘adopt don’t shop’ applies to every species of animal"" he said. ""It really hasn’t caught up in the fowl keepers world.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnRzLzIwMjEtMTItMTgtb25lZmFybS1zaGFyZS1tYWtpbmctYW4taW1wYWN0LWZyb20tZmFybS10by1mb3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OneFarm Share: Making an impact from farm to fork – The Mail & Guardian,"Market conditions created as a consequence of early lockdown measures in 2020 were the catalyst for the development of Standard Bank’s OneFarm Share. Instantly diminished demand and a consequent over-supply of fresh produce presented a very real challenge for the country’s farmers. Simultaneously food security concerns driven by economic hardship and uncertainty continued to grow. While born out of the crisis and the need to match excess supply to people most in need OneFarm Share continues to demonstrate its ability to evolve and play a valuable role in addressing larger systemic challenges in the agri-food value chain.

OneFarm Share is a platform facilitated through a partnership between HelloChoice and Standard Bank and at its core acts as a digital match-maker for food requests from registered charitable organisations and available fresh produce. The early success of the project pilot led to OneFarm Share becoming a formalised product within Standard Bank’s OneFarm offering. As the platform evolves it has become clear that there is opportunity to uplift emerging farmers and offer CSI-as-a-service to corporate South Africa.



As a result of the great community work by Standard Bank and HelloChoice OneFarm Share recently took first place at the 2021 EFMA Accenture Banking in Innovation Awards in the Social Sustainable & Responsible Category; a global recognition that all the platform stakeholders and partners are incredibly proud of.

Making a difference across the agri-food value chain

Since its official launch in February 2021 OneFarm Share has distributed over 5 000 tonnes of fresh produce resulting in an incredible 20-million meals being created. This has fed over one million beneficiaries across South Africa. In 2022 the aspiration is to double this volume: distributing 10 000 tonnes of fresh produce. There are now 108 contributors on the platform comprising 57 emerging farmers (of which 19 are female) 44 commercial farmers and seven food producers.

The platform’s beneficiaries continue to benefit from a reliable supply of fresh nutritious South African-grown produce. Larger-scale commercial farmers with produce that is not-to-spec or excess to offtake contracts are provided with an opportunity to donate or sell (at a reduced price); this significantly reduces food waste and has a positive impact on the environment. Logistics coordination often sees the use of empty return loads to collect produce directly from the farmers and thereby reducing the total cost of food distribution.

Corporate South Africa can utilise OneFarm Share’s CSI-as-a-service; with the platform providing a conduit for those wanting to donate to food relief through a transparent and auditable channel as well as being able to support enterprise development supplier development and a range of additional key CSI focus areas. For emerging farmers OneFarm Share has created a reliable route-to-market ensured guaranteed buyers and assisted in securing fair market-price for their produce.

Supporting women emerging farmers

As a business Standard Bank has set out to make a meaningful and valuable impact beyond traditional banking. With agriculture selected as a priority sector OneFarm Share has an invaluable role to play in realising this objective. As such a key focus area for the platform is empowering female emerging farmers.



Women play a central role in the agricultural sector of South Africa making up a significant majority of the workforce. Despite their primary role they face numerous daily challenges that inhibit their potential for success. This ultimately prevents their ability to economically benefit from their farming activities. Changing the dynamic for women farmers can have a very meaningful impact on the individual their families those they employ/work with and ultimately the country as a whole. A few of the female farmer stories from OneFarm Share include:

Maureen KZN

Maureen Magubane a farmer based in Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal heads up an incredible co-op farm comprising over 20 women farmers. Each woman farms their own smallholding with Maureen running a 130 hectare farm focusing on maize. They then market their produce as a collective. The co-op supplies samp dry beans cabbages beetroot and spinach. Through OneFarm Share and HelloChoice Maureen’s produce was matched with demand enabling her to sell the produce more consistently. It has also given her and the other women farmers in her co-op the confidence to plan and grow according to consistent demand.

Lucy KZN

Lucy Nxusa is a farmer based in Wartburg who grows amadumbi sweet potatoes and green mielies. She faced challenges caused by the imbalance in the power dynamic between herself and buyers and was being haggled on pricing and payment terms. With access to a HelloChoice representative to provide a balanced view she was able to effectively market her produce and secure her requested farm-gate price. In addition she received same-day payments for the sale of her produce (instead of her usual 2+ week delay experienced in the open market). This season OneFarm Share helped her sell 75% of her produce through the platform and helped her gain access to new buyers.

Siphiwe Gauteng



Siphiwe Sithole is another incredible networker with a farm based in Gauteng. She brings together other small-scale farmers from across the province to fulfil requests for produce via OneFarm Share. To date her farm has donated some produce and supplied an impressive 21 706kg of produce. She grows indigenous vegetables and deals with popular produce such as potatoes beetroot cabbage and carrots. She is actively recruiting additional farmers to join her efforts as the cause is close to her heart and personal values. She is now able to mentor other farmers on the platform because of her experience providing a valuable resource to those who want to upskill themselves and improve their farms.

uMsinga Farmers KZN

uMsinga is a remote under-serviced area located along the banks of the Tugela River in rural KwaZulu-Natal. As part of the Tugela Ferry scheme around 1 500 small-scale farmers — primarily women — work the land manually growing crops such as maize cabbage potatoes tomatoes onions beans beetroot spinach and butternut. Lacking access to transport these women farmers usually hawk as much of their produce as they can carry to the roadside many kilometres from their small subsistence plots.

During this year’s potato season OneFarm Share worked together with LIMA (a rural development foundation) to reach these emerging female farmers. A market-related price was secured for the potatoes and the much-needed transportation was provided to collect the produce directly from their fields.

Pallets were provided and assistance was given with standardising their packaging. It was found that in some instances bags were overpacked by up to 2kg presenting a significant profit loss for these farmers. Through this effort the uMsinga female farmers earned a consistent income and gained invaluable commercial market experience.

The journey from Farm to Fork

In celebration of the success to date and the continued evolution of the OneFarm Share platform we have detailed the Farm to Fork journey. “We are incredibly proud of the work being done through OneFarm Share. It is testament to the power of collaboration and the utilisation of innovative technology as a means to solve real-world problems while making a meaningful impact” says Lungisa Fuzile Standard Bank South Africa Chief Executive.

Last Updated 2 years ago

The leading biometrics company CLEAR and popular transportation app Uber has formed a partnership that looks to make getting to the airport on time for a flight a stress free experience for travelers in the US. With travel being a stressful experience at the best of times – let alone during a global pandemic where rules and regulations change almost daily – the partnership will help eliminate some of those stresses and ensure travelers don't have to worry about being late for flights.

The new feature has been launched just in time for the holiday travel period during which millions of Americans are expected to travel domestically – despite the growing threat of the Omicron variant. Here's everything you need to know about the partnership between the two companies and why it will help to make travel a walk in the park for millions of Americans.

New Airport Transfer Solution – What Travelers Should Know

When it comes to traveling to an airport there are several reasons why using taxis is so popular amongst Americans. From not having to worry about the drive to avoiding those pricey airport long term parking fees millions of Americans each year choose to start their trips with a taxi journey. Prior to the pandemic 22% of Uber users said that they used the platform most often for trips to the airport – and with the new partnership between CLEAR and Uber that figure could be set to rise.

The new partnership between the two companies will see Uber's travel platform integrated with CLEAR's “Home to Gate” feature. By combining the two travelers will be able to find out exactly when they should leave for their flight and it will give them the ability to reserve an Uber ride ahead of their departure date – creating a travel experience that is much more streamlined easier and worry-free for travelers.

The “Home To Gate” feature assesses a number of factors such as traffic levels security screening time and distance needed to walk through the airport to provide travelers an extremely accurate time that they should leave in order to arrive at their gate on time for their flight. By adding the ability to book an Uber ahead of time the stresses of working out when to book a taxi for are taken out of the traveler's hands – leaving them free to only worry about what they should pack.

A free feature of the CLEAR app here's how travelers can use it:

Open the free CLEAR App and tap the “Home to Gate” tile

Share location and flight details and – using data driven insights – Home To Gate will tell the traveler the best time to leave for their flight

Tap the “Get A Ride With Uber ” button and the Uber app will have a ride reservation ready to go with all the trip details

Speaking about the new partnership Uber's Head of Mobility in the US & Canada Dennis Cinelli said:

“We're thrilled to partner with CLEAR to alleviate some of the holiday travel stress. As we look to a busy holiday season we're focused on getting travelers where they need to go as quickly and easily as possible. Our integration with CLEAR will take the guesswork out of travel and give users peace of mind knowing they'll get to the airport on time.”

This isn't the first time that companies have sought to enhance journeys to the airport during the pandemic. Back in February United Airlines made a significant $1B investment in a company that was developing electric-powered VTOL aircraft that would be used to ferry passengers to their airport. However with production of the aircraft not expected until 2023 travelers will have to make do Uber for their airport transport means for the time being.

Turkish civil aviation which has overcome the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has started to gain momentum again in terms of flight frequency and passenger density.

There was a significant increase in passenger and flight statistics at Istanbul Airport – the city’s mega airport on the European side – as well as Sabiha Gökçen Airport on the Anatolian side and Atatürk Airport which closed to passenger traffic in 2021 compared to the previous year.

A total of 33.261 million passengers flew from Istanbul Airport in January-November according to the data of the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (DHMI). Of the passengers passing through the airport 9.635 million preferred domestic destinations and 23.626 million flew onward to points abroad.

Sabiha Gökçen Airport meanwhile hosted 14.986 million domestic and 7.772 million international passengers in the first 11 months of the year the data showed.

Atatürk Airport started to host only private and cargo flights after the services at the airport moved to the Istanbul Airport back in April 2019.

A total of 56.20 million passengers – 24.621 million on domestic flights and 31.398 million on international flights – passed through Istanbul's airports.

In the same period of last year the number of passengers hosted at Istanbul airports was recorded as 37.511 million.

A total of 251647 flights were made at Istanbul Airport between January and November of this year. Of those flights 72813 were domestic and 178834 were international.

Likewise Sabiha Gökçen Airport handled 103516 domestic flights and 61743 international flights.

In the first 11 months of this year 37780 flights were carried out from Atatürk Airport.

A survey of 2000 Americans asked respondents what aspects of travel are currently the most important to them with safety topping the list at 71 percent.

Sustainability also ranked in the top five with over half the poll (57%) saying it’s also an important factor when they’re planning a trip.

However results found safe travel habits can overlap with unsustainable behaviors posing the question: can travelers actually achieve those two objectives at the same time? Of the 58 percent who have traveled since the pandemic began 70 percent admit they didn’t consider their carbon impact while on the road.

For those Americans many noted an increased reliance on single-use plastics and using more disposable masks (68%) followed by using more disposable gloves (58%) hand sanitizer (51%) and other cleaners (31%).

Environmentally friendly travel

Commissioned by Cool Effect and conducted by OnePoll the survey dug into how the pandemic may be changing travel moving forward – revealing some good news for Mother Nature.

While prioritizing environmentally friendly behaviors may seem more difficult these days nearly 70 percent say the pandemic is making them more aware of how to travel sustainably. Another two in three people plan to use this knowledge to be more sustainable travelers in the future.

Some of their steps will be to take more sustainable modes of transportation (52%) travel to destinations with a reputation for their environmental consciousness and low carbon footprint (50%) eat or shop locally and use an eco-friendly booking site for accommodations (31%).

Workplaces going green

Companies are also taking action to save the planet. In fact 36 percent of respondents report that their workplace is taking steps to actively reduce travel in its operations. Of those 75 percent say their job requires fewer people to travel for in-person meetings.

Additionally 71 percent note their employers have purchased carbon offsets and 54 percent report that their organizations only fly with specific airlines.

“Travel can have a large carbon footprint but simple steps like packing lighter reducing waste choosing direct flights and choosing airlines that use biofuels can significantly lessen that impact” says Jodi Manning Cool Effect’s VP director of marketing and partnerships in a statement. “The last two years have shown us that virtual options can work. However some travel is still necessary. Being aware of your emissions and actively taking steps to reduce them is what we call traveling better.”

4 in 5 people consider themselves eco-friendly

When looking more broadly at climate change awareness and perceptions the survey finds 78 percent consider themselves an environmentally friendly person. That compares to 71 percent in a similar survey run by Cool Effect and OnePoll last year. In this year’s survey 75 percent say climate change is a daily concern in their life on par with last year’s results (74%).

There has been a slight increase (68%) in the number of people this year who feel knowledgeable about the actions they can take to help fight climate change (versus 63% last year). There still appears to be a gap when it comes to carbon offsets specifically. Of respondents who would not buy a carbon offset (or would not buy one again) they were unsure where the money would go (29%) while others didn’t know how purchasing an offset would help (27%) or were unsure exactly what it was (25%).

However 74 percent believe carbon emissions are important in affecting climate change. While there are still barriers for purchasing offsets over half the poll (58%) are familiar with carbon offsetting (versus 45% last year).

The results also show an increase in the number of respondents who have purchased an offset. In 2021 57 percent of respondents said they have previously purchased a carbon offset compared to 44 percent in last year’s survey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZmEuZ28uanAvcG9saWN5L290aGVyL2JsdWVib29rLzIwMjEvZW5faHRtbC9jaGFwdGVyNS9jMDUwMzAyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diplomatic Bluebook ｜ 2 Strengthening the Foreign Policy Implementation Structure,"2 Strengthening the Foreign Policy Implementation Structure

The security environment surrounding Japan has become even more severe and changes in the power balance of the international community accelerate and become more complex. Amid such a situation and also amid the spread of COVID-19 MOFA must enhance its foreign policy implementation structure while looking ahead to the post-COVID-19 world in order to pursue flexible diplomacy and promote diplomacy that ensures the safety and security of Japanese nationals. To that end MOFA is strengthening both the quantity and quality of its diplomatic missions overseas and reinforcing the organizational and personnel structures at its headquarters.

Diplomatic missions overseas such as embassies and consulates-general not only represent Japan and promote diplomatic agenda but also play a key role in areas such as information-gathering and strategic communication at the frontline of diplomacy. At the same time overseas missions also carry out operations directly related to enhancing the interests of Japanese nationals such as protecting their lives and safety providing support for Japanese companies promoting investment and tourism and securing energy and other resources.

In January 2021 Japan established a new embassy in Haiti and a new consulate-general in Cebu in the Philippines. As a result the number of diplomatic missions overseas as of FY2020 is 229 (153 embassies 66 consulates general and 10 permanent missions).

While Haiti has the largest population in the Caribbean Community it is also the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean and interest from the international community over the country remains high amidst its frequently-occurring natural disasters. Haiti is also traditionally one of the friendliest countries to Japan that has supported many of Japan's positions in the international arena. Cebu is the second-largest metropolitan area in the Philippines after Manilla. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of Japanese companies and travelers such as tourists and language students in Cebu and the Visayas region at large. By establishing the embassy in Haiti and consulate-general in Cebu Japan will not only build a higher level of bilateral relations with the both countries it will also strengthen its capacity to protect Japanese nationals support Japanese companies and cooperate in the international arena.

In FY2021 Japan will establish a new consulate-general in Da Nang in Viet Nam. Da Nang is achieving remarkable economic growth and the numbers of Japanese companies in operation and Japanese nationals living there are both increasing. Additionally Da Nang occupies an important position on the security front facing the South China Sea. Since it is situated at the starting point of the East-West Economic Corridor Da Nang is recognized as one of important strategic locations toward promoting “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP). It is essential for Japan to deepen its relations with the Da Nang region in a multi-layered manner by establishing a basis for information gathering on security and economic affairs in the area.

In addition to establishing more diplomatic missions overseas it is important to secure and increase the number of staff members to support diplomacy at the MOFA headquarters and diplomatic missions overseas. In the context of the Government's policy to reduce the overall personnel expenses due to the current severe budget situation the number of staff members at MOFA was increased to 6358 (6288 in 2019) in order to advance Japan's “Proactive Contribution to Peace” policy implement protection and safety measures for Japanese nationals abroad strengthen information-gathering and analysis capabilities further vitalize the Japanese economy including the promotion of infrastructure exports advance strategic communications and address bilateral relations and regional situations. The number of staff members however remains insufficient in comparison with other major countries. MOFA continues its efforts to build a structure that is commensurate with Japan's national power and diplomatic policy. In the meantime based on the belief that enhancing the foreign policy implementation structure remains essential in FY2021 MOFA will increase its workforce by 72 staff.

Furthermore MOFA appropriated a budget of 712.0 billion yen in the budget for FY2020 (an increase of 18.6 billion yen from FY2019) in order to realize FOIP and fortify the structure for strengthening the international order based on the rule of law. As for MOFA's FY2020 supplementary budgets it appropriated a budget of 102.8 billion yen in the first supplementary budget 2.1 billion yen in the second supplementary budget and 134.9 billion yen in the third supplementary budget. The funding appropriated in the first supplementary budget was chiefly for supporting the halting and prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in developing countries in Asia Oceania the Middle East Africa Central and South America and other regions in order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and for supporting Japanese companies overseas. Similarly in the third supplementary budget MOFA appropriated funding for halting the global spread of COVID-19 and supporting people being affected by the impact of that.

MOFA's FY2021 initial government budget proposal appropriated 709.7 billion yen (of which a digital-related budget of 13.8 billion yen is appropriated under the Cabinet Secretariat budget) based on the following priorities: (1) overcoming COVID-19 which poses a threat to human security while also moving forward with initiatives that look ahead to the post-COVID-19 world; (2) promoting “diplomacy with a sense of caring” in order to preserve the safety of Japan and its nationals; and (3) promoting “diplomacy with robustness” in order to further advance collaboration and cooperation with the international community. Within that in order to bolster support for developing countries in the healthcare and medical fields the budget for providing assistance bilaterally and through international organizations has been enhanced. Additionally partly based on experiences under the spread of COVID-19 the budget for evacuating Japanese nationals in emergency situations the budget for charter flights for the Foreign Minister and related budgets have been enhanced and appropriated as budgets deemed necessary for bolstering the protection of Japanese nationals overseas including in responding to emergency situations and for the continuous implementation of diplomatic and consular duties. In addition MOFA also appropriated funding for hosting conferences and meetings to strengthen cooperation with allies and like-minded countries creating new rules to be effective in space and cyberspace and other matters.

In order to promote Japan's national interests Japan will continue to proceed strategically to develop the foreign policy implementation structure and enhance it further while making efforts to streamline operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL25lcGFsLW1ha2VzLXF1YXJhbnRpbmUtbWFuZGF0b3J5LWZvci10cmF2ZWxsZXJzLWFycml2aW5nLWZyb20tNjctY291bnRyaWVzLTEyMTEyMTgwMDE2Ml8xLmh0bWzSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbmVwYWwtbWFrZXMtcXVhcmFudGluZS1tYW5kYXRvcnktZm9yLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtYXJyaXZpbmctZnJvbS02Ny1jb3VudHJpZXMtMTIxMTIxODAwMTYyXzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nepal makes quarantine mandatory for travellers arriving from 67 countries,"Nepal on Saturday made two weeks quarantine mandatory for travelers arriving from 67 different countries mainly from European and African countries in wake of the rising Omicron variant of coronavirus.

""We talk about finishing. I knew how good this team was"" UAB coach Bill Clark said. ""We had two heart-breaking losses this year but we're still the same team. This was a great example for everyone in the country to see what we're about.""

Here are four takeaways from the 45th bowl game played in Shreveport’s Independence Stadium.

Independence Bowl 2021:BYU football vs. UAB video highlights

UAB’s Dylan Hopkins

The redshirt junior completed his first 13 passes and set an I-Bowl record with an .826 completion percentage. Most importantly his three touchdowns allowed the underdog Blazers (9-4) to defeat a team that had five wins over Power 5 opponents this season.

His near perfect day was spoiled by a third-quarter throw that was intercepted by BYU’s Hayden Livingston and led to a short scoring drive by the Cougars (10-3) capped by Allgeier’s 1-yard scoring run. But Hopkins was undeterred and ultimately did what he needed to do to win the game. He finished 19 of 23 for 189 yards with two scoring throws to Gerrit Prince.

Despite his performance Hopkins didn't earn game MVP offensive honors. That went to BYU running back Tyler Allgeier.

""We knew BYU's 10-2 for a reason and we just came out and played for the seniors"" Hopkins said. ""They're the ones who brought the program back so we needed to finish it for them.""

BYU’s Tyler Allgeier

If the super sophomore enters the NFL Draft in the coming months as expected Allgeier will have left a mark on BYU football.

When he scored his third touchdown on a 1-yard run to open the fourth quarter he had 186 yards on 24 carries to earn MVP honors. His two long runs in the first half took some of the starch out of the UAB defense. Allgeier came close to LSU’s Kevin Faulk who holds the Indy Bowl record of 234 yards set in 1995 against Michigan State finishing with 192 yards and three scores. That total was the fourth most in bowl history.

Afterward he wouldn't say if he'll return to BYU in 2022.

""I'm gonna keep you guys guessing. We'll see what happens"" Allgeier said.

Key turnover

BYU was driving for a final score when wide receiver Samson Nacua caught a pass took three steps and fumbled the ball to UAB's Mac McWilliams. The Cougars never touched the ball again.

BYU coach Kalani Sitake said it was just part of the game.

""No one feels worse than that kid right now but we love him"" Sitake said. ""He's a big part of our family and we forgive him. It's OK. There were a lot of little plays like that so it didn't come down to that one play.""

Solid start

UAB owned the first quarter despite facing a heavy rain blowing into the players’ faces for all but the last couple of minutes. The Blazers got an easy touchdown from Prince on a flip pass from Hopkins to open the scoring on their second drive. The Blazers’ second score was a highlight reel run from sophomore DeWayne McBride who broke free in a gap on the UAB sideline then escaped two tackles as he maneuvered into the end zone.

McBride finished with 183 yards rushing the fifth most yardage in I-Bowl history.

""Coming into the game I knew I'd have to step up for the team and be a leader"" McBride said.

That McBride run seemed to ignite Allgeier who ripped off a 35-yard run moments later to get BYU within 14-7 with a 1-yard touchdown run just after the second quarter opened. The Cougars' defense shut down the Blazers on the ensuing series and BYU went 50 yards in five plays to tie the game at 14-14 on a 2-yard Nacua run.

The investment was co-led by ADM Ventures the investment arm of Chicago-based food multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland and an unnamed global tech investor Prof. Yaakov Nahmias founder and CEO of Future Meat told Bloomberg on Saturday.

US meat company Tyson Foods the second-largest processor and marketer of meat products and an existing investor in Future Meat also participated in the round.

Nahmias said the company will use the funds to build a production facility in the United States and hopes to hit US market shelves later in 2022 pending regulatory approval. This past summer Future Meat opened what it called the world’s first industrial cultured meat production facility in Rehovot its headquarters with the capacity to produce 500 kilograms (about half a ton) of cultured product per day.

The facility further supports Future Meat’s larger efforts “to create a more sustainable future” the company has said.

“We are incredibly excited by the massive support of our global network of strategic and financial investors” said Nahmias. “This financing consolidates Future Meat’s position as the leading player in the cultivated meat industry just three years after our launch. Our singular technology reduced production costs faster than anyone thought possible paving the way for a massive expansion of operations. Our team will break ground on the first-of-its-kind large-scale production facility in the United States in 2022.”

Future Meat’s technology is based on the work of Nahmias a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and is licensed through Yissum the technology transfer company of the university. The company grows animal cells in bioreactors and says its end product is indistinguishable from animal meat. The cells do not undergo genetic modifications and can multiply indefinitely. The process is more environmentally friendly than farming producing 80 percent fewer greenhouse emissions and using 99% less land and 96% less freshwater than traditional meat production according to the company.

“While Future Meat is leading the pack as the fastest-growing company in this space I truly see the entire cultivated meat industry as a massive agent of change creating a sustainable future for coming generations” added Nahmias.

Future Meat also announced Sunday that it was now producing cultivated chicken breast for just $7.70 per pound or $1.70 per 110-gram chicken breast down from under $18 per pound just six months ago.

Cultured meat companies have been drawing significant investments in recent years. Eat Just a San Francisco-based food company raised $267 million in September for its cultured meat division GOOD Meat. Memphis-based UPSIDE Foods (formerly Memphis Meats) has raised over $200 million for its cultivated meat poultry and seafood products and opened a production facility in Emeryville California last month.

In July Israeli cultivated meat startup Aleph Farms received a $105 million investment including by US actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio to bring lab-grown steaks to market.

The Israeli cultured meat sector also includes MeaTech 3D a maker of lab-grown meat products that started research into the production of cultivated pork meat and recently unveiled what it called the largest bio-printed cultivated steak to date at 3.67 ounces (104 grams) and SuperMeat which grows beef and poultry cells.

These food tech companies play a “substantial role” in the alternative proteins global market according to a report by The Good Food Institute Israel a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote research and innovation in the field.

The cultivated meat sector is poised to thrive in coming years when companies transition from the development stage to production the report said.

There are some 40 companies worldwide racing to be the first to market with cell-based meat products that taste and look like the real thing and can be affordably mass-produced to meet the massive demand for protein in a world whose population is increasing and becoming wealthier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY29ycGdvdi5sYXcuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC8yMDIxLWNwYS16aWNrbGluLWluZGV4LW9mLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1wb2xpdGljYWwtZGlzY2xvc3VyZS1hbmQtYWNjb3VudGFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability,"In a two-year period marked by political polarization civil unrest and the January 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol more U.S. companies have adapted by expanding board oversight of potentially controversial political spending. This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

U.S. Bank National Association as the beneficiary of the Deed of Trust bid $30 million at the sale — the minimum bid set for the sale held outside the Kitsap County Administration Building in Port Orchard.

Representatives of U.S. Bank were the only bidders at the auction. Bob Zornes of Falcorp Limited the company that auctioned the property started the auction after 10 a.m. and the sale was closed at 10:19 a.m.

""They're going to decide what they're going to do with it"" Zornes said after the sale.

When contacted about what's next for the mall U.S. Bank spokesperson Cheryl Leamon referred questions to CWCapital Asset Management LLC a special server with the authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions regarding the property in the trust which includes initiating and conducting foreclosures maintaining and marketing or selling the property.

CWCapital Asset Management LLC managing director and assistant general counsel Nelson Phelps on Friday said the company had no comment about the sale.

Founded in 1972 CWCapital is a commercial real estate services company headquartered in Washington D.C. with other office locations in Dallas and New York according to the company's website.

The sale has been postponed multiple times over the last four months. The foreclosure proceeding comes more than a year after the mall’s owner listed as Kitsap Mall LLC stopped paying on its nearly $77 million loan according to the Notice of Trustee’s sale.

It is common for the beneficiary to be the only bidder and end up buying the property because other buyers generally wouldn't have a credit line of $77 million to buy a commercial center without doing due diligence said Steven W. Bender a law professor of Seattle University who specializes in real estate law.

More:Kitsap Mall foreclosure sale has been delayed 8 times. A look at why

The lender of the loan may sue the borrower to get the rest of what it is owed which is nearly $47 million Bender said. It may try to sell the property as well he said.

""Unless the loan documents are non-recourse the lender would sue the borrower and any guarantors for a deficiency judgment for the shortfall between the amount bid and the loan owed"" Bender said.

For a non-recourse loan the lender can only demand recourse against (demand payment from) the property rather than the borrower's other assets when they want to collect the shortfall unless there are certain bad acts by the borrower that are laid out in the loan documents. Such acts may be fraud or not properly managing the property Bender said.

According to the notice the purchaser at the sale is entitled to possession of the property on the 20th day following the sale. After the 20th day the purchaser has the right to evict anyone who is not a tenant under state law.

mong the big surprises of the pandemic economy was the housing boom. As fleeing city dwellers and cramped work-from-home families bid up the price of spacious suburban homes rock-bottom interest rates enticed existing homeowners to refinance in record numbers. By the end of last year 13.6 million mortgages worth $4.3 trillion had been closed shattering the previous all-time record of $3.7 trillion in 2003. It was a miraculous feat considering that most of that lending was done while in-person meetings were taboo and overworked loan officers operated from ad hoc home offices as their dogs barked and children fidgeted through remote classes.Truth is the mortgage market probably would have melted down were it not for a secret weapon: Nima Ghamsari a 35-year-old Iranian immigrant who made hundreds of thousands of dollars playing poker online while at Stanford; joined secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies upon graduation; and then at just 26 quit that dream job to start his own software company Blend Labs in 2012. “I have always felt like I wanted to bet on myself. I’m willing to take a lot of risk” he says matter-of-factly.Though invisible to ordinary borrowers and comparatively low-profile in its Silicon Valley home Blend has had a staggering impact. It now provides digital infrastructure to 287 US banks including such big mortgage lenders as Wells Fargo and First Republic Bank. In 2020 Blend software was used to process $1.4 trillion in mortgage and consumer loans up nearly threefold from the prior year. Its staff grew to 750 from 425 before the pandemic. Blend’s revenue doubled last year to about $100 million Forbes estimates.Thanks in no small part to Blend the mortgage application underwriting and closing process—once a weeks- or months-long slog of paperwork emails faxes and phone calls—can now be done almost entirely digitally. Blend saves an average of 7.3 days and $520 in operational costs per loan and allows a typical banker to close 14 mortgages a month consultancy MarketWise Advisors estimates. Blend seamlessly integrates with CoreLogic for credit scores Plaid to check on bank accounts and Google Maps for location data. This enables some banks to offer home hunters quick tentative mortgage approvals with a few mouse clicks—a huge plus in a white-hot housing market.“We all got stressed last year with the crush of volume” says Tom Wind president of US Bank Home Mortgage one of Blend’s largest customers. “We were able to serve more customers last year because of efficiencies we have with Blend.” In 2020 US Bank saw a 136 percent increase in mortgage fee revenue without having to increase staff.Ghamsari and Blend have produced results by bucking convention on Sand Hill Road. Instead of seeking to disrupt the banks (a common fintech goal) he decided to retrofit them charging for the service. His rationale: He wouldn’t have to waste time and money on consumer marketing and could potentially make financial services easier to access for 100 million consumers instead of maybe a million or two.In January fresh off its banner year Blend raised $300 million from blue-chip investors including Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global and Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management at a $3.3 billion valuation doubling its worth in a span of five months. In April Blend filed confidential documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a possible initial public offering which (given that Blend has an incentive-laden compensation structure similar to Tesla’s) could launch Ghamsari on the road to billionaire status—if Blend performs well. There are whispers that SPACs have shown interest in merging with Blend at double its latest valuation though Ghamsari won’t comment.Blend is a standout on this year’s Forbes’ Fintech 50 which celebrates private startups transforming financial services. Twenty of the Fintech 50 are new this year reflecting the energy and record venture capital pouring into the sector the impact of Covid-19 and the fact that six of last year’s picks including crypto exchange Coinbase and Opendoor Technologies which buys homes quickly for cash have since gone public. Counting Blend at least four current members of the Fintech 50 are considering listing on the public markets.Yet few have had so much impact on ordinary folks’ lives. Since the end of World War II owning a home has been at the center of the American Dream—as it was for Ghamsari’s own family. He moved to the US from Iran in 1987 when he was a year old as his parents pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan and then settled down in Cincinnati where his dad taught math at the University of Cincinnati and his mother taught chemistry at Xavier University. After years of renting Ghamsari’s parents were finally approved in 1998 for a low-down-payment mortgage and purchased a no-frills two-story home in Cincinnati for about $100000. It was the rock their family prospered upon. They later became franchisees of a tutoring company employing their brainy teenage son to grade and tutor students.That wasn’t the only way the ambitious Ghamsari kept busy before graduating from high school first in his class. He worked at McDonald’s Starbucks and Circuit City rebuilt Dell computers and taught himself to code. At Stanford a need-based scholarship helped cover tuition but Ghamsari tried his hand at online poker to help pay for living expenses. Soon when he wasn’t studying he was playing day and night with his winnings extending well into the six figures. “It was my first taste of something where if I really put a lot of energy and effort into getting better how good the outcomes could be over a very long run” he says.To make more time for poker Ghamsari bought a gas-powered golf cart to get around Stanford’s sprawling 8000-acre campus faster. “I really optimise my time around doing the things that I want to do. I try to make everything that I don’t want to do be as efficient—ideally nonexistent—as possible’’ he explains. (Stealing a page from Steve Jobs’ playbook he has 30 black T-shirts he says because “I don’t like spending time thinking about what I’m going to wear.”)With little regard for the brilliant undergraduate’s precious time campus police impounded Ghamsari’s forbidden golf cart. “It was totally obnoxious for me to have in retrospect’’ he concedes. No matter. By the time he graduated with a computer science degree in 2008 he had bought an Aston Martin and been recruited by the ultra-secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies originally funded by the CIA’s venture arm. He was assigned to Palantir’s push to deploy its software inside America’s then-teetering big banks whose patchwork decades-old technology infrastructure gave them a poor grasp of their problematic mortgage exposures. Ghamsari saw up close the massive opportunity to disrupt banks—or to transform them.“The insight Palantir had was that there was this immense growth in the amount of data being captured by organisations but there was no way to harness that data for operational things” he says. “You had to literally read pieces of paper because all the data in the mortgage industry at the time was done in an analog way.”Like other employees Ghamsari had stock options and could have cashed in when Palantir eventually went public in 2020. Instead in 2012 he and two other young colleagues (former quant trader Rosco Hill and engineer Eugene Marinelli) founded Blend together with Erin Collard the head trader of billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital to bring new cloud-based technology to the earthbound banks. They gained early backing from Thiel and Max Levchin now worth $1.4 billion thanks to his newly public fintech Affirm which allows people to pay for items in installments. The four founders first worked out of Ghamsari’s cramped San Francisco apartment until his roommates complained. So they rented a Mission Bay apartment which they used as offices hauling sleeping bags into closets for naps during round-the-clock coding sessions.At first venture capitalists focussed on fast disruptive growth were sceptical of Blend’s approach. Winning business from stodgy banks was uncertain they warned and there were only so many banks to sell to. “Venture capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say ‘This will never work’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it’ ” Ghamsari recalls.But changes in the mortgage market eventually played into Ghamsari’s hands. In an effort to cut risk after the 2008 financial crisis large lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo started offloading hundreds of billions in mortgages to third-party servicers. Those servicers needed help managing their massive new portfolios and were more open to getting it from young tech wizards than banks might have been. Early Blend customers included Nationstar Mortgage (now Mr. Cooper) the country’s third-largest mortgage servicer.Blend’s big break however came courtesy of a competitor. In 2015 Dan Gilbert the Quicken Loans billionaire launched Rocket Mortgage which cut mortgage closing times from over 40 days to just a month—similar to what Blend was offering. “Every bank’s board woke up and said ‘Oh my God we need to find a solution to compete with this because if we don’t we’re going to lose volume to Rocket.’ Blend was one of those answers” recalls Jeffrey Reitman a partner at Blend investor Canapi Ventures.Through the first half of 2017 Blend received just $67 million in outside funding. But after VCs saw it had won Wells Fargo US Bank and mortgage originator Movement Mortgage as customers they started calling. In August 2017 Blend raised $100 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation in a round led by Greylock with Emergence Capital 8VC Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nyca Partners.With that cash Ghamsari was able to add hundreds of smaller banks as customers. He also expanded functionality giving borrowers the ability to upload documents and banks the ability to manage more of the closing process as well as the applications process digitally. In 2019 Blend raised a further $130 million and hired Tim Mayopoulos the now 62-year-old former CEO of Fannie Mae as its president giving it instant credibility with banks and government-backed mortgage finance agencies known in the trade as GSEs. Ghamsari “came and visited me in my office and he was this scruffy guy in a black T-shirt’’ Mayopoulos recalls. “But it was clear that he had the same vision about how the system ought to work that I did: It should all be driven by reliable data that gets shared with all the key participants in the process from the consumer to the lender to the ultimate holder of the credit risk [the GSEs].”Blend isn’t stopping at mortgages—or banks. By 2019 it had launched paper-reducing software for homeowner’s insurance and home-equity and auto loans. It’s also enabling homebuilder Lennar to offer mortgages. In March it agreed to acquire title-insurance and settlement company Title365 for $422 million with the aim of integrating even more of the home closing process into its services—and collecting insurance fees.Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time’’ he says. Consumers will open an app and get real-time recommendations based on their individual financial picture with Blend powering it all. If that happens he adds “This will be one of the biggest companies in the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy91YWUtYmFua3Mtd29yay13ZWVrL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzEyLzE5L2J1c2luZXNzL3VhZS1iYW5rcy13b3JrLXdlZWs?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International banks in UAE to switch to Monday to Friday work week,"Deutsche Bank AG JPMorgan Chase & Co and Societe Generale SA are changing to a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the New Year in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which is aligning its working week with most global markets.

Wall Street-based JPMorgan is also adapting the same week in UAE along with flexible practices such as a break for Muslim prayers on Fridays the bank said in a statement.

France-based Societe Generale’s spokesperson said it is implementing Saturday-Sunday weekend from Jan. 2 in its Dubai and Abu Dhabi entities according to an emailed statement.

Bloomberg News was the first to report on Sunday that JPMorgan Deutsche Bank Bank of America Corp and Societe Generale will switch to a Saturday-Sunday weekend in the UAE.

Representatives of Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The banks’ move comes after the UAE said on Dec. 7 that it would shift to a four-and-a-half day week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the start of next year.

Private companies are however free to choose their own working week in the oil-producing Gulf state which is the region’s commercial trade and tourism hub.

and enter the names or phone numbers of the other riders. Each rider gets a message asking them to accept the split fare. When they do the fare is split. If not you are charged for that person's portion.

This article explains how to split an Uber ride fare by using the app to request the split from other riders. It also includes tips to try when you have trouble with the Uber app. You need the latest version of the app to split the fare.



How to Split an Uber Ride Fare

Uber introduced fare splitting in 2013 putting an end to the age-old question ""Uh how are we paying for this?"" The feature takes the hassle out of dividing the cost of a ride between passengers. It's simple to use too! Here's how to split an Uber ride.



Request an Uber. During your trip swipe up from the bottom of the app and tap your selected payment method. Tap Split Fare. Enter the names or phone numbers of the riders you want to split the fare with. Each rider will get a notification asking them to accept the split. Once they accept the fare will be equally divided among the group. If someone doesn't accept the request or they don't have a valid payment method you'll be charged for both your portion of the fare and theirs. Uber Uber charges each participating rider with a $0.25 fee to split a fare. Your receipt will show the total amounts charged to all riders. That's it!

My Uber App Isn't Working. Help!

If you're running into technical issues while using the Uber app there are few things you can try:

Force quit the Uber app and restart it.

Restart your phone and/or its networking settings.

Uninstall and reinstall the Uber app.

Log out of the app for about two minutes then log back in.

Check for any Android or iOS updates and install them if necessary.

If you're having trouble specifically with fare splitting it's worth noting the feature might not be available for all Uber options. Also a fare can't be split after the trip is ended.

Finally while Uber accepts various payment methods it says Apple Pay might not work on split fares. If you use Apple Pay and want to divvy up the tab you may need to use another payment method. You can then switch back to Apple Pay on your next trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3BhdGVyc29uLXByZXNzLzIwMjEvMTIvMTgvdWJlci1zZXgtY2FzZS1wYXRlcnNvbi1uai10ZWFjaGVyLzg5Mzg5MTAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber sex case costs former Paterson NJ teacher license,"Joe Malinconico

Paterson Press

PATERSON— A 2018 sex case involving an Uber ride in Bergen County has cost a former Paterson gym teacher his job and state teaching certificate.

The Paterson Board of Education approved the termination of the teacher Jayson Lavorne during its meeting on Wednesday night. Lavorne had worked in the district since 2009 and was assigned to School 28 when he was suspended over the sex charges about 33 months ago.

Lavorne was indicted in February 2019 on a criminal sexual contact charge for allegedly exposing his genitals and trying to force an Uber driver to touch him according to public records.

A month after the indictment Lavorne entered pre-trial intervention an alternative justice program that allows first-time non-violent offenders to avoid prosecution and get the charges against them cleared if they fulfill court requirements.

The New Jersey Department of Education's Board of Examiners then referred the case to the state’s Office of Administrative Law for a hearing regarding Lavorne’s teaching license a proceeding in which both the driver and Lavorne gave testimony.

Lavorne could not be reached for comment. During the hearing Lavorne denied exposing himself and trying to force the Uber driver to touch him according to public records. But the judge said in his opinion that he did not find Lavorne’s testimony credible.

The judge recommended Lavorne’s teaching license be suspended for three years and not revoked because the incident did not directly involve his teaching job.

When the state continued to seek the revocation of Lavorne’s teaching certificate he filed a legal response asserting he had “taken corrective action” and “deserves a chance” according to the Board of Examiners.

“He (Lavorne) argues that he has suffered tremendously for his actions” said the decision issued by the teaching certificate board. “All of the years to obtain his degree the years he dedicated to coaching and teaching hang in the balance for six minutes of intoxicated conduct during an Uber ride.”

In a decision adopted on Oct. 28 the state board determined that Lavorne’s certificate should be revoked.

Who needs them when you have Indianapolis' Mr. Steve,"Residents of Indianapolis' mid-north neighborhoods have their own personal chauffeur  and his name is Mr. Steve.

Kids at a Martin Luther King Community Center after-school program at IPS 43 shout ""Mr. Steve!"" when they see his white van pull up to take them home. Residents sitting outside Mt. Zion senior apartments on Boulevard Place occasionally chant ""Midtown-Get-Around!"" when he picks up one of their neighbors for a doctor appointment.

Around the corner on a recent Thursday a 76-year-old client recognized him while crossing the street at a track-star pace. She flashed him a smile and a wave and he honked lightly in return.

""She could outrun this van"" Steve Woods laughs.

Pulling into Tarkington Park between scheduled rides he dials up the MLK Center.

""If anybody calls I'm available"" he tells the receptionist.

Woods is one of two drivers for the nonprofit's growing neighborhood rideshare program called Midtown-Get-Around which was born out of a 2019 contest piloted at the onset of the pandemic and is now in expansion mode.

The MLK Center was a finalist in Ford Mobility's City:One Challenge in 2019 which called for ideas to address mobility needs in the city. The community center's idea was to create a cheap van shuttle service for residents of the Butler-Tarkington Crown Hill Mapleton-Fall Creek and Meridian-Kessler neighborhoods to get to school job interviews medical appointments the grocery store — any essential need within the I-465 loop.

IndyGo leased the center four wheelchair-accessible vans for the endeavor which got off the ground in the spring of 2020.

Today nearly 100 residents are registered for the $2-a-ride service which is looking for two more drivers.

""Our program has taken off by word of mouth"" office manager Jillian Atkerson said.

When Woods isn't driving he's at bus stations or coffee shops handing out flyers or just talking about the program. But it also spreads from client to client.

Tamra Dunlap was one of Woods' first clients at Mt. Zion. Others quickly followed.

""Everybody knows him"" she said on her way to IU Methodist for a check-up. ""I only ride with him. He cares about us. When I get out he's right there waiting right on the dot.""

Timeliness is important to Woods — being late throws him off schedule and off balance.

""You give me a call I'll come get you"" he tells Dunlap at the hospital entrance.

""It'll be 12:30"" she said.

""I'll be here at 12:30 then.""

The lifelong resident almost never uses a GPS and starts at 7 a.m. driving residents to the library or Target for job interviews to temp services on Zionsville Road to the bank or grocery stores particularly on the first or 15th of the month when food stamps get disbursed.

More than half of the program's clients are seniors for whom both walking to a bus line and navigating rideshare apps is cumbersome. A handful use wheelchairs or walkers.

""This new age of tech and rideshare has not really been formatted for them"" Atkerson said. ""I know my grandmother would probably need a couple of training sessions to use an app.""

But plenty others just need an affordable and comfortable way to get to jobs. Every morning Woods takes Paula Kincade to work at Dove Recovery House for Women where she's the kitchen manager. For the first couple months working there she spent $30 a day using Lyft to and from work. Being in recovery taking the bus is uncomfortable — the two times she tried she said men who appeared inebriated sat next to her.

Some days she hails Midtown-Get-Around for grocery store trips. Woods waits for her at the store takes her home and helps her bring in groceries — a lot of them since she also shops for the recovery house.

""They say I'm their favorite passenger"" Kincade said. ""They might be lying to me.""

But in a show of devotion Woods will still show up to pick her up for work in the morning even if she forgets to call the MLK Center ahead of time as is the protocol.

He might bend protocol for a few other reasons too — to take an 89-year-old client to a doctor's appointment half an hour early so the patient can flirt with the nurses and maybe stop to grab him a hamburger if it's on their way home.

The MLK Center is in the process of taking ownership of the vans hiring new drivers and talking about expanding its hours later into the evenings and weekends Atkerson said. Right now the program runs Monday through Friday and stops around 5:30 p.m.

Woods previously worked in machine shops until he was laid off due to the pandemic. He never pictured himself a driver but now that he is he can't picture his life without it.

He meets different people of all backgrounds every week in addition to his regulars; he discovers new things about his city like the fact that Geico has a corporate office just outside the 465 loop.

""It was just I grown to like it that's what it was"" he said. And now all he notices is reckless driving around him.

""Zoom zoom zoom"" he pantomimed.

SAN ANTONIO — If you're planning to attend a holiday party and if there's an adult beverage with your name on it there's a new incentive for you to get a safe ride home.

A newly formed group wants to cut the cost of not one – but two of your Uber rides so you don't drink and drive.

""We hope people take advantage of it"" said Natalie Paulus Manager of Victim Services for Mothers Against Drunk Driving in San Antonio. ""I think [our coalition is] going to do a lot of great things.""

In a first of its kind partnership Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is collaborating with Silver Eagle Beverages Anheuser-Busch and Uber to focus on an end to drunk driving.

""We're not against the alcohol industry. We're just against people driving impaired"" said Paulus. ""[The alcohol industry] can be really big proponents and a really big help in the community as we're pushing out the same message of don't drink and drive.""

The new initiative by the coalition is called ""Decide to Ride"".

The goal is simple: To get people to plan ahead for a safe ride home from holiday celebrations.

""You're with friends and someone is trying to drive off let's see what we can do to stop them or get them a safe ride home"" said Paulus. ""It really is down to each individual.""

Beginning December 23 through January 1 you can get a $10 Uber ride credit. It's two $5 vouchers for two rides.

""We want to make your night your afternoon a little bit easier"" said Paulus. ""We're gonna help you make sure you get home safely or get to wherever you need to go safely.""

Silver Eagle Beverages said to KENS 5 ""Silver Eagle Beverages is proud to sponsor this new program in the hopes that this initiative reaches and encourages consumers to plan ahead for a safe ride before they even take their first sip.""

Company officials tell us there's an average of 300000 crashes a day and 10000 deaths related to alcohol-impaired driving in the U.S. every year – and this problem is 100% preventable.

Any time an A-lister waxes lyrical about a skincare product we pay attention. Why? Well for starters maintaining a beautifully radiant complexion is practically in the 'famous person' job description.

We know celebrities' skin and the excellence thereof usually comes down to a few factors: Genetics an on-point skincare routine plus access to world-class doctors makeup artists and facialists dishing out insider tips by the bucketload. It’s this acquired knowledge on the best skincare products that we’re interested in – and the reason why we’ve taken the time to investigate exactly what products (and in what order) these beauty-obsessed celebrities turn to time and time again.

From Jennifer Aniston's best face moisturizer at a drugstore price to Victoria Beckham's best face masks and the one skincare ingredient that gives Halle Berry her glow read on to discover the (sometimes surprisingly affordable) celebrity skincare secrets that are really worth stealing.

Celebrities' skincare routines revealed

1. Nicole Kidman

Whilst Nicole's flawless skin may look like the result of complex and pricey treatments her routine is surprisingly achievable. “I don’t like dry scaly skin. Who does? But that’s my skin’s tendency” she recently revealed. But with the help of her finely tuned routine Kidman manages to keep her skin looking hydrated and plump. If you also have skin in desperate need of a drink look no further than Nicole's favorite daytime products.

Cleanse: To remove those dead skin cells and excess build-up Nicole starts her day with an exfoliating polish cleanser. Her top choice brand for cleansers is SeraLabs which specializes in CBD-infused skincare products and helps to maintain the skin’s moisture balance.

Protect: “I go out in the sun because I love running and I love swimming but I cover myself usually in zinc"" Kidman says. Her zinc of choice is the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Face Mineral Sunscreen which she re-applies regularly throughout the day.

2. Salma Hayek

It is no secret that Salma Hayek has beautiful skin but her biggest beauty tip may come as a shock to most: she refuses to have tweakments such as Botox. ""I never say never. Have I done it? No still no"" she says. Salma's routine is mostly about letting her skin do the work and aiding it with a few of the best skincare combinations along the way. If you're looking for a more stripped-down skincare routine this might be the one for you.

Cleanse: Perhaps controversially Salma never cleanses her skin in the morning. “My grandmother taught me that at night your skin replenishes all the things you lost during the day. Also if I cleanse very well at night why would it be dirty when I wake up? It’s for companies to have you use more products"" she said. If Salma says so we're on board!

Cate attributes her luminous complexion to a few Holy Grail products that she has been using for over a decade. ""I found something that really works for me and I’ve stuck with it"" she said explaining that her skin is now much more resilient than it was in her 20s. To retain her glow and avoid breakouts Cate also has a rigid SPF routine that she has followed since childhood. With such dedication it is no wonder she looks this good!

Prep: The first step in Cate's routine is an essence by SK-II which she has been using for over 15 years. She claims that this Japanese skincare staple gives her skin such a boost that foundation isn't necessary. We'll take a bottle please!

This woman just keeps getting better and it's her California-girl glow we crave most. Luckily Jen was kind enough to share her morning routine and skincare tips with wellness brand Well & Good.

Fashion mogul and beauty entrepreneur Victoria Beckham takes a surprisingly simple approach to her skincare. “I don’t like to overload my skin” she told Net-A-Porter. Instead Posh Spice has carefully curated a routine that works for her with a few nods to her own well-regarded range.

Refresh: To kick things off Beckham splashes cold water over her face to take down any puffiness – a tip she learned from facialist Melanie Grant. She follows this up with Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Enzyme Cleanser saying ""it's delicate enough to use every day.”

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

THE United Nigeria Airline owned by billionaire businessman Dr. Obiorah Okonkwo began scheduled commercial flights at the new Anambra Airport yesterday thus becoming the second airline operating regularly at the airport.

Five airlines have already indicated interest to operate at the airport and are already setting up their counters there.

Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director of United Nigeria Airline Maxi Osita Okonkwo who monitored the inaugural flight said yesterday at the airport that his company was happy to serve Anambra people.

He said: “We give glory and honour to God for making it possible for us to land here today being our inaugural flight. This is the beginning of many more flights to come.

“There are flights to Abuja and Lagos and we intend to operate daily flights in and out of the Anambra Airport.

“It’s been a long journey for Ndi Anambra and also for us to see today and we thank God for that. So what I am telling Ndi Anambra is to get ready for us.

“Traveling out of Anambra or into Anambra will become easier and more lucrative as the days go by. Today is our inaugural flight and we’re glad we have done it successfully.

“There are a few things that are still being done in the airport and we want to be part of it giving them feedback so that they know what the issues are to get everything going.

“We’re happy with what we have seen today.

This airport is an excellent well thought-out project and I think it is going to be one of the best in Nigeria.

“Of course airport is not just about the building; there are many things that happen around.

“You look for places to stay; there should be transport in and out of the airport. These are the things that will make it viable.

“And I’m sure with time people will begin to see the businesses that are supposed to develop around the airport. So it has all the potentials for it to be a great destination”.",,,,,,,,,

This trucking network – separate from the army of home-delivery contractors that drop Amazon packages on shoppers’ doorsteps – puts small AFPs in fierce competition for drivers against Walmart Inc and United Parcel Service Inc.

“There’s a shortage of drivers especially the good drivers” said Ebony McKinley owner of family-run Seven Strong Trucking. The Phoenix-area firm was among the first to join the AFP program in April 2020. It now has 20 Amazon-branded semi-truck tractors as part of AFP and employs 45 drivers.

Amazon’s logistics unit has bought 1395 Amazon-branded big-rig tractors to pull trailers of goods in the United States according to Department of Transportation data seen by Reuters. Filling seats in those vehicles falls largely to independent contractors like McKinley at a time when the industry has a record shortfall of 80000 big-rig drivers. “Everybody’s feeling the heat” she said.

Labor woes are particularly acute for big-rig trucking firms because their drivers need more credentials: Government agencies require them to have commercial drivers’ licenses and insurers increasingly demand two years’ experience. Skilled drivers can hop to a new job with better compensation amid record demand for consumer goods.

Seattle-based Amazon in October said that higher wages more worker incentives and inflation in services such as trucking contributed to $2 billion in extra expenses in the prior quarter. Amazon expects those costs to double for the current holiday quarter threatening to erase profit in its biggest selling period.

Truckers’ pay has not kept pace with inflation leaving “real” earnings at 70% of what they were in the 1970s according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Federal limits on daily working hours the COVID-19 pandemic and other hurdles prompted many truck drivers to quit.

At Seven Strong new drivers start at $22 an hour. Perks include a $1500 hiring bonus and overtime pay. Base pay is roughly in line with the median wage for all U.S. truck drivers which is $47130 per year or $22.66 per hour according to BLS. Owner McKinley said that payments from Amazon cover driver compensation.

AFPs across the United States advertise pay of $18-$27 per hour before benefits with many nights at home according to a Reuters review of dozens of help-wanted postings on Indeed ZipRecruiter and other online sites. Signing bonuses ranged from $1000 to $2000 according to the postings.

Amazon told Reuters it recommends a minimum contractual wage for AFP drivers but it also encourages contractors to pay above that to find and retain talent.

If Amazon were to dictate trucker wages it could run afoul of rules for independent contractors at a time when some states want such workers classified as employees legal and trucking experts said.

Two current AFPs who declined to be named for fear of retribution told Reuters the work is steady and predictable – although they said other less-experienced operators could be overwhelmed with overtime and unexpected expenses.

While stability and reliability offered by established trucking employers like Walmart or UPS may appeal to older experienced drivers small trucking company owners may be lured by opportunities to grow with Amazon.

“Hitching your wagon to the Amazon train – that’s hard to turn down” said Page Siplon chief executive of TeamOne Logistics a third-party logistics firm with 700 drivers in 43 states that does not work with Amazon.

Amazon forecast fourth-quarter net sales of $130 billion-$140 billion up 4-12% which could translate into a jump in the number of packages it handles. This year that could mean it handles 32 million packages in the United States on a peak day said Marc Wulfraat president of consultancy firm MWPVL International.

Amazon’s former shipping partner FedEx Corp also reported a quarterly profit hit from unexpected costs – primarily from its Ground delivery unit that depends on contract drivers.

Trucker employers UPS and Walmart were not immune to the pressure but did not report the same level of cost woes.

UPS which counts Amazon as its top customer spent more on its well-paid unionized workforce that appears to be providing profit-sheltering labor stability.

Walmart which has more than 11000 big-rig drivers on its payroll said higher supply-chain costs reduced its U.S. gross profit rate by 12 basis points in the latest quarter.

Walmart is hiking pay and sweetening bonuses for its decades-old in-house trucking operation that uses 8400 owned and leased tractors to move goods for its more than 5300 U.S. Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. Walmart – which employs mostly long-haul truckers – advertises immediate truck driver jobs with starting salaries of $87500 not including signing bonuses of $8000 or $12000. Peak season bonuses for working an extra day sometimes jump to $250 a day from $150 a Walmart spokesperson said.

However while Canadians do enjoy access to physician services the country’s health care system does not include services like prescription drugs and dental care. These services are generally accessed through employment-based private insurance and out of pocket payments. As a result large segments of the Canadian population lack access to these essential services. With the recent federal election resulting in a minority parliament the Liberals require support from other parties to govern. This presents a great opportunity for the New Democratic Party (NDP). In exchange for NDP support the party should demand an expansion of the health care system as part of any post-pandemic recovery plan.

Not Universal Enough In Canada prohibitive costs mean that one in ten prescriptions are not filled. Many more patients attempt to cut their pills in half for the same reason. This is because Canada is the only Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country with universal health care that does not include coverage for prescription drugs. As a result after making use of the country’s universal physician services many Canadians are unable to follow through with the advised treatment due to the cost of medications. When people do not take their medication their health deteriorates and many end up back in an emergency room needing care for easily preventable illnesses. By the government’s own reckoning these backend costs saddle the system with over a billion dollars in extra health care spending each year. Canadians spend the third highest amount per capita on prescription drugs in the world. It is only in comparison to the cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States that Canada’s drug prices could appear reasonable. When matched up against the rest of the Global North Canada’s drug costs are outrageous. Estimates show that universal pharmacare would not only make Canadians healthier but would also lower spending on prescription drugs by over 4 billion dollars per year due to the ability to purchase in bulk and use generic drugs. Dental care is also excluded from Canada’s universal health care system. One in three Canadians lack dental insurance and over one in five avoid the dentist each year due to financial constraints. Without access to dental care people go without preventative services and early interventions leaving small problems to fester until pain and infection occurs. Lack of access to dental care results in poor oral health the consequences of which extend beyond the mouth. Poor oral health has been associated with the following health conditions: cardiovascular disease diabetes having a low-birth-weight infant aspiration pneumonia erectile dysfunction osteoporosis metabolic syndrome and stroke. Having missing teeth or visible decay can affect employability further exacerbating the cycle of poverty for those who lack access to care.

Consequences The pain of a toothache is excruciating. As a dentist I have seen countless people who have tried to extract their own teeth. Allowing dental infections to go untreated can become fatal when they spread to the brain or compress the airway. A Sioux First Nation’s person recently died from the complications that arose from a dental infection. Visits to the ER for dental pain cost over $150 million per year while people are still left in need of treatment from a dentist. ER visits are also made by people who cannot fill their prescription or cannot not access mental health services. There are better places than the emergency department to treat these people and many of these emergencies would not happen if people had proper access in the first place. Compared to other countries provincial and federal governments in Canada are uniquely bad at helping those without access to dental care. Canadian government spending accounts for only 5 percent of dental spending — which is even lower than in the United States which spends 10 percent — and well behind the UK’s 46 percent and Japan’s 75 percent. Because Canadians rely primarily on work related insurance and out of pocket payments to access these services financial downturns result in people losing access to care. During the COVID-19 pandemic millions of Canadians became unemployed and lost their work-related benefits as well as disposable income to pay for these services. This very recent history illustrates the precarious nature of work-related health insurance. Access to work-related benefits have been worsening for years — they were getting worse well before the pandemic. Many older people are retiring and losing work-related benefits. The increasing number of workers in the precarious gig economy which does not provide benefits is also increasing the number of people without proper health care access. The result of millions of Canadians being unable to access necessary medical services is a less healthy country. Undue stress is consequently placed on the existing health care system. The COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant financial downturns have only exacerbated this problem. And of course this is exactly when the health care system has been needed most.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbGVhZmxldC5pbi9sZXNzb25zLWZyb20tcHJpdmF0ZS1zZWN0b3ItZW5nYWdlbWVudC13aXRoLWNvdmlkLTE5LWZvci11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lessons from private sector engagement with COVID-19 for universal health care,"SHWETA MARATHE and DR ABHAY SHUKLA provide a critical overview of how private healthcare and the public health system have engaged during the COVID-19 pandemic in India while also examining the next steps for achieving universal health coverage.

——–

THE COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted health systems across the world with an unprecedented and massive increase in demand for health services. To cope with the crisis many countries are turning to the private sector for additional capacity. Given the prominence of the private healthcare sector and low resourced public health systems the private sector’s contribution in providing COVID-19 related care has been inevitably significant in several low and middle-income countries (LMICs) including India.

However in many LMICs the situation of private sector engagement (PSE) with the public health system is not hunky dory but remains patchy and not well-positioned to effectively complement government health services. For India too while the private sector’s contribution in COVID-19 care is undeniable widespread regressive practices during the pandemic with serious implications for health rights cannot be ignored.

Widespread instances of private hospitals evicting COVID-19 positive or suspected patients and shutting down operations despite state-issued orders to reopen services were reported.

With a favourable policy environment India has become an attractive site for private capital investment in the health sector leading to burgeoning privatisation and corporatisation of healthcare services especially in the last two decades. 70% of healthcare in India is provided by the private sector while 90% of all allopathic doctors and around 80% of nurses are engaged by the private healthcare sector. It has been estimated that every year unaffordable costs of privatised healthcare in India push 55 million people into poverty.

The average cost of healthcare in India has tripled from 2005 to 2015 due to unregulated private healthcare expenditure. However governments in India have so far not effectively regulated costs and quality of healthcare in the private sector despite passing of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010 (the CEA) which has also been facing regulatory stalemate for nearly a decade.

During the pandemic several state governments enforced some major regulatory measures over the private hospitals making use of emergency legal provisions. However concerns are being raised over the inadequate implementation of these measures and the response of many private hospitals which continued to gravitate towards profiteering even in this time of crisis. Although the ramifications of a weakly regulated commercialised private sector have always been prevalent the pandemic has brutally exposed the often-contradictory goals of public and commercialised private sectors concerning provision of healthcare.

It is hence important to critically analyse the experiences of PSE during the pandemic which can lead to re-examining the modes of public-private interaction in the healthcare sector while planning a movement towards universal health coverage (UHC) in the coming period.

This commentary aims to provide a critical overview of how the private sector engagement (PSE) with the public health system has unfolded during the pandemic in India with a focus on Maharashtra with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among Indian states. Given the current health policy directions at the national and international level which appear favourable for private players it also highlights the need for drawing lessons from COVID-19 experiences which can contribute towards modifying future modes of effective PSE.

Private healthcare’s response in the initial phase of the pandemic

In the initial phase of the pandemic the private healthcare sector showed a non-uniform response emblematic of heterogeneity of the sector in India. Most small-to-medium hospitals maintained a low profile reducing or completely shutting down their services due to reasons like reduced in-flow during the lockdown not being equipped for COVID-19 treatment and a fear of handling COVID-19 patients.

There were also instances of evicting COVID-19 positive or suspected patients from private hospitals. Despite some states issuing the orders to reopen their services some private hospitals chose to remain closed.

While more recent data on the number of patients who have availed free COVID-19 treatment under the PMJAY is unavailable in the public domain there is considerable evidence that many PMJAY-enrolled private hospitals are not fulfilling the expectation of providing free care to COVID-19 patients.

During the same period a large section of private and especially corporate hospitals were reportedly operating in a different mode to chase the opportunity to maximise their profits. Some patients were reported to be overcharged INR 50000 and INR 100000 per day for COVID-19 treatment. There has also been several public interest litigation filed before courts on issues relating to healthcare facilities and requesting regulation of rates in private hospitals filed by patients.

Both the above-mentioned responses by the private healthcare sector highlights the need for government intervention within the private sector to ensure the delivery of health services in public interest and the same cannot be left to the private sector alone.

Losses and gains

In the initial three months of the lockdown spanning March to June 2020 there were media reports of private hospitals floundering with significant revenue loss. Several corporate hospitals had sustained revenue losses of up to 90%.

This was primarily due to the loss of local and foreign clientele as the government had stopped issuing visas for foreign visitors traveling to India. As a result international medical tourism declined to nearly zero.

Max Hospitals which received around 5000 international patients per month was estimated to have borne an average revenue loss of INR 25 crore per month. Besides this COVID-19 related safety measures also added significantly to the financial burden of hospitals. While there was a buzz around a dent in the private sector’s profit during the period of lockdown the ICRA Limited an independent credit rating agency in India noted that the healthcare industry is likely to witness a 20% revenue growth in financial year 2022.

The COVID-19 crisis may be looked upon as a historic opportunity for re-imagining public health systems as well as their engagement with private healthcare – moving to majorly expand public health services and to socially re-embed private providers enhancing their public regulation and social responsiveness while moving in the direction of universal health coverage.

As per ICRA Ltd the outlook for the sector remains “stable” with a swift recovery seen in its performance despite the COVID-19 challenges. According to its Assistant Vice President on the supply side India currently faces a significant shortage of beds and any government investments towards hospital bed addition are limited. This provides private sector players with the opportunity to step in to fill the gap.

How to steer the private healthcare sector?

Recognising the limited capacities of the public health system several Indian states have mandatorily requisitioned private hospitals. This has enforced public obligations of private healthcare providers at non-commercial terms which extends beyond existing forms of commercial and contractual arrangements through public-private partnerships.

Various states have either converted private hospitals into designated COVID-19 care centers or taken over private hospitals for COVID-19 care. Taking one step ahead Maharashtra has declared that the state health insurance scheme (MPJAY) would cover 100% of its population for free COVID-19 treatment and 996 other procedures.

Further in response to a large number of grievances of overcharging during the pandemic it is quite notable that around fifteen Indian states have directed private hospitals to regulate rates covering 20%-80% of their beds for COVID-19 patients so far. On the whole Maharashtra has been at the forefront in declaring the rate regulation along with taking the above-mentioned decisions on engaging with the private sector (see below).

Key timelines of regulatory measures by Maharashtra Date Key decisions April 2020 Mandatory reservation of 80% of all private hospital beds at regulated rates for COVID-19 & non-COVID-19 treatment valid until August 30 2020 May 2020 Provision of free and cashless insurance protection expanded from 85% to 100% of the citizens in the state under MPJAY June 2020 Appointment of auditors to check bills of private hospitals and conduct audit of bills from private hospitals for COVID-18 and other treatment June 2020 Fixation of rate for conducting RTPCR test in NABL and ICMR approved private laboratories July 2020 Fixation of the fare for private ambulances and also requisition of ambulances across the state to provide free services to patients August 2020

December 2020

and February 2021 Subsequent extensions of notification of mandatory reservation of 80% beds from all private hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients at capped prices September 2020 Notification on fixing rates for non-COVID-19 patients in private hospitals dated April 2020 was challenged by private providers October 2020 The Bombay HC quashed and set aside the provision applicable to non-COVID-19 patients in private hospitals/ health care providers and nursing homes etc. in a notification dated April 2020 and May 2020 February 2021 Extension of notification of mandatory reservation of 80% beds from all private hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients at the capped prices until May 2021 June 2021 Rates have been defined as per classification of cities.

Also private hospitals shall give pre-audited bills to patients. Auditors should be appointed for this by respective District Collectors.

Rate capping in most states is based on charges agreed upon with the insurance companies. In the backdrop of the states’ lackadaisical approach regarding private sector regulation this commendable decision stands in sharp contrast bringing this much-contested issue back on the agenda. As far as regulating rates of COVID-19 testing is concerned despite directives issued by the Supreme Court most private laboratories did not abide by it.

Resistance to rate regulation

Unsurprisingly the state-imposed decision of price capping on COVID-19 treatment was met with resistance by many private providers and their associations. The Indian Medical Association branches in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu as well as the Association of Private Healthcare Providers (AHPI) from Bangalore have demanded revising the rates contending that the rates set by the Government are not viable.

Some doctors had also expressed that fixing the rates of COVID-19 treatment could severely impact the cash flows as 50%-80% of the sector’s costs are fixed.

Further when Maharashtra declared fixing the prices for non-COVID-19 treatment private hospitals challenged this before the Bombay High Court. In October 2020 the Court quashed the state order stating that states have no legislative competence to regulate prices for non-COVID-19 treatments. Subsequently in July this year the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the order of the Bombay High Court.

Non-compliance with state directives

Since the PSE has been done in an impromptu manner as an emergency response invoking the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 it does not seem to be well organised. As a consequence many private hospitals refused to comply with government guidelines and patients continued to be disenfranchised.

Despite state measures many private hospitals continue to indulge in exploitative and unethical practices such as exorbitant charging non-transparency in treatment and billing not informing patients about rate regulation and public schemes forcing them to pay hefty advances and denying admission without advance payment at the cost of affordability rational care and access to care for large sections of the population.

In Pune alone 1387 complaints of overcharging were received since August 2020. Such practices are not simply a failure to comply with the state orders but appear to be a manifestation of widespread commercialisation and business-driven strategies indicating how profit motives of private hospitals override their public obligations even in the face of a crisis.

Audits of COVID-19 bills in Maharashtra

In many cities state governments promptly issued a show-cause notice to private hospitals for flouting the state orders and the alleged refusal of beds for patients. The municipal corporations of Mumbai and Pune have conducted audits to detect the inflated bills and prevent overcharging by private hospitals. During the second wave of the pandemic around 70 auditors were put on the job in Mumbai.

A suo moto audit of around 11000 bills generated during December 2020 to April 2021 was done and a total of INR 15.75 crore were reduced or refunded by the hospitals. In Pune too two teams of auditors were deployed leading to a refund of INR 6.44 crore to patients.

While the initiative of bill audits is much needed and a welcome step such audits have been conducted only in a few cities. It does not seem to be an adequate and a sustainable mechanism given the rising number of COVID-19 patients hospitalisation and continued looting of patients by private hospitals. Instead a robust institutionalised mechanism for grievance redressal needs to be in place where patients can file their complaints and seek justice.

Problems and opportunities

The trajectory of state enforced PSE and regulatory measures implemented during the pandemic raise three significant points.

First while states attempted to requisition private sector services with a positive intent the implementation of these measures has often remained only partially effective and contested mainly due to the absence of an adequate legal framework to ensure public obligations of private providers.

Second it underlines the impacts of widespread commercialisation and growing corporatisation of private healthcare in India which is at odds with core public health goals. The pandemic has sharply revealed this contrast and has highlighted the profit-centred operation of the private sector which is often at the cost of rational ethical equitable and most importantly affordable healthcare for large sections of the population.

Third on a positive note the pandemic has also exhibited the potential of governments to harness private healthcare in public interest provided there exists the required political will. Taking this forward State-enforced ad-hoc regulatory measures taken during the pandemic now need to be up-scaled and institutionalised into comprehensive systemic regulation such as ensuring long pending implementation of the CEA across all Indian states.

Current policy landscape

Since many LMICs have plural health systems with a prominent private sector the international health systems global movement UHC 2030’s Private Sector Constituency opines how PSE is critical for achieving UHC. The National Health Policy of India includes an objective to align the growth of private healthcare with public health goals with reliance on strategic purchasing.

In 2019 the NITI Aayog announced a public-private partnership model to link the new and existing private medical colleges with functional district hospitals in the country. These policy documents recommended “moving together with” the private sector for expanding access to care.

However they do not seem to be taking adequate cognisance of learnings from previous critical experiences of Publicly Funded Health Insurance (PFHI) schemes the shortcomings in governance and the lack of effective regulation related to various Public-Private arrangements and widely known ill-effects of commercialisation and corporatisation of the private healthcare sector. Major new schemes with the PSE continue to be launched without efforts to put in place institutionalised regulatory mechanisms to safeguard public health goals.

PFHI schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) were supposed to contribute majorly to the provision of free COVID-19 care during the pandemic; however this promise does not seem to have been fulfilled.

Data as of May 2020 showed a nominal number of patients have availed free COVID-19 treatment under the PMJAY. More recent data on such numbers seems to be unavailable in the public domain. However there is considerable evidence that many PMJAY-enrolled private hospitals are not fulfilling the expectation of providing free care to COVID-19 patients. Given this situation the contribution of PMJAY during the pandemic comes under serious question.

Which way do we turn?

Undoubtedly the COVID-19 crisis will significantly reshape health systems as well as the mode of operation of private healthcare providers and their interaction with governments. These changes might unfold in two possible directions – under the pretext of COVID-19 related requirements policies may promote further privatisation creating a more favourable environment for financialization and expansion of corporate hospitals. This may be linked with greater public subsidisation and ‘strategic purchasing’ of care from the private sector.

On these lines the recent report of the NITI Aayog on Investment Opportunities in India’s Healthcare Sector celebrates how the pandemic has created growth opportunities for hospitals and infrastructure foreign investments expansion of the healthcare market and so on without any acknowledgement of widespread overcharging and other major hardships faced by people while seeking COVID-19-related care in unregulated private hospitals.

Taking an alternative view the COVID-19 crisis may be looked upon as a historic opportunity for re-imagining public health systems as well as their engagement with private healthcare – moving to majorly expand public health services and to socially re-embed private providers enhancing their public regulation and social responsiveness while moving in the direction of UHC.

In countries like India with mixed health systems dominated by private provisioning UHC cannot be envisaged without the involvement of the private sector. However to ensure the effective contribution of the private sector towards UHC it is necessary to powerfully realign the goals of private providers with UHC. While envisaging this process a key lesson from the pandemic is that PSE arrangements which leave control largely in hands of the private providers and continue to promote profit maximisation and desist from effectively rationalising the content of care (with negative consequences for costs) will fail to achieve the desired public health objective of ensuring access to equitable accountable and free healthcare.

Similarly lack of effective social accountability mechanisms of PSE arrangements allows private providers to use various loopholes to subvert core objectives such as the provision of free care. Further the lack of a comprehensive legal anchoring of regulation allows the private sector to legally challenge emergency-specific PSE arrangements.

Hence there is a need to develop institutionalised frameworks for regulated and accountable PSE which would place control firmly in the hands of public agencies and would work in a complementary manner with the public system. Such frameworks will need to confront the large-scale negative impacts of commercialisation while treating the UHC goals of ensuring equitable and affordable access to healthcare for all as paramount.

Today ironically the wheel is coming full-circle with the former oppressed becoming the oppressors as sexual and reproductive rights threaten to dominate more fundamental debates about sexual health reproduction and human rights.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been working in the area of sexual health since at least 1974 a year marked by the publication of a report entitled “Education and treatment in human sexuality” (WHO 1975). Later debates have compassed the terms and programs involved in the conceptualization and optimization of sexual health.

Further discussions have centered on terms and definitions of body integrity safe sex erotic concepts and reality sexual orientations and gender as well as reproductive health. Overall there is a strong consensus that sexual health mandates a respectful and affirmative view of sexuality and safe sex with partners being free to involve or stay out without fear discrimination or force.

Sexual health has been determined to comprise having access to reliable and current information about sex and sexuality as well as the risks of unsafe sex; being able to have healthcare for sex-related matters and being in a supportive environment. The risks of unsafe sex include sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) syphilis and gonorrhea as well as reproductive tract infections (RTIs).

The consequences of these events are not limited to the immediate infection but may cause infertility via tubal blockage cancers of the reproductive tract and pain. Another frequent sequel to the act of intercourse is unintended pregnancy.

Cultures around the world but often in Islamic countries have practiced forms of female genital mutilation (FGM) that have led to painful sexual intercourse endometriosis infertility and perineal trauma with further injury to the uterine supports. Sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction are other areas of concern.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are now commonly recognized as human rights internationally. However this change has come as part of larger social and political changes. After the release of the 1975 document researchers have traced four distinct stages in the acceptance of SRHR as human rights.

The reproductive health phase

Initially concerns with sexual health were intimately linked to the goals of population control following the first Population Conference (1954) in Rome and the second at Belgrade in 1965. Both were focused on population growth and the experts present were mostly demographic or population specialists.

The impetus for population control programs was mostly ill-founded based on the beliefs that 1) population growth is the chief cause of poverty 2) population growth hampers development and 3) with a higher population in a given area the resources available for each individual are restricted. The feeling was supported by blaring headlines of accelerating world population which was inevitably linked to mass starvation creating a security threat to the country involved.

The result was the application of financial and social pressures as well as outright force to bring down the rate of population growth and reduce the rate of conception. This was explicitly stated at the 1968 International Conference on Human Rights at Teheran which linked human rights to population control for the first time.

The irony of the situation whereby a supposed advancement in human rights was to be ushered in by coercive and discriminatory practices is exquisite. This ushered in the Bucharest World Conference on Population (1974) where a World Population Plan of Action (WPPA) was adopted.

This brought back respect and freedom for human rights against a background of population control by insisting on education and responsibility for individuals involved in the conception and birth of progeny. Importantly this brought individuals and not just couples the freedom to use contraception. It also elevated the status of women within a family to the rightful one of equality.

In 1984 in Mexico City two important controversies came to the fore which continue to create a stir today – that of pro-life or anti-abortion championed by the USA and the Vatican and the fact that China was actively using coercion to accomplish its population control goals thereby rendering the Bucharest resolution defunct.

The objections to this model are two-fold namely the perception of the female body as a tool for population goals rather than considering the woman as a full citizen in this area; and secondly the failure to address structural inequalities in the social system that hampered development instead of shifting the load on to female fertility control. This triggered the next phase.

International conference on population and development Cairo (ICPD 1994):

The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (1993) emphasized the need to guarantee full rights to female citizens as well as abolish discrimination of all sorts against women focusing in particular on SRHR. This led to the unveiling of a new paradigm: “Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights.”

This led to a viewpoint in which population issues were extended beyond fertility control to the free enjoyment of unforced safe sex and pregnancy. This instantaneously shifted the tone of coercive governmental population control from an accepted voice to that of an illegal effort.

The ICPD’s approach has been defined as horizontal holistic and human rights-based contrary to the technical/vertical view of the population control paradigm.”

The consensus here was that governments can only act to achieve population control based on human rights. New definitions emerged including reproductive rights incorporating not only contraceptive rights but the “right” to abort one’s fetus as a basic human right.

This conference saw the term “family” being applied to those who were not part of a traditional heterosexual monogamous marriage a forerunner of today’s wild variety of lifestyles that are given this title. Another trend first recognized here was the fierce defense of the term “right to life” as applied to the pregnant woman as against the equally valid right to life of the fetus in her womb.

Using unsafe abortion as a talking point the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) cleverly obtained the consent of the member states for all abortions framing it as a threat to the woman’s right to life. This overlooks the fact that while unsafe abortion may most unfortunately compromise the woman’s life in several instances legalizing universal abortion deprives the fetus of the right to life in every single case.

Equality and anti-discrimination rights have also been leveraged to obtain wider acceptance for legal abortions irrespective of any medical indication for the same. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) explained in 1999 that “it is discriminatory for a State Party to refuse to provide legally for the performance of certain reproductive health services for women.”

Three international treaties the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and CEDAW thus built a legal framework where SRHR was accorded a full-blown status.

This right of women to control their own reproduction was recognized again in the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (PfA). The dissenting voice of the Vatican City was heard in this and previous conferences as it expressed the Judeo-Christian viewpoint that women’s rights could be advanced only by recognizing the human truths about both sexes and rejecting the SRHR as individualistic.

The post-IPCD stage

The following years were marked by fragmentation where SRHR was recognized as being key to gender equality and measurable markers were described. Though the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) led to the establishment of a target that of reducing maternal mortality by 75%. The term “maternal health” was introduced instead of “reproductive health” leading to harsh criticism for excluding female sexuality and reproduction in favor of maternal health.

The latest 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015) does mention universal access to both sexual and reproductive healthcare services thus winning the approval of pro-choice organizations for their “life-cycle” approach.

In 2016 the CESCR took this further commenting that SRHR are indivisible from and interdependent with other human rights and especially focusing on women’s SRHR as part of their full human rights. While establishing a legal obligation to protect and fulfill SRHR including the requirement that members states provide access to health services and information including legal federally-funded abortion services this document prevents individuals and states with pro-life convictions from exercising their rights to live by their beliefs.

States must take steps to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare including emergency contraception and access to safe abortion services. States are required to provide comprehensive education about sexual and reproductive health for all and to take measures to eradicate social barriers that prevent individuals from exercising their right to sexual and reproductive health.”

Conclusion

The future doubtless holds further development of this concept despite the hounding of all opponents as religious fundamentalists and oppressors. It seems necessary to recognize all citizens of Planet Earth as equal and to respect their views irrespective of whether they fit in with currently popular perspectives. Perhaps a more sincere effort to understand one another and to dialogue rather than calling each other names or rejecting opposing views would produce a final outcome that might serve the world better.

On Sunday Senator Joe Manchin appeared to kill it.“I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can’t” Manchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I’ve tried everything humanly possible. I can’t get there.” Bret Baier the Fox News anchor asked Manchin if this was a definitive no. “This is a no on this legislation” Manchin replied. After the show the Democrat from West Virginia put out a statement confirming his position.

The White House expressed shock and outrage at Manchin’s declaration which he attributed to concerns about rising inflation the national debt and the need to fight COVID. On Thursday after Biden spoke with Manchin by phone the President issued a statement that said “I believe that we will bridge our differences and advance the Build Back Better plan.” The White House also said that discussions with Manchin would continue this week. Evidently Manchin had other plans. According to Politico his office informed the White House about his appearance on “Fox News Sunday” less than thirty minutes before it took place and Manchin himself then refused to take a call from an aide to the President. Later on Sunday Jen Psaki Biden’s press secretary issued a lengthy statement in which she said that Manchin’s comments on Fox “represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator’s colleagues in the House and Senate.” Psaki added “Just as Senator Manchin reversed his position on Build Back Better this morning we will continue to press him to see if he will reverse his position yet again to honor his prior commitments and be true to his word.”

Exchanges of this nature are catnip to the White House press corps and will likely dominate coverage for days. The fact is however that the Build Back Better legislation has always been hostage to Manchin’s de-facto veto power in an evenly divided Senate. During his interview with Baier Manchin claimed that he had told Chuck Schumer the Senate Majority Leader this summer that he wouldn’t support a spending bill bigger than $1.5 trillion over ten years. At the time Democratic leaders were working on a $3.5-trillion package. In October at Biden’s instigation this figure was reduced to $1.75 trillion by cutting some programs and limiting the duration of others. On November 19th the House passed a $2.2-trillion version of Biden’s plan but Manchin continued to withhold his support and dismissed many of its cost reductions as gimmicks. Manchin claimed vindication when the Congressional Budget Office in response to Republican requests released a letter earlier this month estimating that the programs in the bill if they were continued for ten years would raise the deficit by about $3 trillion without further revenue offsets. (The White House in fact had always acknowledged that further offsets would be needed in future years.) On Sunday Manchin cited the C.B.O. finding and said that Democrats should pick their top priorities and fund them for a full ten years.

This seemed to leave open the possibility of the Senate passing a smaller bill with a few fully funded programs sometime in the New Year. But the grand ambitions of the Build Back Better plan are now shattered and the country will be worse off for it. As Bob Greenstein a veteran budget expert explained to me in August the plan was “probably the most far-reaching in the area of social provision in improving the lives of tens of millions of people of any since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in the nineteen-sixties.” Just one of its original planks—making permanent the expanded child tax credit which was introduced as part of February’s pandemic relief bill—would reduce child poverty by nearly half according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. The green-energy components of the original plan although they didn’t go as far as some environmentalists wanted included financial incentives designed to decarbonize the electric grid by 2030 a key requirement in reducing carbon emissions.

In one of several efforts to placate Manchin Democrats drastically scaled back these two elements of the original plan: the House bill funded the expanded child tax credit for just one year and it eliminated the proposal to decarbonize the electrical grid. Given these and other changes the bill that passed by the House was far from perfect. But something is better than nothing in Washington and most progressives and environmentalists lined up behind the revised bill. Now that it appears to be kaput numerous questions will be asked of Democrats. Why didn’t Schumer take Manchin’s $1.5-trillion figure more seriously? Did members of the House Progressive Caucus err when in November they dropped their pledge not to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill until the passage of the Build Back Better bill? What was Biden’s strategy? And did the White House raise expectations too high with its initial $3.5-trillion package? For too long Biden seemed to rely on public pressure and pressure from within the Democratic Party to persuade Manchin to modify his stance. In retrospect this was a long shot. Manchin represents a state that Trump won by nearly forty points in 2020.

What are Manchin’s real motivations? When Baier brought up his ties to the coal industry including family investments in coal companies Manchin argued that the country needed “dependability” in its sources of energy. In sinking the bill he has frustrated efforts to definitively move beyond coal. If the Republicans regain control of Capitol Hill next November this victory of special interests over the public interest may turn out to be a permanent one. That would be Manchin’s real legacy.

These political questions will for a time consume Washington’s political class. For the country as a whole the issue is: How will the nation ever address the enduring market failures glaring inequality and big social-safety-net gaps that the Build Back Better plan was designed to tackle? The cost of the historic plan even using the full ten-year expense estimates totals less than two per cent of G.D.P. per year—an amount eminently fundable through tax increases and bond issues if there was adequate political will. Climate change isn’t going away; it’s intensifying. Neither are child-care needs or exorbitant health-care costs. Most immediately the expanded child tax credit which currently aids thirty-five million families will end this month. “Maybe Senator Manchin can explain to the millions of children who have been lifted out of poverty in part due to the Child Tax Credit why he wants to end a program that is helping achieve this milestone” Psaki said in her statement on Sunday. “We cannot.”"

El atleta del Playas de Castellón Kwizera Rodrigue consiguió la victoria en el 41 Cross Internacional de Venta de Baños (Palencia) seguido del etíope Nibret Melak que ha aguantado el ritmo del corredor de Burundi mientras que en la carrera femenina la ganadora indiscutible en su debut en España ha sido la keniana Edinah Jebitok.

El corredor natural de Burundi ha ofrecido una carrera espectacular en un circuito se presentaba como pocas veces para correr con una temperatura agradable sol y nada de barro y en una carrera que por primera vez lucía la etiqueta Gold ya que el Cross de Venta de Baños ha sido incluido en el World Cross Country Tour donde están las 14 mejores pruebas de campo a través del mundo.

Con el de Venta de Baños que este año contaba con participantes de alto nivel el eritreo Kwizera Rodrigue (11º en el Campeonato del Mundo ganador este año de Itálica Cantimpalos y Castellón) ha ganado su sexto cross en España esta temporada y se ha confirmado como el mejor crossista del momento.

En segundo lugar ha cruzado la meta el etíope Nibret Melak en su debut en Venta de Baños seguido del ugandés Albert Chemutai que ganó el último Cross de Venta de Baños celebrado en 2019 y ya en la tercera vuelta empezó a sufrir al entrar en la arena.

Ha sido en los dos últimos kilómetros donde se ha decidido la carrera entre Rodrigue y Melak que han ido pegados todo el recorrido al ritmo que ha marcado Rodrigue y le ha intentado pasar en la última vuelta sin conseguirlo.

En el grupo de los españoles ha destacado la carrera del doble campeón de España Carlos Mayo que ha sido el cuarto clasificado y el primer español en cruzar la línea de meta seguido del canario Nassin Hassaous y de Adel Mechaal quinto y sexto respectivamente en la línea meta.

En la absoluta femenina la campeona indiscutible ha sido la keniana olímpica en Tokio 2020 Edinah Jebitok que en su debut en España ha llegado a meta en un tiempo de 28':38"" y ha sacado una distancia considerable a la segunda clasificada la etíope Likina Amebaw (ganadora del Cross de Castellón 2021).

(Cuartoscuro)

El Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) aclaró que no cobrara impuestos a los contribuyentes por hacer depósitos bancarios el próximo año como se difundió desde hace algunos días aunque sí contempla acciones para reducir la defraudación fiscal.

Aseguró que los depósitos bancarios por concepto de gastos de padres a hijos o viceversa pago por venta de catálogo (cosméticos utensilios de cocina y del hogar aceites esenciales etcétera) tandas o préstamos personales no se les vigilará ni cobrará algún tipo de impuesto.

“Es importante aclarar que no se cobra impuestos por depósitos en efectivo y tampoco se incorporó en esta miscelánea fiscal. La propuesta que se realizó al respecto gira en torno a que las instituciones financieras otorguen información mensual de aquellos contribuyentes que estén bajo un proceso de alguna auditoría fiscalización o revisión por parte del SAT” puntualizó.

Esta confusión que alertó a los contribuyentes se presentó ante la propuesta que hizo la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP) de incluir en el Paquete Económico 2022 que los bancos entreguen información relacionada con los depósitos en efectivo de manera mensual y no anual.

Pero esta medida reiteró el SAT será cuando los contribuyentes estén en proceso de revisión entonces los bancos estarán obligados a informarle cada mes los ingresos en efectivo para una fiscalización más exacta que coadyuve en las auditorías que estén activas.

Recordó que las auditorías se realizan año tras año a un universo pequeño de contribuyentes ya que de 70 millones solo se revisa a 10 mil; se cruza la información de lo que declaran con los depósitos bancarios y se coteja con los datos que brindan las instituciones financieras.

La marca italiana consiguió su récord de ventas en 2019 y espera romperlo de nuevo en 2021.

El pasado por cuestiones lógicas fue un curso entre paréntesis algo que vemos por ejemplo al comprar las matriculaciones en España mes a mes donde se ofrece también el dato de los dos años precedentes.

Por cuestiones derivadas del coronavirus el fabricante no pudo mejorar sus cifras de 2019 año en el que consiguió comercializar 8.205 unidades lo que supuso un crecimiento del 43% respecto al ejercicio previo.

Encarando ya los últimos días de este año los datos dejan claro que aunque sea de una manera ligera conseguirán batir de nuevo su mejor marca de nuevo impulsados por el buen hacer del Lamborghini Urus.

Con presencia en América Europa Oriente Medio África y Asia con 168 concesionarios en 51 países el reparto de ventas es el siguiente: 38% para la región EMEA 35% en el mercado americano y un 27% en Asia-Pacífico.

El responsable de Relaciones Públicas de Automobili Lamborghini para la región EMEA Emanuele Camerini ha apuntado que “Lamborghini ha pasado a ser una marca pionera con un gran nombre gracias a modelos icónicos como el Miura el Espada el Countach o el LM002 a convertirse en una marca de lujo símbolo de la progresión humana”.

Además señala a partir de ahora “continuaremos con el nuevo capítulo iniciado en 2021 hacia una nueva era la de una Lamborghini más sostenible guiada por valores como la audacia y la autenticidad”.

Y concluye que en el futuro a corto plazo la inversión de 1.500 millones de euros prevista dará como fruto en 2024 una gama 100% electrificada y la llegada del primer Lamborghini eléctrico que le convertirá en “un nuevo punto de referencia en la industria”."

But there's a way out of it.

Earlier in December some users discovered their privacy settings gave future permission to Verizon to track their data usage without their knowledge. It seemed to affect customers who were previously part of a rewards program which had become the Customer Experience Plus program. That's separate from the Customer Experience program which an even greater number of users were automatically opted into.

Both according to the Verizon website track browsing history location data and usage patterns — to help the company ""personalize our communications with you give you more relevant product and service recommendations and develop plans services and offers that are more appealing to you.""

In recent days the telecommunications company finally started reaching out to users that were unwittingly part of the programs as The Verge reported. The texts and emails shared more about the programs and how to unsubscribe from the automatic enrollment.

Verizon put out an informational page earlier this month alerting customers that they would be notified about program options. All users have 30 days to opt out before the program officially kicks off sometime in early in 2022.

Since it's an opt-out situation that puts the onus on you to make the necessary changes. Here's how you can check to see if you're enrolled in either program and the steps you can take to turn off one or both.

That $48 million fine Verizon incurred from the Federal Communications Commission in 2020 because the agency said the company failed to protect customer location data didn't seem to have a lasting effect on its data and privacy practices.

The latest story published on The latest story published on Magenta's network-dedicated newsroom webpage arguably fits that description to the letter blending impertinence with tackiness to unconventionally (at least by the rest of the wireless industry's standards) flaunt T-Mo's subjective (and objective) 5G infrastructure supremacy.





The result is a moderately humorous and exceptionally adorable comparison between three gingerbread houses each meant to represent the size of a major US carrier's 5G network. As you may already be aware T-Mobile's next-gen cellular signal currently covers nearly twice the surface of AT&T's comparable technology and four times (!!!) Verizon's fastest mobile connectivity so naturally said gingerbread houses are designed to illustrate that huge difference as accurately as possible.









Unfortunately there are no actual 5G-themed treats you can buy before Christmas to show your support for your favorite ""Un-carrier"" which further suggests T-Mobile is slowly losing its ""edge"" trying to send customers a slightly more sober marketing message while completely ditching the ""dumb and dumber"" name-calling of its rivals from John Legere's CEO years.





As part of a series of unorthodox ads and publicity stunts dubbed ""If 5G Were..."" today's magenta blue and red-coated gingerbread houses follow in the footsteps of a pumpkin-themed comparison from just a couple of months back and a somewhat predictable trio of snowpeople exactly one year ago (among others).





The aim of course is to depict T-Mo's 5G strengths outside boring coverage maps although to get the full story of how far ahead of the competition this operator really is you'll also have to check out some of those independent reports tracking average nationwide speeds . In other words that significantly larger house also happens to have a stronger foundation solid hardwood floors and nicer furniture.





There's nothing more festive than huge corporations using Christmas as a backdrop for highlighting their various competitive advantages over equally massive companies. All irony aside everyone likes a good holiday laugh and T-Mobile's Verizon and AT&T-deriding publicity stunts are often just brazen and well tacky enough to at least mildly entertain even the most hardcore fans of the ""Un-carrier's"" arch-rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL2thdGUtbWNraW5ub24td2Fsay12ZXJpem9uLWNvbW1lcmNpYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate McKinnon Walk Verizon Commercial: Viewers Talk 'SNL' Star's Gait,"Home > Television Walking in High Heels Might Not Be Kate McKinnon’s Strong Suit By Dan Clarendon Dec. 18 2021 Published 12:03 p.m. ET Source: Verizon

Now that its former “Can you hear me now?” guy is shilling for rival wireless network T-Mobile Verizon has enlisted a two-time Emmy winner to appeal to viewers. But it seems those who have seen Kate McKinnon’s Verizon television commercials have just one question on their mind: Why does she walk the way she does in those commercials and as one forum user added “Is that her normal gait?”

On Reddit one viewer had an empathetic theory. “Honestly she walks around like she’s never worn heels which is likely” that person wrote. “Why wouldn’t they just put her in flats or some other sensible shoe option that lets her walk comfortably?” Other people however weren’t so kind…

Viewers compared her walk to that of a velociraptor Frankenstein’s monster… or even a pregnant yak.

In the same Reddit thread — and in this one — viewers subjected Kate to unflattering comparisons. Here’s a sampling: “She walks like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park in those heels. I’ve never seen a woman less graceful in heels than her.” “She walks like she took a big ol’ dump but there wasn’t any toilet paper in the bathroom. So she’s actually on her way to another bathroom to find toilet paper but trying to be discreet about it and shoot the commercial first.”

“She walks like the alien lizard inside her is failing to walk like a human. Every time I watch her I think of Ed from Men in Black.” “Why the hell does Kate McKinnon walk like Frankenstein’s monster?” “She clearly never learned to walk in heels and so looks like a pregnant yak when she tries.”

Viewers don’t know what’s up with her hand in her pocket either.

OK maybe viewers have two questions about Kate’s Verizon ads. Another Reddit thread is titled “What is the reason Kate McKinnon awkwardly keeps her hand in her pocket through the majority of this Verizon commercial?”

One commenter pointed out that Kate also keeps one hand in her pocket — Alanis Morissette-style — in her Tostitos commercial with Dan Levy. “Maybe she’s just comfortable with her hand in her pocket?” another commented added. “Maybe she’s fondling the fat stack of cash she made to be in their ad. Who cares? LOL let her live.”

Alexander disclosed his communications -- and the relevant materials turned over to the Jan. 6 House select committee -- in a new lawsuit challenging the panel from obtaining his phone records from Verizon.

""Alexander received a notice from Verizon that the Select Committee had subpoenaed Verizon for nine categories of information associated with Alexander's personal cell phone number including IP addresses devices billing addresses account changes a list of contacts call session times and dozens to hundreds of other data points or metadata from November 1 2020 ... to January 31 2021"" according to a Friday complaint filed against lawmakers on the committee and Verizon.

Alexander had challenged the grounds for obtaining his cellphone communication saying in the complaint the data is ""not pertinent to the investigation and sweeps up privileged communications between Alexander and clergy Alexander and people he spiritually counsels and Alexander and his respective attorneys.""

According to the complaint Alexander testified to the committee on Dec. 9 that he ""had a few phone conversations"" with Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. potentially texted Rep. Mo Brooks R-Ala. and spoke in person to Rep. Andy Biggs R-Ariz.

All three GOP lawmakers were involved in the efforts to challenge the electoral results on Jan. 6 and participated in meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill on the subject.

Brooks released Saturday night what he said was the text he received from Alexander showing the activist introducing himself on Dec. 16 2020 and calling Jan. 6 ""a big moment for our republic."" Brooks said he did not recognize the number at the time and called the contents ""benign"" anyway.

""The insinuation that this single text to Congressman Brooks from an unknown number by someone claiming to be 'Ali Alexander' somehow suggests Congressman Brooks in any way helped plan the Capitol attack is absurd outrageous and defamatory"" Brooks wrote in a statement.

Alexander had boasted in a social media video in January that he had worked with the GOP lawmakers to challenge the election results. He did not take part in storming the Capitol.

""In January Mr. Alexander held an organizing call where Members of Congress might have been present and some were invited. He doesn't recall who was in attendance because there was no roll call of attendees because the call was so large"" the complaint reads.

Alexander also spoke over the phone with Kimberly Guilfoyle Donald Trump Jr.'s partner and a Trump campaign fundraiser and told investigators it was a ""short and pleasant"" conversation about the Georgia Senate runoffs and GOP primaries in 2022 according to the complaint.

In January after the Capitol riot Biggs's office told ABC News the congressman was ""not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point -- let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest on January 6.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvbmZsL25ld3MvbmZsLW5ldHdvcmstY2hhbm5lbC1zdHJlYW0tc2F0dXJkYXktZ2FtZXMvM3pkMGl1aHhoOTY0MTI0eDE1ZGlvcWJ6eNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What channel is NFL Network?

For the first time in history a Type 1 diabetes patient was cured of the disease with a new treatment a clinical trial report claims giving hope to millions around the world who may soon be able to live a normal life soon. 64-year-old Brian Shelton participated in a clinical trial by Vertex Pharmaceuticals which has been testing a treatment for decades. He received his first cell infusion of stem cells which acts like insulin-producing pancreas cells that his body lacked earlier this year after the disease had completely taken over his life. Shelton was the first patient to be injected on June 29. After thirty years and over $50 million later Vertex Pharmaceuticals has managed to completely cure a patient. Shelton’s body now “miraculously” completely controls its insulin and blood sugar levels automatically.

“It’s a whole new life” Shelton said in The New York Times report. “It’s like a miracle.”

“It is a remarkable result” Dr. Peter Butler a diabetes expert at the University of California Los Angeles said in the report.

“To be able to reverse diabetes by giving them back the cells they are missing is comparable to the miracle when insulin was first available 100 years ago.”

What is diabetes?

Diabetes occurs when the body’s blood glucose also called blood sugar is too high. Normally when that occurs the brain signals the pancreas to release insulin which acts as a key to letting the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.

Those with diabetes either do not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or the body cells are not responsive to the available insulin (type 2 diabetes).

When there isn’t enough insulin blood sugar stays in the body’s bloodstream and over time can cause serious health problems including heart disease vision loss and kidney disease.

There has not been a cure for diabetes or any such hope until the latest medical discovery. Now the study will continue for five years and will attempt to treat around 17 other people with a severe case of Type 1 diabetes. If deemed successful the study will give over 9 million people around the world who are suffering with the disease a chance to majorly change their life. This will also have a major impact in Qatar given that an estimate of 10% of Qatar’s total deaths is linked to diabetes. In addition more than 17% of the Gulf nation’s population are known to have diabetes which can greatly affect their health if not monitored and treated accordingly.

Once considered heir apparent to be CEO of the Deerfield-based retail pharmacy giant Gourlay joined the company through Walgreens’ merger with Alliance Boots. In 2016 he was promoted from executive vice president to co-chief operating officer. He stepped down as co-chief operating officer in May and currently is serving as senior adviser to CEO Rosalind Brewer until year-end at which point he will depart the company altogether and return to the United Kingdom.

Through a land trust Gourlay and his wife paid $8 million in 2016 for the 15-room 7018-square-foot mansion on Longwood Avenue. Built in 2007 by Tara Homes the mansion is on a bluff overlooking the lake and has seven full bathrooms four half bathrooms three fireplaces two kitchens an elevator serving all floors and a four-car attached garage. Outside on the 0.96-acre property are a private beach and custom-designed limestone terraces.

Listing agent Kathryn Mangel could not be reached for comment.

The mansion had a $166141 property tax bill in the 2020 tax year.

Public records do not yet identify the buyer.

The transaction is one of the highest recorded sale prices in Glencoe history. The village’s highest recorded sale price is the $19.5 million sale in 2014 of a lakefront home to Groupon co-founder Eric Lefkofsky. Meanwhile in 2018 the 12-acre Hoover estate on Green Bay Road sold for $10 million to a real estate developer.

The deal also produced the second-highest-priced suburban home sale in 2021. In October a seven-bedroom 8700-square-foot lakefront mansion in Kenilworth sold for $9.45 million. And within Chicago proper three residences — two homes in Lincoln Park and one penthouse condo — have sold for $9.5 million or more this year.

The holidays are the season of gratitude no doubt but more importantly it's the season of pies. You could even say that Thanksgiving marks the onset of the pie season that goes on well until the end of Christmas.

The day that shoppers find out their favorite supermarket stores have started stocking up on the first festive pies is a day of great joy. From there on it's a race to the store to hunt down the baked good and buy one before it quickly sells out. If you don't believe it in 2008 The American Pie Council (yes there is such a thing) found that about 186 million pies were sold in the U.S. in supermarkets alone. Not counting how many pies that bakery stores and restaurants sell the council said that supermarkets alone generate $700 million in revenue through pies. That's a whole lot of dough!

The National Grocers Association in 2017 also found that 18.9 million pies were sold just during Thanksgiving. If the association's more recent findings are any indication the survey conducted by The American Pie Council a decade ago is still very much relevant!

While all these million dollar figures may seem like unimpressive mathematical jargon you might be surprised to find just many pies Walmart sells. And it's not just an annual sky-high number — Walmart sells a ridiculously high number of pies in a matter of minutes (via Chewboom).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnMxNy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3dheW5lLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzLzEtbWlsbGlvbi1ib25kLXNldC1mb3ItbWFuLW5hYmJlZC1mb3ItZHJ1Zy10cmFmZmlja2luZy1pbi13YWxtYXJ0LXBhcmtpbmctbG90LWluLWdvbGRzYm9yby1wb2xpY2Utc2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$1 million bond set for man nabbed for drug trafficking in Walmart parking lot Goldsboro police say,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/wayne-county-news/1-million-bond-set-for-man-nabbed-for-drug-trafficking-in-walmart-parking-lot-in-goldsboro-police-say/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnMxNy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3dheW5lLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzLzEtbWlsbGlvbi1ib25kLXNldC1mb3ItbWFuLW5hYmJlZC1mb3ItZHJ1Zy10cmFmZmlja2luZy1pbi13YWxtYXJ0LXBhcmtpbmctbG90LWluLWdvbGRzYm9yby1wb2xpY2Utc2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhbG1hcnQtYXBvbG9naXplcy13b21hbi1zYXlzLWJsYWNrLTIwNDcwOTAzMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart apologizes after woman says Black dolls more expensive than white ones,"The Kentucky mother found that a Black version of a doll set was more than 50% more expensive than the white one

While trying to teach her kids about their heritage a Kentucky mother found that finding diverse toys comes at a price.

Asheria Brown a mother of three was looking for a more diverse version of a doll set that her daughter had found at a Walmart store.

When she found the set online she was shocked to see that the Black doll set was over 50% more expensive than the white one.

“There are seven Black babies and there are seven white babies” said Brown about the doll sets available on Walmart.com. “But one set is $39.97; the other is $25.”

Brown who thought it could have been an isolated issue was astonished to see that across different stores the Black dolls consistently cost more than the white versions.

Professor and doll historian at Duke University Dr. Sabrina Thomas said that the issue stems from racial inequality in the production of toys.

“The problem I believe when we look at these discrepancies in pricing is that toy manufacturers do not produce Black dolls in proportion to the number of people in the human population” she said citing that Black dolls are less commonly made and often hand-crafted.

The Kentucky mother said that the Black doll set is 14 dollars and 97 cents more expensive than the white one. The pricing has since been corrected. (Photo Credit: Asheria Brown/WCPO Cinncinati/Walmart.com)

A spokeswoman from Walmart told WCPO Cinncinati that the company lowered the price on select toys including the white version of the dolls to help drive up sales.

“Unfortunately we overlooked the impact these changes would have on similar items. This was an unintentional error and we sincerely apologize to anyone it may have offended” the spokeswoman said. She also said price adjustments have been made to both sets and now the prices are the same.

This is not the first time however that Walmart has been called out for racial-based price differences.

In 2014 the company listed a Black ice skater Barbie at $11.87 and listed the white one at $9.88.

“They should always be the same price across all ethnicities” said a spokesperson for Walmart in response to that issue. “This is just a pricing error. We corrected it immediately.”

One of my favorite holiday candies is English Toffee and when I last visited Disneyland they were sold out resort-wide! So to make up for the toffee I’d usually bring home I decided to make some of my own to share with my family and neighbors for Christmas. English Toffee may seem scary to make but I’ll walk you through it!

Christmastime Traditions

It should come as no surprise that I love Christmas. I fully deck out my house in holiday decorations Christmas music plays on any available speaker and I love to binge-watch Christmas movies with my family. I’ve decorated my yard with homemade signs from the classic holiday movie “Elf” and I think I did a pretty good job!

My favorite holiday story is Charles Dicken’s “A Christmas Carol” which was published December 19 1843. It has a timeless message about treating everyone with kindness generosity and compassion that embodies the spirit of Christmas. Over the years there have been countless versions of the classic story. Some of my favorite adaptations are the Muppets version (so funny and family-friendly) and Mickey’s Christmas Carol but the best one (in my opinion) is the Jim Carey version from 2009.

I love Victorian-era England and always enjoy a good piece of English Toffee (even if it isn’t necessarily a British invention!). I try to bring home at least 2 bags of English Toffee home from every visit to Disneyland but since they were out this time around I figured my copycat version would make for a good replacement.

In a large saucepan over medium heat add butter sugar water and corn syrup and bring to a boil. When the temperature reaches 245º F add nuts and stir constantly. Continue cooking until mixture reaches 285º F or turns a light brown color then quickly and carefully pour sugar mixture onto the prepared pan.





While the toffee is cooling melt semi-sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler. Spread half of the melted chocolate evenly over the toffee and sprinkle 1 cup of chopped almonds evenly over the chocolate. Carefully flip the toffee slab over and repeat the process with the chocolate and nuts Allow toffee to cool completely but do not place toffee in the refrigerator to speed up the process. Once the toffee is cooled break into smaller pieces.

Now that we’ve made the English Toffee now it’s time to give the candy some nice packaging. I love to give gifts with thoughtful handmade touches and this simple cloth bag makes a nice statement. Here’s a quick guide to making a bag perfect for giving your English Toffee to your friends and family.

I measured the plastic bags that I am going to put the toffee in and added a few extra inches to my selected fabric.

I cut it out with the fold of the fabric on the bottom of the bag. With the right sides together (the pretty side of the fabric) make a 1/4” seam (straight stitch) along the long sides of the fabric and leave the short end opposite of the fold open.

Turn the fabric inside out and make sure that you pull the corners out carefully with a pin you can press the edges with an iron if you want and then stitch again a little wider than the original seam. This will encase the frayed/raw edges of your seams…hence a French seam.

Cut the top of the fabric with decorative pinking shears (made for fabric and not paper). I used scalloped scissors and there is also a zig zag scissor you can use.





Finish off with a pretty bow and a beautiful tag.

A just-opened exhibit at the Met “Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts” showcases how historical European design influenced both the animator and those that worked for him.

The exhibition goes back to the post-World War I era when a 16-year-old Disney travelled to France to work for the Red Cross. He fell in love with the buildings and the art. A subsequent trip through Europe in 1935 when he was in his 30s provided further inspiration. He filmed the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles during those travels; decades later its design would be used as a clear reference by Disney artists for the backdrop for the famed ballroom scene in 1991’s “Beauty and the Beast.”

9 Just a week old the exhibit has already drawn excited crowds and lines outside of its galleries. Stefano Giovannini

“He sucked it all up like a sponge” said 36-year-old Wolf Burchard a Met associate who curated the new display which is on until March 6 and already drawing lines outside the galleries.

Disney’s travels also opened his eyes to gothic revival architecture which made its way into 1950’s “Cinderella” and of medieval art which inspired the look of 1959’s “Sleeping Beauty.”

While some inspirations — such as modeling “Sleeping Beauty” off of medieval tapestries — are direct and specific Disney drew on others such as rococo references for the Lumiere character in “Beauty and the Beast” more generally.

“The end product often doesn’t look like the original source of inspiration — and I think that’s really important” said Burchard. “Because that shows that Disney animators are not just unimaginatively copying their forebears but they’re actually creating something new.”

Here the backstories of four items and how they influenced Walt Disney and Co.

Tiny rooms big dreams

Disneyland in California — the fantasy park that opened in 1955 across 160 acres of former orange groves — finds its roots in something much smaller. The late American artist Narcissa Niblack Thorne’s 1930s miniature period rooms — dozens of small-scale reproductions of stately European American and Asian interiors — caught the eye of Walt Disney in 1939 while on display in San Francisco. “These rooms were created for Americans who couldn’t travel [abroad] … and because they’re so extremely accurate they really help in the imaginative leap of traveling” said Burchard. At the Met visitors can see Thorne’s roughly 18 by 24 by 23-inch miniature French boudoir from the Louis XV period which shows a room crowned with a chandelier that’s surrounded by walls with ornate moldings. Such detailed re-creations compelled Disney to initially conceive of Disneyland as a model town with particular attention to imaginative play. “They are about this childlike fantasy” said Burchard of Thorne’s rooms. “This idea of escapism of letting your imagination run free — children looking at it and letting their minds travel.”

Flower power

The visual inspiration for “Sleeping Beauty” was the floral “Unicorn Tapestries” designed in Paris and woven in the southern Netherlands in the 1500s. The Met acquired the tapestries in 1937 and put them on display at the Cloisters uptown. Disney employee John Hench took in the tapestries during a 1950s trip to NYC. “[He] returned to Los Angeles suggesting to Disney that the ‘Unicorn Tapestries’ really should be a template for the aesthetics and for the storytelling of ‘Sleeping Beauty’ ” said Burchard. “Disney then employed the art director Eyvind Earle to create exactly that stage set and it’s considered one of the most artistically sophisticated of all films.” At the new exhibit visitors can see a vibrant gouache work of Earle’s “Sleeping Beauty” concept art which shows a thatched cottage surrounded by trees and plants — all of which are in saturated tones and crisp focus. The idea is “stepping into a tapestry where the foreground and the background are reproduced in the same level of detail” Burchard said. According to the exhibit’s catalogue Earle once said “I rearranged the bushes and trees in geometrical patterns. I made a medieval tapestry out of the surface wherever possible. All my foregrounds were tapestry designs of decorative weeds and flowers.”

Let there be light

Candlesticks from France’s 18th-century rococo period — a time known for its highly ornamental designs — served as inspiration for Disney animators to develop the just-as-flamboyant Lumiere character in “Beauty and the Beast.” In the exhibit a 1991 work of concept art for Lumiere is paired with a gilt bronze candlestick made between 1735 and 1750 by the designer Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier.

9 The inspiration for Lumiere came from rococo candlesticks. This one by Meissonnier is a good example for showing its abstract shapes bringing movement to an otherwise inanimate object. Courtesy of The Met

The inspiration for Lumiere isn’t specific to this one candlestick but rather the period aesthetic overall; both pieces aim to show visitors how somewhat theatrical design can breathe life into inanimate objects. The concept art from the film shows “the melting wax that forms [Lumiere’s] shifty-looking face and then you have the shiny metal candlestick itself and you can see how the arms move to inform how the animation works” said Burchard. Meanwhile the 18th-century candlestick perched on a rotating platform shows off a series of glittery curves that give a sense of movement to an otherwise ordinary object. “This is a different type of animation” said Burchard. “This is how pre-cinema and pre-hand drawn animation the rococo designers were trying to animate the object through … undulations and carrying the eye across a complicated abstract surface. It’s the most incredible work.”

Mi castle su castle

Inside the exhibit’s last gallery viewers get a look at four towering French porcelain vases capped with pink and green domes. Standing next to each other the vases bear a similar outline and color scheme to Disney castles. Made around 1762 by Sèvres Manufactory Burchard said these rococo pieces rank among the most ambitious porcelain vases ever created due to the level of detail like windows carved into the domes. Two vases are on loan from the Huntington Library in California which Disney visited but it isn’t clear if he saw them.

“The point that this makes is not necessarily to say that Disney saw those vases and was inspired by them when he was overseeing the making of Disneyland” said Burchard. But it’s the reasoning behind the design that matters. “The key thing is that rococo designers used the same rhetoric to encourage our imagination to run free and these pieces of porcelain are just as magical as a Disney castle.”

You may not recognize Robert Sherman’s name but you’d definitely recognize his work if you heard it. Chances are you’ve hummed one of his numerous songs sometime over the past week!

The prolific songwriter worked with his brother Richard to create more motion picture songs than any other songwriting team in history—including many for The Walt Disney Company. Their work on films like Mary Poppins Bedknobs and Broomsticks and The Jungle Book earned them a place in the Disney Legends hall of fame. The brothers were both inducted in 1990.

Disney Legend Robert Sherman

Sure we know the Sherman brothers are famous for the “it’s a small world” and Enchanted Tiki Room songs but they contributed so much more to Disney and beyond. Want to learn more about this talented artist? Let’s look back on his career and learn five facts about Disney Legend Robert Sherman.

1. A Real American Hero

Robert Bernard Sherman was born on December 19 1925 in New York. The elder son of Russian Jewish immigrants Robert enlisted to serve in World War II when he was 17 years old.

During the global conflict Robert served in an infantry combat unit and was shot in the knee which resulted in the need for a walking cane for the rest of his life.

Just two weeks after his injury Robert was one of the first Allied troops to enter the Dachau concentration camp—mere hours after the German military abandoned it. He received multiple medals for his service in WWII including a Purple Heart.

Robert spent time recovering from his injury in England where he fell in love with British culture—so it’s no surprise that Robert eventually moved to the UK to retire.

2. It Runs in the Family

After graduating from Bard College in 1949 Robert and his brother began writing songs together at the behest of their father who had been a successful Tin Pan Alley songwriter. Finding that they they too possessed the songwriting gene the brothers pursued that vocation and established the publishing company Music World Corporation in 1958.

Around that time the brothers had their big break with the song “Tall Paul” which they wrote for Mouseketeer Judy Harriet. It was later sung by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello whose rendition made it into the top 10 on the music charts—and caught Walt’s attention.

What followed for the duo was a full-time gig as staff songwriters for the Walt Disney Company in California until Walt passed away in 1966.

3. A “Chitty Chitty” Banger

After Walt passed the Sherman brothers returned to being freelance songwriters and luckily their renowned work for Disney had made them famous in Hollywood so work was easy to find.

They began freelancing in 1966 and shortly after received their first non-Disney gig in a very long time: writing songs for Albert R. Broccoli’s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang movie for United Artists in 1968. The job earned the brothers their third Academy Award nomination.

Decades later when Robert moved to London he and his brother wrote a handful of new songs for the stage musical adaptation of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang being produced in England.

4. An Award-Worthy Career

The best evidence of how talented Robert was as a songwriter is to look at the numerous awards he and his brother earned over the years.

Foremost on the mantle would be the Academy Awards they received for their work on Mary Poppins including “Best Original Song” for “Chim Chim Cher-ee” which was iconically crooned by Dick Van Dyke in his chimney sweep garb. The duo received Oscar nominations five subsequent years for other films.

In addition to that prestige Robert won three Grammy awards with his brother and the duo were the only Americans to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival (in 1973 for Tom Sawyer).

Before passing away in 2012 Robert was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and given a National Medal of the Arts by President George W. Bush.

5. In His Own Words

If you want to learn more about Robert’s life and accomplishments his acclaimed autobiography Moose: Chapters from My Life is a great read—packed with everything you’d want to know. His son Robert J. Sherman edited the book and helped publish it in 2013 a year after Robert’s death.

Before Robert passed away he shared an early portion of his memoir with Alison Owen who went on to guide the production of Disney’s 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks. She and her crew drew from his account to fill in some details surrounding the development of Mary Poppins in 1961 and credited Moose as an important resource.

In the film Robert is portrayed by B.J. Novak whom you may know as a writer director and actor for NBC’s The Office.

Remembering Disney Legend Robert Sherman

What’s your favorite Disney song that Robert and Richard wrote? I have trouble deciding but “The Spectrum Song” from Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color is definitely a top contender. I still get it stuck in my head whenever someone starts naming colors."

Read more here.

UPDATE: YouTube TV and Disney have reached a new carriage deal and YouTube TV has begun restoring Disney channels including ESPN to its service. The virtual MVPD said it will still give subscribers a one-time $15 credit.

""We apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience as we continued to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Disney's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement"" the company wrote.

YouTube TV and Disney were unable to reach a new carriage agreement before their current deal expired Friday and the result is ESPN ABC and other channels disappearing from the streaming service.

Besides ESPN and ABC subscribers are also losing ABC News Live Disney Channel Disney Junior Disney XD Freeform FX FXX FXM National Geographic National Geographic Wild ESPN ESPN2 ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app) ESPNU ESPNEWS SEC Network and ACC Network.

Google warned about the possible channel blackout on Monday and said that it would reduce its monthly price by $15 from $64.99 to $9.99 while Disney’s content remains off the platform. The company said that YouTube TV subscribers will have a $15 credit applied to their next bills after December 17.

“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months. Unfortunately despite our best efforts we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV” the company said in a statement. “We know this is frustrating news for our customers and not what we wanted. We will continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”

RELATED: YouTube TV could lose ESPN amid standoff with Disney

YouTube TV is pointing its subscribers toward alternative ways to keep watching Disney’s content including The Disney Bundle which includes Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu for $13.99 per month.

Disney has accused YouTube TV of declining to reach a fair deal based on market terms and conditions.

“We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort” the company said in a statement.

YouTube TV has more than four million subscribers based on analyst estimates and many of them took to Twitter to voice their frustration with the channel blackout and threaten to cancel YouTube TV in favor of a rival virtual MVPD. DirecTV Stream fuboTV Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV (which is majority owned and controlled by Disney) all still offer some if not all of the channels that have been removed from YouTube TV.",,,,,,,,,,,,
WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2lvd2FjYXBpdGFsZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTkvc21hc2hlZC1jYXJzLWJ1cm50LXRyZWVzLXNvZ2d5LWluc3VsYXRpb24tcG9zdC1kaXNhc3Rlci1jbGVhbnVwLWlzLWV4cGVuc2l2ZS10aW1lLWNvbnN1bWluZy1hbmQtd2FzdGVmdWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smashed cars burnt trees soggy insulation: Post-disaster cleanup is expensive time-consuming and wasteful • Iowa ...,"By Sybil Derrible Juyeong Choi and Nazli Yesiller

Communities across the U.S. Southeast and Midwest will be assessing damage from the deadly and widespread tornado outbreak on Dec. 10-11 2021 for some time. But it’s clear that the cleanups will take months and possibly years.

Dealing with enormous quantities of debris and waste materials is one of the most significant challenges for communities in the wake of natural disasters. Often this task overwhelms local waste managers leaving waste untouched for weeks months or even years.

The most destructive and costliest wildfire in California’s history the Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed nearly 19000 structures in November 2018. A year later crews were still collecting and carrying away piles of wood metals appliances contaminated soil toxic household chemicals and other debris and waste totaling more than 3.2 million metric tons – roughly the weight of 2 million cars.

Hurricane Michael which hit Florida in October 2018 left about 13 million cubic meters of debris. To visualize what that looks like picture a pile of 13 million boxes each the size of a washer and dryer. More than a year later crews were still removing the waste.

As researchers who study urban engineering disaster management and planning and waste management we see this as a critical and under-studied problem. Disasters will continue to happen and the losses they cause will continue to grow as a result of climate change population growth urbanization deforestation and aging infrastructures. Societies urgently need better strategies for dealing with the wastes these events leave behind.

Trails of wreckage

Climate-related disasters like floods landslides storms wildfires and extreme hot and cold waves afflict millions of people around the world. These events have been increasing over time particularly over the past several decades and so have the losses they cause.

In 2020 the U.S. experienced a record-setting 22 natural disasters that each caused at least a billion dollars in damages. For 2021 the count stood at 18 such events through early October. The mid-December tornado outbreak doubtlessly will add to it.

Disasters commonly produce thousands to millions of tons of debris in a single event. For example waste from hurricanes includes vegetation such as trees and shrubs; municipal solid waste such as household garbage; construction and demolition materials; vehicles; and household hazardous materials including paints cleaning agents pesticides and pool chemicals.

Debris from wildfires largely consists of ash contaminated soils metal and concrete along with other structural debris and household hazardous items such as paints cleaners solvents oils batteries herbicides and pesticides.

Dangerous and in the way

Debris collection and cleanup following a disaster is a slow expensive and dangerous process. First crews clear out debris from roads used for rescue efforts. They then move the material to temporary storage areas. No one has yet invented a way to easily sort or contain hazardous materials so they remain mixed into the debris mass. This poses major challenges for reusing and recycling post-disaster waste.

Beyond direct health and safety risks debris also threatens the environment. It can emit air pollutants and contaminate groundwater surface waters and soil. Uncollected debris and waste can hamper rescue and recovery efforts and slow down rebuilding efforts.

As an example when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans in 2005 it left behind an estimated 75 million cubic meters of waste that interfered with and slowed down recovery efforts. The debris included close to 900000 white goods such as refrigerators 350000 cars and more than 16000 metric tons of rotten meat. Cleanup costs were estimated at roughly $4 billion.

Toward reusing disaster waste

At an expert workshop that we organized in 2019 we identified steps for sustainably managing disaster debris and waste. As we see it the key tasks are to (1) identify what is contained in these wastes; (2) find better approaches to recycling and reuse; (3) design new technologies to identify hazardous components and sort the different types of waste; and (4) develop markets to promote reuse and recycling.

Today public officials and planners know little about the amount and types of materials generated during disasters – what they contain in what proportions whether they are large and sortable versus fine and mixed and how much can be reused or recycled. Developing new technologies and management approaches that can assist debris characterization reuse and recycling should be a top priority.

For example drones and autonomous sensing technologies can be combined with artificial intelligence to estimate amounts and quality of debris the types of materials it contains and how it can be repurposed rapidly. Technologies that allow for fast sorting and separation of mixed materials can also speed up debris management operations.

Turning the problem around creating new sustainable construction materials – especially in disaster-prone areas – will make it easier to repurpose debris after disasters.

Finally new business models can help generate demand for and access to waste and recycled products. With proper sorting some disaster materials can be used to make new products or materials. For example downed whole trees can become timber resources for furniture makers. Today opportunities to match materials with markets are wasted – pun intended.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXN0ZTM2MC5jb20vZm9vZC13YXN0ZS90aGUtcml0ei1jYXJsdG9uLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRlcy13aXRoLWJpb2dyZWVuMzYwLWFuZC1nYXJpY2stdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1hLTEwMC1jaXJjdWxhci1zb2x1dGlvbi1mb3ItZm9vZC13YXN0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Ritz-Carlton to Develop a 100% Circular Solution for Food Waste,"STRATHAM N.H. and PENTAGON CITY Va. - BioGreen360 the leading innovator in distributed food waste management solutions today announced the successful completion of a six-month collaboration with The Ritz-Carlton Pentagon City Hotel and Garick to develop a closed-loop program that diverts 100% of the Hotel's food waste from landfill with the residual material being integrated into an all-natural compost product.

The collaboration was conducted at The Ritz-Carlton Pentagon City Hotel leveraging BioGreen360's innovative integrated technology solution including: a waterless distributed digestor technology proprietary bio-catalysis an ""as a a service"" business model and a real-time data analytics package. Since the start of the collaboration the Pentagon City Hotel has successfully diverted 100% of its food waste totaling more than ten tons. In addition the culinary staff at the Pentagon City Hotel have used real-time data feeds from the system to track which departments are creating waste to reduce it over time.

The organic material created through the on-site digestion process at the Pentagon City Hotel was then repurposed into an all-natural compost at Garick's New Milford CT facility. Through this collaborative relationship the Pentagon City Hotel not only diverted 100% of its food waste but now also is repurposing food that otherwise would have been wasted into a high-value sustainable natural resource through an environmentally friendly fully circular process.

Recycling is almost non-existent in the North African country which produces 2.6 million tonnes of waste each year.

Some 85 percent of that ends up in landfills while much of the rest winds up in informal dumps says Tunisian waste management expert Walim Merdaci.

But with many facilities close to overflowing and neighbouring communities up in arms the crisis is already stoking tensions.

In November a man died as security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters demanding the closure of a stinking landfill they say has spread deadly diseases and health problems to their town of Agareb near second city Sfax.

An employee of African Recycling feeds plastic waste into a grinder -- much of the refuse is collected in the streets by informal waste pickers FETHI BELAID AFP

That could be a worrying sign of things to come as according to expert Wassim Chaabane most of the country's 11 official dumping grounds are due to close by the end of 2022.

That has authorities scrambling to find new sites.

In the capital Tunis home to about 2.7 million people the situation is particularly urgent.

The Bordj Chakir dump Tunisia's biggest receives more than 3000 tonnes of rubbish a day and is close to overflowing.

From waste to wealth

But where others see a crisis Masmoudi sees an opportunity.

Every day a steady stream of minivans and small trucks bring to his facility in Mghira near Tunis bales of plastic waste to be weighed sorted and cut into fine chips for industrial use.

Much is collected by hand from the streets and bins of the capital by ""barbechas"" informal waste pickers.

Masmoudi's firm African Recycling deals with 6000 tonnes of waste a year.

The 42-year-old directly employs around 60 people many of them women and indirectly provides work to roughly 200 -- no small achievement in a country suffering 18 percent unemployment.

Between four and seven percent of Tunisia's waste is recycled according to official figures.

But Masmoudi standing by his sleek white four-wheel-drive said the waste market was growing fast.

""Recycling is a sector where a lot remains to be done but which could create jobs and wealth in Tunisia.""

The situation is similar in neighbouring Algeria where experts say as much as 60 percent of household waste from the country's 43 million population goes to unregulated dumps.

Samira Hamidi a member of Algeria's semi-independent advisory body CNESE says ""less than seven percent of waste is recycled"".

Just 5000 people are employed in Algeria's recycling sector according to official figures.

In Tunisia after a decade of political paralysis since a 2011 revolution Masmoudi says the waste management system reflects a lack of strategy and vision.

Firms like his are blocked from collecting trash directly as ""municipalities own the rubbish"" he says.

""The state pays 150-200 dinars ($52-$70) per tonne of waste that goes to landfill. We're paying money to bury something that's worth a fortune.""

But implementing a system of sorting could take years according to Chaabane.

""Tunisia's waste management system is hopeless at all levels but especially when it comes to collection.""

The national waste management agency recently admitted that it lacks the resources.

Running out of time

Merdaci the other expert says Tunisian authorities want to bring in a combination of mechanical and biological methods to treat waste compacting and composting it whilst collecting methane gas which can be used as fuel.

But initial projects will take two years to get off the ground.

""Time is running out"" he says.

Merdaci called for ""a tax to pay for waste management and to make everyone pay for what they produce"" as a means for municipalities to deal with waste.

A steady stream of minivans and small trucks arrives daily at African Recycling whose owner says Tunisia's waste management system lacks strategy and vision FETHI BELAID AFP

Each Tunisian produces on average 365 kilogrammes (804 pounds) of waste per year yet taxpayers are charged no more than 28 cents for its management.

Chaabane says urgent solutions are needed and adds that incineration was ""the best option for cities"" if clean energy is used.

But that option would not come cheaply with incinerators costing some $280 million each.

To Merdaci the outlook is grim.

""We've had 10 years of political instability a decade without any decisions problems with those living near dumps and a lack of money. Success is nil.""

The Benton County Solid Waste District's Board of Directors voted unanimously Monday to appeal a decision declaring the district's imposition of a ""service fee"" was an attempt to avoid state law requiring the district share revenue from solid waste fees with the Boston Mountain Solid Waste District.

""There's literally nothing worse that can happen to us other than this decision"" Wendy Bland director of the Benton County district said Monday.

Washington County Circuit Judge John Threet entered a summary judgment Nov. 23 ruling Benton County could not unilaterally reduce or replace the fees assessed by Boston Mountain and avoid the requirement to share the revenue from the waste assessment fees.

About $603000 in disputed fees had been deposited in an escrow account by Waste Management while the lawsuit is ongoing. Waste Management operates the Eco-Vista Landfill in Tontitown which receives most of the solid waste generated in Northwest Arkansas including solid waste from Benton County.

Threet's order indicates $98000 was released to Benton County by an earlier order leaving about $505000 in escrow. Threet ordered Benton County should receive about $203000 of that amount and Boston Mountain should receive about $301000.

""I don't see where there's a downside to appealing it"" Benton County Judge Barry Moehring said during the meeting. ""It can't get any worse.""

The Benton County district has until Thursday to file an appeal according to Bland. She added based on past experience the appeal won't be decided until well into 2022. Bland said Threet's ruling should be put on hold while an appeal is pending.

Bland said she didn't budget any revenue from the waste assessment fees in 2022 since the lawsuit was still pending. The total revenue for the district was about $864000 according to its 2021 budget.

Robyn Reed Boston Mountain's director said she hadn't included any of the disputed revenue in her 2022 budget so an appeal won't hamper the district's operations. Reed said the district's 2021 budget included about $3.2 million in total revenue. Waste assessment fees collected within the Boston Mountain district provided about $500000 in revenue she said. Boston Mountain's share of the Benton County waste assessment fees has been around $186000 a year according to Reed.

""This has been going on for so long I'm not surprised by the appeal"" she said.

Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse chairman of the Boston Mountain district's Board of Directors said he's ready to see the litigation end so the district can move forward.

""It's like any litigation. You always look forward to it being over"" Sprouse said. ""Each side does what it thinks is best for its own interests.""

The two districts have been engaged in a series of lawsuits since 2016 over fees levied on waste generated in Benton County and disposed at the Eco-Vista Landfill.

State law provides that if two districts can't agree on a division of this type of revenue the money is divided equally between them.

Under a 2011 agreement between the two districts both districts kept the entire amount of the $1.50 per ton fee for waste generated within its district. In 2013 the Boston Mountain district declared the 2011 agreement void and withdrew. Benton County filed a breach of contract lawsuit and succeeded in having the 2011 agreement enforced until it expired in 2016.

The Boston Mountain district notified Benton County in 2016 the agreement wouldn't be renewed and presented a new proposal giving the Boston Mountain district $1 of the $1.50 fee on waste generated in Benton County and disposed of in the Eco-Vista Landfill. The remainder of the fee would go to Benton County. The Benton County district filed a lawsuit requesting the division of fees be declared unconstitutional and seeking an injunction to have the disputed money held in escrow.

The state Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Boston Mountain district on Oct. 30 2019. In December 2019 the Benton County district amended its own regulations to reduce the waste assessment fee from $1.50 per ton of solid waste to $0.01 and to impose a $1.49 per ton ""service fee"" on waste haulers in the county. All of the money from the ""service fee"" was to be paid to the Benton County district.

According to information in the order filed by Threet when solid waste is generated in one district and delivered to another district for disposal either the district in which the solid waste was generated or a district in which the same solid waste is transported stored managed or disposed may assess a per-ton fee of no more than $2 on the waste. The fee may be assessed against the generator transporter or disposal facility. Each ton of waste may be assessed only one fee which cannot exceed $2 per ton.

The order said Benton County lacked the authority to unilaterally reduce Boston Mountain's fee.

This contract the largest for land mail service that had yet been given was authorized by an act of Congress in March 1857.The Pinery Station site commemorates his achievement in transporting the first regular overland mail to California from Missouri in the record-breaking time of 23 days 23.5 hours.

Born at Berne New York in 1801 Butterfield grew up on a farm amidst the revolutionary changes of the first steamboat the Erie Canal the steam locomotive and the electric telegraph. His ambition was to become a professional stage driver which he did at the age of 19. He diligently saved his earnings and soon owned and operated a livery business. Butterfield convinced Henry Wells and William Fargo to consolidate their express company with the Butterfield Express Company and form the American Express Company which Butterfield then directed. He was a natural organizer with an incredible memory and a generous spirit to share his success. He filled his life with challenging business ventures that were not only profitable but that also gained him respect and benefited the public.

Although his appearance was stern he generated a current of enthusiasm all around him demanding the highest quality of service from his employees in a just and fair manner. He was reserved except for his fashionable dress which particularly on western journeys set a trend across the country. Butterfield coats shirts boots and hats became the rage.

In 1857 most prominent men of his day retired from business at about the age of 56 and Butterfield could have enjoyed the same with his great wealth reputation and unimpaired health. He must have realized that a stage mail route was doomed since the locomotive had already appeared and taken over much of the mail and passenger service in the East. However he was anxious to see a letter move from east to west by means other than a steamship sailing around South America. Perhaps it was his inborn love of horses the feel of the reins and the lure of the open road that motivated him to begin the most outstanding achievement of his career – the Butterfield Overland Mail Route.

Butterfield had never been farther west than Buffalo New York so he hired St. John a young man who had made three trips west and experienced the limitless plains deserts barren mountains and the cry of raiding Indians. He instructed St. John and his crew to prepare stations and water storage tanks every 30 miles because “speed is what we want.” He sent a steady stream of coaches west over this southern route each carrying 12000 letters as well as passengers.

The stress and strain of the venture the rerouting of the first route and the cancellation of the Butterfield Overland mail contract due to the Civil War caused John Butterfield’s physical breakdown at age 59. He then retired to his home in Utica New York where he later suffered a paralyzing stroke. He had established an amazing mail route the longest in the world which provided a regular line of communication for Americans separated by almost 2000 miles of undeveloped wilderness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9jaGFybG90dGUvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9yZXRhaWwtcm91bmR1cC10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LW9uLXN0b3JlLW9wZW5pbmdzLWluLWFuZC1hcm91bmQtY2hhcmxvdHRlLTI3NjM3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail roundup: The latest on store openings in and around Charlotte,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/local/charlotte/2021/12/18/retail-roundup-the-latest-on-store-openings-in-and-around-charlotte-276378 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9jaGFybG90dGUvMjAyMS8xMi8xOC9yZXRhaWwtcm91bmR1cC10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LW9uLXN0b3JlLW9wZW5pbmdzLWluLWFuZC1hcm91bmQtY2hhcmxvdHRlLTI3NjM3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvd2FycmlvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Gb3JtZXItQmF5LUFyZWEtYnJvYWRjYXN0ZXItS2F0ZS1TY290dC1zZXR0bGVzLTE2NzExNDE2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bay Area broadcaster Kate Scott settles into groove as voice of 76ers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/warriors/article/Former-Bay-Area-broadcaster-Kate-Scott-settles-16711416.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvd2FycmlvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Gb3JtZXItQmF5LUFyZWEtYnJvYWRjYXN0ZXItS2F0ZS1TY290dC1zZXR0bGVzLTE2NzExNDE2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9nYW1lL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTM0OTYwNi9zZW5hdG9ycy1mbHllcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flyers 4-3 Senators (Dec 18 2021) Final Score,"Vincent Trocheck is Rangers' do-it-all hero in 2024 playoffs

mong the big surprises of the pandemic economy was the housing boom. As fleeing city dwellers and cramped work-from-home families bid up the price of spacious suburban homes rock-bottom interest rates enticed existing homeowners to refinance in record numbers. By the end of last year 13.6 million mortgages worth $4.3 trillion had been closed shattering the previous all-time record of $3.7 trillion in 2003. It was a miraculous feat considering that most of that lending was done while in-person meetings were taboo and overworked loan officers operated from ad hoc home offices as their dogs barked and children fidgeted through remote classes.Truth is the mortgage market probably would have melted down were it not for a secret weapon: Nima Ghamsari a 35-year-old Iranian immigrant who made hundreds of thousands of dollars playing poker online while at Stanford; joined secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies upon graduation; and then at just 26 quit that dream job to start his own software company Blend Labs in 2012. “I have always felt like I wanted to bet on myself. I’m willing to take a lot of risk” he says matter-of-factly.Though invisible to ordinary borrowers and comparatively low-profile in its Silicon Valley home Blend has had a staggering impact. It now provides digital infrastructure to 287 US banks including such big mortgage lenders as Wells Fargo and First Republic Bank. In 2020 Blend software was used to process $1.4 trillion in mortgage and consumer loans up nearly threefold from the prior year. Its staff grew to 750 from 425 before the pandemic. Blend’s revenue doubled last year to about $100 million Forbes estimates.Thanks in no small part to Blend the mortgage application underwriting and closing process—once a weeks- or months-long slog of paperwork emails faxes and phone calls—can now be done almost entirely digitally. Blend saves an average of 7.3 days and $520 in operational costs per loan and allows a typical banker to close 14 mortgages a month consultancy MarketWise Advisors estimates. Blend seamlessly integrates with CoreLogic for credit scores Plaid to check on bank accounts and Google Maps for location data. This enables some banks to offer home hunters quick tentative mortgage approvals with a few mouse clicks—a huge plus in a white-hot housing market.“We all got stressed last year with the crush of volume” says Tom Wind president of US Bank Home Mortgage one of Blend’s largest customers. “We were able to serve more customers last year because of efficiencies we have with Blend.” In 2020 US Bank saw a 136 percent increase in mortgage fee revenue without having to increase staff.Ghamsari and Blend have produced results by bucking convention on Sand Hill Road. Instead of seeking to disrupt the banks (a common fintech goal) he decided to retrofit them charging for the service. His rationale: He wouldn’t have to waste time and money on consumer marketing and could potentially make financial services easier to access for 100 million consumers instead of maybe a million or two.In January fresh off its banner year Blend raised $300 million from blue-chip investors including Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global and Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management at a $3.3 billion valuation doubling its worth in a span of five months. In April Blend filed confidential documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a possible initial public offering which (given that Blend has an incentive-laden compensation structure similar to Tesla’s) could launch Ghamsari on the road to billionaire status—if Blend performs well. There are whispers that SPACs have shown interest in merging with Blend at double its latest valuation though Ghamsari won’t comment.Blend is a standout on this year’s Forbes’ Fintech 50 which celebrates private startups transforming financial services. Twenty of the Fintech 50 are new this year reflecting the energy and record venture capital pouring into the sector the impact of Covid-19 and the fact that six of last year’s picks including crypto exchange Coinbase and Opendoor Technologies which buys homes quickly for cash have since gone public. Counting Blend at least four current members of the Fintech 50 are considering listing on the public markets.Yet few have had so much impact on ordinary folks’ lives. Since the end of World War II owning a home has been at the center of the American Dream—as it was for Ghamsari’s own family. He moved to the US from Iran in 1987 when he was a year old as his parents pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan and then settled down in Cincinnati where his dad taught math at the University of Cincinnati and his mother taught chemistry at Xavier University. After years of renting Ghamsari’s parents were finally approved in 1998 for a low-down-payment mortgage and purchased a no-frills two-story home in Cincinnati for about $100000. It was the rock their family prospered upon. They later became franchisees of a tutoring company employing their brainy teenage son to grade and tutor students.That wasn’t the only way the ambitious Ghamsari kept busy before graduating from high school first in his class. He worked at McDonald’s Starbucks and Circuit City rebuilt Dell computers and taught himself to code. At Stanford a need-based scholarship helped cover tuition but Ghamsari tried his hand at online poker to help pay for living expenses. Soon when he wasn’t studying he was playing day and night with his winnings extending well into the six figures. “It was my first taste of something where if I really put a lot of energy and effort into getting better how good the outcomes could be over a very long run” he says.To make more time for poker Ghamsari bought a gas-powered golf cart to get around Stanford’s sprawling 8000-acre campus faster. “I really optimise my time around doing the things that I want to do. I try to make everything that I don’t want to do be as efficient—ideally nonexistent—as possible’’ he explains. (Stealing a page from Steve Jobs’ playbook he has 30 black T-shirts he says because “I don’t like spending time thinking about what I’m going to wear.”)With little regard for the brilliant undergraduate’s precious time campus police impounded Ghamsari’s forbidden golf cart. “It was totally obnoxious for me to have in retrospect’’ he concedes. No matter. By the time he graduated with a computer science degree in 2008 he had bought an Aston Martin and been recruited by the ultra-secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies originally funded by the CIA’s venture arm. He was assigned to Palantir’s push to deploy its software inside America’s then-teetering big banks whose patchwork decades-old technology infrastructure gave them a poor grasp of their problematic mortgage exposures. Ghamsari saw up close the massive opportunity to disrupt banks—or to transform them.“The insight Palantir had was that there was this immense growth in the amount of data being captured by organisations but there was no way to harness that data for operational things” he says. “You had to literally read pieces of paper because all the data in the mortgage industry at the time was done in an analog way.”Like other employees Ghamsari had stock options and could have cashed in when Palantir eventually went public in 2020. Instead in 2012 he and two other young colleagues (former quant trader Rosco Hill and engineer Eugene Marinelli) founded Blend together with Erin Collard the head trader of billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital to bring new cloud-based technology to the earthbound banks. They gained early backing from Thiel and Max Levchin now worth $1.4 billion thanks to his newly public fintech Affirm which allows people to pay for items in installments. The four founders first worked out of Ghamsari’s cramped San Francisco apartment until his roommates complained. So they rented a Mission Bay apartment which they used as offices hauling sleeping bags into closets for naps during round-the-clock coding sessions.At first venture capitalists focussed on fast disruptive growth were sceptical of Blend’s approach. Winning business from stodgy banks was uncertain they warned and there were only so many banks to sell to. “Venture capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say ‘This will never work’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it’ ” Ghamsari recalls.But changes in the mortgage market eventually played into Ghamsari’s hands. In an effort to cut risk after the 2008 financial crisis large lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo started offloading hundreds of billions in mortgages to third-party servicers. Those servicers needed help managing their massive new portfolios and were more open to getting it from young tech wizards than banks might have been. Early Blend customers included Nationstar Mortgage (now Mr. Cooper) the country’s third-largest mortgage servicer.Blend’s big break however came courtesy of a competitor. In 2015 Dan Gilbert the Quicken Loans billionaire launched Rocket Mortgage which cut mortgage closing times from over 40 days to just a month—similar to what Blend was offering. “Every bank’s board woke up and said ‘Oh my God we need to find a solution to compete with this because if we don’t we’re going to lose volume to Rocket.’ Blend was one of those answers” recalls Jeffrey Reitman a partner at Blend investor Canapi Ventures.Through the first half of 2017 Blend received just $67 million in outside funding. But after VCs saw it had won Wells Fargo US Bank and mortgage originator Movement Mortgage as customers they started calling. In August 2017 Blend raised $100 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation in a round led by Greylock with Emergence Capital 8VC Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nyca Partners.With that cash Ghamsari was able to add hundreds of smaller banks as customers. He also expanded functionality giving borrowers the ability to upload documents and banks the ability to manage more of the closing process as well as the applications process digitally. In 2019 Blend raised a further $130 million and hired Tim Mayopoulos the now 62-year-old former CEO of Fannie Mae as its president giving it instant credibility with banks and government-backed mortgage finance agencies known in the trade as GSEs. Ghamsari “came and visited me in my office and he was this scruffy guy in a black T-shirt’’ Mayopoulos recalls. “But it was clear that he had the same vision about how the system ought to work that I did: It should all be driven by reliable data that gets shared with all the key participants in the process from the consumer to the lender to the ultimate holder of the credit risk [the GSEs].”Blend isn’t stopping at mortgages—or banks. By 2019 it had launched paper-reducing software for homeowner’s insurance and home-equity and auto loans. It’s also enabling homebuilder Lennar to offer mortgages. In March it agreed to acquire title-insurance and settlement company Title365 for $422 million with the aim of integrating even more of the home closing process into its services—and collecting insurance fees.Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time’’ he says. Consumers will open an app and get real-time recommendations based on their individual financial picture with Blend powering it all.

The state legalized marijuana in 2016 for adult recreational use yet the black market continues to thrive with thousands of illegal grows. Criminal syndicates in turn are cashing in across the U.S. on the ""green gold rush.""

They're undercutting prices of legalized products offered by permitted farmers who follow the rules and pay taxes.

And they're exploiting workers robbing and shooting adversaries poisoning wildlife and poaching water in a state fighting widespread drought and devastating wildfires.

Lured by America's push toward legalized cannabis cartels have abandoned many decades-old marijuana farms in Mexico moving their operations to Northern California where they can blend in seamlessly alongside legitimate grows said Mike Sena executive director of Northern California's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area task forces.

""Why try to bring that bulk marijuana into the United States when you can just grow it in the United States in remote locations like Mendocino County and then move it across the entire country?""

Major cartels including the top powerhouses — Sinaloa and Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación or CJNG — also continue trafficking billions of dollars of heroin meth and opioids into the U.S. and countries worldwide.

They're flooding the streets with fentanyl often pressed into pills to mimic prescription medicine fueling skyrocketing overdoses that killed more than 100000 people during the pandemic. The cartels and their drugs also have infiltrated Kentucky where overdose deaths rose 49% in 2020 killing nearly 2000 people.

Americans' growing embrace of marijuana has given the cartels an avenue to expand their reach employing the same vicious tactics they use to push out competitors in the illicit opioid trade.

John Haschak a member of the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors said the county has issued about 1100 permits for cannabis cultivation.

Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall told The Courier Journal there are as many as 10000 illegal grows in his jurisdiction a two-hour drive north of San Francisco. He tries to target the worst 100 which is all his small force can handle in a year.

""I'm fighting a dragon with a needle"" Kendall said.

Marijuana farming in the ‘Emerald Triangle’

In Mendocino County just 21 deputies patrol a jurisdiction that stretches over 3506 square miles from ocean-side cliffs on its western border to the Mendocino National Forest on the east.

The area is double the geographic footprint of Los Angeles Atlanta Houston New Orleans Chicago and Denver combined.

Because of the twisty terrain It can take sheriff's deputies up to an hour to reach the site of an emergency or crime.

""We have international cartels successfully operating here"" setting up multi-million dollar farm operations said California Assemblyman Tom Lackey R-Palmdale a former highway patrolman.

""They’re poisoning our ground and stealing our water and we have drought out here"" he said.

Headless bodies and murder victims

The sheriff said he doesn't have enough deputies to safely serve a search warrant amid increasing violence.

A glimpse at what he's dealing with: Christopher Wayne Gamble who allegedly operated large illegal crops near the town of Willits in central Mendocino County is charged with murdering a 17-year-old boy and his father who came from Mexico seeking work according to Mendocino County Superior Court records.

On a second property Gamble owns detectives found the victims' headless bodies in April in a ditch under a pile of tires that had been set on fire.

""It’s a punishment to the person who stepped out of line"" the sheriff said. ""And a message to the next person: 'Don’t step out of line.'""

Willits is a small community in Mendocino County California. The county is more than three times the size of Rhode Island.

In October a Fish and Wildlife warden stumbled onto a decomposing body stuffed in the trunk of a vehicle parked along the roadside near Covelo in the northern part of the county.

During a drive-by shooting last year one man was shot in the ear and another in the head in Covelo.

And in July a 27-year-old man was fatally shot in the Laytonville area southwest of Covelo.

All according to the sheriff and court records are linked to illegal cannabis grows.

""We're a very short amount of time away from having heads in the square like they do down in Mexico"" Kendall said.

Number of missing people grows

Every year backpackers from the U.S. and beyond seek adventure and farm work boarding buses bound for the Emerald Triangle.

They join men and women who travel from Mexico looking to make money to send back to their families. Some never make it home.

""It’s the Wild West"" said Sena who is based in San Francisco and oversees 22 federally funded drug task forces throughout Northern California. ""We’ve got people in gunfights on a regular basis over marijuana.

""And the number of missing people is insane"" especially in the Emerald Triangle. ""During grow season people call the sheriffs' offices up there looking for loved ones who may never be found.""

The Courier Journal spent a week in the valley town of Covelo and throughout Mendocino County touring cattle ranches permitted marijuana farms and a licensed dispensary and talking with conservationists lawmakers teachers police and fire officials and tribal members.

Some gave differing opinions about marijuana and laws governing its crops but all agreed that crime and related problems have only worsened with legalization.

The newspaper investigation found:

Cartels encroach on illegal grows in Northern California bringing violence and other woes Farmers ranchers and others in Northern California's Mendocino County are impacted by rogue marijuana growers -- including Mexican cartel associates.

Cash-only industry a ripe target

Illegal growers can camouflage their grows in plain sight near permitted grows forcing police and code enforcement to research which crops are legal or in the midst of the permit process.

Even if a grow isn't legal it's only a misdemeanor crime in California — regardless of the size of the crop.

Typically investigators must prove environmental damage occurred or someone was stabbed or shot to elevated the crime to a felony.

And though more than 30 states legalized marijuana for medicinal use and 18 allow adult recreational use marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug in the U.S. making it illegal federally.

Iker Munoz shows a licensed grow operation Mendo Select in Potter Valley in Mendocino County California. There are 10 greenhouses on the property. Dave Najera a former U.S. Marine said that he was drawn to the plant's medicinal properties in treating PTSD and now co-owns a cannabis business in Potter Valley on land that used to be a vineyard. ""We were doing it before it was legal"" he said.

Accordingly banks typically won't issue credit cards or provide banking services to permitted marijuana businesses. That renders it a cash-only industry ripe for robbers.

For the past few years U.S. lawmakers have voted down controversial measures to open up banking services to legitimate cannabis-related businesses.

And marijuana's classification as an illegal drug means farmers and dispensaries in California are barred from exporting it to other states. Adult tourists can legally buy marijuana joints edibles and other cannabis products but they can't carry them over state lines.

That hands organized criminals a ready-made customer base. They move their cannabis by train plane and car to states where it's not legal. Investigators say even some California residents buy it illegally because it's cheaper.

John Burkes Mendocino County's Code Enforcement supervisor said he uses flyover photography and Google Earth satellite imagery to hunt for illegal crops sometimes hidden among the tree canopy. He estimates the county's known illegal grows cover roughly 300 acres.

His department also receives tips about questionable crops and greenhouses from neighbors logging about 600 complaints this year as of mid-November double the complaints from the year before.

Permitted farmers are at a disadvantage said Swami Chaitanya of Swami Select farms a self-described hippie and ""legacy farmer"" meaning he harvested the crop before it was legal in a wooded area north of Laytonville.

He and his partner Nikki Lastreto run a small farm producing up to 400 pounds annually. They have spent more than $200000 during the past five years and still haven't completed the complicated permitting process.

They've had to submit maps and photos and pay for surveys and inspections from state and county agencies monitoring food and agriculture fish and wildlife water quality and more.

""We want to be the Bordeaux or Champagne of cannabis and we are"" Chaitanya said of their small-batch craft cannabis ""if they don't kill us"" with taxes and fees.

‘The whole process has failed’

Customers who buy from licensed dispensaries know the product has been tested to be free of dangerous chemicals and to reflect the ingredients and potency listed on the label.

The trade-off is they have to pay cannabis consumption and dispensary taxes.

California's Department of Cannabis Control has been instructed to facilitate the permitting process. There are more than 8400 cultivation licensees scattered across the state according to department data.

But each county has the option to ban cannabis. Currently 68% of local jurisdictions in California ban cannabis retail according to the department and 62% ban all cannabis activity.

Local jurisdictions also can establish additional requirements and taxes which Mendocino officials have done.

Chaitanya whose product is sold in 15 dispensaries estimates that more than 100 area growers near his north Mendocino County farm aren't permitted and ""they're kind of looking at us like we're stupid.""

Farmers once fetched up to $4000 per pound but a saturated market across the state has driven down prices to $400 or less. Illegal sellers can ship it to get triple the price on the East Coast Sena said.

""The whole process has failed"" said Katie Delbar a sixth-generation rancher in Mendocino County. ""It has failed the growers who are trying to do it right and it's failed the community.""

Delbar whose family runs a cattle ranch in the town of Potter Valley is concerned about growing violence piles of garbage left beside streams and abandoned greenhouses called ""hoop houses"" left to deteriorate after growers leave.

""There's not enough policeman sheriffs code enforcement agents to make sure the people who are growing are permitted"" she said during a ride on a four-wheeler to check on a herd.

Delbar said a Realtor and two men came to her farming community and offered residents $400000 to $500000 cash upfront to lease property for one year promising $1 million or more at the end of the 12 months.

However the agreement required property owners to stay off their own land for the entire year.

""Any ponds any waste and environmental damage is the owner’s responsibility"" she said.

His business licensed as Mendo Select legally operates 10 greenhouses.

""There are a lot more guidelines a lot more hoops to jump through but you sleep better at night"" he said. ""It’s nice to know you aren’t going to lose your freedom.""

Najera said government fees and taxes are a bigger threat to his business than illegal growers.

""They're going to most likely cripple the small farmers"" he said.

There aren't too many small farmers left in Covelo a town of modest homes in northern Mendocino that has become a marijuana hot spot.

The valley town boasts a stunning panoramic view of the mountains and its borders include the Round Valley Indian Reservation more than 2000 enrolled members of seven tribes: Yuki Pit River Little Lake Nomlacki Concow Pomo and Wailacki.

Covelo is accessible by a narrow road that snakes upward for several miles overlooking a drop-off. Growers tucked away in these hills have a birds-eye view when patrol cars or strangers are coming their way.

How to buy marijuana legally Adult residents and tourists can legally buy cannabis from authorized dispensaries in California and other states where recreational use is legal. In California you must be age 21 or older for recreational use and age 18 or older with a physician’s recommendation for medicinal use. Be prepared to show identification and pay in cash. Since it’s illegal federally federal-regulated banks can’t authorize credit card purchases. It’s advisable to check the laws and regulations in the city and state you plan to visit ahead of time. The California Department of Cannabis Control’s website offers a detailed list of what is allowed and what is prohibited. California also offers a database of dispensaries searchable by zip code or county.

What to avoid Even in states such as California where recreational cannabis is legal lawmakers in counties and cities can ban the cultivation selling buying and consumption in their jurisdictions. And in locations where cannabis is allowed often its use is banned in public areas in restaurants and hotels. Tourists must consume the cannabis before leaving the state where it was purchased since it’s illegal to carry across state lines. It’s also illegal to order it online and ship it to another state.

The rise of million-dollar properties

The sheriff is a sixth-generation Covelo native with a daughter who is half Native American and has relatives on the reservation.

During a recent drive through the town he donned a tan cowboy hat and drove an unmarked white pickup and spat Copenhagen into a black Yeti while pointing out signs that the town he loves is under siege.

He drove by illegal grows on and off the reservation hidden behind fences 6-feet or taller and guarded with security cameras pit bulls and other dogs. Some posted multiple signs cautioning: ""Keep out.""

And there are several dump sites with abandoned cars and piles of trash including one near an archaeological site with arrowheads the sheriff said.

The center of town is a small strip that includes a gas station a clothing boutique a grocery store and several other businesses. Fliers on a billboard advertise several properties for sale including ones listing for $1-3 million.

The sheriff said he's concerned about buyers who paid double the land's value — in cash.

A decade ago 20 acres with a house and barn would have sold for $200000 or less. Now it can fetch more than $1 million.

""Almost everybody that grows dope up here is from San Jose"" Kendall said. ""That’s a hub"" where some Mexican cartels position their regional supervisors.

After doing flyovers sheriff's investigators estimate there are a million pot plants on the valley floor an area about seven by eight miles. That's less than 2% of the county's landmass.

The sheriff estimates that 95% are illegal. If tribal officials ask him to shut one down on their portion of the valley floor his deputies go in with a tractor and machetes.

Ronnie Hostler 79 of the Nomlacki tribe said he doesn't approve of cannabis but other tribal members support it.

He sits on the front porch of his small home watching his neighbors' grazing cattle and avoiding the back of his house and the view of migrant workers farming marijuana.

Hostler said he was offered a $5000 cash down payment and promised $10000 at the end of grow season to allow greenhouses in his front yard. He declined.

The valley is known as ""nature's hideaway"" carved into a town sign.

""It's not that anymore"" Hostler said. ""The beauty is gone.""

Over time several tribal members sold their land or leased it. Now the reservation resembles a ""checkerboard"" with about half the reservation consisting of non-Native Americans said Joel Merrifield a member of the tribal council.

Merrifield who is in recovery and works with youths at the Round Valley Indian Health Center said he believes marijuana should only be used medicinally such as for relief of pain from cancer. He said he smoked marijuana years ago and it was his gateway to other drugs.

""It's being abused"" on the reservation he said while standing in front of the center within view of a marijuana grow across the street. ""I've voiced that many times in (tribal council) meetings.""

The councilman said he also is concerned about shootings and disappearances.

""This ain't Mexico City but it's happening here"" he said. ""It is alarming our elders 80-years-old and up who don't feel safe here.""

Living in ‘squalor’

Customers across the U.S. who buy marijuana on the internet likely don't realize the labor and sex trafficking they could be financially supporting police said.

""Some of the marijuana being moved across the country is born on the back of slave labor” said Sena who also heads up the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. ""Often the people brought in to do labor are mistreated"" on illegal marijuana farms.

In Mendocino County someone dropped off a frightened 16-year-old girl from Mexico who didn't know where she was and didn't speak English at an illegal cannabis farm in Covelo months ago. The sheriff fears she was brought in to have sex with the workers but his deputies found her first.

Other farm workers including young men used for sex and labor trafficking weren't rescued in time. Some were forced to live in squalor without plumbing. Others ended up dead and many are missing the sheriff said.

""We have families who will never be able to know what happened to their children"" Kendall said. ""I’m not going to put up with it.""

Harming national forest land wildlife

Armed illegal growers are also setting up operations on federal land in national forests.

Investigators have found ""trespass grows"" in 72 national forests in 21 states that includes all of California's 18 national forests said Mourad Gabriel a regional wildlife ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service who is based in the Emerald Triangle.

An average of more than 2 million cannabis plants were eradicated on federal land from 2007-2019 — more than a million of which was grown in California Gabriel said.

He's concerned about the unknown impact of dangerous chemicals including ones used to kill rodents that are banned in the U.S. and have been used at some grow sites including in the Mendocino National Forest.

""They’re definitely smuggled in from Mexico"" he said.

Gabriel worries about soil contamination and tainted streams which supply the Round Valley Indian Reservation in Covelo.

""They definitely are at risk if contamination is to occur"" he said.

The scientist said in 2014 someone poisoned his beloved rescue dog Nyxo who suffered an agonizing death. Gabriel believes it was a scare tactic to stop his research.

Gabriel helped connect illegal grows to the poisoning or shooting of spotted owls fishers bear deer and hawks.

Growers at illegal sites sometimes cut down trees and also leave piles of trash and human waste near streams in the forests.

""They're toxic waste sites"" said California Assemblyman Jim Wood a Democrat whose district includes the Emerald Triangle.

""They're damaging the water and damaging wildlife and it's at a pretty large scale.""

In fiscal year 2019 more than 353000 marijuana plants were eradicated from national forests in California and across the country and officials confiscated $948 million dollars worth of marijuana said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jamie Hinrichs.

In recent years officials found large grows on national forests in California Alabama Arkansas Arizona Colorado Georgia Idaho Indiana Kentucky Michigan Montana North Carolina New Mexico Nevada Oregon Tennessee Texas Utah Virginia Washington and Wisconsin.

Burns and death linked to illegal cannabis

Burns and explosions are another threat with illegal cannabis.

A 56-year-old man illegally making a form of pure THC in September caused an explosion in Mendocino County that killed him and burned his two grandchildren.

Firefighters and three air ambulances rushed to the overnight trailer park in the town of Ukiah the county seat.

""I found three burn victims running around trying to find water"" screaming and crying said Justin Buckingham a battalion chief with the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority.

Justin Buckingham Battalion Chief Ukiah Valley Fire Authority.

Investigators say the man was making butane honey oil a golden liquid extracted from the cannabis stem seeds and leaves using the same highly flammable gas found in grill lighters.

The finished product syrupy like honey can contain nearly pure THC. A kilo of the wax formed when the extract solidifies has a street value of up to $39000 Sena said.

Drug users can heat vaporize and inhale the wax a trend called ""dabbing"" which has sent patients to emergency rooms with symptoms similar to pneumonia according to case studies including one published in July in the National Library of Medicine.

Doctors caution the long-term health effects aren't known.

Most of these labs are illegal police said. There are several steps to get a permit including having a ventilation system avoiding heat sources and recycling the wastes.

The Ukiah explosion which blew out the windows caused 2nd- and 3rd-degree burns to a 12-year-old boy's arms and legs said Lt. Andy Phillips with the Ukiah Police Department.

An 8-year-old girl suffered 1st- and 2nd-degree burns.

The grandfather died several days later.

There have been several similar explosions over the past few years but none were fatal the lieutenant said.

What can be done?

Veteran lawmen including Sena and the Mendocino County sheriff now favor allowing marijuana federally as a way to cripple the illegal market.

Results of a new Gallup poll released in November show 68 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana federally a record high.

More cartel coverage

However repeated attempts by U.S. lawmakers to legalize it have failed. In November Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a bill to federally decriminalize marijuana allowing states to regulate the drug similarly to alcohol.

In California lawmakers announced in September $1.5 million to target the biggest illegal growers in Mendocino Trinity and Humboldt counties. The Emerald Counties previously got $1.5 million to help clean up the toxic wastes left behind on illegal grow sites Wood said.

Kendall said federal prosecution of criminal drug networks in his area are rare and he needs more help from agents.

DEA San Francisco officials declined to comment but the FBI released a statement saying its officials collaborate with the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office ""on ongoing investigations and share intelligence on criminal threats.""

Sena agreed Mendocino County needs more resources but said undercover work is difficult because area growers recognize cars and faces that are new to the remote area.

He also said the focus is more on the immediate threat of fentanyl America's No. 1 killer.

""Until this gets elevated to the point where people can actually make the connection between the violence that we're seeing on the streets of America and the illicit flow of marijuana we're not going to be able to get the funding the personnel the right resources.""

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

AUSTIN Texas — Full details have been revealed in the FBI investigation that led to the arrest of Austin auto dealership executive Erik Charles Maund.

Maund and three other men are facing a federal indictment in connection with the deaths of an estranged couple in Tennessee as part of an alleged murder-for-hire plot.

Maund 46 is the grandson of Charles Maund and a partner of Maund Automotive Group a car dealer in Austin that sells Toyota and Volkswagen cars.

A new report from KVUE’s media partners at the Austin American-Statesman by Senior Reporter Tony Plohetski shows Maund was driving home from a hunting trip at a South Texas ranch last week when federal agents alongside San Marcos police and Texas DPS troopers surrounded Maund’s black Toyota SUV.

The FBI had likely been surveilling Maund for days following a yearlong confidential investigation the Statesman reports. It’s alleged Maund directed and financed the million-dollar plot that left two people dead to hide his affair.

A federal indictment unsealed on Monday showed Maund had begun a relationship with an aesthetician 33-year-old Holly Williams using the fake name “Erik Moore” while visiting his son at college in Nashville Tennessee. Text messages obtained by investigators show Maund last saw Williams at a Nashville hotel in February 2020 calling her “beautiful” when arranging to meet up.

The indictment says Maund began receiving demands for money three weeks later from Williams’ on-again off-again boyfriend 36-year-old William Lanway with whom she had a violent relationship. Lanway had reportedly traced Maund’s cellphone number to his auto company revealing his name and position.

Authorities say instead of turning the alleged extortion over to police or a civil lawyer Maund went to an Austin-based security company and developed a plan with three other men over the next three weeks to kidnap and kill Williams and her ex-boyfriend. The group allegedly coordinated via encrypted cellphone messaging apps as Maund sent a flow of high-dollar payments.

The Maund family has now hired Austin attorneys Perry Minton and Sam Bassett to defend Erik Maund locally and in Nashville according to the Statesman.

Attorneys told the Statesman facts emerged in trials that do not match initial allegations by investigators.

“We intend to give Erik Maund the vigorous defense to these allegations that he deserves and that the law provides” they said.

Denise Truscello

A true architect of Las Vegas entertainment Franco Dragone is ready to return to the Strip to surprise and delight audiences with a new brand of performance and production. This time he’s teaming up with famed illusionist and longtime Vegas headliner Criss Angel to take their collective creativity in a new direction.

Dragone may be best known for his work with Cirque du Soleil creating and directing landmark Las Vegas productions “Mystère” at Treasure Island and “O” at Bellagio — the first two Cirque shows to return to the stage this year during the pandemic. He’s also behind Celine Dion’s original residency show at Caesars Palace “A New Day” and the shuttered aquatic spectacular “Le Rêve” that ran at Wynn Las Vegas for 15 years.

“Franco is probably one of the most prolific directors in entertainment history and he certainly changed the trajectory and history of Las Vegas” Angel says. “Now we are equal partners on a course to create some more.”

Angel and Dragone first connected during the launch of “Le Rêve” and spent time together developing a show for Steve Wynn that was never realized. They reconnected last year when Angel interviewed Dragone for a web series on creativity that raised funds for out-of-work artists and performing arts workers.

“We have followed each other for a long time and we met again thanks to this initiative” Dragone says. “And Criss and I wanted to do something more together as partners and we decided to try this experience.

“I think for both of us it’s a risky time during this pandemic we are going through which is not finished so maybe we are a little bit crazy. But we’ve jumped into this project completely and it has deepened our friendship.”

The show is “Amystika” described as a prequel to Angel’s “Mindfreak” magic-based production at the Criss Angel Theater at the Planet Hollywood resort and it will run in the same room.

“It’s very interactive a visual feast but there is a story there” Angel says. “This is the first time I’m aware of in Las Vegas history where you have two shows you have to see to get the complete experience and understand the entire concept.”

Originally set to launch preview shows on December 27 “Amystika” has pushed back its opening date to March 11. The delay is expected to give the production team the time it needs to finalize the dramatic special effects stunts and technical requirements of the show. As Angel said in a statement last week “We are literally inventing the technology and special effects that are used throughout this show and that level of creativity can’t be rushed.”

The objective for the two partners behind the project has always been to push the boundaries of what is possible in live theater and present something Las Vegas audiences haven’t seen before.

“To create something new nowadays is extremely different than 15 years ago” says Dragone. “The audience can go on YouTube and see a lot of things so when they actually come to you you have to offer something that makes a difference.

“I have the impression that from time to time Las Vegas goes through transitional periods where it moves from one genre to another. It seems for a few years now everyone is using the words ‘immersive’ and ‘interactive’ and when something is trendy that means that it’s already old. Something follows an innovation and then everybody wants to compete and do the same thing. So yes we are trying to do something new but we do this with much humility and ambition and we put all of our talent experience and energy into the project.”

Both entertainment icons say they’ve truly enjoyed collaborating on “Amystika” and learned quite a bit from each other.

“Sometimes when you work with somebody you don’t know what you’re going to get” Angel says. “It has turned into something absolutely beautiful and I’ve grown so much personally and professionally. He’s such a genius at what he does and he looks at the process in a very different light that I’ve seen anybody do.”

Dragone says they are both “fully into the creation” of the show and his international theatrical background is a nice complement to Angel’s background in magic. “And he never stops. He has the energy to work day and night so it has been a very demanding experience” Dragone says. “But it’s something that we love. I have found that passion I remember in him 20 years ago when we were collaborating with Steve Wynn.”

Now that so much time has gone by since that first connection this creative duo can accomplish thing onstage today that they could only imagine back then. “Amystika” will have a blizzard that engulfs the audience Angel says and fire and wind storms unlike anything that has been presented in a Las Vegas show. The cast of the show has grown much larger than originally planned.

“There was such a wealth of talent we couldn’t say no” Angel says. “But it’s worth it because we want to do something no one is doing opening a brand-new spectacle at this time when most everybody is scared … about possibly closing down again [due to the pandemic]. No one knows what’s going to happen but we are feeling bullish and we’re setting the bar pretty high.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyL2JvcmlzLWtvbGV2LXdpbnMtd3lubi13aW50ZXItY2xhc3NpYy1wa28tYm91bnR5LTQwNDQ2Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boris Kolev Wins Wynn Winter Classic PKO Bounty; Madsen & Hughes Claim Side Titles,"Boris Kolev Wins Wynn Winter Classic PKO Bounty; Madsen & Hughes Claim Side Titles

At 16 inches high and comprised of 40 pounds of bronze and etched acrylic it is notable for its rich detail work including a stitched jersey and lettered hockey stick.

Sculptor Bill Mack was the designer. A Minnesota native Mack is an internationally known artist whose work can be seen in venues like the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame where his sculpture of basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar greets visitors in the museum’s entryway.

Mack began the lengthy process of designing the Hobey Baker trophy with a search for a model—a search that ultimately led to Steve Christoff. Christoff was a star player for Minnesota’s Richfield High School and the University of Minnesota and later played for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team and the National Hockey League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hYmJleS1tdXJwaHktcGxheXMtd2l0aC1hLXZhbHVhYmxlLWVkZ2UtZm9yLXUtcy13b21lbnMtaG9ja2V5LXRlYW0vNjAwMTI4NzA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbey Murphy plays with a valuable edge for U.S. women's hockey team,"Forward Abbey Murphy's all-around game — in more ways than one — has taken her from Evergreen Park Ill. through the Gophers women's hockey program and currently with the United States team that is preparing for the Beijing Olympics.

""Murph's a player who brings a tremendous amount of speed and skill to the game"" Team USA coach Joel Johnson said. ""When she's got the puck she's a dynamic player she's deceptive. She can create offense for herself which is not always common. She's a young player so she's still learning how to play without the puck and playing an honest game.""

She also likes to keep the other team honest.

Team USA on Monday will face Canada in the seventh game of the nine-game My Why Tour as the two rivals prepare for the Olympics. And Murphy has let Team Canada know she's watching them throughout the tour. In addition to her offensive capabilities — she scored 18 points in 20 games with the Gophers last season before taking this season off from college hockey — she has shown little tolerance for opponents who give her teammates the business.

Consequently the USA-Canada hockey rivalry continues to percolate through a few scrums and an expected crowd of more than 10000 will get to see for themselves at Xcel Energy Center on Monday.

It will be the first game between the teams since Friday in St. Louis when Murphy came to the rescue of fellow forward Dani Cameranesi and triggered one of the more spirited skirmishes of the series.

At the 3 minute 6 second mark of the second period Cameranesi was crosschecked into the boards by Canada's Claire Thompson ... with no whistle from the referee.

""I've been keeping my composure pretty well not getting rattled after some stuff"" Murphy said ""but when that happens in front of my face a teammate gets hit from behind into the boards I can't watch that happen and not jump in and stick up for her.

""That's not a teammate if I don't do anything.""

Murphy crosschecked Thompson to the ice. Murphy then took a shot from Canada captain Marie-Phillip Poulin. Others joined in on the conflict. Murphy got her helmet pulled off as referees moved in and started handing out penalties. Murphy and Poulin who has a similar edge had words for each other from the penalty boxes.

Johnson agreed that Murphy falls into the same category as former Twins cage-rattler AJ. Pierzynski in that you want to play with her and not against her. And Johnson pointed out that the 19-year-old Murphy is as gritty as talented but never takes the grit side too far. Meanwhile she has earned respect from her teammates.

""That's what she brings every day"" U.S. captain Kendall Coyne Schofield said ""She loves this game. She'll have her teammates backs. She wants to win. She competes hard and how you see her compete against Canada against anybody that's how she competes in practice.""

Abbey Murphy is away from her college team the Gophers this season play for Team USA.

Coyne Schofield is from Palos Heights Ill. about 15 minutes from where Murphy grew up and remembers seeing Murphy on a U12 team full of energy and loving the game. Murphy started playing hockey at age 7. By 9 her competitive traits began to form. She had two older brothers: Patrick played football at Carthage College while Dominic is a wrestler at St. Cloud State.

""We tossed each other around quite a bit when we were younger"" Abbey Murphy said.

They ever gang up on you? ""When I was being a little brat yeah"" she said ""but I would get them back.""

Murphy was a highly touted recruit earning preseason WCHA Rookie of the Year honors. Then she was twice named rookie of the week. She misses her Gophers teammates but is having the time of her life with Team USA.

On Monday she will have family and friends in attendance at the X as she creates — and protects — for her teammates.

""It's a nice little short drive for my family"" Murphy said. ""It will be nice. We don't have many games close to home so it will be really special. And to be able to play on Minnesota ground is awesome.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmY0d29ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy93d2UvcmVzdWx0cy93d2UtbWFpbi1ldmVudC1yZXN1bHRzLXQtYmFyLXZzLWFwb2xsby1jcmV3cy0zNjMxMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Main Event results: T-Bar vs. Apollo Crews,"This week’s WWE Main Event was taped at the Xcel Energy Center Forum in Saint Paul Minnesota before Monday’s Raw.

Veer Mahaan defeated Cedric Alexander (w/ Shelton Benjamin) (4:13)

This was exactly what it should have been: Alexander made Mahaan look way better than he is and got beat in under five minutes.

Last week we had a title match on Main Event and this week we got a pre-match promo! It’s almost like an actual wrestling show. Almost. Alexander ran down how Veer had everything to prove to build up some heat and made it clear that Mahaan is a babyface. He’s coming to Raw soon or at least he was right?

This was essentially a few basic moves from Mahaan and a couple of chin locks from Alexander before Mahaan had had enough. After working out of the second resthold Mahaan hit a running splash to the corner a sidewalk slam and then nailed Alexander with the Million Dollar Arm for the win.

Mahaan is going to need a lot more of these sorts of matches if he’s going to be ready for main roster action.

T-Bar defeated Apollo Crews (w/ Commander Azeez) (7:15)

T-Bar showed a lot of energy in the babyface role here and looked good. He has a few new moves too but Crews losing with Azeez in tow seemed an odd move.

Before the commercial break Azeez interfered and made it look as though it was a done deal that he and Crews would collude to ensure T-Bar lost. But after the break Azeez played no part at all and stood by to watch as Crews got beaten by the better man.

Crews went up top with T-Bar lying prone but he was actually playing possum and rolled out of the way of the splash instead. Crews turned around to eat a spinning big boot from T-Bar who then hoisted Crews up onto his shoulders and used the Eyes Wide Shot to earn just his sixth singles victory of 2021.

Final Thoughts:

Alexander and Benjamin are wasted on Main Event every week as is Crews’ and Azeez’s act but T-Bar could easily be used in a spot on the main roster. He has size and presence and if booked right could get over nicely.

Let’s see what 2022 holds for this idiosyncratic show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWlubmVzb3RhaG9ja2V5bWFnLmNvbS90aGlzLW9uZXMtZm9yLXRoZS1naXJscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This One's for the Girls,"SAINT PAUL — It looked like a typical Minnesota Wild practice. Sure Kirill Kaprizov and goaltender Cam Talbot weren’t on the ice but otherwise it was business as usual. Had someone not known that Gopher women’s hockey player Crystalyn Hengler was on the ice to kick off the Minnesota Wild’s fifth annual Girls’ Hockey Weekend the only clue might have been the curly ponytail flowing down the back of her jersey.

“She didn’t stick out” said Natalie Darwitz Gophers women’s hockey assistant coach who watched the practice. “She fit right in and looked like one of the guys. It’s a huge compliment to Crystalyn.”

Hengler kicked off the weekend as the female hockey player invited to skate with the Minnesota Wild during the team’s practice Friday morning at TRIA Rink. She got in on some of the early drills with the Wild.

“It was an awesome experience” Hengler said. “They’re really fast-paced. They’re bigger than I thought they would be when watching them on TV.”

She talked a lot with Wild assistant coach Bob Woods about various drills the Wild runs during practice. Woods talked to her about things he wants the defensive corps to work on Hengler said.

“That was actually really helpful” Hengler said. “I can bring some stuff back to college with me and share those things with my teammates.”

The Gophers women’s hockey team is 14-5-1 overall this season with Hengler a staple on the blue line. She has two goals and seven points in the 20 games and 10 goals 32 points in 112 career games at Minnesota. She had a pair of assists in the team’s last victory a 2-1 score over Minnesota-Duluth on Dec. 11.

Hengler is an offensive defenseman going back to her five years with Eden Prairie High School when the 2018 Minnesota Ms. Hockey semifinalist scored 27 goals and 108 points in 147 career games. She helped lead the team to state multiple times including to a Class 2A state title in 2016.

She brings a super skillset to the Gophers blueline with a quick-release shot to get pucks to the net efficiently Darwitz said.

“Off the ice she’s just a super character person” Darwitz said. “Does things the right way is a great teammate. Just a joy to coach.”

One Wild player Hengler particularly connected with Friday was defenseman Matt Dumba. Hengler said Dumba asked about her ethnicity and the two had a perfect vantage point to see all the young girls from Minnesota Unbounded watching in the stands.

“I think it was pretty cool when you’re sitting with another person of color on the bench looking out into the stands full of color different shades faces races” Dumba said. “It’s sometimes a real lonely feeling being in a hockey world being different. To see that gave me a smile and warmed my heart to see these girls here today.”

Friday Hengler had a lot of support in the stands and along the glass from many of her Gophers teammates three of her coaches her mom and her brother. One of those coaches was Darwitz.

Hengler was also supposed to make the “Let’s Play Hockey!” call before the Florida Panthers versus Minnesota Wild game Saturday afternoon but that game was postponed due to Covid-19 safety protocols issues involving the Panthers. The plan is to have Hengler make the call along with holding the other Girls’ Hockey Weekend activities whenever the make-up game gets scheduled.

The Girls’ Hockey Weekend clinics for girls’ hockey players went on as scheduled Friday night and Saturday afternoon (moved up after the postponed Wild game) at Xcel Energy Center. About 50 girls each for the 8U 10U and 12U levels participated in on-ice clinics and dryland training led by Minnesota Hockey personnel and Minnesota Whitecaps and WCHA players.

Thirteen Gophers women’s players helped with the clinics Friday night alone Darwitz said. They volunteered “without batting an eye” and during their finals week too she said. It didn’t take much prodding from Darwitz.

“I said to our team ‘hey you have no idea that little eyes that are on you’” Darwitz said. “’Male female it doesn’t matter. They want to emulate you and be wearing the same sweater you are and do the same moves you are doing.

“’Getting out there in the public eye and doing these camps and clinics not only is it going to do so much for you it’s going to do now triple for the game and those little girls.’”

Hengler is the fifth player from the Gophers women’s hockey program to skate with the Wild though she’s the first one to participate while still a collegiate player. Krissy Wendell skated in 2017 followed by Hannah Brandt in 2018 and Lee Stecklein in 2019.

Darwitz was retired when asked to be part of the inaugural Girls’ Hockey Weekend in 2016.

“I told Wayne Petersen of the Wild that I was able to set the bar low for everybody else” Darwitz joked.

Watching Hengler brought back memories of that weekend for Darwitz. It all comes back to growing the game and both Darwitz and Hengler acknowledged how great it is that the Wild put together a weekend like this since few organizations do. Having Hengler skate with the Wild is a way to help grow the game too. It’s all about having role models to look up to and someone to emulate on the ice Darwitz said adding that for her it was Neal Broten until Cammi Granato came along.

“Now the same for people of color or different backgrounds” Darwitz said. “They see Crystalyn out there and think ‘you know I can do this too.’ So I think that’s pretty special.”

Hengler’s advice and encouragement for young girls playing hockey? Have fun.

“I’ve grown some lifelong friends through the sport throughout my time playing it” Hengler said. “Just have fun with it. Don’t be too serious especially at a young age. Just find the little things that make you happy when you play.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLXJldm9sdXRpb24tYnJpbmdzLWNoYW5nZXMtdG8tbWlubmVzb3RhLWdhcmFnZXMvNjAwMTI4MzQ3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric vehicle revolution brings changes to Minnesota garages,"The monumental effort underway to build a public electric vehicle charging network across the United States involves intense planning and billions of dollars.

But one of the linchpins in the electric vehicle revolution is not on the highway. It's at home on the wall of the garage or apartment building.

The vast majority of electric vehicle (EV) charging takes place at home after all. Home owners with garages are the easiest part of the charging puzzle and there's a brisk business in upgrading residential chargers in Minnesota. It can be more complicated for multi-unit dwellers — particularly for renters where the lack of charging access is a major barrier to driving electric and a serious equity issue.

It's all a paradigm shift in the way we drive said David Ranallo whose title at Maple Grove-based Great River Energy includes ""director of culture.""

""People are so used to comparing the old model of driving — you see a Kwik Trip on every corner — and so people naturally expect that that is what is required of EV infrastructure to do the same sort of driving"" Ranallo said. The gas-stations-everywhere model falls away when people mainly charge at their origin or destination he said.

The public network of charging stations on the side of the highway remains essential. For one Ranallo said they're major confidence boosters. Just seeing them can jump-start consideration of going electric. And they'll be more visible with Minnesota's $68 million for public charging from the federal infrastructure bill. More money for the charging network would come from the pending Build Back Better Act.

But the workhorse outlet is at home.

""That's where utility companies are going to play a really really important role"" said Jukka Kukkonen at the Minnesota consulting firm Shift2Electric.

New vehicles come with a Level 1 charger that plugs into a standard 110-volt outlet and that's adequate if your daily drive is less than 30 miles Kukkonen said. Some homeowners are installing more powerful 240-volt outlets for faster Level 2 chargers that can recharge a flat battery overnight.

Many utilities including many of Minnesota's rural electric cooperatives have programs to help EV owners such as providing cheaper rates for off-peak charging at night. Some offer one-stop shopping on their websites to order chargers arrange for the design of hookups and schedule an electrician.

""We really target getting them installed in four weeks or less"" said Nadia El Mallakh Xcel's Area vice president for strategic partnerships and ventures. About 700 Xcel customers have upgraded at home so far she said. More are queued up. Demand is ""eclipsing"" expectations she said.

Xcel estimates it costs an average of $1000 to $2000 to buy and install a home charger. Costs vary by utility the type of charger the amount of wiring required and other factors. Xcel also rents chargers for about $16 per month. While Xcel does not offer a rebate Great River Energy gives customers $800 toward charging installations.

A federal tax credit likely to be extended covers up to 30% of the cost of buying and installing a charger.

Future-proofing

It's all good business for Adam Wortman an electrician with Ray of Light Electric in St. Paul. He specializes in upgrading garages for charging doing five to 15 jobs a week across the Twin Cities.

""It feels good to be kind of making a difference"" Wortman said.

On a frigid December morning he drilled a hole through a south Minneapolis garage wall to mount a new electric meter. He wired up a 240-volt outlet inside the garage to hook up the new charger homeowners Alex Shaver and Megan Mekoli bought for their 2017 Chevy Bolt.

Shaver a software engineer and Mekoli senior regulatory affairs specialist at Medtronic recently moved from Maryland. Shaver said he bought his first EV a few years ago in Maryland because the apartment building where he lived had a charger. No one was using it he said.

""I had to leave paper signs in the garage asking people not to park in the charging space because people didn't realize"" Shaver said.

Shaver said the dedicated power line meter charger and installation altogether cost $2555. Because they both work from home they could probably get by plugging the Bolt into the garage's 110-volt outlet they said. But it takes more than a day to fully charge it with that ""drip"" outlet Mekoli said with a laugh. A Level 2 will fully charge the car overnight and with much cheaper off-peak electricity.

They are future-proofing eyeing a second EV. As electric cars grow into SUVs and pickups with larger batteries they'll draw more amps Shaver noted.

'All over the map'

The Great Plains Institute a Minneapolis-based think tank is among those pushing charging at multifamily buildings. Developers need to at least put conduits in new construction for EV charging to avoid expensive retrofits Great Plains Vice President Brendan Jordan said.

""We need a lot more effort to what that parking solution looks like"" Jordan said. ""It's kind of all over the map.""

For years clean-energy advocates such as St. Paul-based Fresh Energy have gone before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission pushing for multifamily EV charging to ensure it's not just the wealthy who can plug in at home. The fear is that less affluent communities could be left behind in the electric transition.

In one step to address that Xcel has launched a pilot program for multifamily building charging working with landlords and building owners to design build and maintain charging equipment. And it's partnering with Hourcar the St. Paul-based car-sharing nonprofit to install 50 electric vehicles for ride sharing at 25 multifamily locations across the Twin Cities. About half of the sites are in low- or low-to-moderate-income areas.

Anjali Bains senior clean transportation manager at Fresh Energy gives Xcel high marks on the effort. The utility worked with stakeholders for at least year on it she said calling it ""probably one of their most thoughtfully designed programs.""

The road is long. EVs make up less than 1% of new car sales in Minnesota although that will change with Minnesota's new Clean Cars rule requiring auto makers doing business in Minnesota to supply more EVs to sales lots.

As Wortman the electrician sees it when the country's charging infrastructure matures to where apartment dwellers can easily charge at home rapid change will follow.

""That will be a big breakover moment in my opinion"" Wortman said."

This increased engagement by boards of publicly held companies was revealed in the 2021 CPA-Wharton Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability a nonpartisan benchmarking of S&P 500 companies released November 29.

The heightened board and committee involvement came as the annual Index also showed continuing increases for other measures of corporate political spending sunlight and accountability over recent years.

Issued annually since 2011 by the Center for Political Accountability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the Index started with the S&P 100 before expanding to cover the S&P 500 in 2015.

In a statement on the Index Wharton Professor and Zicklin Center Director William S. Laufer said “With the looming possibility of a Securities and Exchange Commission rulemaking over corporate political disclosure corporations can cross the threshold of accountability before being required to do so as a matter of law. And embracing accountability should not only be a matter of legal risk mitigation and even code compliance. Ultimately corporate political accountability is a reflection of a firm’s integrity culture and leadership. This I believe explains the significant progress made by S&P 500 companies on the 2021 Index.”

Here are major findings from the 2021 Index:

More Board and Committee Involvement: 295 companies have policies for general board oversight of political spending up 13.9 percent from 259 companies in 2020. Board committee review of direct political contributions and expenditures rose to 255 companies from 227 in 2020 an increase of 12.3 percent; board committee review of payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt groups spending types known as “dark money” rose to 228 from 199 in 2020 an increase of 14.6 percent.

Average Company Scores Rise: The average Index score for political disclosure and accountability rose to 54.1 percent this year (from 50.1 percent a year ago).

Top-Scoring Trendsetter Companies (with scores of 90 percent or higher) rose to 87 from 79 last year. Among 15 new Trendsetter companies are Cigna Comcast Ford Motor Co. (the first automaker to achieve this status) FirstEnergy Corp. Hiton Wordlwide Holdings Inc. Marriott International Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Yum! Brands.

First-Tier Companies Up: 171 companies are in the top Index tier (scoring from 80 percent to 100 percent) up from 156 last year. For the first time there are more first-tier companies than bottom-tier dwellers (getting scores in the lowest 20 percent). The latter number is now 128.

Aligning Company Values Action: Intel made itself a model for others by detailing a policy for avoiding conflict between its core values and its political donations. In the aftermath of the January 6th events Intel pledged “In cases of significant misalignment across our multiple key public policy issues we take action to realign future funding decisions.” Intel also stated in its political spending policy that it would not contribute to members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election.

Increased Disclosure: The number of companies that disclosed some or all of their political spending was 293 increased from 260 in 2020. This is significant in light of possible Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of a rule requiring public companies to disclose their election-related spending with corporate funds. The rule would standardize what 59 percent of the S&P 500 are doing.

The 2021 Index was published at a time that companies have come “Under a Microscope” according to a report in March 2021 by The Conference Board the nation’s preeminent business research organization. “Political activity can pose increasingly significant risks for companies including the perception that political contributions—and other forms of activity—are at odds with core company values” TCB warned.

And the trends identified in the 2021 Index take on heightened relevance because fundraising for the 2022 midterm congressional elections already has eclipsed prior records and many companies that paused their political spending to reassess it after January 6th have resumed giving.

Companies are also facing scrutiny over political spending that ultimately supported passage of such extreme state laws as vote suppression and an abortion ban in Texas. These patterns of company spending are examined in CPA’s “Corporate Enablers” and “Conflicted Consequences” reports released in July 2021.

The 2021 Index marks the start of the second decade for the Index which has become a standard resource and reference for companies investors activists academics and journalists. The Index findings open the door for boards of directors to consider adopting the Model Code of Conduct for Corporate Political Spending.

The Model Code offers a framework for responsible political spending at a time of seismic change. The experience of FirstEnergy in Ohio working to recover from a dark money and public corruption scandal shows how easily corporate political payments can blow up.

I respect that! But I’m still going to make a guess: my money would be on Corazón’s space in the Project (see below). Broad Street’s offerings—including its famous lobster roll—pair well with Captain Fatty’s and the location is high-volume and near enough to the water (which I think is ideal for a seafood restaurant). But that’s just a guess. And of course there are many other spaces that would work such as Chomp on the Rocks somewhere on Stearns Wharf the old Tyger Tyger space (if XO Burger moves on)…. Update: A couple of readers reminded me that Broad Street used to have a presence in town—a cart in front of Muni Wines in the Funk Zone (which I went to and enjoyed but forgot the name).

••• Corazón has closed its outpost at the Project in the Funk Zone. From the announcement: “With great pleasure we want to thank everyone for the amazing support we have received in the past two years. We hope to have brightened some of your darkest days with delicious food during the pandemic. Covid has won this one! We’re saying adios to this location but please continue to visit our sibling restaurants Corazón Cocina for amazing tacos and ceviches Little Heart Cafecito for coffee & breakfast tacos (coming soon [to the Public Market]) and Del Corazón for tacos de guisados tamales and churros (coming soon [to E. Victoria Street].” The Captain Fatty’s taproom part of the Project remains open.

••• Starting tomorrow Bettina will be the first restaurant around here that I’m aware of to insist on vaccination proof for inside dining. It’s what’s required in big cities like L.A. San Francisco and New York and it makes far more sense than Santa Barbara County’s policy requiring masks everywhere indoors except restaurants. (Does Covid take a rest when we’re eating?) Anyone whose panties get twisted at the thought of having to show proof—a photo with your vaccination card and ID suffices—can sit outside. Update from a reader on Instagram: “Might be worth mentioning—Bettina is also accepting proof of a negative test. Which I think is very fair especially in light of current situation with young children/boosters/Omicron! I’m at-home testing my family these days any time we do gatherings with others. With Omicron knowing strangers have just been tested honestly gives me more peace of mind than knowing they have been vaccinated (possibly 6+ months ago).”

••• Speaking of Bettina chef Joshua Pressman will be cooking at Outstanding in the Field‘s lunch (it’s at 2 p.m.) on February 19 at Rancho El Rincon. Tickets are $385 per person and don’t appear to include tax or service.

••• And chef Matthew Kammerer of the Harbor House Inn near Mendocino will be cooking dinner at the Ojai Valley Inn on March 7. The price is $395 per person which includes wine but not tax nor an unspecified service charge. No disrespect to Pressman or Kammerer both of whom are very talented but who are all these people willing to pay more than $400 per person for dinner?

••• Padaro Beach Grill closed because of a fire says it’s hoping to reopen this week.

••• XO Burger in the former Tyger Tyger space is now open Thursday through Sunday (noon-7 p.m.).

••• “Habit Burger Grill founder Brent Reichard and his co-owning brother Bruce Reichard are selling the last eight of their restaurants to Yum! Brands which owns every other Habit in the country. The Reichards had hung onto the Santa Barbara County locations when they sold the rest of the chain in 2007.” —Independent

••• The Independent profiles Sideyard Shrubs whose founder Sarah Bourke “typically buys fruit that otherwise can’t be sold because it’s bruised getting old oddly sized or otherwise not pretty. Without the salvation of her shrubs much of this produce would wind up in a compost pile or landfill.”

••• Peasants Deli the Peasants Feast spinoff in Solvang has been doing pop-ups during the run-up to its official opening in January. (Keep an eye on its Instagram stories for details.) Below: The Godfather.

You can’t possibly predict the future but you can plan for what is probable and make arrangements accordingly.

It’s no secret that recent supply chain trends have been less than predictable. A series of social and economic macro-shocks have radically affected the way consumers shop and interact with brands. And as the consumer experience has shifted supply chains have had to shift with it. The organizations having the most success are the ones that are adjusting their supply chains in advance of coming trends. They are planning ahead — not because they know exactly what is going to happen but because they know something will happen.

Here’s how technology is best used to prepare the supply chain to meet current trends and changing consumer demands.

Urbanization and speed

The combination of urbanization and speed to consumer is driving a significant shift in how supply chain networks are designed. The days are gone when the solution for all e-commerce challenges was building a single enormous fulfillment center in the middle of a cornfield. Now to meet the delivery speed needs of consumers organizations are looking to smaller fulfillment facilities located in or near the metropolitan market region they are serving. As the populations of these regions continue to grow the return on investment to justify standing up smaller fulfillment facilities within the regions grows as well. Placing these smaller urban fulfillment centers nearer to where consumers live allows organizations to get product into consumer hands within hours which is the new “free 2-day” standard delivery expectation.

From a technology perspective urban fulfillment centers require high storage density with high throughput. Automation providers have available and are currently deploying goods-to-person micro-fulfillment solutions in urban fulfillment centers. There are several variations on the theme (some are more space-efficient some provide higher throughput) but all facilitate a nimble and quick supply chain.

There are “close-to-consumer” fulfillment strategies across several industries. The primary ones leading the way are general merchandise and apparel. But there’s also durable manufacturing organizations placing small assembly operations and spare parts fulfillment near metro markets to meet the speed demands of consumers.

Sustainable packaging

The world continues to increasingly embrace the critical role of sustainability in the manufacture distribution and consumption of products. Consumers are looking for brands that are elevating environmental friendliness. As companies focus attention on carbon neutrality environmental efforts gain more weight and sustainable packaging becomes a priority. Best practices on packaging are both an effort to mitigate the negative impact of non-recoverable (single-use) materials and a way to fulfill customer expectations for positive management of environmental resources.

The biggest challenges are to avoid single-use packaging and to minimize non-used space. Trends for sustainable packaging include returnable/reusable containers bioplastics and edible films. In many cases it’s no longer practical or prudent to default to super-rigid rectangular packaging. And this new age of consumer packaging is creating a growing variety of more unique handling characteristics that material handling automation must be able to accommodate.

Companies are having to adapt their operations to address the challenges brought on by new packaging standardization new handling methods and changes in flow of inventory. Automation solutions featuring trays and totes to move goods through a facility are well suited for handling the variations and offer an excellent example for how technology can provide the necessary flexibility for supply chains to adapt quickly to change.

Individualization and consumer choice

The growing trend toward very specific consumer preferences (from extreme price consciousness to very specific dietary practices such as veganism) has given rise to products and solutions tailored to those preferences. To meet these unique needs manufacturers and retailers have been expanding their offerings with more choices. To survive this SKU proliferation there has been a shift to reduce lots sizes toward a sort of “lot-size-of-one” mentality (a unique choice for every individual).

Supply chains are now having to grapple with how best to cope with this shift. Typically the number of choices a company offers its customers will have an inverse relationship with the throughput of its supply chain. Early in the pandemic there was a retraction of product offerings as organizations placed a greater importance on supply chain throughput and volume. As a consumer you may have noticed fewer choices at your local retailer. That’s because those organizations focused their efforts and resources on only the highest-demanded products. Now after the initial disruption of the pandemic the number of offerings is increasing again and will continue to do so to meet consumer demands toward individualization.

An aging society’s impact on supply chains

Global population numbers continue to expand as expected lifespan metrics improve. Healthcare technology advancements across the world are driving the average age of the global population to rise. And with an aging population comes an aging workforce. Since the year 2000 the average age of the workforce has increased by approximately 5 years. As a result two key trends are affecting global supply chains:

· The need for more ergonomically friendly solutions to accommodate the aging workforce.

· The need for a combination of people and robotics in the workforce.

Creating a working environment that is more ergonomically friendly goes hand in hand with a flexible automation environment where people can focus on truly value-added tasks and robotics can handle repetitive labor-intensive tasks. A supply chain environment that is welcoming for a wide range of physical abilities will be critical for organizations to meet their operation goals particularly given the recent global labor challenges.

What’s going to happen next?

That’s the thing — nobody knows exactly what’s going to happen next in supply chains. But with a healthy understanding of current trends companies can plan ahead and look to automation technology to provide the flexibility to navigate through the disruptions ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5keWNpdHlncmlkaXJvbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS8yMjg0MzUxMS9jaGljYWdvLWJlYXJzLXBhdHJpY2stbWFubmVsbHktdGVkLXBoaWxsaXBzLXRlYW0tcHJlc2lkZW50LWRldmluLWhlc3Rlci1kYXZlLXRvdWItdGltZS1mb3ItYS1jaGFuZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Time for a new Bears president says Patrick Mannelly,"Chicago Bears’ long snapping legend Patrick Mannelly joined our guy Jack M Silverstein for a jampacked thirty minutes that hit on a number of topics.

The Patrick Mannelly Award which is presented by Zebra Technologies and benefitting Bernie’s Book Bank was recently given out to the top long snapper in the nation Pittsburgh’s Cal Adomitis so it was neat hearing Mannelly explain the backstory to how the Award came to be.

Mannelly played with some fantastic special teamers during his time in Chicago including one of the all-time greats in Devin Hester so they talk about Hester’s chances to make the Hall Of Fame. They also talk about his former special team’s coordinator Dave Toub and why teams are missing out on not hiring him as head coach.

But the most eye-opening part of their interview was when Mannelly gave his take on the current team and how the changes that need to happen need to start on top with team president Ted Phillips.

“I think he’s been there long enough” Mannelly says about Phillips.

“If you truly want to make a difference just say ‘hey man it’s time for you to retire. We’ll put you on the board or something like that and we’re just going to get you out the building every day and you’re not making decisions’ and that’s the true change. If you really want to make a change that’s the one thing we’ve got to make.”

Mannelly is still very close to the team and his passion for the Bears shines through so this entire interview is a must listen.

Here’s the segment from them talking about Devin Hester Dave Toub and some of Mannelly’s time in Chicago.

And here’s the segment where Mannelly goes deep on his thoughts about the current Bears and the Ted Phillips situation.

Mannelly holds the Bears record for most seasons played (16) and most games played (245) but he also hosts the pre and post game Bears’ shows on Chicago’s 670 The Score so he’s still quite dialed in to the current team.",,,,,,,,,
